            "content": "The Gateway Pundit, a rightwing website known for spreading election conspiracies, will declare bankruptcy as it faces lawsuits for defamation. The site\u2019s parent company, TGP Communications, will file for bankruptcy in Florida \u201cas a result of the progressive liberal lawfare attacks against our media outlet\u201d, founder Jim Hoft wrote on the website. Those lawsuits include one from the Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, who sued the organization in Missouri, where it is based, after the website perpetuated false claims that the two had been involved in election fraud in Georgia. In a separate case, Freeman and Moss secured a $148m judgment against Rudy Giuliani for spreading election lies about them and defaming them. After the verdict, the former New York City mayor and Trump attorney filed for bankruptcy, complicating whether or how Freeman and Moss can get paid. The Gateway Pundit also faces a suit in Colorado from a former Dominion Voting Systems employee, Eric Coomer, who alleges the outlet defamed him by claiming he rigged the election against Trump. Election offices have faced waves of harassing messages after Gateway Pundit stories have been published, often targeting staff members with threatening and abusive language. The defamation lawsuits are one strategy pro-democracy groups, private companies and individuals are using to attempt to hold people and organizations accountable for spreading election lies, especially ones that cause harm to people like Freeman, Moss and Coomer. Those on the defense often refer to these lawsuits as \u201clawfare\u201d. Hoft said that the company seeking bankruptcy protection was \u201cnot an admission of fault or culpability\u201d, but instead a way to reorganize and consolidate lawsuits \u201cwhen attacks are coming from all sides\u201d. The company will be able to put the lawsuits it faces into one court, he wrote. Even though the Gateway Pundit is based in Missouri, its parent company filed paperwork last week to become a limited liability company in Florida, where the bankruptcy claim was filed. The Gateway Pundit said in its bankruptcy filing that it had between $500,000 and $1m in assets and between $100,001 and $500,000 in liabilities. A list of its 20 largest creditors contained mostly anonymous individuals. RonNell Andersen Jones, a first amendment scholar at the University of Utah, said that maneuvering to declare bankruptcy showed the challenges of using defamation law to try and hold those who spread misinformation accountable. \u201cIt seems to be an increasingly common maneuver for outlets accused of widespread libelous disinformation to declare bankruptcy in an effort to avoid or delay defamation damages,\u201d she said. \u201cBankruptcy after trial is frustrating to defamation plaintiffs because it robs them of the chance to quickly and fully recover for their loss. Bankruptcy before trial is surely all the more frustrating. \u201cThese moves keep us from being able to use libel law as a public truth-finding mechanism,\u201d she added. \u201cThe goal here seems clear: for the defamer to essentially make itself judgment-proof rather than facing the libel trial and the potentially staggering consequences for the lie.\u201d"

            "title": "US has seen evidence of attempts by China to influence election, says Blinken",
            "date": "2024-04-26T16:38:51Z",
            "content": "Washington has seen evidence of attempts by Beijing to \u201cinfluence and arguably interfere\u201d in this year\u2019s US elections, the secretary of state has said during a trip to China, also warning that Chinese companies face new sanctions if they do not stop supplying material and equipment to the Russian arms industry. Antony Blinken told CNN that he had reiterated Joe Biden\u2019s message to Xi Jinping not to interfere in November\u2019s vote \u2013 a warning that reportedly received assurances from the Chinese president that he would not do so. Asked whether China was keeping to its promise, Blinken said: \u201cWe have seen, generally speaking, evidence of attempts to influence, and arguably interfere, and we want to make sure that that\u2019s cut off as quickly as possible. \u201cAny interference by China in our election is something that we\u2019re looking very carefully at and is totally unacceptable to us.\u201d There was no immediate response from Beijing on either the accusation of attempts at election interference, nor the warning on sanctions, which Blinken said the US and its allies could impose over China\u2019s support of the Russian defence industry. But earlier on Friday China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said \u201cdisruptions\u201d could reverse recent improvements in US-China relations and lead to a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d of rivalry, confrontation and even conflict. Speaking to reporters at the end of a three-day visit to China, Blinken acknowledged there had been improvements in relations since a summit in San Francisco in November between Xi and Biden. He pointed to cooperation on counter-narcotics, the revival of contacts between the militaries of both countries, and he announced the first US-China talks on the security risks of artificial intelligence development, which he said would take place in the coming weeks. However, Blinken made clear that Chinese support of the Russian defence industry, used to fuel Vladimir Putin\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, remained a major focus of disagreement, on which the US and its European allies were prepared to act. \u201cChina is the top supplier of machine tools, micro electronics, nitrocellulose, which is critical to making munitions, and rocket propellants, and other dual-use items that Moscow is using to ramp up its defence industrial base,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cRussia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China\u2019s support.\u201d He said Washington\u2019s Nato allies and G7 partners saw the issue in the same light. \u201cFuelling Russia\u2019s defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security. Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the cold war.\u201d He added: \u201cI made clear that if China does not address this problem, we will. We\u2019ve already imposed sanctions on more than 100 Chinese entities, export controls, et cetera. As before, we are prepared to act to take additional measures, and I made that very clear in my meetings today.\u201d Blinken said China had previously shown it could take \u201cpositive action\u201d at a critical moment in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. \u201cYou\u2019ll recall that well over a year ago we had concerns that Russia was considering possibly using a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that China\u2019s voice was important, at least at that time, in moving Russia away from that possible course of action.\u201d Xi, in his own remarks at the start of his meeting with Blinken, did not directly address Chinese policy on Russia and Ukraine. The Chinese president said he hoped the US could look at China\u2019s development in a positive light. \u201cThis is a fundamental issue that must be addressed, just like the first button of a shirt that must be put right, in order for the China-US relationship to truly stabilise, improve and move forward,\u201d he said. Earlier in the day, Wang had warned the US not to \u201cstep on China\u2019s red lines\u201d when it came to its sovereignty and development. Setting a stern tone at the beginning of a day of meetings, Wang suggested the bilateral relationship was at a turning point. Since the Biden-Xi summit in San Francisco in November, he said, it was \u201cbeginning to stabilise\u201d, with increased dialogue and cooperation. Through an official interpreter, Wang said: \u201cThis is welcomed by our two peoples and the international community \u2026 But at the same time, the negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building and the relationship is facing all kinds of disruptions. \u201cChina\u2019s legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges,\u201d he said, and then he posed a question: \u201cShould China and the United States keep to the right direction of moving forward with stability or return to a downward spiral? \u201cThis is a major question before our two countries, which tests our sincerity and ability,\u201d Wang added, warning the US \u201cnot to step on China\u2019s red lines on China\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests\u201d. He asked: \u201cShould our two sides lead international cooperation on global issues and achieve win-win for all, or engage in rivalry and confrontation or even slide into conflict, which would be a lose-lose for all? The international community is waiting for our answer.\u201d Blinken emphasised the importance of managing responsibly what he called the \u201cmost consequential\u201d relation for both countries, to reduce the chance of miscalculation in a volatile region. \u201cThat really is a shared responsibility that we have, not only for our own people but for people around the world, given the impact that the relationship between our countries has around the world,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to demonstrate that we\u2019re managing responsibly the most consequential relationship for both of us in the world.\u201d But he insisted the US would stand up for its interests. He said he had been \u201cextremely clear\u201d in his meeting with Xi about Washington\u2019s concerns over Chinese supplies to the Russian arms industry, and added: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what actions follow from that.\u201d As well as the threat of sanctions over Chinese supplies to the Russian defence industry, Washington is considering tariffs in response to what Blinken described as subsidised Chinese manufacturing exports flooding the world market at the expense of US workers. The Biden administration has also tightened export controls on computer chips critical to AI development. And in a move that has particularly angered Beijing, Washington plans to provide billions of dollars in aid for the Indo-Pacific that would largely benefit Taiwan. While Blinken was on his way to China, Congress passed legislation that would ban TikTok in the US within a year if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, does not sell its stake. Blinken said the subject did not come up in his meeting with Xi on Friday. US officials say there has been relative calm in the Taiwan strait since the Biden-Xi summit, following a period of high tension in which Chinese warships and planes would regularly approach Taiwan. At the same time, however, there has been increasing friction in the South China Sea between China \u2013 which claims sovereignty over most of the sea \u2013 and neighbouring countries, particularly the Philippines, a US ally. One of the key topics in the Beijing talks was counter-narcotics cooperation. After November\u2019s summit, China took some steps to curb the supply of chemical precursors and equipment used by traffickers to make the synthetic opioid fentanyl, the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. However, there is concern in Washington that the steps taken by Beijing have been token and have yet to have much effect. Blinken, who was accompanied in Beijing by Todd Robinson, the assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, held a brief meeting with China\u2019s public security minister, Wang Xiaohong, focused on counter-narcotics. Blinken told the minister: \u201cOur ability to cooperate in this area, to show results, will have a very positive impact on relations between our two countries.\u201d He said China was \u201cproviding information to international law enforcement that can be used to track and intercept illicit drugs and their precursors\u201d, and that the two governments were cooperating to close loopholes in their financial systems that drug traffickers had been using to launder money. Blinken said there was more to be done, however, calling on Beijing to prosecute those selling chemicals and equipment to traffickers, and to regulate all of the chemical precursors used in the manufacture of fentanyl."

            "date": "2024-04-25T04:00:16Z",
            "content": "Europe\u2019s most isolated leader was beaming. Standing in a hallway in Brussels, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the Hungarian prime minister, spoke excitedly about the politician he hopes will change his political fortunes \u2013 Donald Trump. The longtime leader, who has been widely criticised for undermining Hungary\u2019s democratic institutions and cultivating ties with Moscow and Beijing, has been busy building an international far-right network of political allies, from Brazil to Austria. His strategy, experts say, centres on the bet that nationalist and far-right forces are on the rise. And at the core of his calculus is the wager that change is coming in Washington DC. Approached by the Guardian this month as he was rushing after a meeting with Polish and French nationalists, Orb\u00e1n, who rarely speaks to independent media, stopped to defend his foreign policy choices \u2013 and cheer for Trump. Asked about his recent trip to the US \u2013 where he visited the former American president in Florida but did not meet with any US administration officials \u2013 Orb\u00e1n said that \u201cour strategy is connectivity\u201d. \u201cWe have to have good relations and friendship with everybody,\u201d the prime minister insisted. Addressing concerns that Budapest was very isolated, he dismissed the question as a \u201cleftist interpretation of foreign policy which is totally fake\u201d. Pressed on criticism that the relationship between the US and Hungary was at a 30-year low, he enthusiastically responded: \u201cWaiting for Donald Trump!\u201d Orb\u00e1n\u2019s embrace of the former US president \u2013 and conspiracy theories that paint Washington as meddling in Hungarian domestic politics \u2013 can be felt in the streets of Budapest, where people walk by billboards depicting opposition figures with dollar signs. And the prime minister\u2019s narrative about the US \u2013 echoed in government-controlled media outlets \u2013 is resonating with some voters. Trump and Orb\u00e1n are \u201cbig friends\u201d, said L\u00e1szl\u00f3, a refuse collector, in Budapest\u2019s city park one afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly right, in terms of interests, politically,\u201d he said. It was \u201cclear\u201d that a Trump presidency would be better for Hungary than a Joe Biden win, he added. Sitting at a nearby picnic table, 79-year-old Ferenc also praised the former American president. Biden and his party \u201clove the war\u201d, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the business, they are pro-war.\u201d Orb\u00e1n has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Ukraine, accusing western capitals of prolonging the war and arguing that Kyiv cannot win. In a study by the Globsec thinktank last year, Hungarians were asked which countries they consider to be Hungary\u2019s two most important strategic partners. Only 17% of respondents selected the US. Another poll, by the Budapest-based Political Capital Institute, found that 22% of Hungarians believe common disinformation narratives about America. David Pressman, the US ambassador in Budapest, has raised concerns about the Hungarian government\u2019s approach. In a statement to the Guardian, the ambassador said that \u201cHungary is pursuing a relationship with the US \u2013 and a relationship with Russia and China \u2013 unlike any other ally\u201d. \u201cWith Hungary facing very serious issues \u2013 including a war next door and corruption challenges at home \u2013 the US will remain focused on advancing security and democracy, including by standing up for Ukraine as it is invaded by Putin\u2019s Russia, and standing up for democratic institutions and independent voices upon which democracy depends,\u201d Pressman added. But despite facing anti-government protests, a new challenger and economic troubles at home, Orb\u00e1n has been spending a significant amount of his time on his international image. In Brussels, he spoke at a National Conservatism conference \u2013 co-sponsored by groups linked to the Hungarian government \u2013 which garnered international attention after a local mayor attempted to shut it down. In April, Orb\u00e1n will speak alongside conservative American lawmakers and figures including the Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders at the Budapest edition of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a gathering whose organisers rejected the Guardian and other media outlets\u2019 accreditation requests citing a \u201cno woke zone\u201d. P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, the director of the Political Capital research institute, said: \u201cOne of the essential elements of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s foreign policy is that he is not building bilateral relationships, but personal or party relationships.\u201d The Hungarian leader is looking for allies who are \u201canti-migration, anti-LGBT, anti-woke \u2013 and what is important, anti-international institutions\u201d, Krek\u00f3 said, adding that Orb\u00e1n supported Trump because \u201che sees him as an isolationist who won\u2019t say anything about what\u2019s happening in Hungary\u201d. Trump, in turn, has welcomed the Hungarian leader\u2019s friendship. \u201cViktor is a Great Leader, respected all over the World. Hungary is a Safe Country because of his Strong Immigration Policies, and as long as he is in charge, it always will be!\u201d he wrote after Orb\u00e1n\u2019s March visit to Mar-a-Lago. Asked about the aims of this year\u2019s CPAC Hungary, Mikl\u00f3s Sz\u00e1nth\u00f3, the director of the government-linked Center for Fundamental Rights, which is organising the event, said in an emailed statement that \u201cthe goal is clear: to create a global alliance of anti-globalist forces\u201d. \u201cAt CPAC Hungary, we are the wokebusters and we will drain the swamps in Washington and Brussels,\u201d he said. The prime minister\u2019s domestic opponents have raised qualms about the government\u2019s foreign policy decisions. Kl\u00e1ra Dobrev, a member of the European parliament and lead candidate of the opposition Democratic Coalition in the European elections, said: \u201cThe relationship between the US and Hungary began to deteriorate when Orb\u00e1n ignored Washington\u2019s concerns about the rule of law in Hungary and the rapidly worsening corruption.\u201d \u201cThis was compounded by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s increasingly open obstruction of his allies\u2019 actions and his increasingly spectacular echoing of the narrative of Moscow and Beijing,\u201d she said. M\u00e1rton Tompos, a member of the Hungarian parliament and vice-president of the opposition Momentum party, criticised Orb\u00e1n\u2019s public campaigning for Trump. \u201cI believe that this is the typical case of putting all the eggs in one basket, which is irresponsible and deeply concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cHungary does not seem to have any kind of strategy, only the will of Orb\u00e1n and a few people around him \u2013 and this is terrifying.\u201d"

            "content": "Twelve US news organizations are urging Joe Biden and Donald Trump to agree to TV debates ahead of the November presidential vote, a typical feature of an election year and one that can sometimes play a crucial role. \u201cIf there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high,\u201d the organizations including ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, PBS, NBC, NPR and the Associated Press said in a statement. \u201cAmidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation,\u201d they added. But the two major candidates have so far resisted debating rival candidates from their own parties, with Trump refusing to participate against the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley and others, and Biden resisting calls to set foot on a TV stage with rival Democratic candidates, who have since abandoned their electoral efforts to challenge him in the party. The news organizations said it was not too early for each campaign to say publicly that it will participate in the three presidential and one vice-presidential TV showdowns set by the non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2020, Biden and Trump debated twice, with a third debate canceled after then-president Trump tested positive for Covid-19. Last week, the Trump campaign called for presidential debates to be held earlier and more frequently so voters \u201chave a full chance\u201d to see the candidates in action. Trump campaign managers have argued that by the time of the first scheduled debate, on 16 September, more than 1 million Americans will probably have already voted, with more than 8.7 million voting by the third debate, penciled in for 9 October. Trump has said he is willing to go head-to-head with Biden \u201canytime, anyplace and anywhere\u201d, starting \u201cnow\u201d. But Biden has been uncommitted to any debate so far, saying last month: \u201cit depends on [Trump\u2019s] behavior.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-09T19:38:33Z",
            "content": "A new study confirms what election experts have been warning about for years: increased harassment and threats following the 2020 election have led election officials to quit at higher rates than in previous election cycles. The study, conducted by the Bipartisan Policy Center and using data on more than 18,000 chief election officials across the 50 states, found that while turnover in election offices had been steadily increasing since 2004, election officials have left their jobs at higher rates since the 2020 election \u2013 with turnover increasing from 28% in 2004 to 39% in 2022. While election worker turnover has increased across the country, the problem is especially pronounced in larger cities. In jurisdictions with more than 100,000 voting-age residents, the turnover rate of election officials has reached close to 46%, the study found. Before 2020, election workers in large jurisdictions typically quit their jobs at a steady rate of 35%. According to a separate 2022 survey, about 20% of election workers from smaller communities reported harassment, while close to 70% of officials in larger cities faced harassment \u2013 with the threats particularly acute in swing states. Long before the 2020 election, persistent underfunding and an ageing workforce drove turnover in the field of election administration; the increasingly complexities of the job, including the requirement that officials have cybersecurity expertise, has also increased pressure. Spikes in threats and harassment can often be traced directly to Trump and his allies\u2019 claims of fraud and meddling by Democrats. In a 2023 report, the Guardian found that a deluge of violent threats against election officials in Maricopa county, Arizona, had originated from the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. New laws implemented by states after the 2020 election to limit external funding for election offices and withdraw from the bipartisan voter registration management program Electronic Registration Information Center (Eric) further deprive election officials of resources. Critically, the study found, head election administrators vacating positions overseeing large jurisdictions were likely to be replaced by administrators with, on average, 11 years of experience in the field. The high rate of turnover means that some of the officials administering the presidential election will have less experience leading elections and could lack the institutional knowledge that helps in an increasingly complicated role. The concern is reflected in reporting by the Guardian, which has covered numerous examples of election offices plagued by high turnover, threats and harassment. In some cases, high turnover has led to real human error, as in Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, where high-profile mistakes have fueled conspiracy theories about election administration. \u201cIt has become the expectation that if somebody walks into this office, they\u2019re not going to be here long term,\u201d Emily Cook, Luzerne county\u2019s election director, told the Guardian last month. \u201cYou kind of just document everything that you can, prepare as best as you can, at least in my opinion. Learn as much from whoever\u2019s sitting here while they\u2019re here. And we can keep moving forward.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-06T22:49:56Z",
            "content": "Nationalist-left government candidate Peter Pellegrini has won Slovakia\u2019s presidential election ahead of liberal, pro-western opposition candidate Ivan Kor\u010dok. The close ally of populist prime minister Robert Fico received 53.85% of the vote with the ballots from more than 98% polling stations counted by the Statistics Office in Saturday\u2019s runoff election, topping former foreign minister Kor\u010dok who had 46.14%. Speaking in Bratislava, Pellegrini vowed \u201cto ensure that Slovakia remains on the side of peace and not on the side of war\u201d. Kor\u010dok conceded the defeat and congratulated the winner. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d he said, adding that he respected the result. Pellegrini becomes Slovakia\u2019s sixth president since the country gained independence after the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993 and will succeed Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, the country\u2019s first female head of state. \u010caputov\u00e1, a staunch backer of neighbouring Ukraine in its fight against Russia\u2019s invasion, announced she would not run for re-election last June after receiving death threats. Pellegrini\u2019s victory cemented Fico\u2019s grip on power by giving him and his allies control of major strategic posts. Slovakia\u2019s president picks the prime minister after parliamentary elections, swears in the new government and appoints constitutional court judges. The president can also veto laws, though parliament can override the veto with a simple majority, and challenge them at the constitutional court. The head of state also has the right to pardon convicts. The government, led by the prime minister, possesses most executive powers. Fico\u2019s leftist Smer (Direction) party won the parliamentary elections in September on a pro-Russian and anti-American platform. Pellegrini, 48, who favours a strong role for the state, heads the leftwing Hlas (Voice) party, which finished third in the vote and joined a governing coalition with Fico and the ultranationalist Slovak National party. Critics worry Slovakia under Fico will abandon its pro-western course and follow Hungary\u2019s direction under its populist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The new government immediately halted any arms deliveries to Ukraine. Thousands have taken to the streets across Slovakia recently to rally against Fico\u2019s pro-Russian and other policies, including plans to amend the penal code and take control of the public media. Kor\u010dok was critical of the government\u2019s moves, which protesters fear could undermine the rule of law, while Pellegrini backed the new government and did not question its policies. Prior to the vote, Pellegrini told the AFP news agency that the European Union and Nato were \u201cdivided between those who are in favour of the continuation of the war [between Russia and Ukraine] at all costs, and those who demand the start of peace negotiations\u201d. Kor\u010dok, the former ambassador to the US and Germany, firmly supports Slovakia\u2019s EU and Nato memberships. Pellegrini, who was Fico\u2019s former deputy in Smer, became prime minister in 2018, after Fico was forced to resign after major anti-government street protests over the killing of journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak and his fiancee. Pellegrini had temporarily parted ways with Fico after the scandal-tainted Smer lost the previous election in 2020. With Pellegrini\u2019s win, Fico rebounded from two straight presidential election losses. Fico was defeated at the presidential vote by Andrej Kiska 10 years ago while \u010caputov\u00e1 claimed victory over a candidate he supported in the 2019 ballot.

The Trump campaign letter comes after five of the major TV news networks banded together to prepare a letter urging Biden and Trump to participate in televised debates ahead the November general election. Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy in Arizona on Thursday focusing on reproductive rights, just two days after the state\u2019s supreme court upheld a near-total abortion ban dating to 1864.

The joint press conference between Mike Johnson and Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago tomorrow will come just two days after the former president called on Republicans to kill legislation the speaker put forward to extend a controversial surveillance law. Trump had urged House GOP members to reject a reauthorization of the law, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa), ahead of the key procedural vote on Wednesday. Johnson is dashing to Florida to meet with Trump, where the pair are expected to appear tomorrow at an event at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate for a \u201cmajor announcement on election integrity\u201d. Friday\u2019s appearance will mark their first public event together since Johnson was elected to the speakership last fall. FBI director Christopher Wray is currently speaking before the House appropriations committee, where he is expected to warn lawmakers of his concerns over potential bad actors carrying out attacks on US soil. \u201cOur most immediate concern has been that individuals or small groups will draw twisted inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks here at home,\u201d a transcript of Wray\u2019s opening statement obtained by ABC News reads. But now increasingly concerning is the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, akin to the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russia Concert Hall a couple weeks ago. Wray said he was \u201chard pressed to think of a time where so many threats to our public safety and national security were so elevated all at once,\u201d according to the transcript. While he was careful not to touch on US domestic politics, the address by Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, today comes amid a deadlock in Congress on approving billions of dollars in additional military aid to Ukraine, due to pressure from hard-right Republicans aligned with Donald Trump. Kishida warned that the biggest challenge the world faces comes from China: China\u2019s current external stance and military actions present an unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge, not only to the peace and security of Japan but to the peace and stability of the international community at large. \u201cUkraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\u201d he added. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, on Thursday called on Americans to overcome their \u201cself-doubt\u201d as he offered a paean to US global leadership before a bitterly divided Congress. Warning of risks from the rise of China, Kishida said that Japan \u2013 stripped of its right to a military after the second world war \u2013 was determined to do more to share responsibility with its ally the United States. \u201cAs we meet here today, I detect an undercurrent of self-doubt among some Americans about what your role in the world should be,\u201d Kishida told a joint session of the House of Representatives and Senate during a state visit to Washington. The international order that the US worked for generations to build is facing new challenges, challenges from those with values and principles very different from ours. Kishida said he understood \u201cthe exhaustion of being the country that has upheld the international order almost single-handedly\u201d but added: The leadership of the United States is indispensable. Without US support, how long before the hopes of Ukraine would collapse under the onslaught from Moscow? Without the presence of the United States, how long before the Indo-Pacific would face even harsher realities? A majority of voters in Florida say they believe a six-week abortion ban is too strict, but only 42% said they will vote in favor of a ballot measure to enshrine abortion protections into the state constitution, according to a new poll. The study by Emerson College Polling found that 57% of respondents said the six-week abortion ban that will become state law next month is \u201ctoo strict\u201d, compared with 15% who said it is not strict enough. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said: Fifty-six percent of Democrats and 44% of independents plan to vote in favor of a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability. Republicans are more split: 36% plan to vote no, 30% yes, and 34% are unsure. Wisconsin Republicans have hit the state election commission with complaints alleging that officials in the state\u2019s two largest cities illegally rejected Republican applicants for poll worker positions for the primary election. The complaints, filed by the Milwaukee county Republican party and Dane county Republican party, claim officials in Milwaukee and Madison violated state law by not contacting eligible Republicans nominated by their party to work the polls. The move furthers the GOP strategy of questioning election processes in key battleground states. \u201cThis is the kind of misconduct that drives down faith in elections,\u201d the Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman, Michael Whatley, said in a statement on Wednesday. The Republican Party is filing these complaints to compel election officials to follow the law and guarantee bipartisan access to important election administration positions in the Badger state. Burt Jones, Georgia\u2019s state senator turned lieutenant governor, will be investigated for his role as a fake elector for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Pete Skandalakis, director of the prosecuting attorneys\u2019 council of Georgia, said he will look into whether Jones should face criminal charges over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the state. Jones was one of 16 state Republicans who signed a certificate stating that Trump had won Georgia and declaring themselves the state\u2019s \u201cduly elected and qualified\u201d electors even though Joe Biden had been declared the winner in the state. The Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, was barred from prosecuting Jones in 2022 as part of her election interference case against Trump and others, after she hosted a campaign fundraiser for his Democratic opponent in the lieutenant governor\u2019s race. Skandalakis announced on Thursday that he would appoint himself to spearhead a potential case against Jones, after facing criticism for not moving more quickly to find a prosecutor to replace Willis. The Trump campaign letter comes after five of the major TV news networks banded together to prepare a letter urging Joe Biden and Donald Trump to participate in televised debates ahead the November general election. The letter, endorsed by ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and Fox News, urged the presumptive presidential nominees \u201cto publicly commit to participating in general election debates before November\u2019s election\u201d, according to CNN. In a statement responding to the Trump campaign\u2019s letter asking for more presidential debates, Republican national committee Michael Whatley and co-chair Lara Trump said: Election calendars have become longer than ever before \u2013 and scheduling debates after millions of Americans have already cast their ballots does a grave disservice to voters who want to hear solutions to the economic, border, and crime crises created by Joe Biden. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign wrote to the commission on presidential debates asking for this year\u2019s general election debates between him and Joe Biden to take place \u201cmuch earlier\u201d and calling for more to be added to the schedule. In a letter to the commission, Trump co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote: The Commission must move up the timetable of its proposed 2024 debates to ensure more Americans have a full chance to see the candidates before they start voting, and we would argue for adding more debates in addition to those on the currently proposed schedule. The first presidential debate is scheduled to take place on 16 September in San Marcos, Texas. There are three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate scheduled. Wiles and LaCivita noted that by the date of the first proposed debate, more than a million Americans are likely to have already voted, and three million may have cast their ballot by 1 October, when the second proposed debate is scheduled. They added: We have already indicated President Trump is willing to debate anytime, anyplace, and anywhere \u2013 and the time to start these debates is now. Trump, who did not participate in any of the Republican primary debates, made similar requests during the 2020 election. The Republican National Committee sent out a scripted robocall on behalf of its new co-chair Lara Trump, falsely claiming Democrats were guilty of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. \u201cWe all know the problems,\u201d the RNC call said, according to CNN, which also said the call was sent 145,000 times in the first week of April. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place. If Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen. Marc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who repeatedly defeated Trump in court after the 2020 election, said the RNC robocall showed the Republican party to be \u201cmore committed to the big lie than ever\u201d. Donald Trump, who installed his daughter-in-law at the RNC last month, lost the 2020 election conclusively to Joe Biden and was told by close aides including William Barr, his attorney general, and Chris Krebs, his head of cybersecurity, that there was no widespread fraud. Regardless, Trump pursued his fraud lie through the courts \u2013 losing every case \u2013 and ultimately by inciting the deadly attack on Congress on 6 January 2021. The daily media briefing in the west wing at the White House is overdue, so we\u2019ll bring you highlights when it happens. White House press secretary Karine-Jean-Pierre was scheduled to begin the briefing at 1.30pm ET, then it was put back to 1.45pm, but no sign yet. These events often run late and it\u2019s nothing we\u2019re not used to, it often partly depends on whether Joe Biden is running on or behind schedule (usually behind). No-one else is listed as attending the briefing today. Jean-Pierre is sometimes accompanied, increasingly of late with so much international news involving the US, especially in Gaza, by national security adviser Jake Sullivan or national security spokesman John Kirby. Amid the Biden-Harris campaign ad buy in Arizona focusing on reproductive rights, just two days after the state\u2019s supreme court upheld a near-total abortion ban dating to 1864, US vice president Kamala Harris will visit the state tomorrow, for an official campaign event focused on \u201creproductive freedom\u201d. Harris had already planned to be in Arizona but now will make the visit to Tucson a key campaign trail stop as she leads the administration and the election campaign\u2019s efforts to bolster reproductive choice. Also she\u2019s marking Black Maternal Health Week. And she\u2019s been posting. And re-posted this from Joe Biden. It\u2019s been a lively day so far of political jostling between Democratic and Republican leaders and within the Republican top echelons, on Capitol Hill and on the presidential election campaign trail. There\u2019s more to come and we\u2019ll bring you the news as it happens. Here\u2019s where things stand: Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy in Arizona on Thursday focusing on reproductive rights, just two days after the state\u2019s supreme court upheld a near-total abortion ban dating to 1864. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman of Georgia who has filed a motion to remove Mike Johnson, said the House speaker offered her a spot on a proposed \u201ckitchen cabinet\u201d of advisers after a meeting at the Capitol. Senator Tim Kaine, a former vice-presidential nominee and leading foreign policy voice in the Democratic party, has said Joe Biden now understands that Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cplayed\u201d him during the early months of the war in Gaza but \u201cthat ain\u2019t going to happen any more\u201d. The joint press conference between Mike Johnson and Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago tomorrow will come just two days after the former president called on Republicans to kill legislation the speaker put forward to extend a controversial surveillance law. Trump had urged House GOP members to reject a reauthorization of the law, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa), ahead of the key procedural vote on Wednesday. House speaker Mike Johnson is dashing to Florida to meet with Donald Trump, where the pair are expected to appear tomorrow at an event at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate for a \u201cmajor announcement on election integrity\u201d. Friday\u2019s appearance will mark their first public event together since Johnson was elected to the speakership last fall. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is due to brief the media at 1.30pm ET. At 3.15pm Joe Biden will meet with Philippine president Ferdinand R Marcos Jr and at 4.15pm Biden will hold a trilateral meeting with Marcos and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, which US vice president Kamala Harris will attend. Jon Stone, a New Hampshire Republican state representative and county chair for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, who once presented Trump with an AR-15 assault rifle, lost his job as a police officer in 2006 after a suspension over a relationship with a teenage girl prompted him to threaten to kill colleagues and rape the police chief\u2019s wife and children. The extraordinary story was first reported by InDepthNH.org, a \u201cnonprofit watchdog news website published by the New Hampshire Center for Public Interest Journalism\u201d. Its story, by Damien Fisher, begins: Republican representative Jon Stone\u2019s New Hampshire law enforcement career ended when he threatened to kill fellow police officers in a shooting spree, and murder his chief after raping the chief\u2019s wife and children, all while he was already under scrutiny for his inappropriate relationship with a teen girl, according to the internal investigation reports finally released this week. Stone, a twice-elected Republican state representative for Claremont, has been fighting to keep those reports secret for years. Last month, the New Hampshire supreme court ruled that Stone could not block their release in response to this reporter\u2019s 2020 right-to-know request, ending years of legal challenges. Stone and his attorney did not comment. On Wednesday, HuffPost pointed to Stone\u2019s 2016 presentation to Trump of an assault rifle engraved with the New Hampshire state motto, \u201cLive free or die\u201d, and \u201c1-4-5\u201d, indicating Trump was his No 1 choice to be the 45th president. \u201cIt was very nice to meet Mr Trump,\u201d Stone, a co-owner of Black Op Arms, told WMUR-9, an ABC News affiliate. Stephen Stepanek, Trump\u2019s 2024 New Hampshire campaign chair, told HuffPost: \u201cI just found out about it this morning. [Stone has] been a Trump supporter for a long time, and he\u2019s been a state representative, and he had, as far as we were concerned, what looked like a great background. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions at this point,\u201d Stepanek said, adding that he expected aides close to Trump at his Florida home would decide what to do. \u201cI think it will be handled by Mar-a-Lago, in consultation with me.\u201d Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, co-managers of Trump\u2019s campaign, did not comment to HuffPost. The Guardian has contacted Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s campaign spokesperson, for comment. Arizona state senator Eva Burch, a Democrat, shared her recent experience of getting an abortion as she condemned the state supreme court\u2019s ruling earlier this week that a near-total abortion ban could be enforced. \u201cSomebody took care of me,\u201d Burch, who earned national attention last month after announcing she would get an abortion because her pregnancy is no longer viable, said today. Now we\u2019re talking about whether or not we should put that doctor in jail. This is outrageous that we would even dignify the consideration of this type of ban. Arizona\u2019s state Republican leadership halted an effort by Democrats on Wednesday to repeal an 1864 law banning almost all abortions, which the state supreme court this week ruled could go into effect. Democrats and one Republican lawmaker sought to repeal the law, but GOP leaders, who command the majority, cut it off twice and quickly adjourned for the week. Outraged Democrats erupted in finger-waving chants of \u201cShame! Shame!\u201d Republican state Rep Teresa Martinez, of Casa Grande, said there was no reason to rush the debate. She accused Democrats of \u201cscreaming at us and engaging in extremist and insurrectionist behaviour on the House floor\u201d. The GOP-led senate briefly convened without debate on abortion. Democratic legislators seized on national interest in the state\u2019s abortion ban. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the eyes of the world watching Arizona right now,\u201d said Democratic state Rep Stephanie Stahl Hamilton, of Tucson. We know that the supreme court decision yesterday is extreme. And we know that should the 1864 ban on abortion remain a law in Arizona, people will die. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign launched a seven-figure ad buy in Arizona on Thursday focusing on reproductive rights, just two days after the state\u2019s supreme court upheld a near-total abortion ban dating to 1864. The ad buy focuses on Donald Trump\u2019s latest abortion stance, in which he said laws should be left to individual states, many of which have enacted new restrictions since he appointed supreme court justices who were instrumental in the 2022 Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v Wade. \u201cBecause of Donald Trump, millions of women lost the fundamental freedom to control their own bodies,\u201d Biden narrates in the 30-second ad. And now, women\u2019s lives are in danger because of that. The question is, if Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next? The ad, dubbed \u201cPower Back\u201d, will run this month on targeted television programs and target key young, female and Latino voters both on television and online, according to the campaign. In a statement, campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said: This week, women across the state of Arizona are watching in horror as an abortion ban from 1864 with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the health of a woman will soon become the law of the land for Arizonans. This nightmare is only possible because of Donald Trump. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she had recently spoken to Donald Trump but did not say how the former president felt about her threats to force a vote to remove Mike Johnson as House speaker. I don\u2019t speak for the president,\u201d Greene said after her meeting with Johnson on Wednesday, CNN reported. Asked about Johnson\u2019s upcoming appearance with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club, Greene said: Things like that don\u2019t bother me. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman of Georgia who has filed a motion to remove Mike Johnson, said the House speaker offered her a spot on a proposed \u201ckitchen cabinet\u201d of advisers after a meeting at the Capitol. Johnson met with Greene for nearly an hour on Wednesday to discuss their disagreements, after which she described the exchange as \u201cdirect and passionate\u201d. Johnson \u201cdiscussed having a kitchen cabinet group that would be a group of advisers for him, asked me if I was interested,\u201d she told reporters on Wednesday. She said she would \u201cwait and see\u201d about Johnson\u2019s offer, but that she was more interested in how he handles several issues before Congress, particularly aid for Ukraine and the Fisa vote. She added: I explained to him, this isn\u2019t personal. But he has not done the job that we elected him to do. She added: He does not have my support and I\u2019m watching what happens with Fisa and Ukraine. Those are the two things that we\u2019ll all be watching. The Democratic senator for Virginia, Tim Kaine, is best known nationally as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in the 2016 presidential election, a race they lost to Republicans Donald Trump and Mike Pence. The Biden ally is a member of the Senate foreign relations and armed services committees. Kaine has repeatedly reiterated his backing for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Hamas following the terrorist attack six months ago that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 people hostage. But he has joined other Democrats in expressing growing consternation over a hardline military response that has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, and spurred a looming famine. In a 30-minute phone call last week, Joe Biden issued a stark warning to Benjamin Netanyahu that future American support for the war depends on the swift implementation of new steps to protect civilians and aid workers. Netanyahu subsequently approved measures to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, including the reopening of a key crossing destroyed in the 7 October attack. Kaine noted: They turned water back on in northern Gaza. They allow bakeries to start to operate again in Palestine. They announced they\u2019re pulling troops back in southern Gaza, and there\u2019s probably more that they\u2019re going to do, because I think he finally heard in Joe Biden\u2019s voice, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m a friend but you played me and I know you played me; that ain\u2019t going to happen any more.\u2019 He added: I feel strongly that Benjamin Netanyahu has made Israel less safe in dramatic ways and is now hurting the US-Israel relationship, which has been fairly steady and easy to be counted upon. Senator Tim Kaine, a former vice-presidential nominee and leading foreign policy voice in the Democratic party, has said Joe Biden now understands that Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cplayed\u201d him during the early months of the war in Gaza but \u201cthat ain\u2019t going to happen any more\u201d. In an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday, Kaine accused the prime minister of making Israel \u201cdramatically less safe\u201d and hurting its longstanding relationship with the US, and said the US president had come to realise the limits of his influence. Biden embraced Netanyahu early in the conflict but had little to show for it as Israel continued to rain bombs on Gaza, causing mass displacement, threats of famine and disease and, last week, the deaths of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers. Protesters have condemned Biden for miscalculating the extent of his sway over Netanyahu. Kaine reflected: I do believe he felt like that relationship and the true compassion that he had for Israel over his career would lead him to be listened to by the Israeli leadership. I think he is enormously frustrated that he\u2019s been trying to give advice, not like a foe would give it \u2013 \u2018I think this is better for you if you listen to me. I\u2019m not just saying this is better for me; I\u2019m saying this will be better for you.\u2019 The House is expected to vote again on renewing section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) today after the bill was blocked on Wednesday by a small faction of House Republicans backed by Donald Trump. Republican congressman French Hill of Arkansas told Reuters: What I\u2019ve been told is that we\u2019re going to do the same thing we were doing yesterday today. Mike Johnson\u2019s embarrassing defeat over the Fisa bill and the threat of an intra-party revolt over a Ukraine aid package leaves Johnson, six months into his speakership, in a similar place as his predecessor Kevin McCarthy, who was unceremoniously voted out last fall. After the Fisa vote on Wednesday, Johnson held a closed-door meeting of House Republicans but there was no breakthrough after more than an hour, NBC News reported. The speaker later told reporters: We will regroup and reformulate another plan. The joint press conference between Mike Johnson and Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago tomorrow will come just two days after the former president called on Republicans to kill legislation the speaker put forward to extend a controversial surveillance law. Trump had urged House GOP members to reject a reauthorization of the law, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa), ahead of the key procedural vote on Wednesday. \u201cKILL FISA,\u201d Trump posted to Truth Social. As a result, a faction of far-right House conservatives banded together to block the law from coming to the House floor, throwing the chamber into chaos once again. The Fisa vote was an embarrassing defeat for Johnson, and the fourth time in his tenure that the House has defeated a rule vote. Asked about Trump\u2019s role in the reauthorization process, Johnson told reporters: I\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s never helpful for the majority party to take down its own rules. What it does ultimately is it weakens our hand in negotiations with the Senate and the White House, so it\u2019s not a good development. As the House adjourned last month, Mike Johnson vowed that the chamber would soon \u201ctake the necessary steps to address the supplemental funding request\u201d, which includes money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The Senate passed a $95bn foreign aid package in February, but Johnson indicated that the House would consider an amended proposal when members returned to Washington this week. Even as Johnson faces a challenge from the hard-right flank of his conference including congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, other House Republicans insist the chamber must take action to assist Ukraine. They warn that further inaction, after months of ignoring the White House\u2019s demands to approve more funding, will only embolden Russian president Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe are at a critical juncture on the ground that is beginning to be able to impact not only morale of the Ukrainians that are fighting, but also their ability to fight,\u201d congressman Mike Turner, the Republican chair of the House intelligence committee, told CBS News last Sunday. Putin knows this. This is obviously an area where we cannot allow Putin to win. Allies of Mike Johnson have reached out to Donald Trump to ask him to publicly support the speaker, sources told CNN. Johnson has also been advised to keep the former president in the loop on a vote on funding for Ukraine could be imminent in the chamber, it writes. The specter of Trump has loomed large over the wrangling for a Ukraine deal; he was instrumental in Johnson\u2019s refusal to call a House vote on a $95bn wartime funding bill that passed the Democratic-led Senate in February, which also included aid for Israel in its war in Gaza. Trump has also demanded Republicans reject any Ukraine funding measure that ties in money for US border security in order to deny Joe Biden a \u201cwin\u201d on immigration ahead of November\u2019s election. The friction has led to rightwingers, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, threatening Johnson\u2019s position. The joint appearance at Mar-a-Lago tomorrow was pitched by Mike Johnson\u2019s office to Donald Trump\u2019s team, but the event is being viewed as a win by both camps, according to Politico\u2019s Playbook. Johnson gets to stand onstage with the King of MAGA himself right as he faces a hard-right revolt, while Trump gets the country\u2019s highest-ranking Republican to lend credence to his voting concerns as many in the GOP beg him to move past the 2020 election. The event on Friday comes as discussions are under way about holding regular meetings between the Trump campaign and Johnson\u2019s team, it writes. Those around Donald Trump are growing weary of the constant motion-to-vacate threats and fearful that an election-year speakership battle could risk Republicans losing the House, Politico\u2019s Playbook writes. \u201cThe internal fighting is not appreciated by [Trump],\u201d one person close to the former president said, adding: It\u2019s no way to run a party; it\u2019s no way to run a House. You can\u2019t work in that environment. The embattled House speaker, Mike Johnson, is dashing to Florida to meet with Donald Trump this week where the pair are expected to appear tomorrow at an event at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate for a \u201cmajor announcement on election integrity\u201d. Friday\u2019s appearance will mark their first public event together since Johnson was elected to the speakership last fall, and comes as he and Trump have begun to develop a rapport and engaging in more frequent phone calls, Politico\u2019s Playbook reports. It also comes at a precarious time for Johnson, who faces a threat for his ouster from one of Trump\u2019s most loyal allies in Congress, the far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. Just before the spring recess last month, Greene filed a motion to vacate, and has since warned Johnson that passing Ukraine aid would put his position in peril. Johnson warned on Wednesday that an effort to oust him would not be helpful for the Republican majority and \u201cwould be chaos in the House\u201d, and Trump insiders reportedly agree. \u201c100 percent distraction. Unwanted. And just stupid,\u201d one Trump insider told Playbook. We\u2019re not going to get trapped into this cycle of bullshit that comes out of members of the House. Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re watching: 10am ET: Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida will meet with Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries. 10.35am: Kishida will address a joint meeting of Congress. 1.30pm: Jeffries will hold his weekly news conference. 1.30pm: White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will brief. 3.15pm: Joe Biden will meet with Philippine president Ferdinand R Marcos Jr. 4.15pm: Biden will hold a trilateral meeting with Marcos and Kishida. Kamala Harris will attend."

            "title": "Panama\u2019s presidential frontrunner vows to \u2018close\u2019 Dari\u00e9n Gap",
            "date": "2024-04-18T10:30:25Z",
            "content": "Panama\u2019s presidential frontrunner has vowed to \u201cclose\u201d the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the swampy jungle straddling the border with Colombia that has become an unavoidable ordeal for many US-bound migrants \u2013 but experts criticised the idea as unworkable and potentially dangerous. Presided over by criminal groups and corrupt officials, the Dari\u00e9n Gap is one of the world\u2019s most dangerous and fast-growing border crossings. Last year, more than half a million people \u2013 including 113,000 children \u2013 risked their lives to make the crossing, up from 24,000 in 2019. \u201cThe border of the United States, instead of being in Texas, moved to Panama,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who served as security minister under former president Ricardo Martinelli. \u201cWe\u2019re going to close the Dari\u00e9n and we\u2019re going to repatriate all these people,\u201d said Mulino, without saying how he would do it, though promising to respect migrants\u2019 human rights. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s in their heads,\u201d said Juan Pappier, the Americas deputy director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cClosing the Dari\u00e9n Gap is virtually impossible.\u201d The Dari\u00e9n Gap is roughly 60km wide and 160km long, a mix of mountains and rainforest with few roads and little state presence. For decades, drug-trafficking groups have been the de facto authority in the area. \u201cRestricting the flow would push people to take even more dangerous paths,\u201d said Pappier. \u201cPeople will risk their lives, organised crime groups will get richer, and Panama will have even less control.\u201d The majority of those crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap are fleeing collapsing economies in countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Haiti. But a growing portion of migrants come from as far afield as Africa and Asia in an attempt to reach the US. The number of migrants crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap is expected to keep rising as visa restrictions in Mexico and Central America mean ever fewer are able to fly over it. If the first few months of this year are any indication, \u201cthe number of people crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap could be as high as 700,000 or even 800,000 this year ,said Pappier. As the numbers have increased, and the human-trafficking business has grown, conditions have deteriorated. The Colombian side of the gap is strictly controlled by the country\u2019s largest drug cartel, the Gulf clan. But the Panamanian side is more lawless, and armed bandits target migrants for robbery and rape. \u201cDoctors Without Borders \u2013 until they got kicked out by the Panamanian government \u2013 were documenting a sharp increase in sexual abuse,\u201d said Adam Isacson, from the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group. \u201cThe banditry has gotten much worse.\u201d \u201cBut if the government tries to establish more of a state presence along a path that people could take, that could actually make their journey safer \u2013 as long as security forces aren\u2019t in league with the bandits,\u201d he added. Panamanian authorities reported finding 124 bodies in the Dari\u00e9n Gap between January 2021 and April 2023, but this is probably a fraction of the true number, given the challenges in reporting and recovering bodies. \u201cNo one knows the exact number of people who have died crossing the Dari\u00e9n Gap,\u201d said Pappier. \u201cBut all the migrants we interviewed on the Panamanian side said they saw bodies, sometimes 10 or 15, when they crossed the jungle.\u201d It is unclear why Mulino has vowed to close the Dari\u00e9n Gap, given the relative absence of anti-migrant sentiment in Panama, where migrants spend little time before heading north. But in a US election year, migration is at the top of the political agenda in the region. Last year, Panama, Colombia and the US announced a plan to close the Dari\u00e9n Gap, with little apparent impact on the flow of migration. \u201cIt may be a message he thinks the United States wants to hear,\u201d said Isacson. With less than three weeks until the 5 May election, Mulino is the frontrunner to be Panama\u2019s next president. Polls suggest Mulino has a comfortable lead of 13 to 25 percentage points over his two closest rivals, the lawyer Ricardo Lombana and former president Mart\u00edn Torrijos. Mulino only stepped in as a candidate in February, replacing the billionaire businessman and former president Martinelli, whose candidacy was annulled after local courts ratified his prison sentence for money laundering. \u2022 This article\u2019s subheading was amended on 18 April 2024. An earlier version incorrectly referred to Ricardo Martinelli, rather than Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino."

            "date": "2024-04-10T17:16:05Z",
            "content": "The independent presidential candidate Cornel West announced on Wednesday that Melina Abdullah would serve as his running mate, joining the former Harvard professor\u2019s long-shot bid in the US presidential race. Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles, helped to form the LA chapter of the group Black Lives Matter, and West praised her as \u201cone of the great freedom fighters of her generation\u201d. \u201cI wanted somebody whose heart, mind and soul is committed to the empowerment of poor and working peoples of all colors,\u201d West told the talkshow host Tavis Smiley on Wednesday. \u201cAnd Melina has a history of longevity, of putting her heart, mind, soul and body in the struggle.\u201d Abdullah told Smiley that West\u2019s offer took her by surprise, but she quickly accepted because of her belief in his \u201cplatform of truth, love and justice\u201d. \u201cHow can you not get behind that platform?\u201d Abdullah said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been following him and had been really enthusiastic about his candidacy and just was excited to be able to share space with him.\u201d The news comes as West, an author and leftwing activist, continues his efforts to get on the ballot in every US state. West\u2019s campaign said he had already secured ballot access in Alaska, Oregon, South Carolina and Utah, but some states require a running mate for independent candidates to get on the ballot. As part of his 50-state campaign, West announced in January that he would launch a new political party, called the Justice for All party, to help ease his path to ballot access in some states. West has no path to victory, as national polls show his support languishing in the low single digits. A survey conducted last month by the Marquette Law School found that just 4% of likely US voters named West as their preferred candidate. But West\u2019s presence on the ballot in key battleground states could draw support away from Joe Biden, raising concerns among Democrats that the independent candidate might serve as a spoiler for the incumbent president. According to a Quinnipiac University poll of US voters conducted last month, Biden leads Donald Trump by 3 points, 48% to 45%, in a head-to-head match-up, but the president\u2019s support dipped down to 38% (compared with Trump\u2019s 39%) when third-party candidates such as West, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Jill Stein of the Green party were listed as options. \u201cCornel West and Jill Stein will each run from the extreme left and likely garner a paltry number of votes. Not all of their voters would support Biden, but none of them would support Trump,\u201d Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler, leaders of the center-left thinktank Third Way, wrote in a USA Today op-ed last week. \u201cThe lessons from 2016 and 2000 are clear: minor party does not mean minor impact. No-hope candidates can change the outcome of an election, even by garnering a relative handful of votes.\u201d West has previously dismissed concerns about how his presence on the ballot might boost Trump, arguing that he has a moral obligation to give a voice to progressives\u2019 concerns in this election. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be able to speak the truth no matter what. I\u2019m planning to do that until the very end,\u201d West said at a fundraising event in October. \u201cSo in that sense, who knows who\u2019s stealing from who.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-19T15:51:37Z",
            "content": "Standing in the shadow of Iceland\u2019s Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull, \u2013 a 700,000-year-old glacier perched on a volcano and visible to half the country\u2019s population on any given day \u2013 in 2010, Angela Rawlings was struck by an unconventional thought. \u201cIt suddenly just came to me. What if the glacier was president?\u201d said Rawlings. It was a seemingly unorthodox way to push forward a movement that was already swiftly advancing; Ecuador had enshrined legal rights for nature while M\u0101ori in New Zealand were working to secure legal personhood for the Whanganui River. More than a decade later, Rawlings\u2019 musing has snowballed into what is perhaps the continent\u2019s most singular presidential bid, as a team of more than 50 people scrambles to secure Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull a spot on the ballot in the country\u2019s upcoming election on 1 June. Among the first to hear the idea was Daria Testo. \u201cI immediately was like, yup, OK. Let\u2019s do it,\u201d said Testo. \u201cI come from the Indigenous lands in Siberia, and therefore personhood of nature is something that is so common to the culture and the psyche in general.\u201d On paper Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull meets all of the basic requirements: it is older than 35 years and arguably can be considered a citizen of Iceland. The need for a civil registration number was skirted after Rawlings legally took on Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull as a middle name, in essence allowing the campaign organiser to become a proxy for the glacier on the ballot. Since officially launching the bid in mid-March, the team behind Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull has been steadily laying out their case for why the thick mass of ice is a perfect fit for a position largely seen as symbolic. \u201cSn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull is the one glacier in the country that actually has an international reputation,\u201d said Rawlings, citing its role as a protagonist in Jules Verne\u2019s Journey to the Centre of the Earth. More importantly, its candidacy would offer a means of ensuring that the climate crisis, and those most affected by it, are front and centre in the election. \u201cHalf the population of Iceland is watching this glacier melt between 2024 and 2050,\u201d said Rawlings, pointing to research suggesting that Iceland\u2019s glaciers are at risk of disappearing within the next 200 years. \u201cI\u2019ve been personally referring to glaciers as the charismatic, geographic phenomenon of the climate emergency.\u201d So far, they have received a wide array of reactions to the campaign. \u201cWe are coming at this with both joy and seriousness,\u201d said Rawlings. \u201cI\u2019m aware that when you first say something like \u2018A glacier for president\u2019, it seems like a comedic gesture. But then once you get through that, the conversation opens up.\u201d Most have been curious to hear more about their rationale rather than jumping to the conclusion that they are making a mockery of the country\u2019s presidential office, said Rawlings. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been surprised by the volume of glee, let\u2019s say, that we\u2019ve been receiving. People are like \u2018Oh my gosh, yes, best candidate to come up\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s the only candidate I will even consider.\u2019\u201d Others have expressed hesitancy about how the idea would work in practice. The team has seized on these concerns to hash out various scenarios, explaining that a bottle of glacial meltwater could be sent when the president is invited to engagements abroad and that visiting foreign dignitaries could be redirected to meetings with local specialists in fields such as glaciology. When it comes to the president\u2019s often symbolic role in signing off on legislation, the ideas being weighed include using a presidential seal or a few droplets of meltwater. When it comes to legislation that would run counter to the best interests of the glacier; however, the question of whether Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull should exercise the president\u2019s rarely used veto could be put to a nationwide participatory process. Looming over the presidential bid is one other requirement for candidates: the need to collect at least 1,500 signatures in support of the nomination by 26 April. So far, Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull\u2019s candidacy has gathered about 200 signatures, suggesting there is much work to be done in the coming days in order to advance the candidacy. Regardless of what comes next for Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull, Rawlings described the bid as a potent \u201cthought experiment\u201d on how humans could seek to interact differently with the ecosystems that surround them. \u201cGetting on the ballot itself would be a huge step for increasing awareness around the rights of nature movements internationally,\u201d said Rawlings. \u201cIt would set an extraordinary precedent to be considering non-human entities for these kinds of positions.\u201d"

            "content": "France is being \u201cpounded\u201d by Russian disinformation that could distort the result of the upcoming EU parliamentary elections, France\u2019s minister for Europe has said. Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said in an interview with Ouest-France that Russian propaganda was being disseminated across social media platforms on a weekly basis. \u201cWe are being pounded by the propaganda of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and its communication corridors,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a week goes by without France being the target of coordinated and deliberate manoeuvres to disrupt public debate and interfere in the campaign for the European elections.\u201d He cited several examples, including the launch of a fake French ministry of defence website claiming that 200,000 French people were being called up to fight in Ukraine. A link to the site was posted on X at the end of March. \u201cThe site is a fake government site and has been reposted by malevolent accounts as part of a disinformation campaign,\u201d the French defence ministry said at the time. These \u201cdoppleganger\u201d sites, identified as one of several forms of Russian disinformation, involve the creation of websites that look identical to bona fide and authoritative sources, such as government or mainstream media sites. Other fake news Barrot cited was a recent announcement from a fake ministry of interior site claiming France was tightening up conditions of entry for Ukrainians, when, in fact, people from Ukraine are allowed to live and work in the EU under a bloc-wide temporary protection directive. He also mentioned false stories about a rise in tuberculosis in France. Barrot said the risk to the EU elections on 6-9 June \u201cis proven\u201d. Belgium, which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the EU, said it was looking at activating a temporary crisis taskforce to monitor and coordinate the response to Russian disinformation campaigns. The Integrated Political Crisis Response unit was last used at the start of the war in Ukraine and during the Covid pandemic. Sources in Belgium say it would be in operation for two months. Two weeks ago, the Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, revealed the Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office had opened an official investigation into alleged payments by the Kremlin to MEPs after it received classified intelligence from the country\u2019s security services. He said the mission to \u201chelp elect more pro-Russian candidates in the European parliament and to reinforce a certain pro-Russian narrative in that institution\u201d was \u201cvery clear\u201d. The Czech government recently discovered an alleged Russian disinformation operation aimed at influencing the EU elections. The EU regularly warns about the rise in disinformation, sometimes targeting the election, but also to sow the seed that civil society is crumbling, and to amplify dissent on issues such as Ukraine, migration and LGBTQ rights. Its disinformation unit has identified 17,000 specific cases of false information on social media and doppelganger sites."

            "date": "2024-04-15T17:17:47Z",
            "content": "Google has temporarily blocked links from local news outlets in California from appearing in search results in response to the advancement of a bill that would require tech companies to pay publications for links that articles share. The change applies only to some people using Google in California, though it is not clear how many. The California Journalism Preservation Act (CJPA) would require large online platforms to pay a \u201cjournalism usage fee\u201d for linking to news sites based in the Golden state. The bill cleared the California assembly in 2023. To become law, it would need to pass in the senate before being signed by the governor, Gavin Newsom. In a blogpost published on Friday, Jaffer Zaidi, Google\u2019s head of global news partnerships, explained that the company was experimenting with removing local news links for a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of California users in preparation for the bill potentially passing. \u201cWe don\u2019t take these decisions lightly and want to be transparent with California publishers, lawmakers and our users,\u201d he said. \u201cTo avoid an outcome where all parties lose and the California news industry is left worse off, we urge lawmakers to take a different approach.\u201d Google will also suspend \u201cfurther investments in the California news ecosystem\u201d, the blogpost said, cutting California publications from its Google News Showcase, a feature that pushes stories to users in a streamlined feed in an effort to boost traffic to publishers. In May 2023, in response to the California legislation, Meta said it would be forced to remove news content from Facebook and Instagram \u201crather than pay into a slush fund that primarily benefits big, out-of-state media companies\u201d. The company has not yet followed through on those statements, and did not immediately respond to request for comment. The California bill is meant to support the local journalism industry, which has been gutted in recent decades in part due to the rise of social media and other online means of accessing news. But media equity advocates say that the legislation is misguided, and stands to benefit larger publishers over smaller outlets that are seeing more drastic impacts. A study conducted by Free Press Action, a media-reform advocacy group, found in a November report that more than 80% of the websites that would benefit from the reimbursement mandated by the bill are owned by just 20 major firms. Media conglomerates like News Corp and Gannett stand to benefit from the proposed measure, according to the study. Because of this, major social media companies have lobbied heavily against the legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s a Google versus corporate media fight, and in the end California residents are the ones being harmed,\u201d said Mike Rispoli, senior director at Free Press Action. \u201cIt speaks to real challenges facing local news today when how the news is created and how it is accessed is controlled by these large corporations that are just looking after themselves.\u201d The California bill is the latest to challenge big tech firms over their impact on news publishers. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, have battled similar legislation in Australia and Canada. That fight came to a head in Canada when Meta turned off news services in the country in 2023, in the midst of a wildfire crisis. The blockade on links to news in Canada is ongoing. Meta has also continued to scale back its news services in Australia after the country passed a bill in 2021 forcing social media firms to pay publishers for content shared on their platforms. In March it escalated the battle with lawmakers there by stating it would stop paying publishers there for content. Similar legislation is being considered in Illinois. Introduced in February 2024, the Journalism Preservation act would require social media firms to pay a fee based on how many times per month they link to a news outlet\u2019s work."

            "content": "Channel 4 has hired The News Agents\u2019 Emily Maitlis to present its general election results coverage alongside the Rest Is Politics\u2019 Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart. Maitlis, who was a regular face on the BBC\u2019s results coverage, will co-host the programme with long-term Channel 4 News presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Channel 4\u2019s early announcement of its presenting lineup comes as broadcasters try to second-guess when an election \u2013 which must be before next January \u2013 will be held. The broadcaster is also hoping to create a buzz around its show by capitalising on the increasingly influential reach of two political podcasts which had not been launched at the time of the last general election. The Rest Is Politics has 700,000 regular listeners and is hosting a live event at the 20,000-capacity O2 Arena in London in the autumn. The show, made by Gary Lineker\u2019s Goalhanger Productions, has been wildly profitable for its co-hosts \u2013 the former Labour director of communications Alastair Campbell and ex-Tory MP Rory Stewart. In the past, Channel 4 has gone against the grain by hosting an \u201cAlternative Election Night\u201d featuring comedians providing satirical commentary in front of a live studio audience. However, the 2019 edition, co-hosted by the comedian Katherine Ryan, descended into chaos. The studio audience loudly booed the exit poll showing a large Tory majority, Jimmy Carr attempted political analysis and Boris Johnson\u2019s father, Stanley, was barracked while arguing with Robert Michael \u201cJudge\u201d Rinder about whether female fighter jet pilots could go to war while wearing burkhas. At the time, Conservative party officials said that it was symptomatic of why Channel 4 should be sold \u2013 citing it as one of the broadcasts that led to the ultimately unsuccessful attempt by the government to privatise the channel. This time Channel 4 is playing it safer, handing production duties to ITN and promising straight election analysis from Clare Balding and political editor Gary Gibbon \u2013 albeit mixed with contributions from the stars of Gogglebox. Meanwhile, the BBC is facing a challenge over how to replace Huw Edwards, who only took up the mantle of announcing election results to the nation in 2019. Edwards remains on the BBC payroll but has not worked since the Sun published a series of stories about his communications with a young man last summer. He is not expected to return to the corporation and Mastermind host Clive Myrie is widely predicted by BBC News employees to be given the job of announcing who has won the election."

            "date": "2024-04-02T11:17:44Z",
            "content": "A few of us were chatting the other day with Rob Baxter, Exeter Chief\u2019s director of rugby, about the toughest challenge in the sport. We all probably have a personal opinion on the subject: physically trying to stop a massive onrushing forward two metres from your own line, say, or having to kick a last-minute winning penalty into the teeth of a Galway gale from 50 metres. Baxter, though, was talking more generally and coming at the question from a seasoned coach\u2019s perspective. In his opinion the most difficult obstacles to overcome are often mental. Not least the art of preparing to face opponents whom you steamrollered last time you played them. \u201cDoubling up on games you\u2019ve had a good result in is the hardest thing to do in rugby,\u201d insisted Baxter. \u201cThe amount of times I\u2019ve been involved, either playing or coaching, when you\u2019ve won by 30 points one week and the next time it\u2019s so different.\u201d He had in mind this weekend\u2019s Champions Cup last-16 tie between Bordeaux and Saracens. When Sarries visited the Stade Chaban-Delmas in January they lost 55-15. So a home win awaits this Saturday, then? Nothing is guaranteed, in Baxter\u2019s experience. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Bordeaux tanking Saracens in the pool stages is the worst game for them to get back again. Saracens will be in a completely different place, they\u2019ll be going to war. Bordeaux will be thinking: \u2018Play like we did last time, throw it around a bit, score a few tries, this\u2019ll be great.\u2019\u201d But, then again, who can say precisely which version of Saracens will turn up? The team who looked totally irresistible when they stuck 50 points on a hapless Harlequins at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium or the well-beaten mob who shipped 40 points at Northampton last Friday night? Bordeaux, meanwhile, did brilliantly to overcome title-chasing Toulouse in the Top 14 last month, only to be firmly put in their place by lowly Lyon at the weekend. Up, down, in, out \u2026 if you are looking for a sport with plenty of hokey cokey jeopardy then rugby union is currently hard to beat. What goes up one week is liable to descend the next. The aforementioned Quins, so lacklustre against Sarries, were so good at home to Bath they were 40-3 up early in the second half only for the visitors to score 33 unanswered points in the last half hour. Try explaining that away without dialling the number of the team psychologist. There are clearly some plausible explanations for these stark variations. The home and away factor, for one. Squad rotation for another. It might seem common sense, after a huge win, to sub in a couple of fresh bodies but a team\u2019s chemistry can be surprisingly delicate. Equally, keeping the exact same XV does not always yield identical results. As Baxter was implying, mindset counts for every bit as much as personnel. The old Heineken Cup format of home and away pool fixtures on consecutive weeks was a good example, with the outcomes often varying ludicrously from one week to the next. Take a team like Ulster: they would go somewhere like Leicester and lose by a double-digit number before sticking 40 points on them back at Ravenhill. Perhaps the ultimate example was in 2003-04 when they thrashed the Tigers 33-0 in Belfast \u2013 only to go to Welford Road the following weekend and go down 49-7. It is not just a home-and-away thing, though. There are all sorts of other intangibles, from disrupted preparation and contractual distractions to matchday traffic jams and sickly family members. Life is seldom a straight line and neither is rugby. Crucially, too, there are loads of smart analysts out there endlessly poring over mountains of video footage. What worked last week \u2013 or even half an hour ago \u2013 can be shut down quicker than you can say Steve Borthwick. Then there is the fickle, knife-edge nature of the modern game itself. Increasingly you feel for coaches as they struggle to rationalise exactly how their bunch of lads went from heroes to zeroes inside half an afternoon. When Quins staged their famous \u201cBrist-anbul\u201d comeback from 28-0 down in the Premiership semi-final of 2021, it felt like a once-in-a-lifetime achievement. Nowadays sides are bouncing back from the edge of oblivion most weeks. Because momentum can be devilishly hard to stop if, say, the penalty count dries up and it is no longer possible to kick to the corner, win a lineout and turn the screw. Which is why the incident in the Quins-Bath game, when the prop Irn\u00e9 Herbst was allowed back prematurely from the sin-bin, was a complete shocker. It is less about the actual tackles Herbst made when he was back on the field illegally than the wider range of options open to an increasingly rampant Bath had he stayed off. So while, at first glance, the majority of Champions Cup last-16 ties look likelier to be won by the home sides, it is not quite that simple. Bordeaux will not thump Sarries so easily this time because rugby rarely works like that. Northampton may have beaten Munster in Thomond Park in January but when the first whistle blows at Franklin\u2019s Gardens this weekend that will count for nothing. Which brings us back to the toughest task, bar none, in rugby. The answer is obvious: refereeing a big game without making a solitary mistake in the eyes of all present. Professional rugby union has existed for almost 30 years and it is still yet to happen. This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

            "date": "2024-04-20T06:00:20Z",
            "content": "Labour has appointed a dedicated employee to work with influencers and seed positive messages about Keir Starmer\u2019s party on TikTok and Instagram, as the UK\u2019s political parties prepare to target \u201cmicroinfluencers\u201d during the general election campaign. During previous British elections, political parties often asked big-name celebrities to send a supportive tweet or attempted to win over YouTubers with millions of followers. But this election, the focus is shifting from a top-down approach towards winning over more \u201cauthentic\u201d influencers with smaller but loyal followings. The intention, according to political campaigners and digital marketing consultants, is to cut through to niche audiences hooked on scrolling through videos on their phones. \u201cIt\u2019s less about finding people with a million followers. It\u2019s more about finding authentic people who talk about an issue and can deliver a good message,\u201d said one campaigner. Labour candidates say the party has been offering training to produce influencer-style content themselves, circumventing a dying local news industry. Candidates are now being promised support from HQ in wooing influencers, with the party recently hiring a dedicated creator outreach manager \u2013 a standard role in many private-sector advertising campaigns. The party did not return a request for comment but pro-Labour influencers are likely being offered support, updates on policies, and access to politicians during the general election campaign. The policy shows how political parties are increasingly shifting resources away from wooing political journalists in a bid to directly reach audiences who are not consuming traditional news outlets. Political parties also believe influencers are more trustworthy than politicians and some media outlets. Marco Ricci from influencer agency Takumi said this reflected how consumption habits have changed since the 2019 general election, with people spending hours a day on apps such as TikTok. He said: \u201cThis is where people are now. There are huge parts of the population who are inaccessible through TV and radio. The big advantage of influencer marketing is you can be very laser-focused on who you\u2019re going after.\u201d Microinfluencers also benefit from the way social media algorithms operate in 2024, where large follower counts are increasingly less important than an ability to make engaging content. Thomas Walters, of digital influencer agency Billion Dollar Boy, said it made sense for political parties to target TikTok as voters increasingly switch off traditional media outlets. \u201cGen Z are glued to their phones and get a lot of news from TikTok. They also get a lot of opinions from creators,\u201d he said. But he added it was wrong to think of this as a youth voter policy, with influencer content increasingly reaching all age groups. He said: \u201cLinear TV is declining rapidly, it\u2019s a shift in eyeballs and it\u2019s [an] algorithm thing \u2026 The breadth and depth of audiences now is a lot greater than in 2019.\u201d The challenge for the UK\u2019s political parties is how to balance the reward of working with supportive influencers with the risk of causing a backlash by being perceived as inauthentic. A botched attempt to reach out to an influencer could result in private messages being made public and negative headlines, meaning parties have to accept a degree of risk when offering access. The Conservatives have struggled in this area due to the toxicity of their brand among younger voters. One video featuring Rishi Sunak and the food influencers TopJaw was deleted within minutes after a slew of negative comments from their audience. The prime minister had more success with a series of interviews with personal financial Instagram influencers in Downing Street around the time of the spring budget, where his announcements on free childcare and national insurance cuts landed better with an audience already looking for financial tips. Labour\u2019s policy on Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza has also been strongly criticised by many younger online audiences, creating a potential risk for any content creators who want to align themselves with Starmer\u2019s party. Yet there is one Rubicon that is yet to be crossed in UK political content: paying influencers to make content. In the USA, political campaigns think nothing of handing over money in return for supportive content by small-follower TikTok or Instagram accounts. Although there are no laws banning political parties from doing the same in the UK, British advertising rules require paid social media promotions to be labelled as adverts \u2013 meaning any paid partnership is likely to look inauthentic. Walters predicted British people would not react well to influencers taking cash from political parties: \u201cPeople want to feel that the person promoting the cause is genuinely engaged in the cause \u2013 not taking a paycheck to do it. But if people are gifted an experience to have their travel paid for to visit a factory with Keir Starmer, then disclosing that is fine.\u201d Another influencer agency boss described paid political work as \u201chigh-risk, high-reward work if you can get it\u201d. They said political parties can be dream clients because they have \u201cno idea of value\u201d but the risk of reputational damage to the agency and the influencer is high. Ricci said the trick is to flood the zone with noise and try to see what works, rather than focus on a few high-profile collaborations: \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a cross-platform noise. You need a snowball of momentum that\u2019s continuous and constant.\u201d He said influencer content only works if the public believes an endorsement is legitimate \u2013 and he predicted this would become an issue during the election: \u201cYou want real voters, you want real people. What\u2019s the difference between an authentic endorsement and deceptive manipulation?\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-08T11:00:30Z",
            "content": "In recent months, polling has generally showed President Joe Biden running behind his Republican challenger, Donald Trump, by a small margin, particularly in swing states like Georgia and Arizona. But election polling began to fluctuate after Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech last month. The question is how much meaning observers should ascribe to polls in April, seven months ahead of the election. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty well beyond the point where it starts becoming meaningful,\u201d said Dave Wasserman, editor at the election-analysis newsletter the Cook Political Report. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of variation in polls, which is not new.\u201d Most political partisans have long made up their minds about their preferred candidate. But large numbers of voters aren\u2019t really paying attention to the election campaigns yet. \u201cThe polling has a lot of noise because of polarization,\u201d said Rachel Bitecofer, a political scientist, campaign strategist and author of Hit \u2019Em Where It Hurts. \u201cThe polling is measuring latent partisanship. \u2026 But, you know, at the end of the day, it is going to be a 50-50 race coming into election day. I don\u2019t know why folks are having a hard time accepting that.\u201d The discipline of political polling comes under perennial challenge every election cycle, occasionally metastasizing into cancerous error like \u201cunskewed polls\u201d. Pollsters try to focus on building a demographic model of the electorate that\u2019s accurate, to weight the results of a poll correctly. If a pollster under- or overestimates the proportion of, say, Latino voters or college-educated voters or young voters on election day, a poll will reflect that error. But pollsters also treat their formulae for weighting polls like a trade secret akin to the recipe for Coca-Cola, said Louis Perron, a political strategist and author of Beat the Incumbent: Proven Strategies and Tactics to Win Elections. That lack of transparency contributes to polling error, he said. \u201cPolls have been considerably off for many cycles. Now, after every election cycle, pollsters claim to have learned their lesson, just to be wrong again,\u201d Perron said. \u201cNow, in their defense, primary polling seems to be OK. Let\u2019s wait for the general election. I mean, Trump has been seriously underestimated in many polls, as have Trump voters. So, maybe the simple reason why he\u2019s now ahead is because he\u2019s no longer underestimated. Maybe they have adapted the polling, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s now doing better than ever.\u201d Even the most precise polling leaves room for questions. If the margin of error on a poll is 3%, that means the poll has a 95% chance to be within three points of the population surveyed. The margin of error in a poll varies inversely by the square root of the sample size. A poll of 100 voters may vary by as much as 10% from the views of a group. Polls of 1,000 people have an error rate closer to 3%. Several polls in recent months have suggested Trump is winning as much as 20% of Black voters. Most of those estimates are based on samples within larger polls that are too small to be accurate, said BlackPAC executive director Adrianne Shropshire. \u201cIt\u2019s not reflected in our own polling,\u201d she said. Her group polls between 600 and 1,000 Black voters at a time. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing close to a historic shift in Black voters\u2019 intentions.\u201d Consider news reports about a New York Times/Siena poll last month showing Trump with 23% support among Black voters: only 119 of the respondents were Black. An Economist/YouGov poll suggested about 12% of Black voters support Trump; there, only 168 respondents were Black. A Marquette University poll cited by the Washington Post showing \u201cat least 20 percent\u201d Black support for Trump surveyed only 92 Black voters. A substantial decline in voters\u2019 responsiveness to the phone calls and internet entreaties of pollsters is adding to polling challenges, Wasserman said. Fewer than 1% of pollsters\u2019 attempts to contact voters for a poll are now successful. Those who do pick up a phone might have stronger political views than those who ignore the call. \u201cIt\u2019s a fraction of what it used to be because respondents can screen their calls. They are getting far more spam than they used to,\u201d he said. \u201cResponse rates are really, really low, and that creates the bigger possibility for a systemic polling error of the kind that we saw in 2016 or 2020.\u201d But despite the gaps, polls historically trend in the right direction. Polling was fairly accurate in 2018 and 2022 \u2013 years without presidential contests, Wasserman noted. \u201cThe question is: in \u201924, is there a similar hidden Trump vote? Or are polls roughly on the mark? Or is there a hidden Biden vote because Democrats are less enthusiastic about Biden than Republicans are about Trump?\u201d Polls especially have a place in understanding where the electorate is at a point in time. \u201cWhat the polls tell us is that voters aren\u2019t necessarily enamored with Republicans. But they\u2019re very down about Biden\u2019s management of foreign policy, the economy, immigration \u2013 and not by small margins, by very large margins. And that\u2019s contributing to his status as an underdog in this race.\u201d For now, many voters are tuned out of presidential politics, particularly the \u201cdouble haters\u201d \u2013 those who dislike both Biden and Trump. And those are the voters likely to decide the election in close states. \u201cIn terms of the general public, they\u2019re both deeply flawed general-election candidates,\u201d Perron said. \u201cDouble haters will decide the election. Those who actually have a negative opinion about both candidates will ultimately decide the election by choosing what appears to them to be the lesser evil.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-24T01:51:53Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden and Donald Trump both won their primaries in Pennsylvania shortly after polls closed. Pennsylvanians had gone to the polls on Tuesday to cast ballots in the state\u2019s primary races \u2013 the results provide a window into where voters in the crucial battleground stand roughly six months out from the general election. Biden and Trump had already locked up their parties\u2019 nominations, but Pennsylvania voters still had other options in the presidential primaries. With nearly 50% of the votes counted, Biden got 491,892 votes, or 94.4%, according to state election data. Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman who dropped out of the race, got 29,333 votes, or 5.6%. Trump got 268,670 votes, or 79.4%, with 33% of the votes counted, while Nikki Haley, who dropped out the race, got 70,648 votes, or 20.6%, data shows. Haley, a former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador, remained on the Pennsylvania ballot after dropping out of the race in March. Primary voting in the state is confined to registered Republicans, locking out the independent voters who favored her. Her results show that a number of Republicans continue to be unhappy with Trump, who is on trial on 34 criminal counts in New York. Biden faced challenges of his own in Pennsylvania, which he won in 2020 by about 80,000 votes, or 1.2 points. A group of progressive activists had run a campaign to encourage Democrats to write in \u201cuncommitted\u201d on Tuesday to protest against Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza. The effort, based on the similar Listen to Michigan campaign, hopes to get at least 40,000 Democrats to write in \u201cuncommitted\u201d, but it may take weeks to get those ballots counted. On Tuesday, voters had the economy and foreign policy on their minds as they cast their ballots. Karen Lau, a 70-year-old retired educator in Kingston, said she would be voting for Trump. She said Biden\u2019s handling of the conflict in Gaza was a top issue. \u201cBiden\u2019s destroying our country,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hypocrisy with Israel of saying one thing and meaning another with Biden.\u201d Even though Trump has been quiet on what exactly he would do in Israel, Lau said she was convinced he would handle it better. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a supporter of Israel,\u201d she said, citing the Abraham accords and Trump\u2019s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem. \u201cI just have a lot more trust in what he will do.\u201d Lau, who is Jewish, added that she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d with pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. \u201cThe rise of antisemitism is something I never thought I would see in my lifetime,\u201d she said. Richard K, a 69-year-old retired security guard in Kingston who declined to give his last name, also said he was unbothered that Trump was not that much younger than Biden. \u201cTrump plays golf when he can, he has a lot more energy,\u201d he said. \u201cBiden walks like an old man.\u201d He also dismissed the criminal cases against Trump, calling them \u201celection interference\u201d. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t ahead, they wouldn\u2019t be going after him,\u201d he said. Biden and Trump recently held events in Pennsylvania before the primary, underscoring the state\u2019s pivotal role in the election. At a campaign stop last week in Scranton, where Biden was born, the president used the setting to contrast his vision for the country\u2019s future with Trump\u2019s. \u201cWhen I look at the economy, I don\u2019t see it through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago, I see it through the eyes of Scranton,\u201d Biden said, referring to Trump\u2019s Florida resort home. \u201cScranton values or Mar-a-Lago values: these are the competing visions for our economy that raise fundamental questions of fairness at the heart of this campaign.\u201d Farther down the ballot, Pennsylvanians will cast votes in congressional primaries that will help determine control of the Senate and the House in November. In the Senate race, incumbent Bob Casey ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, while Dave McCormick was the sole candidate in the Republican primary. McCormick ran for Pennsylvania\u2019s other Senate seat in 2022, but he lost the primary to the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, who was later defeated by the Democrat John Fetterman in the general election. The Pennsylvania Senate race will probably be one of the most expensive in the country, as Casey reported having nearly $12m in cash on hand earlier this month while McCormick\u2019s campaign has more than $6m in the bank. The Cook Political Report rates the race as \u201clean Democrat\u201d. Several House races will provide additional clues about Pennsylvania voters\u2019 leanings ahead of the general election. In the Pittsburgh-based 12th district, the progressive congresswoman and \u201cSquad\u201d member Summer Lee faces a challenge from local council member Bhavini Patel, who has attacked the incumbent over her support for a ceasefire in Gaza. The Moderate Pac, a group that supports centrist Democrats and is largely funded by the Republican mega-donor Jeffrey Yass, has spent more than $600,000 supporting Patel, and the race will be closely scrutinized as an early test for progressives facing primary challenges this year. In south-eastern Pennsylvania, the Republican representative Brian Fitzpatrick won his primary after attracting a threat from an anti-abortion activist, Mark Houck, who criticized the incumbent for being too centrist. In 2022, Fitzpatrick won re-election by 10 points in a district that Biden carried by 4.6 points two years earlier, according to the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. Cook rates the first district as \u201clikely Republican\u201d in the general election. Fitzpatrick will face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, who ran uncontested in the Democratic primary, in November. Elsewhere in the state, Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican state representative, won the seventh-district GOP primary, vying for the chance to face off against the Democratic incumbent Susan Wild. The Lehigh Valley district is considered a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in the general election, per Cook\u2019s ratings. In the 10th district, based around the city of Harrisburg, Democrat Janelle Stelson won the crowded Democratic primary. The former news anchor will face the Republican incumbent and former House freedom caucus chair Scott Perry. Cook rates Perry\u2019s race as \u201clean Republican\u201d in the general election.

            "date": "2024-04-29T15:57:39Z",
            "content": "The EU is set to launch formal proceedings against Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, amid concerns it is not doing enough to counter Russian disinformation before the EU elections in June, according to reports. It is also expected to express concerns about the lack of effective monitoring of election content and a potentially inadequate mechanism for flagging illegal content. It is understood the European Commission is concerned that Meta\u2019s moderation system is not robust enough to counterbalance the potential proliferation of fake news and attempts to suppress voting. The Financial Times reported that officials were particularly worried about the way Meta\u2019s platforms were handling Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine upcoming European elections, although it was expected to stop short of citing the Kremlin in proceedings. Reports suggest that the commission is particularly concerned over Meta\u2019s plan to discontinue CrowdTangle, a public insights tool that allows real-time disinformation researchers, journalists and others across the EU to monitor the spread of fake news and attempts to suppress voting. Under sweeping new laws forcing tech companies to regulate their own content for compliance with the law in the EU, Facebook and others are obliged to have systems to guard against the systemic risk of election interference. A spokesperson for Meta said: \u201cWe have a well-established process for identifying and mitigating risks on our platforms. We look forward to continuing our cooperation with the European Commission and providing them with further details of this work.\u201d If the move on Meta is confirmed it will come just days after the commission carried out stress tests on all the big social media platforms to determine whether there were adequate safeguards in place against Russian disinformation. The stress tests entailed a series of fictitious scenarios based on historical attempts at influencing elections as well as cyber-enabled information manipulation. This included deepfakes and attempts to suppress authentic opinions through online harassment and threats. Such opinion suppression was identified by the EU in February as a new weapon in silencing legitimate democratic voices. \u201cThe aim was to test platforms\u2019 readiness to address manipulative behaviour that could occur in the run-up to the elections, in particular the different manipulative tactics, techniques and procedures,\u201d said the commission. This allowed them to test the resilience of social media to manipulation, which politicians predict will intensify in the next six weeks. The European parliamentary elections are being held on 6-9 June against a backdrop of increasing disinformation across the bloc. On Monday the parliament released tips for voters with a list of previous incidents, including claims that only pens with certain coloured ink will be accepted on ballot papers. Politicians have also warned voters to be on the lookout for disinformation, given the experience of recent national elections. In elections in Slovakia, Spain, Finland and Estonia, stories that voting booths had pens with disappearing ink spread on social media, while voters were told of physical threats including bombs at polling stations during last year\u2019s Spanish election. The EU DisinfoLab has tracked 17,000 incidents of disinformation of fake news with many attempts to discredit Ukraine\u2019s defence in the war against Russia, including Vladimir Putin\u2019s pseudo-historical grounds for his invasion. Last week a Czech news agency website was hacked to display fake news. One of the articles claimed that the Czech counterintelligence service had prevented an assassination attempt on the Slovak president, Peter Pellegrini; another carried an alleged reaction from the Czech foreign minister, Jan Lipavsk\u00fd, to the news. Last month the Czech government uncovered what it believed was a Moscow-orchestrated disinformation network. The Belgian prime minister also recently revealed the federal prosecutor had opened an investigation into alleged payments of MEPs by Russia with a view to electing more pro-Russian deputies to the European parliament."

            "date": "2024-04-19T04:00:00Z",
            "content": "A leftwing coalition of Basque separatists, partly descended from the political wing of the defunct terrorist group Eta, could become the largest party in the Basque Country\u2019s parliament after an election in the northern Spanish region on Sunday. Latest polls suggest that EH Bildu, which is led by a convicted Eta member who later played a key role in persuading the group to end its armed campaign for an independent Basque homeland, has edged ahead of its rivals in the Basque Nationalist party (PNV). The centrist PNV, which has ruled the northern Spanish region almost continuously since 1980, now governs in coalition with the Basque Socialist party (PSE-EE). Surveys suggest Bildu\u2019s decision to break from the past and focus on issues such as health, housing and employment is paying off \u2013 especially among younger voters. A poll on Monday for El Pa\u00eds and Cadena Ser radio put Bildu on 35.4% of the vote and 30 seats in the 75-seat regional parliament \u2013 eight short of an absolute majority; the PNV on 34.5% and 28 seats; the PSE-EE on 13.4% and 10 seats; and the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) on 8.2% and six seats. Another recent survey, conducted by Spain\u2019s public research body, the Centre for Sociological Research, suggested Bildu could take 35.1% of the vote, the PNV 33.5%, the PSE-EE 14.1% and the PP 7%. However, the campaign has inevitably been overshadowed by Eta and the atrocities it committed over the course of five decades. The issue of Bildu\u2019s descent from Batasuna, Eta\u2019s political wing, returned to the fore this week after Pello Otxandiano, Bildu\u2019s candidate for Basque president, or lehendakari, was criticised for referring to Eta as an \u201carmed group\u201d rather than a terrorist one during a debate this week. Eta, which stands for \u201cBasque homeland and freedom\u201d, murdered 829 people \u2013 almost half of them civilians \u2013 during its terror campaign. The group\u2019s disregard for civilian life and push to escalate the violence throughout Basque society using a strategy known as \u201cthe socialisation of suffering\u201d left it increasingly marginalised. In 1987, it killed 21 people in a supermarket bombing in Barcelona. Six million people took to the streets in protest a decade later after Eta kidnapped and murdered Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco, a young local PP politician. Eta abandoned its armed campaign in 2011 and dissolved itself seven years later. In 2021, Bildu\u2019s leader, Arnaldo Otegi, said the terror group\u2019s violence \u201cshould never have happened\u201d and that it ought to have laid down its arms far earlier than it did. Although Otegi, who joined Eta as a teenager and was later imprisoned for kidnapping, is credited with playing a pivotal role in persuading the group to renounce violence and seek independence by peaceful, political means, he remains a hate figure for most Spaniards. The party\u2019s commitment to distancing itself from the violence of the past was called into question when it sought to field 44 convicted Eta members, including seven people found guilty of violent crimes, as candidates in last year\u2019s local elections. Otxandiano\u2019s reference to Eta as an \u201carmed group\u201d was also seized on by his opponents. Spain\u2019s socialist-led government, which relied on Bildu\u2019s support to help it win a second term in office after last year\u2019s inconclusive general election, described Otxandiano\u2019s choice of words as cowardly and disrespectful to Eta\u2019s victims and to Spain as a whole. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the leader of the national PP, in turn accused the socialists of \u201creal cynicism\u201d for suddenly deciding to take Bildu to task after cutting a series of municipal, regional and national deals with Otegi\u2019s party. Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political scientist at Madrid\u2019s Carlos III University, said that despite Bildu\u2019s poll lead, the most likely outcome on Sunday was a repeat of the existing PNV and PSE-EE coalition. \u201cI think the most interesting thing about these elections is how Bildu may become the biggest party,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s neck and neck with the PNV, but we\u2019ll see what happens because this final week of campaigning hasn\u2019t gone as well for [Bildu] as the first week did.\u201d Whatever happened, Sim\u00f3n added, the Basque Country had undergone \u201ca very important sociological change\u201d in which Bildu had cemented its status as a \u201ccatch-all party\u201d. He said: \u201cToday, support for independence in the Basque Country is at 22% \u2013 which is one of its lowest levels. That means the public debate is about governing.\u201d Sim\u00f3n said Bildu\u2019s focus on health, housing and industrial policy had helped it connect with those sick of the political status quo. \u201cIt\u2019s been looking for a debate centred on public policy and trying to pick up on that discontent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how the Bildu brand has progressively managed to win credibility and respectability. I think it will get a good result \u2013 but I still have a few doubts as to whether it will outperform the PNV.\u201d"

            "title": "Joe Biden has gained an inch in the polls \u2013 and Democrats are jubilant | Emma Brockes",
            "date": "2024-04-11T09:00:27Z",
            "content": "It is a mark of the bleakness of expectations among American Democrats that, this week, President Biden\u2019s slight rise in the polls has been seized on as cause for giddiness. I did it myself. This was it! The beginning of the correction. Finally, the toll of various lawsuits and expensive judgments was coming home to roost in the form of a drag on Donald Trump\u2019s popularity. New York magazine urged cautious optimism. NBC News lost its mind and used the word \u201cbehemoth\u201d in a headline to toast Biden\u2019s burgeoning campaign. All this based on national polling that puts Trump 0.7% ahead. Still, it\u2019s better than the numbers were a few months ago. In Pennsylvania, a key battleground that flipped for Trump in 2016, a recent survey put Biden up 10 points, having led by only one in February. In a national poll conducted by NPR, Biden was actually two points ahead. (The same poll found that 40% of respondents reported being \u201copen to changing their minds\u201d. Who are these people and what is wrong with them?) But while older voters, particularly men, seemed to be moving en masse towards Biden, voters under 45 appeared less sure. Many young people still endorse Biden, but Trump, up a net 15 points in that demographic since 2020, is seemingly gaining ground with younger Americans. Of course, it\u2019s possible that none of this means anything. A two-point lead is too narrow to predict an outcome. It does, however, fit with a sense that things look very different now to the way they did in 2020. In February, the Biden campaign raised $53m in donations, and has built a significant fundraising advantage over Trump. The former Republican president has seemed less visible \u2013 or more accurately, less audible \u2013 than he did at this point in the run up to the election four years ago. Some of this may be down to a sharpened ability on the part of the electorate simply to screen the man out. But there is a sense, also, of Trump\u2019s attention residing elsewhere. While no individual legal judgment against him appears, ever, to discourage his supporters, Trump\u2019s endless legal wrangles do at least seem to be making demands on his time. Next week, Trump will become the first former US president to face criminal proceedings, with the start of the so-called hush-money trial featuring Stormy Daniels. This is among the weaker of the cases against him, turning as it does on esoteric campaign finance rules that are unlikely to move voters. If anything, the burlesque quality of the episode is perfectly suited to Trump\u2019s ability to spin negative coverage into a joke that delights his supporters; expect the word \u201cporn star\u201d to do a lot of heavy lifting. But there is bigger trouble ahead. Hanging over Trump is the recent $454m judgment against him in the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, for which, in March, he was scheduled to pay a $175m bond. In the event, James questioned the paperwork provided by Trump\u2019s insurance company, Knight Specialty Insurance, citing insufficient evidence of funds. A judge will hold a hearing on the probity of Trump\u2019s bond payment on 22 April. If the bond is found inadequate, his assets may be seized. To list Biden\u2019s successes against these liabilities of Trump\u2019s as if the comparison falls within a regular framework is an exercise that plunges us back into the realm of the surreal. The US economy is strengthening, Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness scheme has affected millions of lives and job growth has continued for a record 39 months. Meanwhile, last month, Trump predicted a \u201cbloodbath for the country\u201d if he lost the election, a word he repeated in a speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan last week. The difference this time is that we\u2019ve heard it all before. In the spring of 2020, reporters were going to Trump rallies and sending back dispatches as if from the moon. Trump voters were given thousands of words to describe their predicaments and grudges. The normalisation of Trump has been largely a bad thing. But if the wild novelty of his campaign \u2013 the sheer entertainment value, to some, of his disruptive presidency \u2013 accounted for a good proportion of his success at the last election, we may hope, without getting too giddy, that this will be much less of a factor in November.

            "content": "A 45-year-old man accused of murdering someone he came across by chance in the street told police he wanted to kill people because of the conflict in Gaza, wanting \u201cPalestine to be free from the Zionists\u201d, a court has heard. Ahmed Alid, an asylum seeker living in Hartlepool, was said to have told police he had killed \u201cbecause Israel was killing children\u201d and that if he had had a machine gun, he would have killed more people. Alid has gone on trial accused of murdering Terence Carney, 70, in Hartlepool town centre in the early hours of a Sunday morning last October. He is also accused of attempting to murder a housemate, Javed Nouri, whom he regarded as an apostate because he had converted from Islam to Christianity. Alid, who is a Moroccan national, faces two further charges of assaulting two police detectives who interviewed him after his arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford KC told a jury at Teesside crown court in Middlesbrough that Alid was one of four men, all asylum seekers, who shared a house in Hartlepool. He said Nouri and Alid initially got on until the defendant found out Nouri had been a Muslim who had converted to Christianity. Sandiford said Alid considered Nouri an apostate and \u201ctherefore somebody who deserved to die\u201d. Housemates noticed Alid was paying particular attention to news coverage of the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October and had begun to carry a knife, the jury heard. Nouri had complained about Alid\u2019s alleged threatening behaviour to police but \u201crightly or wrongly\u201d, Sandiford said, the police decided no offence had been committed. The fact that Nouri had complained was a motive for Alid wanting to kill him, Sandiford said. He added that Nouri was in bed when Alid, armed with two knives, kicked in the door of his bedroom and stabbed the victim several times in the chest and leg. The jury heard an audio recording from a 999 call in which Nouri could be heard screaming and someone said to be Alid could be heard repeatedly shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d [God is Great]. The prosecution allege that Alid thought he had killed Nouri and that he left the house and walked towards the centre of Hartlepool, armed with one knife. The jury watched CCTV footage that, the prosecution said, showed Alid approaching Carney from behind. When Carney realised Alid had a knife, he began running away. But Alid repeatedly stabbed him. Carney died at the scene. The court heard a postmortem examination established that the victim had been stabbed six times in the chest, abdomen and back. Sandiford said Alid admitted killing Carney in a police interview and said he wanted to kill more people, but injuries to his hand had prevented him. \u201cHe swore by Allah that if he had a machine gun and more weapons he would have killed more victims,\u201d Sandiford said. Later in the interview, Alid \u201cadmitted that he had intended to kill Mr Carney and said that his intention had been to kill more people. He described Mr Carney as an innocent victim, killed because Britain had created what he described as \u2018the Zionist entity\u2019. \u201cHe put it this way: \u2018They killed children and I killed an old man.\u2019\u201d Sandiford said Alid told officers Britain \u201cwas on the verge of an explosion and that there would be more victims\u201d. Alid said the attacks were for the sake of Palestine and that \u201che was ready for shahada, or martyrdom\u201d. After Alid was arrested he was taken to Middlesbrough where he made a speech in Arabic in his holding cell which was filmed on body-worn camera. Sandiford said Alid assaulted two female detectives who had interviewed him. \u201cBoth were shaken by their experience.\u201d The trial continues."

            "date": "2024-04-16T18:08:37Z",
            "content": "An escalating Middle East conflict risks leading to higher oil prices, a reversal of the recent fall in inflation and a puncturing of the optimistic mood in financial markets, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The Washington-based IMF said it was closely monitoring events in the region after Iran\u2019s missile strike on Israel at the weekend and stressed the possibility that a war between the two countries could lead to higher interest rates. Senior IMF officials used the launches of two reports \u2013 the World Economic Outlook (WEO) and the Global Financial Stability Review (GFSR) \u2013 to highlight the risks that a broader conflict would pose at a time when financial markets assume there will be a soft landing for the global economy comprising lower inflation, falling interest rates and the avoidance of recession. In London, anxiety over the Middle East crisis, and concerns that central banks will not cut interest rates soon, combined to drive UK shares lower. Previous wars in the Middle East have led to a sharp increase in oil prices and Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said the fund was evaluating the possibility of another commodity shock from the region. Gourinchas said: \u201cThe increased inflation that would come from higher energy prices would trigger a response from central banks that would tighten interest rates in order to secure inflation coming back to target, and that would weigh down on activity. \u201cIt would do so in a context in which, in some countries, activity and growth is already fairly weak, so that might also have a strong effect there.\u201d Gourinchas said the impact of a 15% rise in oil prices and the higher shipping costs from a conflict that was not contained would lead to a 0.7% increase in inflation, and would also damage business confidence and investment. Tobias Adrian, the IMF\u2019s financial counsellor, said at the release of the GFSR: \u201cWe are very concerned about developments in the Middle East.\u201d Adrian said there had been a fall in share prices even before Iran launched its missile strikes on Israel, and while oil prices are stable there is a risk that they could rise. \u201cIn such a scenario that leads to upward pressure on inflation,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cHigher interest rates could come back into play. Our key message to central banks is to make sure inflation is durably back to target and not to cut interest rates prematurely.\u201d Adrian used a blog that accompanied the release of the GFSR to caution financial markets against assuming there would be no fresh setbacks after the series of shocks to the global economy in recent years. \u201cA sense of optimism has pervaded financial markets in recent months, amid investor confidence that the fight against inflation is entering its \u2018last mile\u2019 and that central banks will ease monetary policy in the coming months. Stock markets around the world have risen substantially this year.\u201d However, he said there were \u201clikely to be bumps along this last mile\u201d and that geopolitical tensions could \u201cweigh\u201d on investor sentiment. The concerns over tensions in the Middle East hit financial markets in London on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 closed down 145 points, or 1.8%, at 7820 \u2013 the biggest drop in points since 6 July 2023. The fall marked a three-week low, and a significant change in market sentiment since 12 April when the index almost hit its record high of 8,047 points. Adrian added that there had been evidence from some countries \u2013 including the US \u2013 that the trend towards lower inflation had stalled. Higher-than-expected readings could challenge the \u201clast-mile\u201d narrative, potentially leading to a re-pricing of financial assets. Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, expressed confidence that the UK was on its way to lower rates despite the recent events in the Middle East. Interviewed in Washington, Bailey said the UK was \u201cdisinflating at full employment\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is strong evidence the process is working its way through. Our judgment on interest rates is how much do we need to see before we are confident of the process.\u201d In the WEO report, the IMF said Britain\u2019s households would endure a second year without an improvement in their living standards in 2024 as the effects of high inflation would take time to abate. Growth per head \u2013 one of the key measures of living standards \u2013 was expected to remain flat this year after a 0.3% drop in 2023, the report said."

            "title": "Israeli military intelligence chief quits over 7 October attack",
            "date": "2024-04-22T08:39:13Z",
            "content": "The head of Israel\u2019s military intelligence has resigned over the failures surrounding Hamas\u2019s unprecedented attack on 7 October, becoming the first senior figure to step down over his role in the deadliest assault in Israel\u2019s history. Maj Gen Aharon Haliva wrote in his resignation letter: \u201cThe intelligence directorate under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with. \u201cI have carried that black day with me ever since, day after day, night after night. I will carry the horrible pain of the war with me for ever.\u201d Amid continued widespread public anger with the political and intelligence lapses, Haliva called for a state commission of inquiry to investigate the failures as he announced he was stepping down. \u201cI am convinced \u2026 that it is appropriate to set up a state inquiry commission that can thoroughly, deeply, comprehensively and critically investigate all the factors and circumstances that led to the tragic events,\u201d he added. Haliva\u2019s announcement sets the stage for what is expected to be further fallout from Israel\u2019s top security brass over Hamas\u2019s attack, when militants breached border defences, rampaged through Israeli communities unchallenged for hours and killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, while taking about 250 hostages. Late on Monday, the head of the IDF\u2019s central command, Yehuda Fuchs \u2013 whose area of responsibility includes the occupied West Bank \u2013 also announced that he was stepping down in the summer. Previous commissions of inquiry including the Agranat commission, which examined the causes of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, and the Kahan commission into the Sabra-Shatila massacre in Lebanon in 1982 led to widespread political repercussions. While Haliva and others have accepted blame for failing to prevent the attack, others have stopped short, most notably the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said he will answer tough questions about his role but has not outright acknowledged direct responsibility for allowing the attack to unfold. He has also not indicated that he will step down, although a growing protest movement is demanding elections be held soon. Continuing public anger in Israel over the intelligence failings was underlined in new polling by the Israel Democracy Institute that suggests more than 62% of Israelis believe those responsible for the failures of 7 October should resign, while 51% support elections by the end of this year. Haliva had previously taken public responsibility for the failures, saying a week after the Hamas attack: \u201cWe did not live up to our mission,\u201d adding: \u201cI bear full responsibility for the failure.\u201d But he said he would stay in position until the war with Hamas concluded. Haliva had been seen as particularly vulnerable to the fallout from the October attack. He was on holiday in the Red Sea resort of Eilat and was called in the early hours of that morning to be updated about a potential Hamas attack, but had then played no role in conversations among senior Israel Defense Forces staff regarding what was happening. The Hamas attack set off the war in Gaza, which is in its seventh month. The Israeli military said in a statement that Haliva had asked to end his service \u201cfollowing his leadership responsibility\u2019. Shortly after the war, Haliva had publicly said that as head of the military department responsible for providing the government and the military with intelligence warnings and daily alerts, he shouldered blame for not preventing the assault. The military said in the statement that the military chief of staff accepted Haliva\u2019s request to resign and thanked him for his service. Haliva, as well as other military and security leaders, were widely expected to resign in response to the glaring failures that led up to the 7 October attack. The timing of the resignations is unclear, because Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza and battling the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the north. Tensions with Iran are also high after attacks between the two enemies. Agencies contributed to this report"

            "date": "2024-04-12T04:00:44Z",
            "content": "This year\u2019s Venice Biennale is being billed as an event rooted in the now, in a world of conflict and division \u2013 or, as one newspaper put it, the celebration of global art will be full of \u201cwar, refugees, destruction\u201d. Another theme that runs through many of the pavilions is colonialism: both its legacy in the form of restitution debates, and Europe\u2019s lingering presence \u2013 physically and psychologically \u2013 in those countries that were formerly colonised. More than half a dozen of the pavilions taking part \u2013 including Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, the Netherlands, Ethiopia and the UK \u2013 contain art or artists who are wrestling with ideas of colonialism and its influence more than half a century after many states gained independence. The Irish entry features a film made by Eimear Walshe, which combines ideas around the 19th-century land contestation and the current housing crisis in Ireland, while the Dutch pavilion features Congolese collective Cercle d\u2019Art des Travailleurs de Plantation Congolaise who have secured a loan of a contested colonial-era artefact. The UK\u2019s representative, John Akomfrah, has consistently interrogated ideas connected to colonialism since the early 1980s. The Brazilian pavilion has been renamed the H\u00e3h\u00e3wpu\u00e1 pavilion, which refers to the name the Patax\u00f3 people use for the land that is now known as Brazil. The team behind it say that that decision chimes with the Biennale\u2019s theme of Stranieri Ovunque \u2013 Foreigners Everywhere, and is intended to highlight indigenous voices in a country that recently apologised to Indigenous groups for persecution during the dictatorship. \u201cMany Indigenous peoples are still foreigners within Brazilian territory: perceived as outsiders,\u201d says Gustavo Caboco, one of three indigenous curators of the pavilion. The Biennale\u2019s artistic director, Adriano Pedrosa, is also a Brazilian whose own curation has regularly spotlighted Indigenous artists and culture, while the 58-year-old has invited many artists from the global south to the Giardini and the Arsenale. Brazil\u2019s former coloniser, Portugal, has a pavilion curated for the first time by three women of afro-descent (M\u00f3nica de Miranda, S\u00f3nia Vaz Borges and V\u00e2nia Gala), and looks back at the European state\u2019s legacy in Africa where it colonised Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea, Mozambique and islands in the Gulf of Guinea. At its centre is the concept of the \u201ccreole garden\u201d, which were the pieces of land enslaved people were allowed to cultivate. The garden \u2013 full of plants with a connection to Portugal\u2019s colonial past \u2013 will take up the main space in the palazzo, and also references Am\u00edlcar Cabral, an agricultural scientist turned revolutionary leader who defeated Portugal in Guinea-Bissau. De Miranda said: \u201cThe forest was always the place that [Cabral] was safe and able to plan the strategy to defeat the colonial power, so for us the forest is a place of refuge as well.\u201d The Ethiopian pavilion has a special significance: it\u2019s the first time the country has taken part at Venice and the invitation to came from Italy, a state that occupied it for five years but never managed to colonise it. Its curator, Lemn Sissay, said the presence of Ethiopia at the \u201cOlympics of the art world\u201d was a significant moment for the African nation, which makes it harder for countries like Britain that hold its artefacts to retain them. The Nigerian pavilion has an even stronger connection to the restitution debate: it is being curated by Aindrea Emelife, the curator of modern and contemporary art at Mowaa, the Museum of West African Art, which has been at the forefront of the debate over the return of the Benin bronzes. Emelife said the eight artists taking part \u2013 including Toyin Ojih Odutola, Precious Okoyomon and Yinka Shonibare \u2013 have been asked to create work about the \u201cpotential\u201d of Nigeria, from the colonial era to the present day and into the future. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a post-colonial element to what the artists are making,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think of moments of optimism for any nation post-independence, there is this galvanising force, so it\u2019s natural that that comes to play. But the artists who are discussing colonialism are also trying to resist it \u2026 and not repeat the mistakes.\u201d"

            "title": "Gulf states\u2019 response to Iran-Israel conflict may decide outcome of crisis",
            "date": "2024-04-19T18:18:49Z",
            "content": "Iran\u2019s missile and drone attack on Israel had, by the end of this week, become one of the most interpreted events in recent modern history. Then, in the early hours of Friday, came reports of Israel\u2019s riposte. As in June 1914, when Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in a moment that ultimately led to the first world war, these shots were heard around the world, even if few can agree conclusively on what they portend. By one de minimis account, Tehran was merely sending a performative warning shot with its attack last Saturday, almost taking its ballistic missiles out for a weekend test drive. The maximalist version is that this was a state-on-state assault designed to change the rules of the Middle East. By swarming Israel with so many projectiles, such an assessment goes, Iran was prepared to risk turning Israel into a mini-Dresden of 1945 and was only thwarted by Israeli strategic defences and, crucially, extraordinary cooperation between the US, Israel and Sunni Gulf allies. Whatever Iran\u2019s ultimate intention, its assault and now Israel\u2019s reported counterattack have presented the Gulf states with dilemmas and acute choices, according to Hugh Lovatt of the European Council on Foreign Relations. How they respond may determine the outcome of the crisis. The key question is: do the Sunni monarchies led by Saudi Arabia fear Iran and its proxies more than they detest Israel and the damage it is inflicting on Palestinians and regional stability? For the past six months, that choice has been suppressed, as Iran and the Sunni states have forged a fragile united front. In January, Saudi Arabia ensured that Iran had a seat at the table through a joint meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (GCC-IOC). Nevertheless, the two sides have resolute disagreements \u2013 over a two-state solution, a future role for Hamas, and whether state boycotts or disinvestment, once a common tool of the Arab states against Israel, should be used in this crisis to put the pressure on Israel that Joe Biden was not willing to deploy. Further, Iran has made no secret of its desire to see the US driven out of the region, a vision that the Gulf states do not share. Cooperation with Israel At issue is whether Arab states\u2019 cooperation with Israel to repel Iran\u2019s attack denotes something bigger and more permanent. One school of thought is articulated by Martyn Idynk, a former US ambassador to Israel, who told a Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) briefing of the Iranian attack: \u201cWhat happened \u2026 is the Sunni Arabs, particularly Jordan and Saudi Arabia, came out of the closet and made it clear that the threat from Iran was far greater than anything. What we discovered was that the strategic coordination between the US and Israel is a lot further along than most of us knew \u2026 and [Arab states] who have been attacked by Iranian missiles and rockets before now have a credible defence umbrella that is part of a US-Sunni-Israel strategic cooperation arrangement.\u201d He said the Gulf states no longer cared if the world knew about this alliance and that as long as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, could show a sensitivity to Arab concerns, the basis existed to develop the Israeli-Sunni relationship. It is certainly true that the Gulf states\u2019 role in the defence of Israel has been long in the making. \u201cWe have been practising our steps together over and over for years,\u201d said one British official. This is based on the supposition that the Arab states and Israel are \u201cfrenemies\u201d. Speaking about the defence operation launched against the incoming barrage from Tehran, the CFR fellow Max Boot said: \u201cThis is a huge win for this de facto Centcom alliance and this new air defence network. A 99% interception rate is off the charts. The US played a huge role, but so did the Arabs.\u201d Some Gulf nations have been more coy about their role than others, fearing a domestic backlash. Qatar had no involvement despite hosting the largest US base in the Middle East. Equally, no US F-35s flew from Dhafra air base in the United Arab Emirates. Kuwait may have allowed US planes into the sky, not to attack Iran missiles, but to carry out \u201croutine intelligence\u201d sorties. Saudi Arabia\u2019s airborne warning and control system was operational, possibly providing intelligence. Above all, Jordan made no effort to disguise the fact that it was shooting down Iranian drones to defend its sovereign airspace, prompting angry exchanges between the two countries. These included Jordan accusing Iran of having used the militant Muslim Brotherhood group and its Iraqi militia proxies for months to mount infiltration operations on its territory to stir up the largest Palestinian population in the region. The US military has for years been advocating an integrated air defence alliance, stitching together the Gulf states and Israel. Stage one was the Abraham accords in 2020, through which Bahrain and the UAE normalised relations with Israel. Stage two happened in September 2021 with the relocation of Israel into Centcom, the US-Middle East combatant command that includes Arab states. The question now is whether the latest events will result in an anti-Iranian air defence alliance, and if so, on what terms. Dana Stroul, who until December was the most senior civilian official at the Pentagon with responsibility for the Middle East, insisted: \u201cWhatever regional politicians may say, the military, security and intelligence establishments of both the Arab states and Israel are quite clear \u2013 that Iran is the centre of gravity for instability, the export of terrorism and its illicit nuclear weapons programme.\u201d Little attempt has been made in the Saudi press to disguise Riyadh\u2019s irritation with Iran. In Arab News, Abdulaziz Sagar, the chair of the Gulf Research Centre, wrote: \u201cThe Iranian leadership has tried to position itself as the guardian of the rights of the Palestinian people and the leading player in the Palestinian struggle against Israel. This policy turned into the hijacking of the Palestinian cause and employing the plight of the Palestinians in an utterly obscure manner to support Iran\u2019s expansionist and interventionist regional policy and national interests.\u201d He added: \u201cThe inevitable outcome of the Iranian missile attack on Israel is the breakdown of the myth \u2026 that the Iranian leaders imparted on the imaginations of the Arab world: that supporting Iran, its revolution and its leaders is the only way to effectively deal with Israeli arrogance and aggression.\u201d In Israel, politicians hope the Saudis will see the week\u2019s events as a turning point. The defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said: \u201cWe have an opportunity here to establish a strategic alliance against this serious threat from Iran, which threatens to put nuclear explosives on the heads of these missiles.\u201d But Stroul urged caution. \u201cIf this integrated air defence is about the sovereign airspace of our partners, there is room to work together, but if we try to push this into an anti-Iran, pro-Israel coalition, our partners will be nervous.\u201d Furthermore, some regard it as overblown triumphalism to suggest that the Gulf states are about to meaningfully intensify relations with Israel. Lovatt said Arab nations\u2019 cooperation with the response to Iran\u2019s attack could be seen simply as an attempt to limit the damage inflicted by Tehran, and so prevent an escalatory Israeli response. He said Riyadh\u2019s foreign policy was on a new course of putting its own economy first, and that was the purpose of the Saudi-Iranian agreement reached in 2023 with the help of Iraq and China. Palestinian future Saudi Arabia, along with Qatar, Jordan, the UAE and Egypt, had in recent months invested heavily in their own Palestinian peace plan, he pointed out. This included proposals for a ceasefire, followed by an Arab international protection force operating in both Gaza and, significantly, the West Bank. Under the plan, the protection force would be formed at the request of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and not be externally imposed. This would be the precursor to peace talks lasting no more than two years leading to the formation of a Palestinian state. All parties would have to agree to this end point, presenting an obstacle for Netanyahu. The plan promised Israeli regional recognition and integration at the end stage. Lovatt said the Arab states had hoped to release the plan in March, but it had been delayed by the US. A key element would include giving Hamas a role within a rejuvenated Palestinian leadership organisation. It was possible, Lovatt said, that Iran could be brought on board for this, despite its longstanding opposition to a two-state solution. Noting that Iran signed a GCC-IOC statement supporting a two-state solution in January, he said that should a concrete plan emerge for this, Palestinians, including Hamas, accepted it may be possible to persuade Tehran. Although there is widespread cynicism about Saudi intentions towards the Palestinians, many British officials insisted Riyadh was speaking enthusiastically about the possibility of staging a peace conference. Saudi diplomats themselves have denied that they would jettison the Palestinians if Biden met Riyadh\u2019s demands for its own security in return for normalisation with Israel. Tobias Borck, the Middle East lead at the the RUSI defence thinktank, said: \u201cThe Palestinian issue stands alongside Riyadh\u2019s own domestic national interests, but I think the Saudis are keenly aware that the kind of stability they want in the region is only really possible when this volatility from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is somehow tamed.\u201d On this basis, he noted, Saudi Arabia would resist more conflict with Iran for now, regarding it as a diversion, and instead insist the world\u2019s gaze must not turn from Gaza. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 April 2024. The Saudi-Iranian agreement referred to was reached in 2023, not 2013 as an earlier version stated."

            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial on charges of falsifying business records to conceal a hush-money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels began in earnest on Monday, with lawyers for both sides making their opening statements. A jury of seven men and five women will weigh whether Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to conceal an affair with Daniels, which he feared would damage his bid for the White House, were illicit. Trump was charged in the spring of 2023 with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He has pleaded not guilty. Here are the key takeaways from opening statements on Monday. To recap what happened today: The prosecution said Trump \u201corchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election\u201d in his efforts to cover up an alleged affair with Daniels. The prosecution called its first witness to the stand: David Pecker, former publisher of the National Enquirer and a man at the heart of Trump\u2019s alleged crimes. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors that Trump, his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen and Pecker hatched a plan to keep damaging information about Trump out of the press. Colangelo said this \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d campaign was geared towards helping Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign. He mentioned an earlier payment to Karen McDougal, the Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with Trump. The prosecutor also read out a transcript of Trump\u2019s infamous comments on the set of the Access Hollywood television show, where Trump bragged he could sexually assault women because he was famous, and noted that the video was released to the public in October 2016, one month before election day. The defense argued that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to influence an election \u2013 it\u2019s called democracy\u201d. Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche said Trump \u201cis innocent\u201d and made an effort to humanize Trump, while also repeatedly calling him \u201cPresident Trump\u201d. Blanche argued that Trump was unaware about the specifics of the hush-money payments because he left it all to Cohen. Trump had nothing to do with the 34 checks other than to sign them, Blanche said. Trump, who has appeared mostly dour throughout the proceedings and fell asleep briefly at several points last week, looked very attentive to and focused on Pecker\u2019s testimony. Donald Trump was confronted on Monday with the unsavory details of his alleged attempt to illegally influence the 2016 election by covering up his hush-money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels, as the first criminal trial for a former US president got under way in New York. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records \u2013 where the hush-money payments were recorded as legal expenses \u2013 to cover up the affair just weeks before the election. Here are the key takeaways from the start of the trial. Donald Trump spoke to the media after court was adjourned for the day, where he complained that the hush-money case is \u201ca case of bookkeeping, which is a very minor thing\u201d. He said: I\u2019m the leading candidate ... and this is what they\u2019re trying to take me off the trail for. Checks being paid to a lawyer. Trump attacked Michael Cohen, claiming that the things Cohen got in trouble for \u201chad nothing to do with me\u201d. He said: [Cohen] represented a lot of people over the years but they take this payment and they call it a legal expense ... and this is what I got indicted over. The former president said he should be campaigning in Georgia, Florida and other places and instead \u201cI\u2019m sitting here and this will go on for a long time,\u201d adding: It\u2019s very unfair what\u2019s going on and I should be allowed to campaign. No cameras are allowed inside the Manhattan courtroom during Donald Trump\u2019s hush-money trial, but courtroom sketches mean we are able to get a glimpse of proceedings. Trump lawyer Alina Habba spoke to reporters a little while earlier as the court took a short recess, where she called the former president\u2019s trials a \u201cdisgrace to the American judicial system\u201d, per pool. Habba, flanked by Christopher Kise and Clifford Robert, said: The fact that we have two courts not one, criminal and civil, being used against one man because they cannot beat him in the polls is a disgrace to the American judicial system. You should not have two teams of lawyers here today. You should not even be here today, because you didn\u2019t know is the epitome of a witch-hunt. She did not take any questions. The defense team and prosecutors are still in the courtroom after jurors left. Lawyers on both sides are squabbling over various objections. David Pecker has completed his testimony for the day and is dismissed from the stand. He is expected to return tomorrow. The jury is slowly filing out. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked David Pecker: if the story was big or involved a major figure, would he have final say? \u201cYes, I did,\u201d the former publisher said. The prosecution now appears poised to use Pecker\u2019s testimony for documentary evidence in relation to the conspiracy. Steinglass asked Pecker to tell jurors what the last four digits of several phone numbers that he used around election time. When Pecker had trouble remembering one, Steinglass joked, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a quiz!\u201d Pecker cackled. Donald Trump is very attentive to and focused on David Pecker\u2019s testimony. He has been conferring both with his lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, in between watching Pecker on the monitor in front of him. Trump has also started to take notes on the yellow legal pad in front of hm. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass is trying to establish that David Pecker had the power as head of AMI to control coverage \u2013 which will help him later on as the prosecution tries to prove that Pecker was integral to the catch-and-kill conspiracy. Pecker said: We used checkbook journalism and we paid for stories. I gave a number to the editors that they could not spend more than $10,000 to investigate or produce or publish a story, anything over $10,000 they would spend on a story, they would have to be vetted and brought up to me, for approval. Did he have final editorial say, Steinglass pressed. Pecker replied: Being in the publishing industry for 40 years, I realized early in my career that the only thing that was important is the cover of a magazine, so when the editors produced the story or prepared a cover, we would have a meeting and they would present to me what the story would be, what the concept was, what the cost was going to be. Right now, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass is going through preliminary information, establish who David Pecker is, and why he matters. This is normally when witnesses first take the stand. What kind of work do you do? Consulting. What did you used to do? Pecker said he chaired AMI. The company had titles such as the National Enquirer and The Globe, he said. David Pecker was a key Trump ally who served as the CEO of American Media Inc (AMI), the publisher of the National Enquirer. Pecker helped Trump by purchasing the rights to potentially damaging stories and then never publishing them, a practice known as \u201ccatch and kill\u201d. In 2015, AMI paid $30,000 to Dino Sajudin, a former doorman at Trump Tower, who was trying to sell a story that Trump had allegedly fathered a child out of wedlock. In June of 2016, AMI paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, $150,000 to suppress a story about an affair. AMI bought the story with the understanding that Trump would reimburse them, according to the indictment. Michael Cohen would later release a tape of him and Trump discussing repaying Pecker. In 2016, Dylan Howard, then the editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer, alerted Pecker that Daniels had potentially damaging information about Trump, according to the indictment. Pecker advised Howard to reach out to Cohen, and Cohen subsequently negotiated the deal with Stormy Daniels\u2019 lawyer. And we\u2019re off to the races. Judge Juan Merchan directs prosecution to call first witness. \u201cThe people call David Pecker.\u201d Pecker, with his silvery hair slicked back, sporting a slate suit and a yellow tie, walked to the witness stand. He was instructed to raise his right hand while being sworn in and when he was directed to stand in a different direction, offered a smile. He\u2019s seated at the stand. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass just said \u201cgood afternoon, Mr Pecker,\u201d to which he replied, \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d Anti-Trump protesters and supporters of the former president gathered outside the Manhattan courthouse on the first day of opening statements in his hush-money criminal trial. Police had discussed the possibility of closing the park across the street after a man set himself on fire there last week, but it remained open to the public today. Donald Trump raised his fist and did not speak to reporters as he left the courtroom after opening statements, per pool. The court is taking a short 10-minute recess. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche also insisted that catch-and-kills are legally OK. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about a scheme,\u201d Blanche said, insisting nothing was legally untoward with what purportedly went down between Trump, Michael Cohen and David Pecker. \u201cThis sort of things happens regularly, where newspapers [make] decisions about what to publish, where to publish, how to publish,\u201d Blanche said. It happens with politicians, famous people, wealthy people \u2026 Blanche\u2019s opening statement has ended. We have a brief break. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche has been hammering down on the prosecution\u2019s expected star witnesses: Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels. Cohen, Blanche said, was incredibly loyal to his then-boss. He wanted a job in his administration and didn\u2019t get one. Blanche said: He\u2019s obsessed with President Trump \u2013 he\u2019s obsessed with President Trump, even to this day. So much so that Cohen has multiple podcasts over Trump and routinely waxes enthusiastic about the possibility of his former boss\u2019s conviction. Cohen, he noted, was found to have lied under oath, further undermining his reliability. As for Daniels? She had \u201cmade a life\u201d off of her alleged liaison with Trump, Blanche said. But, in the end, her role here was immaterial. It doesn\u2019t matter. What I mean by that is, I expect you will learn that Ms Daniels doesn\u2019t have any idea. She doesn\u2019t know anything about the charge, 34 counts in this case. She has no idea what Michael Cohen wrote on the invoice ... her testimony, while salacious, does not matter. As for Stormy Daniels wanting to come forward with her alleged affair with Trump, and his decision to address it, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche defended his doing so, leaning hard into the everyman motif yet again \u2013 that Trump was just a man who wanted to protect his loved ones. It was sinister, and it was an attempt to try to embarrass President Trump, to embarrass his family, because as the people alluded to at that time, there were all kinds of salacious allegations going around about President Trump, and it was damaging to him and it was damaging to his family. Blanche also said: You will hear during this trial President Trump fought back \u2013 like he always does \u2013 like he\u2019s entitled to do to protect his family, his reputation, and his brand \u2013 that is not a crime. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche then downplayed prosecutors\u2019 theory of the case. He said: I have a spoiler alert: there\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to influence an election, it\u2019s called democracy. Prosecutors, he said, \u201cThey put something sinister on this idea, as if it was a crime. You\u2019ll learn: it\u2019s not.\u201d Trump lead lawyer Todd Blanche\u2019s defense opening statement to the jury appears to be that Trump was unaware about the specifics of the hush-money payments because Trump left it all to his ex-lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. Trump had nothing to do with the 34 checks other than to sign them, Blanche says. Trump had nothing to do with generating the checks or the allegedly falsified entries on the Trump Organization ledger, he says. Blanche adds that there\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to influence the 2016 election: \u201cIt\u2019s called democracy.\u201d And that\u2019s the other thrust of Trump\u2019s defense: Entering into a non-disclosure agreement is perfectly legal; companies do that all the time. And now it\u2019s the defense\u2019s turn. Defense attorney Todd Blanche is telling jurors: President Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes. The Manhattan district attorney should never have brought this case. Blanche is trying hard to humanize Trump, while also repeatedly calling him \u201cPresident Trump\u201d. It\u2019s an odd balance to strike \u2013 trying to portray him as a normal guy, but also the former commander-in-chief. President Trump, you\u2019ve seen him, of course, for years and years and years \u2026 He\u2019s, in some ways, larger than life. But he\u2019s also here in this courtroom doing what any of us would do \u2013 defending himself. As for why they\u2019re using \u201cPresident\u201d for a man who\u2019s no longer in the White House? This is a title that he has earned, because he was our 45th president. We will call him President Trump, out of respect for the office that he held from 2017 to 2021. Blanche, shortly thereafter, said: \u201cHe\u2019s also a man, he\u2019s a husband, he\u2019s a father, he\u2019s a person who\u2019s just like you and just like me.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at some of the people who are likely to play a key role in the case. Manhattan DA Matthew Colangelo also used Trump\u2019s purported cheapness as evidence of motive. Michael Cohen paid $130,000 in the Daniels payoff. But, he was ultimately repaid $420,000. Per Colangelo, Cohen and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg had met to discuss how Cohen would get repaid. They added $50,000 to the tab for \u201ctech services\u201d Cohen paid for during the campaign, and then doubled that sum \u201cto account for taxes\u201d. The final amount Trump ultimately paid effectively showed that Trump knew his payoff was wrong. Colangelo said: Donald Trump was a very frugal businessman. He believed in pinching pennies \u2026 He believed in negotiating every bill. With Cohen, Colangelo emphasized, Trump did not hold back money. Donald Trump\u2019s willingness to do so here shows just how important it was to hide the true nature of Cohen\u2019s [payment] to Ms Daniels and the overall election conspiracy they had launched in August of 2015. Manhattan DA Matthew Colangelo said: Look, no politician wants bad press, but the evidence at trial will show that this wasn\u2019t spin or communication strategy. This was a planned, coordinated, long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures \u2013 to silence people with something bad to say about his behavior. He added: It was election fraud, pure and simple. Colangelo said \u201cwe\u2019ll never know\u201d whether this conspiracy made the difference \u201cin a close election\u201d. While Colangelo is sticking to the facts, his word choice is keeping things interesting \u2013 which, admittedly, can be hard in a record about allegedly illicit financial records. Among the entertaining quips was when he described a meeting between Michael Cohen and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg \u2013 who pleaded guilty \u2013 to discuss how his ex-lawyer would be repaid. Neither Trump nor the Trump Organization could just write a check to Cohen for $130,000 with a memo line that said \u2018reimbursement for porn star payoff\u2019 \u2013 they had to disguise the nature of the repayment, so they agreed to cook the books and make it look like the repayment was actually income. \u201cThe campaign went into immediate damage control mode,\u201d Manhattan DA Matthew Colangelo said. The campaign quickly framed it as \u201clocker room talk\u201d, but not action. Hence the danger of Stormy Daniels\u2019 story, which came on to their radar one day after the Access Hollywood tape. The Daniels story showed that his boorish behavior extended to actions, Colangelo told jurors. Colangelo\u2019s narrative is key here. The prosecution is trying to establish that Trump was desperate to keep a lid on damaging info. Colangelo said: Another story about infidelity, with a porn star, on the heels of the access Hollywood tape, would have been devastating to his campaign. Donald Trump has been frowning while Manhattan DA prosecutor Matthew Colangelo tells the jury about Trump\u2019s alleged affair with Stormy Daniels. He has kept his eyes trained downwards on the table. Trump has also occasionally cocked his head to the side while fiddling with papers in front of him. With his brow still furrowed, Trump appears frustrated for the first time as Colangelo reads out part of the infamous Access Hollywood tape to the jury, where he brags about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d \u2013 after which he passes a note to his lawyer Emil Bove. On 7 October 2016, the Washington Post published a video of Donald Trump caught on a hot mic on the set of a television show called Access Hollywood \u2013 \u201che didn\u2019t know he was being taped,\u201d Manhattan district attorney Matthew Colangelo said. Colangelo then read a transcript of Trump\u2019s statement on the hot mic, quoting Trump saying that he could grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d. Colangelo said: Those were Donald Trump\u2019s words, on a video, that was released one month before election day. The prosecution has discussed the various schemes including one involving Karen McDougal, the Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with the married Trump. Manhattan district attorney Matthew Colangelo said that \u201cPecker will also testify that 150,000 was way more than AMI (American Media) would normally pay for this kind of story, but he discussed it with Donald Trump and he discussed it with Michael Cohen, and he agreed on the deal with the understanding what Trump would find a way to pay AMI back.\u201d \u201cThe company coordinated directly with the candidate,\u201d Colangelo also said of AMI. He told jurors that they would hear Trump on tape talking about the deal. Manhattan DA prosecutor Matthew Colangelo sketches out in his opening statement the link between Donald Trump\u2019s alleged falsification of business records and the alleged campaign finance law violation \u2013 which is what would elevate the crimes into felonies. Colangelo tells the jury that Trump\u2019s \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d with David Pecker and the National Enquirer was all geared towards helping the Trump campaign. There were three parts to the conspiracy, he says: An agreement to run positive coverage in the National Enquirer An agreement to attack opponents An agreement to act as the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for the campaign The prosecution\u2019s opening statement has just started. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo says: This case is about a criminal conspiracy and fraud. The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election then, he covered up that conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over, and, over, and over again. Trump \u201cinvited his friend, David Pecker, to a meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan\u201d, he says. Pecker, Cohen, and Trump met \u201cas part of that agreement, Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to an adult film actress named Stormy Daniels ... to silence her, and to make sure the public did not learn about a sexual encounter with the defendant\u201d. The defendant said in his business records that he was paying Cohen for legal services pursuant to a legal agreement but those were lies: there was no retainer agreement Cohen was not paying for legal services, the defendant was paying him back for an illegal payment to Stormy Daniels on the eve of the election \u2026 he wanted to conceal his and others\u2019 criminal conduct. Manhattan district attorney prosecutor Matthew Colangelo has begun his side\u2019s opening statement. He says: This case is about a criminal conspiracy. The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a scheme to corrupt the 2016 election. Then he covered up that scheme by lying in his New York business records, over and over and over again. Donald Trump has a furrowed brow as Judge Merchan reads the jury instructions. He has shifted in his seat \u2013 apparently trying to get comfortable \u2013 initially leaning forward before leaning back. Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove have been expressionless. Susan Necheles appeared to be looking at her notes. Donald Trump is leaning forward in his chair as he listens to Judge Merchan read preliminary jury instructions. It\u2019s going to be an exceptionally busy legal week for Trump: On Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, Trump must sit in New York state criminal court for this trial about falsification of business records to influence the 2016 presidential election; Also on Monday, a New York civil judge is set to hold a hearing to decide whether to cancel Trump\u2019s $175m bond in his civil fraud case; On Thursday, Trump\u2019s legal team will argue before the US supreme court that Trump has presidential immunity and cannot be prosecuted over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. As judge Juan Merchan continued with his instruction to jurors, a brief flicker of humor emerged. Someone in the courtroom sneezed. Merchan paused his reading, said \u201cBless you,\u201d and then continued. A chuckle could be heard here and there. At present, in advance of openings, judge Juan Merchan is instructing jurors on the law. \u201cDefendant is not required to prove that he is not guilty,\u201d Merchan said. The defendant is not required to prove or disprove anything. Prosecutors, he said, have the burden of proof. The jury\u2019s findings, Merchan said, must not \u201cbe influenced in any way bias prejudice sympathy or by a desire to bring an end to your deliberations \u2026\u201d This is all standard in criminal trials, of course \u2013 judges always instruct jurors on reasonable doubt what this metric means. If prosecutors don\u2019t prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, jurors must acquit. If prosecutors do, they must convict. Jurors are looking at Merchan as he addresses them. Donald Trump seems attentive. This reporter has not detected any sleepiness thus far. No cameras are allowed inside the Manhattan courtroom once court is in session, but Donald Trump posed for a few photographs before court got under way this morning. Here\u2019s more on Judge Juan Merchan\u2019s rulings on what prosecutors can bring up if Donald Trump takes the stand. Judge Merchan is handing down his decision about what evidence prosecutors could ask Donald Trump on cross should he take the stand. Prosecutors will be able to ask \u201cthat on September 6, 2023 the defendant was found to have defamed E Jean Carroll in public statements in 2019 by making statements of actual malice\u201d. Prosecutors will also be able to ask about compensatory and punitive damages Carroll received. They can also ask about how Trump was found in New York attorney general Letitia James\u2019s civil case against him \u201cto have by fraudulently misstating the value of his assets for an economic benefit\u201d. Judge Juan Merchan is reading his ruling on the Sandoval hearing, which determines what prosecutors are allowed to ask Donald Trump if he takes the stand \u2013 helping Trump decide whether to do so. Judge Juan Merchan says a juror who expressed concerns is staying on the panel. He says: Juror No 9 is going to remain with us, so that\u2019s not going to be an issue. Judge Juan Merchan has taken the bench and greeted the court: We have a couple of housekeeping matters to take care of before we get started. He asks how long openings will be. Prosecutors said about 40 minutes; defense said about 25. He also informed the court that one juror was having cold feet. My understanding that the juror was concerned about the media attention and wasn\u2019t 100% sure they wanted to be here today. The juror is here today I think we should speak to the juror. Because there\u2019s a courtroom full of people, they will confer with the juror in the robing room. Donald Trump addressed reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom, where he complained about his treatment and once again described himself as a victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on right here should never be happening. It\u2019s a very, very sad day in America,\u201d Trump told reporters. The former president focused much of his remarks on the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and her civil fraud suit against him. James is \u201cthe worst attorney general in the country,\u201d Trump complained. The court is now in session. Opening statements are expected to begin soon. The prosecution will probably try to frame the trial not as a sex scandal, but as another case of Trump\u2019s attempts to interfere with elections. After all, that\u2019s what they argue elevates this case to a felony: the prosecution say Trump falsified business records (normally a misdemeanor) in order to violate US campaign finance law (a federal crime). The defense will be trying to downplay the events as a sordid but forgivable case of trying to hide an affair, which doesn\u2019t rise to the level of a federal crime. They\u2019re also likely to pile on Cohen\u2019s own shady history in order to throw doubt on his claim that he discussed the deal with Trump in the Oval Office in 2017. Trump\u2019s criminal hush-money trial: what to know A guide to Trump\u2019s hush-money trial \u2013 so far The jurors: who is on the Trump trial jury? The key arguments prosecutors will use against Trump How will Trump\u2019s trial work? From Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels: the key players Donald Trump is walking into the courtroom, trailed by a procession of attorneys and paralegals, in advance of opening statements in his hush-money trial. A coterie of photographers has entered the courtroom to snap photos of the ex-president who, in moments, will be the first commander-in-chief, present or former, to face opening statements in a criminal trial. While jury selection last week did mark the commencement of Trump\u2019s hush-money trial, it gains momentum this morning with expected opening statements. Donald Trump\u2019s Manhattan criminal trial in his hush-money case starts in earnest this morning with opening statements that mark a momentous day in US history. Trump is the first American president, former or sitting, to face a criminal trial and the proceedings also play out against a 2024 presidential race in which Trump is almost certain to be the Republican nominee to face Joe Biden. The first week of Trump\u2019s trial was characterized by comedy and, at one point, tragic chaos. Over four days of jury selection, Trump had to listen to his fellow New Yorkers talk about why they could not be fair jurors in his trial. But on Friday afternoon, right as the six alternate jurors were chosen, a man set himself on fire across from the 100 Centre Street courthouse. The man, who succumbed to his injuries, left behind pamphlets and an online screed in which he outlined numerous conspiracy theories that seemed to have little specifically to do with Trump but were more broadly anti-government and anti-tech industry, among other targets. Donald Trump was seen raising a fist to the cameras as he departed Trump Tower to head to Manhattan court this morning. The former president has in the past week addressed the media before heading inside the courtroom ahead of court proceedings, which get under way at about 9.30am ET. Donald Trump has arrived at the Manhattan central courthouse for the opening in earnest of his criminal trial, likely to include opening statements today. The Guardian\u2019s Victoria Bekiempis and Hugo Lowell are at the courthouse. Donald Trump left Trump Tower, waving to assembled press, and is on his way in a motorcade to the Manhattan central courthouse. If there\u2019s enough time in the day (court may wrap around 2pm today because of Passover), the trial could see its first witness. This is expected to be David Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc (AMI), which publishes the National Enquirer. Pecker will be asked about his alleged deals with Trump to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d negative stories by buying them from people and then not publishing them, in order to save Trump the bad publicity before the 2016 election. For example, there\u2019s the Trump Tower doorman who said he heard Trump fathered a child with one of his employees (a story that turned out to be false but the National Enquirer bought anyway, to kill it). And there\u2019s the model Karen McDougal, who said she had a 10-month affair with Trump while his wife, Melania, was pregnant with his son Barron (though the judge has ruled that the prosecution cannot mention that little titbit). AMI paid McDougal $150,000 to stay quiet. In a twist, AMI actually decided not to pay Stormy Daniels for her story, balking at her $120,000 asking price. That\u2019s why it was left to Trump\u2019s fixer Cohen to make the payments ($130,000 in the end) directly to her attorney. History turns on such things. Next up most likely would be opening statements. The prosecution will probably try to frame the trial not as a sex scandal, but as another case of Trump\u2019s attempts to interfere with elections. After all, that\u2019s what they argue elevates this case to a felony: the prosecution say Trump falsified business records (normally a misdemeanour) in order to violate US campaign finance law (a federal crime). Politico also reports that people close to the case say the prosecution will be working hard to \u201crehabilitate the credibility\u201d of Michael Cohen \u2013 Trump\u2019s former fixer, who already served time for his role in the hush-money payments, but who has also previously been found guilty of lying in court. Luckily for them, there is a fair amount of evidence to corroborate Cohen\u2019s central claim: that he paid Stormy Daniels at Trump\u2019s behest. The defense, for their part, will be trying to downplay the events as a sordid but forgivable case of trying to hide an affair, which doesn\u2019t rise to the level of a federal crime. They\u2019ll also likely pile on Cohen\u2019s own shady history in order to throw doubt on his claim that he discussed the deal with Trump in the Oval Office in 2017. Trump himself may or may not testify. The one thing we know he\u2019ll definitely do, however, is pitch the trial every day in the courthouse corridors to anyone who will listen as a \u201cBiden-inspired witch-hunt\u201d \u2013 evidence that he sees two juries: the 12 people in the courthouse and the 160 million-plus American voters, who, let\u2019s remember, could still elect him even if he\u2019s convicted. Likely to come first is what\u2019s known as a \u201cSandoval\u201d decision. Here, the judge rules in advance about what prosecutors are allowed to ask Trump if he takes the stand \u2013 helping Trump decide whether to do so. (He has said he would, but signs indicate he may not.) In this case, prosecutors have asked the judge for several things, such as permission to ask Trump about the two civil fraud trials he just lost: one for defaming E Jean Carroll after she accused him of raping her, which a judge ruled was \u201csubstantially true\u201d, and the other for fradulently inflating the value of his properties. They also want to grill him, among other matters, about criticism from a judge in a different case that Trump didn\u2019t seem to be a truthful witness. Colour us shocked. So: who are those jurors? It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d be interested. So are we. And there is some limited information about them here: But many media outlets seem determined to dox (or reveal the identity and personal information, like addresses) of the jurors. This would probably expose them to threats and abuse from Trump\u2019s legions of fans, even without him telling them to. So curiosity is normal. But given Merchan has unusually decided not to sequester the jury (often standard procedure in such high-profile trials), perhaps it\u2019s best to give these people a little privacy, too. Well, after all the appeals and bombast and tears, it\u2019s finally here: opening statements in the first criminal trial of a US president. Jury selection in the case of the People of the State of New York versus Donald Trump wrapped up last week, though not without some difficulty. Hundreds of prospective jurors were dismissed, several cried and a couple of them quit after they were chosen. But at last Judge Juan Merchan has landed on 18 people (12 jurors and six alternates) living in Manhattan who say they don\u2019t have strong enough opinions about Donald Trump to bias them against the facts. And facts there are aplenty. Prosecutors accuse Trump of falsifying business records in order to cover up an attempt to influence the 2016 election. Specifically, they say he tried right before that election \u2013 at a time when was already facing serious heat because of the Access Hollywood tape, in which he bragged he could sexually assault women because he was famous \u2013 to buy the silence of a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with him 10 years before. Prosecutors say Trump feared yet another sex scandal could sink his election prospects, so he paid her to keep silent about the affair, his coercive behavior in the bedroom, and of course his \u201ctoadstool\u201d. It\u2019s going to be edifying. We\u2019re at the courthouse. Stay with us."

            "date": "2024-04-21T23:01:08Z",
            "content": "Global military expenditure has reached a record high of $2440bn (\u00a31970bn) after the largest annual rise in government spending on arms in over a decade, according to a report. The 6.8% increase between 2022 and 2023 was the steepest since 2009, pushing spending to the highest recorded by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) in its 60-year history. For the first time, analysts at the thinktank recorded a rise in military outlay in all five geographical regions: Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania and the Americas. Nan Tian, a senior researcher with Sipri\u2019s military expenditure and arms production programme, warned of the heightened risk of an unintended conflagration as governments raced to arm. He said: \u201cThe unprecedented rise in military spending is a direct response to the global deterioration in peace and security. \u201cStates are prioritising military strength, but they risk an action-reaction spiral in the increasingly volatile geopolitical and security landscape.\u201d The two largest spenders \u2013 the United States (37%) and China (12%) \u2013 made up around half of global military spending, increasing their expenditure by 2.3% and 6% respectively. The US government spent 9.4% more on \u201cresearch, development, test and evaluation\u201d than in 2022 as Washington sought to stay at the forefront of technological developments. Since 2014, when Russia first invaded Crimea and the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, the US has been shifting its focus from counter-insurgency operations and asymmetric warfare to \u201cdeveloping new weapon systems that could be used in a potential conflict with adversaries with advanced military capabilities\u201d, according to Sipri\u2019s report. While dwarfed by the US in military spending, China, as the world\u2019s second biggest spender, allocated an estimated $296bn in 2023, an increase of 6% on 2022. It has consistently increased defence spending over the past 29 years, although the biggest growth periods were in the 1990s and between 2003 and 2014. The single-digit growth figure of the last year reflected China\u2019s more modest economic performance in recent times, according to Sipri. Russia, India, Saudi Arabia and the UK \u2013 the largest spender in central and western Europe after a 7.9% year-on-year increase \u2013 follow in Sipri\u2019s league table. The Kremlin\u2019s military expenditure in 2023, after a year of full-scale war with Ukraine, was 24% higher than in 2022 and 57% more than in 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea. With spending at 5.9% of GDP, equivalent to 16% of the Russian government\u2019s total expenditure, 2023 marked the highest levels recorded since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Amid growing tensions with China and Pakistan, Indian spending was up by 4.2% from 2022 and by 44% from 2014, reflecting an increase in personnel and operational costs. Sipri\u2019s analysts noted that 75% of India\u2019s capital outlay was on domestically produced equipment, the highest ever ratio, as India progressed towards its goal of becoming self-reliant in arms development and production. Saudi Arabia\u2019s 4.3% rise in spending, to an estimated $75.8bn, or 7.1% of GDP, was said to have been powered by the increased demand for non-Russian oil and rising oil prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Expenditure in the Middle East rose by 9% to an estimated $200bn, making it the region with the highest military spend as a proportion of GDP in the world at 4.2%, followed by Europe (2.8%), Africa (1.9%), Asia and Oceania (1.7%) and the Americas (1.2%). The military expenditure of Israel, second behind Saudi Arabia in the region but ahead of Turkey, grew by 24% to reach $27.5bn, driven mainly by its offensive in Gaza. Iran was the fourth largest military spender in the Middle East. Its spending went up marginally (+0.6%) to $10.3bn. Sipri said the share of total military spending allocated to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had been increasing since at least 2019. Ukraine became the world\u2019s eighth biggest military spender in 2023, with an annual rise of 51% to reach $64.8bn, still only equivalent to 59% of Russia\u2019s military spending that year. Kyiv\u2019s military expenditure increased by 1,270% between 2014 and 2023. The military aid received from over 30 countries is included in Sipri\u2019s figures. The largest percentage increase in military spending by any country in 2023 was by the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (+105%), which has been in a protracted conflict with non-state armed groups, mostly in the east of the country. South Sudan recorded the second largest percentage increase (+78%) amid internal violence. The use of the military to combat organised gangs was said to be a factor in the rise in spending in Central America and the Caribbean, where expenditure was 54% higher in 2023 than in 2014. Spending by the Dominican Republic rose by 14% in response to worsening gang violence in neighbouring Haiti. Expenditure reached $11.8bn in Mexico, a 55% increase from 2014, albeit marginally down on 2022. Allocations to the Guardia Nacional (National Guard) \u2013 a militarised force used to curb criminal activity \u2013 rose from 0.7% of Mexico\u2019s total military expenditure in 2019, when the force was created, to 11% last year. Diego Lopes da Silva, a senior researcher at Sipri, said: \u201cThe use of the military to suppress gang violence has been a growing trend in the region for years as governments are either unable to address the problem using conventional means or prefer immediate \u2013 often more violent \u2013 responses.\u201d"

            "title": "Cuts to England\u2019s cycling and walking budget challenged in court",
            "date": "2024-04-30T16:23:26Z",
            "content": "Swingeing cuts to public spending on cycling and walking in England should be overturned as government expenditure was already insufficient to meet legally binding climate targets, the high court has been told. Campaigners are challenging a decision in 2023 to cut more than \u00a3200m from the Department for Transport\u2019s active travel budget for the following two years. In a judicial review hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice on Tuesday, lawyers for Transport Action Network (Tan) argued that the cuts threatened a key plank of the UK\u2019s carbon reduction strategy. The DfT\u2019s budget for cycling and walking was cut by more than 50% in March last year in a move that was overshadowed by accompanying cuts to the HS2 high-speed rail scheme, announced the same day. Lawyers for Tan argued that the decision was incompatible with the government\u2019s net zero strategy and transport decarbonisation plan, which set out proposals and policies required to meet carbon budgets. The first of the strategic priorities outlined in the plan was to accelerate \u201cmodal shift\u201d from car use to sustainable travel. Accompanying targets included doubling cycling journeys and ensuring more than half of primary school age children walked to school by the middle of this decade. David Forsdick KC, representing Tan, said in written arguments that the DfT had decided not to cut funding which was \u201ccentral to achieving the objectives for active travel, was important for equality ambitions, for air quality targets and for delivery confidence in meeting carbon targets, and had a very high cost-benefit ratio\u201d. The barrister said that \u201cimmediately prior\u201d to the March 2023 decision, the Treasury and No 10 required the transport secretary, Mark Harper, \u201cto impose \u2018additional savings\u2019\u201d. Forsdick said: \u201cThis appears to explain, at least in part, the illegalities in the decision.\u201d In November 2023, a critical public accounts committee report found that the DfT had made little progress against its objectives to increase active travel, and was not on track to meet its 2025 targets. Although Dame Bernadette Kelly, the DfT\u2019s permanent secretary, told the committee hearings that she \u201cwould not identify funding as the key issue\u201d in missing targets, Tan claims that the money allocated was already inadequate to meet the climate pledges. Tan\u2019s lawyers also claim that the funding decision last March was only made after an 11th-hour intervention from the Treasury that did not allow time for proper consideration. They also argue that the move failed to take into account air quality considerations. The DfT has told the court that none of the grounds has any substantive merit and that the claim should be dismissed. The government said it had invested more than \u00a3850m in active travel in 2020-21 and 2022-23. A judgment is expected to be delivered in the weeks following Tuesday\u2019s hearing. A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cThis government is doing more than any other to promote walking and cycling, investing over \u00a33bn into active travel during this parliament up to 2025. We await the verdict and will respond fully once received.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-09T20:04:01Z",
            "content": "Arizona\u2019s supreme court ruled to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect. The justices said Arizona could enforce a 1864 near-total abortion ban that went unenforced for decades after the US supreme court legalized abortion nationwide in the 1973 decision Roe v Wade. Arizona governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, said Tuesday was a \u201cdark day\u201d for the state and implored abortion rights supporters to make their voices heard in November. Joe Biden criticized the Arizona supreme court ruling, blaming \u201cthe extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women\u2019s freedom\u201d and calling the ban \u201ccruel\u201d. Kamala Harris, in response to the ruling by the Arizona supreme court, said the state had \u201crolled back the clock to a time before women could vote\u201d, and said Donald Trump was resopnsible for the ruling. Harris will travel to Arizona on Friday. Secretary of state Antony Blinken and his UK counterpart, foreign secretary David Cameron, urged Congress to approve new military aid for Ukraine after talks in Washington during a joint press conference following talks in Washington on Tuesday. Blinken said the supplemental budget request that the president has made of Congress is \u201curgent\u201d and should be taken to a vote \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d. Victory for Ukraine is \u201cvital for American and European security\u201d, Cameron said. Cameron also met with Trump over dinner on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate. During the briefing with Blinken, Cameron defended the meeting as a standard encounter with an opposition figure and said it covered a number of pressing global issues but did not elaborate. \u201cThese things are entirely proper,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s campaign said the former president and Cameron discussed the Ukraine war and \u201cthe need for Nato countries to meet their defense spending requirements\u201d. Defense secretary Lloyd Austin said the US has seen \u201cno evidence\u201d that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Austin addressed a Senate armed services committee during a budget hearing and was interrupted several times by protesters calling for the US to stop funding Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A New York appeals court judge rejected the latest bid by Trump to delay his 15 April trial on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to an adult film star. Republican far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated her threat to oust Mike Johnson, issuing a searing indictment of the House speaker in a letter explaining her decision to file a motion to oust him. Kamala Harris will travel to Arizona on Friday just days after the state\u2019s supreme court upheld a near-total abortion ban. The vice president\u2019s trip to Arizona, her second this year, was already in the works prior to Tuesday\u2019s court decision and will likely take on a heightened focus on abortion rights and access, Politico reported. The White House said Harris will use her visit \u201cto continue her leadership in the fight for reproductive freedoms\u201d. Fifteen prominent historians filed an amicus brief with the supreme court, rejecting Donald Trump\u2019s claim in his federal election subversion case that he is immune to criminal prosecution for acts committed as president. Authorities cited in the document include the founders Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Adams, in addition to the historians\u2019 own work. Trump, the historians said, \u201casserts that a doctrine of permanent immunity from criminal liability for a president\u2019s official acts, while not expressly provided by the constitution, must be inferred. To justify this radical assertion, he contends that the original meaning of the constitution demands it. But no plausible historical case supports his claim. Despite widespread legal and historical opinion that Trump\u2019s immunity claim is groundless, the supreme court, to which Trump appointed three justices, will consider the claim. Oral arguments are scheduled for 25 April. The court recently dismissed attempts, supported by leading historians, to remove Trump from ballots under the 14th amendment, passed after the civil war to bar insurrectionists from office. As we reported earlier, defense secretary Lloyd Austin told the Senate earlier today that the US government has seen \u201cno evidence\u201d that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Austin addressed a Senate armed services committee during a budget hearing and was interrupted several times by protesters calling for the US to stop funding Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The UK also confirmed in meetings with US counterparts that there would be no changes to arms exports to Israel, although it would be kept under review. Here\u2019s the clip: Louisiana\u2019s Republican-controlled senate advanced a bill on Monday that would empower state and local law enforcement to arrest and jail people in the state who entered the US illegally, similar to embattled legislation in Texas. Amid national fights between Republican states and Joe Biden over how and who should enforce the US-Mexico border, Louisiana joins a growing list of legislatures seeking to expand states\u2019 authority over border enforcement. Proponents of the bill, such as the legislation\u2019s author, GOP state senator Valarie Hodges, say Louisiana has the \u201cright to defend our nation\u201d. Hodges has accused the federal government of neglecting responsibilities to enforce immigration law, an argument heard from GOP leaders across the country. Opponents argue the bill is unconstitutional, will not do anything to make the state safer, and will only fuel negative and false rhetoric directed toward migrants. Across the nation, reliably red legislatures have advanced tougher immigration enforcement measures. The Oklahoma house passed a bill that would prohibit state revenue from being used to provide benefits to those living in the state illegally. A bill in Tennessee, which is awaiting the governor\u2019s signature, would require law enforcement agencies in the state to communicate with federal immigration authorities if they discover people who are in the country illegally. Measures that mirror parts of the Texas law are awaiting the governor\u2019s signature in Iowa, while another is pending in Idaho\u2019s statehouse. Lawmakers and climate advocates called on utilities to \u201cditch the American Gas Association\u201d at a press conference at the US Capitol on Tuesday. \u201cAmericans are already paying the price of climate change,\u201d said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. They shouldn\u2019t have to pay the salaries of those who are fueling it. A trade association representing more than 200 US utilities, the AGA has a well-documented history of lobbying against climate regulations and policies \u2013 activity funded in part by members\u2019 ratepayers\u2019 utility bills. It\u2019s a \u201cdirty game,\u201d said Xavier Boatwright of the Sierra Club. Both the event and a protest outside the AGA\u2019s headquarters earlier Tuesday were led by the anti-gas nonprofit organization the Gas Leaks Project. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing natural about natural gas,\u201d said the group\u2019s senior communications director Maria Luisa Cesar. The extraction and use of gas, called natural gas by industry interests, emits planet-heating and toxic pollution. Reports show the AGA has been aware of these dangers for 50 years, but has continued to undercut climate efforts. Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse said: The fossil fuel industry depends in roughly equal parts on hydrocarbons and lies. In August, the New England utility Eversource cut ties with the American Gas Association. Advocates are calling on other utilities to follow its lead. Four states have also passed legislation to prevent the use of ratepayer dollars to fund political activity. Also in Arizona, Eva Burch, a Democratic state lawmaker who drew national attention after announcing her decision to seek an abortion earlier this month, said today\u2019s court decision to enforce a ban - using a law that was originally drafted in the 19th Century before women could vote and before Arizona was a state - would have devastating consequences for women such as her. \u201cA couple of weeks ago I had an abortion \u2013 a safe legal abortion here in Arizona for a pregnancy that I very much wanted,\u201d Burch said. Somebody gave me a procedure so that I wouldn\u2019t have to experience another miscarriage \u2013 the pain, the mess, the discomfort. And now we\u2019re talking about whether or not we should put that doctor in jail. This is outrageous. Burch predicted the ruling would backfire on conservatives who have fought to allow the ban to be enforced. \u201cThe people of Arizona have had enough,\u201d Burch said. We are electing pro-choice candidates in November. Watch it happen. Kamala Harris has responded to a ruling by the Arizona supreme court to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect, saying the state had \u201crolled back the clock to a time before women could vote\u201d. In a statement, the vice president said there was \u201cone person responsible\u201d for the ruling, which will allow a law first passed in 1864 to go into effect, \u201cby his own admission \u2026 Donald Trump\u201d. Harris said the \u201cextreme and dangerous\u201d ban criminalizes almost all abortion care in the state and \u201cputs women\u2019s lives at risk\u201d, adding: It\u2019s a reality because of Donald Trump, who brags about being \u2018proudly the person responsible\u2019 for overturning Roe v. Wade, and made it possible for states to enforce cruel bans. She added: The alarm is sounding for every woman in America: if he has the opportunity, Donald Trump would sign off on a national abortion ban. He has called for punishing women and doctors. If he wins, he and his allies have plans to ban abortion and restrict access to birth control, with or without Congress. Arizona governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, called today\u2019s news from the state\u2019s supreme court on an abortion ban a \u201cdark day\u201d for the state and implored abortion rights supporters to make their voices heard in November. Hobbs vowed to do everything in her power to preserve access to reproductive care and contraception in the state, pointing to actions she has already taken. After winning the election in 2022, Hobbs last year issued a sweeping executive order banning county attorneys from prosecuting women who seek abortions and doctors who perform them. Asked about the possibility that her directive could be challenged in court, Hobbs said: \u201cBring it on.\u201d At the news conference, held moments after the state supreme court released its decision, Hobbs called on the Republican-led state legislature to \u201cimmediately\u201d repeal the ban. But the legislature is unlikely to do so. The leaders of both chambers joined anti-abortion activists in favor of allowing the territorial-era ban to take effect. \u201cThe legislature has ignored the will of the voters on this issue for decades,\u201d she said. The ballot box is the way that voters can have their say and overrule the legislature on this issue that the vast majority of Arizonans support. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, just said that US government agencies were still involved in an \u201cinformal review\u201d of the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 review of the killing by the Israeli military of seven aid workers with the group World Central Kitchen in Gaza earlier this month. Sullivan said that the CIA director, Bill Burns, was involved in further talks in Cairo in Egypt at the weekend, where states such as the US and Qatar are trying to broker a ceasefire in Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and the return of the remaining hostages held by Hamas since the massacre it perpetrated in southern Israel last 7 October. Sullivan said the US \u201chas seen Israel take some steps forward\u201d in the talks, while the latest statements from Hamas were regarded as \u201cless than encouraging\u201d. He said more humanitarian aid was reaching Gaza, which he said was \u201cgood, but not good enough\u201d, amid Israel\u2019s blockade and siege of the Palestinian territory. And amid Israel pulling troops out of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, in a pause in its offensive actions, Sullivan said the US has still not seen \u201ca credible and executable\u201d plan from Israel about what it would do to move or protect Palestinians in the event that, as it has pledged to do, it invades Rafah. Joe Biden has just arrived back at the White House after a very short trip to Washington\u2019s main Union Station rail hub, to deliver remarks about healthcare. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was originally due to brief the media at 1.30pm in the regular daily session in the west wing, but obviously everything is being pushed back because the president\u2019s schedule shifted later than originally expected, also. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will join the briefing. It\u2019s getting underway now. We\u2019ll bring you highlights from the briefing. There has been a lot of international-facing news today, especially with the latest on high-level talks in the Middle East about Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and US secretary of state Antony Blinken and the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron meeting in Washington, DC, and urging the US Congress to approve new military aid for Ukraine. Joe Biden has criticized the Arizona supreme court ruling from earlier today to let an old law on the books banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect \u2013 albeit with a 14-day delay to allow further legal challenges before it does. The US president blamed \u201cthe extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women\u2019s freedom\u201d and called the ban \u201ccruel\u201d. In a statement issued from the White House moments ago, Biden said: \u201cMillions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest. This cruel ban was first enacted in 1864 \u2013 more than 150 years ago, before Arizona was even a state and well before women had secured the right to vote.\u201d The statement ended with: \u201cVice-President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman\u2019s right to choose. We will continue to fight to protect reproductive rights and call on Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v Wade for women in every state.\u201d Kamala Harris has taken a strong lead in recent months on efforts by the Biden administration and the Biden-Harris re-election campaign to win support for protecting reproductive rights. This follows, in particular, the landmark overturning of the federal right to abortion by the conservative-dominated supreme court in 2022 and further attacks on rights ranging from abortion pills to contraception to IVF by the hard right. The Arizona supreme court ruled on Tuesday to let a law banning almost all abortions in the state go into effect, a decision that could curtail abortion access in the US south-west and could make Arizona one of the biggest battlefields in the 2024 electoral fight over abortion rights. The justices said Arizona could enforce a 1864 near-total abortion ban, first passed before Arizona became a state, that went unenforced for decades after the US supreme court legalized abortion nationwide in the 1973 decision Roe v Wade. However, the justices also ruled to hold off on requiring the state to enforce the ban for 14 days, in order to allow advocates to ask a lower court to pause it again. The ban can only be enforced \u201cprospectively\u201d, according to the 4-2 ruling. Minutes after the ruling Kris Mayes, Arizona\u2019s Democratic attorney general, vowed not to prosecute any doctors or women under the 1864 ban. You can read the full story here. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, urged Congress to approve new military aid for Ukraine after talks in Washington. Blinken and Cameron held a joint press conference where the US secretary of state said the stalled Ukraine funding is critical for US, European and world security. The supplemental budget request that Joe Biden has made of Congress is \u201curgent\u201d and should be taken to a vote \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d, Blinken said. Victory for Ukraine is \u201cvital for American and European security\u201d, Cameron said. Cameron also met with Donald Trump over dinner on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate. During the briefing with Blinken, Cameron defended the meeting as a standard encounter with an opposition figure and said it covered a number of pressing global issues but did not elaborate. \u201cThese things are entirely proper,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s campaign said the former president and Cameron discussed the Ukraine war and \u201cthe need for Nato countries to meet their defense spending requirements\u201d. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, told a Senate armed services committee hearing that the US has seen no evidence that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. A New York appeals court judge rejected the latest bid by Trump to delay his 15 April trial on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to an adult film star. Republican far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated her threat to oust Mike Johnson, issuing a searing indictment of the House speaker in a letter explaining her decision to file a motion to oust him. There\u2019s a key US Senate race in Ohio this year, where the incumbent leftwing Democrat, Sherrod Brown, is expected to face a tough challenge from Bernie Moreno, a car dealer turned Trump-backed populist firebrand. Like many Trump-backed candidates, Moreno is making it his business to blame China for woes affecting blue-collar workers. Earlier this year, he went so far as to tell a conservative radio host: \u201cThe Buick Envision was made in China, I told General Motors I wouldn\u2019t sell one of them, don\u2019t even ship it to me.\u201d The problem about the claim, which Moreno has made elsewhere, is that as Spectrum News reports \u2026 \u201cMoreno\u2019s dealership did sell the Chinese-made SUVs for several years, and even promoted the vehicles on social media, according to numerous social media posts.\u201d After detailing such posts, Spectrum adds: \u201cGM, the parent company of Buick, confirmed to Spectrum News the Envision was only manufactured in China. The SUV became the first Chinese-made vehicle to be imported by a major US automaker when it debuted in Michigan in 2016. The imports were called a \u201cslap in the face\u201d by the United Auto Workers union, which felt the vehicles should be made on US soil by American workers. A spokesperson for Moreno, Reagan McCarthy, told Spectrum: \u201cIn response to the closure of the Lordstown Plant here in Ohio [in March 2019], Bernie made a decision to stop any new inventory of Envision\u2019s [sic] from being sold at his dealership. After he sold off the inventory he already had on the lot, he refused to take orders for more Envisions. There is zero contradiction here.\u201d There are contradictions elsewhere in Moreno\u2019s campaign statements, though, as the Guardian discussed here: A New York appeals court judge has rejected the latest bid by Donald Trump to delay his 15 April trial on criminal charges stemming from hush money paid to an adult film star. Trump\u2019s lawyers had requested the trial to be postponed indefinitely while he appeals a gag order that bars him from commenting about jurors, witnesses and others connected to the case. Trump\u2019s attorneys argue that Justice Juan Merchan\u2019s order restricting his public comments is an unconstitutional prior restraint on his free speech rights while he campaigns for president. Merchan imposed the order last month after finding Trump made statements in various legal cases that the judge called \u201cthreatening, inflammatory\u201d and \u201cdenigrating\u201d. During the hearing on Tuesday, Trump\u2019s lawyer Emil Bove said: The First amendment harms arising from this gag order right now are irreparable. Justice Cynthia Kern issued the order following a Tuesday morning hearing, but a full panel of appeals judges will later consider the former president\u2019s underlying challenge to the gag order. Austin, asked what the consequences of a deadly mass famine in Gaza would be, said: It will accelerate violence, and it will have the effect of ensuring that there\u2019s a long-term conflict. Addressing the Senate armed services committee, the defense secretary added: It doesn\u2019t have to happen ... We should continue to do everything we can, and we are doing this, to encourage the Israelis to provide humanitarian assistance. The defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, speaking during a Senate armed services committee hearing, said pressure on Israel to improve humanitarian aid to Gaza appears to be working, but that more must be done. Austin said: It clearly had an effect. We have seen changes in behavior, and we have seen more humanitarian assistance being pushed into Gaza. Hopefully that trend will continue. During the meeting, a number of senators decried the civilian casualties in Gaza and called on the administration to press Israel to protect the population in the Palestinian territory. Austin said he spoke with his Israeli counterpart, the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, on Monday and that he repeated US insistence that Israel must move civilians out of the battle space in Gaza and properly care for them. The US has seen no evidence that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said. Austin, addressing a Senate armed services committee during a budget hearing today, said: We don\u2019t have any evidence of genocide being created. He also avoided referring to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October as a genocide, calling it a \u201chorrific terrorist attack\u201d and \u201ccertainly \u2026 a war crime\u201d. Austin\u2019s testimony was interrupted several times by protesters calling for the US to stop funding the war. Cameron was asked if Donald Trump gave any assurance that the US would remain a Nato member if he is re-elected to the White House. The UK foreign secretary says he won\u2019t go into what he said during his dinner with Trump, but that he has argued consistently for getting Nato in its strongest possible shape and getting all of its members to meet the alliance\u2019s target of spending 2% of GDP on defense this year. He says the best things Nato can do is to keep the Ukrainians in this fight, and that he will \u201cmake that argument to anyone who will listen\u201d. He says supporting Ukraine is \u201cextremely good value for money\u201d for the US and its allies. For like 5 or 10% of your defense budget, almost half of Russia\u2019s prewar military equipment has been destroyed, without the loss of a single American life. This is an investment in United States\u2019 security. Cameron says that the UK\u2019s position on arms sales to Israel remains \u201cunchanged\u201d after the latest assessment of the government\u2019s legal advice. He says Israel remains a \u201cvital\u201d defensive security partner to the UK. Cameron is asked why he is not meeting with the US House speaker, Mike Johnson, during his visit to Washington. The UK foreign secretary says he has a range of meetings with senators and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, and that he does \u201cwith great trepidation\u201d. Cameron says: It\u2019s not for foreign politicians to tell legislators in another countries what to do. It\u2019s just that I am passionate about the importance of defending Ukraine against this aggression, that I think it is up to the interests of US security that Putin fails in his illegal invasion. Cameron says there will be people in Tehran, Pyongyang and Beijing looking at how the US and UK stand by its allies. So I\u2019m here to offer my opinion and to meet with anyone who wants to talk to me about it to make those arguments. He says he\u2019s \u201cdelighted\u201d to have these meetings this afternoon and tomorrow, and that he will make time for anyone in Congress who would welcome a conversation. Blinken says the US is working \u201c24/7\u201d with Qatar, Egypt and Israel on reaching a ceasefire and hostage-release agreement. He says there is a \u201cvery serious\u201d offer for Hamas on the table that \u201cshould be accepted\u201d, adding that he believes that the fact that Hamas has not said yes \u201cis a reflection of what it really thinks about the people of Gaza \u2013 which is not much at all\u201d. The ball is in Hamas\u2019s court. The world is watching to see what it does. Cameron, asked about his meeting with Donald Trump on Monday, says it was an \u201centirely proper\u201d meeting that was in line with precedent of UK ministers speaking with opposition politicians in the run-up to elections. The UK foreign secretary says it was a \u201cprivate\u201d meeting and that he and Trump \u201cdiscussed a range of important geopolitical subjects\u201d. Blinken, responding to a reporter\u2019s question, says the US does not have a day for a potential Israeli operation in Rafah in southern Gaza. He says Joe Biden has been very clear with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about the US\u2019s deep concerns about Israel\u2019s ability to conduct a major military operation that would do real harm to civilians. Blinken says he expects that he will see Israeli colleagues again next week for further talks. Cameron, reiterating Blinken\u2019s comments, says the UK and US want to see 500 trucks carrying humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza. The UK foreign secretary calls on the water in Gaza to be switched back on, the Ashdod port and a northern crossing point to be opened, and for aid to reach across Gaza. David Cameron starts his remarks off by saying that there is no closer alliance for the UK than its partnership with the US. \u201cIn a time of danger like this international affairs, close alliances really matter,\u201d the UK foreign secretary says. In terms of support for Ukraine, Cameron says: We know what they need, and we know what is right for us. We know that if we give the Ukrainians the support they deserve, they can win this war. Citing the Ukrainian foreign minister, Cameron says Ukraine needs air defenses, ammunition and money. He says it is important to send a clear message to all those around the world, including China, that the US and UK stands by its allies. Cameron says: Nothing is more important than the supplemental request the Congress is looking at the moment. I come here with no intention to lecture anybody or tell anybody what to do or get in the way of the process of politics. I just come here as a great friend and believer in this country and a believer that it\u2019s profoundly in your interest, and your security, and your future, and the future for all your partners to release this money and let it through. Blinken speaks about the Middle East \u2013 he says Israel has made \u201cimportant commitments\u201d to significantly increase the supply of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza, and that it is taking some \u201cinitial actions to move on those commitments\u201d. \u201cBut what matters is results and sustained results,\u201d the secretary of state says, noting that the US \u201cwill be looking very carefully in the days ahead\u201d that assistance is distributed effectively in Gaza, including that it gets to the north of Gaza. The US continues to work closely with Israel, Egypt and Qatar to reach an agreement for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, Blinken says. Blinken says it is \u201cimperative\u201d now that the House is back in session to get a vote on Ukraine aid \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d. The supplemental budget request that President Biden has made to Congress is \u201curgent\u201d, he says. Blinken says there has been genuine burden-sharing among the US and European and international allies in terms of support for Ukraine. \u201cWe need to continue to do our part,\u201d he says. Antony Blinken begins the news conference by saying he and Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, David Cameron, reaffirmed the imperative of continuing to support and help Ukraine defend itself against the ongoing Russian aggression. The secretary of state says the UK has been an \u201cextraordinary leader\u201d in the effort to support Ukraine from day one, including by imposing sanctions and export controls on Russia. Blinken says he and Cameron discussed ways to strengthen efforts to prevent the transfer of weapons and materials to Russia for use in Ukraine. \u201cThis is an ongoing challenge,\u201d he says. We see weapons and technologies to support the defense industrial base in Russia coming from North Korea from Iran from China. This is an area of particular concern for not only the United States and the United Kingdom, but many of our allies and partners throughout Europe. Donald Trump and David Cameron discussed \u201cthe need for Nato countries to meet their defense spending requirements\u201d during a dinner at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday, Trump\u2019s campaign said in a statement. The pair discussed \u201cthe upcoming US and UK elections, policy matters specific to Brexit, the need for Nato countries to meet their defense spending requirements, and ending the killing in Ukraine,\u201d the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s campaign said. The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, are due to hold a joint press conference at 11:15am ET following talks in Washington about support for Ukraine and bringing stability to the Middle East. Cameron also met with Donald Trump ahead of his meeting with Blinken in an attempt to persuade the presumptive Republican presidential candidate to drop his opposition to a new package of aid for Ukraine that is being held up in Congress partly on Trump\u2019s instruction. Though it is called \u201cnatural gas\u201d by industry interests, gas is primarily made of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more planet-warming in the short term that has also been linked to asthma and other health risks. \u201cThere is no such thing as clean methane gas,\u201d Caleb Heeringa of the Gas Leaks Project shouted at a protest in Washington DC to demand that gas utilities stop using ratepayer dollars to fund their political agendas. Attendees included actors from the Gas Leak Project\u2019s recently launched Hot &amp; Toxic campaign, a faux reality show which parodies the marketing of gas stoves. Dressed in brightly colored outfits, they cheered when protesters mentioned pollutants such as carbon monoxide and benzene and pretended to try and snatch the banner away. Authorities quickly asked the protesters to vacate the American Gas Association\u2019s premises, so they relocated in front of the Capitol building. The Gas Leaks project on Tuesday also launched DitchTheAGA.com, a website allowing viewers to determine if their utility is a member of the American Gas Association. If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d, users can also easily email their local officials to demand that the utility cut ties. At noon, the group will hold a press conference with Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Protesters gathered in Washington DC on Tuesday to demand that gas utilities stop using ratepayer dollars to fund their political agendas. The demonstration took place outside the headquarters of the lobbying organization the American Gas Association, which represents nearly every gas utility in the country. \u201cWe won\u2019t pay for the AGA,\u201d protesters cried. The trade group, funded in part by utility bills paid to its members, has come under fire for successfully working to strip decarbonization measures from building codes and lobbying against an array of climate-friendly policies. The protesters, convened by the anti-gas nonprofit The Gas Leaks Project, held a banner that said Ditch the AGA and signs that said \u201cAmerican Gaslighting Association\u201d. David Cameron is scheduled to hold talks with the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Washington on Tuesday. Although they have much to discuss covering the future of Nato, China and a possible ceasefire in Gaza, the foreign secretary\u2019s key goal is to shift Republican thinking in Congress on the relevance of the threat posed by Russia to American interests. A steady stream of European politicians have travelled to Washington on similar missions, only to return frustrated at the growing US indifference to Ukraine\u2019s fate. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, has so far declined to allow the Ukraine aid issue onto the floor of the Congress, but has indicated he might do so next week when Congress returns from recess. In February, the speaker refused to consider a Senate-passed foreign aid package that would have included $60bn for Ukraine because it lacked measures relating to security on the US-Mexico border. A key test for Cameron\u2019s trip is whether he gains meetings with the swing Republican congressmen including Johnson. At present no meeting with Johnson is slated for Tuesday. Talks will also focus on the Middle East, with the foreign secretary expected to set out the UK\u2019s reasoning for not suspending arms sales to Israel. The risk is that past bad blood between David Cameron and Donald Trump over issues such as Brexit have poisoned the well, and Cameron, for all his persuasive skills, is not the British political leader most likely to make Trump change his mind and drop his opposition to a new Ukraine aid package. Trump has said he can negotiate a peace deal on Ukraine in 24 hours. His allies say the deal will involve ceding Crimea and the Donbas region to Russia, formalizing the land grab that Vladimir Putin started in 2014 and continued with the full-scale invasion in 2022. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Sunday that Ukraine would lose the war if US aid was withheld and Ukrainian air cover not improved. \u201cSuccess for Ukraine and failure for [Vladimir] Putin are vital for American and European security,\u201d Cameron said before his trip. This will show that borders matter, that aggression doesn\u2019t pay and that countries like Ukraine are free to choose their own future. The alternative would only encourage Putin in further attempts to redraw European borders by force, and would be heard clearly in Beijing, Tehran and North Korea. Earlier this year, he warned Congress not to show \u201cthe weakness displayed against Hitler\u201d in the 1930s. Cameron is also arguing that Ukraine has shown time and again that if it is given the resources it can succeed and would be ready to \u201cgo on the offensive\u201d in 2025. Aware that Trump believes Europe does not pull its weight in defending itself, Cameron is armed with statistics to show more than $184bn (\u00a3145bn) has already been committed to Ukraine by European nations including more than $15bn (nearly \u00a312bn) from the UK. The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, has taken the unusual and potentially risky step of travelling to see Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida before a visit to Washington DC on Tuesday. Cameron was hoping to persuade the presumptive Republican presidential candidate to drop his opposition to a new package of aid for Ukraine that is being held up in Congress partly on Trump\u2019s instruction. It is Cameron\u2019s second visit to the US to try to convince Republicans that it is in America\u2019s national interest for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, not to make any further military advances in Ukraine. In a statement on Monday, a UK Foreign Office spokesperson played down the rarity of a Conservative foreign secretary trying to persuade a Republican not to make concessions to Russia over the future of Europe. The Foreign Office said it was \u201cstandard practice for ministers to meet opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement\u201d. Although Conservative politicians have met Trump, as has his great ally Nigel Farage, Monday\u2019s meeting was the first between a senior UK minister and Trump since he left office insisting that the presidential election had been stolen from him. Ken Buck was one of eight Republicans who voted to eject the previous speaker, Kevin McCarthy, last October. But Buck quit Congress in protest of his party\u2019s domination by Trump supporters. Speaking to CNN on Monday, Buck dismissed McCarthy\u2019s contention that Marjorie Taylor Greene is \u201ca very serious legislator that deals with policy\u201d, saying: So many of the statements that Marjorie has made over the years are completely irresponsible. The idea that somehow the speaker [Johnson] is corrupt because he believes that we should be supporting an ally that has been invaded by a war criminal, [Russian leader] Vladimir Putin, and the idea that somehow anybody who is in agreement with Ukraine and our Nato allies is corrupt, it\u2019s just another distraction that she uses to take away from the core arguments that are so important. Marjorie Taylor Greene is ungovernable and should be known as \u201cMoscow Marjorie\u201d, said a former House Republican colleague, accusing the far-right Georgia congresswoman of \u201cgetting her talking points from the Kremlin\u201d when opposing new federal aid for Ukraine. Ken Buck, a Colorado rightwinger who left Congress last month, told CNN: My experience with Marjorie is people have talked to her about not filing articles of impeachment on President Biden before he was sworn into office, not filing articles of impeachment that were groundless based on other individuals in the Biden administration. She was never moved by that. She was always focused on her social media account. And \u2018Moscow Marjorie\u2019 is focused now on this Ukraine issue and getting her talking points from the Kremlin and making sure she is popular and she is getting a lot of coverage. In the letter sent to colleagues this morning, Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene laid into Mike Johnson with a point-by-point takedown of his record as speaker. She ticked through the instances that Johnson has negotiated with Democrats on major legislation, including a $1.2tn spending bill last month that averted a government shutdown and prompted Greene to file a motion to move the speaker. At the time, she said the move was meant as \u201cmore of a warning than a pink slip\u201d because she did not want to \u201cthrow the House into chaos\u201d. But in her memo, Greene wrote that Johnson\u2019s actions have been \u201ca complete and total surrender to, if not complete and total lockstep with, the Democrats\u2019 agenda that has angered our Republican base\u201d, adding: If we win the House this fall, it will only be because President Trump is on the ballot, not because we have earned it. For his part, Johnson has tried to downplay Majorie Taylor Greene\u2019s threat and attempted to ease tensions. Johnson and Greene exchanged text messages over the two-week Easter recess, and the pair was supposed to speak on Friday but the plan fell through, the Hill reported, citing a source. In a statement last week, the House speaker said: I respect Marjorie. She will always have an open door to the speaker\u2019s office. We do have honest differences on strategy sometimes but share the same conservative beliefs. Republican Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated her threat to oust Mike Johnson, issuing a searing indictment of the House speaker in a letter explaining her decision to file a motion to oust him. In the five-page memo sent to her Republican colleagues on Tuesday morning, Greene laid out a detailed case against the speaker, accusing Johnson of failing to deliver on promises he ran on and breaking legislative procedural rules. Johnson is \u201cthrowing our own razor-thin majority into chaos by not serving his own GOP conference that elected him\u201d, Greene wrote. With so much at stake for our future and the future of our children, I will not tolerate this type of Republican \u2018leadership\u2019. This has been a complete and total surrender to, if not complete and total lockstep with, the Democrats\u2019 agenda that has angered our Republican base so much and given them very little reason to vote for a Republican House majority. Greene quoted the seven \u201ckey priorities\u201d Johnson laid out when running for the speakership in October, and said he had \u201cnot lived up to a single one of his self-imposed tenets\u201d. Greene has not said if or when she plans to force a floor vote on Johnson\u2019s removal, calling it a \u201cwarning\u201d and noting it would be a \u201crolling issue\u201d, but the letter marks her first direct pitch to her GOP colleagues to join her push to oust the speaker. Some centrist Democrats have already indicated they will not allow Greene to let the chamber descend into chaos, especially if she forces the motion to vacate vote over the issue of Ukraine funding. Congressman Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat of Florida, posted to Twitter/X last month: I do not support Speaker Johnson but I will never stand by and let [Greene] \u2026 take over the people\u2019s House. The House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, previously told the New York Times that he expected \u201ca reasonable number\u201d of his caucus members would come to Johnson\u2019s assistance if his speakership was imperiled because of a vote on Ukraine aid. But one of the leading House progressives, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, has argued that Democrats\u2019 support for Johnson should come with some legislative strings attached. Ocasio-Cortez recently told CNN: My vote would most likely be for a Speaker Jeffries, which becomes an increasingly likely reality day after day as Republicans pursue further midterm resignation. But I think, for those of us and for any Democrat inclined, I don\u2019t think we do that for free. While Johnson weighs his legislative options to approve more money for Ukraine, the specter of the motion to vacate looms in the background. If congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia follows through on her threat to force a vote on Johnson\u2019s removal, the House must take up the matter within two legislative days. Johnson will then need the support of a majority of members to keep his job, and because of a recent string of Republican resignations, he can only afford to lose two votes within his conference. As of now, few Republicans appear eager to revisit the spectacle of last fall, when the conference\u2019s repeated failures to elect a new speaker ground the House to a complete halt for weeks. Even as Johnson faces a challenge from the hard-right flank of his conference, other House Republicans insist the chamber must take action to assist Ukraine. They warn that further inaction, after months of ignoring the White House\u2019s demands to approve more funding, will only embolden the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Congressman Mike Turner, the Republican chair of the House intelligence committee, told CBS News last Sunday: We are at a critical juncture on the ground that is beginning to be able to impact not only morale of the Ukrainians that are fighting, but also their ability to fight. Putin knows this. This is obviously an area where we cannot allow Putin to win. Johnson already has two legislative options to approve more money for Ukraine, the Senate-approved package and a smaller $66bn bill introduced by a bipartisan group of House members. The second proposal would provide military-only funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, omitting the $10bn for humanitarian aid included in the Senate bill. The House legislation also outlines a number of border security provisions, a bid to sway some Republican members who are otherwise wary of sending more money to Kyiv. Congressman Mike Lawler, a Republican of New York and one of the House bill\u2019s co-sponsors, told CNN last Sunday: I am hopeful that the speaker will put the bill on the floor or an amended version of the bill on the floor so that we can once and for all ensure that our allies have the aid and support that they need. As the House adjourned last month, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, vowed that the chamber would soon \u201ctake the necessary steps to address the supplemental funding request\u201d, which includes money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The Senate passed a $95bn foreign aid package in February, but Johnson indicated that the House would consider an amended proposal when members return to Washington. Johnson told Fox News last Sunday: We\u2019ve been talking to all the members, especially now over the district work period. When we return after this work period, we\u2019ll be moving a product, but it\u2019s going to, I think, have some important innovations. Those innovations might include sending money to Kyiv as a loan or redirecting Russian assets seized under the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (Repo) for Ukrainians Act. But even those changes are unlikely to sway the most vocal Ukraine skeptics in the House Republican conference, such as the congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Good morning US politics readers. The House returns today after a two-week Easter recess as the speaker, Mike Johnson, faces mounting pressure to advance a Ukraine aid package and the threat of an intra-party revolt if he does so. Johnson has indicated the House will take up the issue of Ukraine funding this week, but many hard-right members of his conference remain staunchly opposed to additional Ukraine aid and the Georgia congresswoman, Marjorie Taylor Greene, has already introduced a motion-to-vacate resolution, all but daring Johnson to move forward with a Ukraine aid bill so she can force a vote on the matter. Speaking to CNN last week, Greene said: I\u2019m not saying I have a red line or a trigger, and I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t have a red line or trigger. But I\u2019m going to tell you right now: funding Ukraine is probably one of the most egregious things that he can do. Meanwhile, the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, is scheduled to meet with secretary of state Antony Blinken and congressional lawmakers in Washington over the next two days. Ahead of his meeting with Blinken, Cameron took the unusual and potentially risky step of traveling to see Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, in the hopes of persuading the presumptive Republican presidential candidate to drop his opposition to Ukraine aid deal that is being held up in Congress partly on Trump\u2019s instruction. Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re watching: 10am ET. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will meet with the British foreign secretary, David Cameron, at the state department. 11:15am. Blinken and Biden will give a news conference. 12.30pm. Joe Biden will speak at Washington\u2019s Union Station about the \u201ccare economy\u201d, a reference to care workers and family caregivers. 1.30pm. The White House daily press briefing. 4pm. The House rules committee will meet to take up several bills, including a bill extending Section 702 in the FISA reauthorization and a resolution denouncing the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies. 6pm. Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, will welcome the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida and his wife, Yuko Kishida, to the White House. Kamala Harris will meet privately this afternoon in with relatives of Americans taken hostage in Gaza during the Hamas terror attacks on southern Israel on 7 October."

            "date": "2024-04-10T22:03:23Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden and Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, have announced a new era of military cooperation during the pomp and pageantry of a White House state visit aimed at countering China. The US president said the two nations\u2019 forces will cooperate on a joint command structure and, along with Australia, develop a new air missile defence network. \u201cWe\u2019re increasing the interoperability and planning of our militaries so they can work together in a seamless and effective way,\u201d Biden said at a joint press conference with Kishida in the bright sunshine of the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. \u201cThis is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since it was first established. \u201cI\u2019m also pleased to announce that for the first time, Japan and the United States and Australia will create a networked system of air, missile and defence architecture. We\u2019re also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom.\u201d The president, born a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that prompted US entry into the second world war, said the agreements set a \u201cnew benchmark for our military cooperation\u201d. The move appears aimed at making US and Japanese forces more nimble in the event of a crisis such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Biden insisted that it was \u201cpurely defensive\u201d and \u201cnot aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region\u201d. Kishida told reporters that the two leaders had discussed tense relations between Taiwan and China and pledged to uphold international order based on the rule of law. \u201cWe confirmed that unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d Kishida said. The US and Japan will continue to respond to such actions, including challenges from China, he added. \u201cRegarding Russia\u2019s aggression of Ukraine, based on a recognition that Ukraine today may be east Asia tomorrow.\u201d The leaders also announced deals for technology, including artificial intelligence and the economy, along with a joint partnership to accelerate development and commercialisation of nuclear fusion. Biden said they had a shared goal that a Japanese person will be the first non-American to walk on the moon, flying on a US mission due to take place in a few years\u2019 time. Japan is taking on a more prominent global role after a series of security law changes in the past decade that have transformed its pacifist constitution. Biden also noted that Japan is the top foreign investor in the US. Overall the US and Japan have struck about 70 agreements on defence cooperation, including moves to upgrade the US military command structure in Japan, the biggest such change since the 1960s. The two sides will set up a forum for the co-development and co-production of missiles and maintenance of US warships and aircraft, as well as a working group for fighter pilot training and co-development and co-production of jet trainers. A joint statement said the US\u2019s Aukus defence partnership with Australia and Britain is considering cooperation with Japan on advanced capabilities and technologies including quantum computing, undersea, hypersonic, artificial intelligence and cyber technology. Asked if there was a path for Japan to become a full member of Aukus, Kishida replied: \u201cWe want to contribute to the peace and stability of the region and therefore we have consistently supported Aukus \u2026 But for Japan, to have a direct cooperation with Aukus, nothing has been decided at this moment.\u201d Kishida is the first Japanese leader to get a US state visit since Shinzo Abe in 2015 and only the fifth world leader to receive one since Biden took office in 2021. The dinner was held in the grand East Room of the White House, decorated by fans and cherry blossom branches. White House chefs served a meal featuring Japanese flavors, starting with house-cured salmon, followed by dry-aged ribeye with wasabi sauce, and salted caramel pistachio cake with cherry ice-cream. After dinner, singer Paul Simon performed hits while playing guitar, including Graceland and Slip Slidin\u2019 Away. Simon is one of Jill Biden\u2019s favourite artists, according to the White House. At the dinner, Kishida quoted from the science fiction series Star Trek, telling guests \u201cI would like to propose a toast to our voyage to the frontier of the Japan-US relationship with this word: boldly go,\u201d a phrase from the iconic opening monologue of the TV series. Other notable guests at the dinner included Bill and Hillary Clinton and actor Robert De Niro. Kishida will address Congress on Thursday and join Biden and the Philippines president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, for a meeting expected to focus on Beijing\u2019s South China Sea incursions. Biden also expressed support for Japan\u2019s attempts to set up a leader-to-leader summit with North Korea. \u201cWe welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Korea,\u201d he commented. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said many times, we\u2019re open to dialogue ourselves at any time but without preconditions from the DPRK.\u201d"

            "content": "The US military has released pictures it says show that a pier to help bring more aid into the besieged Gaza Strip is now under construction. The images show what appears to be a large metal construction with workers in military uniform dotted along the floating platforms. The US central command posted the images on X saying \u201cpier-building begins\u201d and that \u201cconstruction of the floating JLOTS pier in the Mediterranean is underway\u201d. JLOTS stands for Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore. Earlier, a US navy ship involved in the American-led effort to bring more aid into the Gaza Strip appeared offshore from the territory and was involved in building out a floating platform for the operation, according to satellite photos analysed by the Associated Press. The USNS Roy P Benavidez sits about 5 miles from the pier and base of operations for the accompanying project being built by the Israeli military. A satellite image from Sunday by Planet Labs PBC showed pieces of the floating pier in the Mediterranean Sea alongside the vessel. The US military and Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Benavidez\u2019s position. Under the plan by the US military, aid will be loaded on to commercial ships in Cyprus to sail to the floating platform now under construction off Gaza. Pallets will be loaded on to trucks, which will be loaded on to smaller ships that travel to a metal, floating two-lane causeway. The 550-metre (1,800ft) causeway will lead to shore. The new port sits just south-west of Gaza City, north of a road bisecting Gaza that the Israeli military built during the current fighting against Hamas. The area was the territory\u2019s most populous region before the Israeli ground offensive rolled through and pushed more than a million people south toward the city of Rafah on the Egyptian border. Israeli military positions now sit on either side of the pier, which initially had been built \u2013 as part of an effort led by World Central Kitchen \u2013 out of the rubble of buildings levelled by Israel. That effort halted after an Israeli airstrike killed seven WCK aid workers on 1 April as they travelled in clearly marked vehicles on a delivery mission authorised by Israel. WCK said on Sunday that it would resume work in Gaza. Its CEO, Erin Gore, said the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) had apologised for the attack and promised a change in their rules of operation, but that little was assured. \u201cWhile we have no concrete assurances, we continue to seek answers and advocate for change with the goal of better protecting WCK and all NGO workers serving selflessly in the worst humanitarian conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cOur demand for an impartial and international investigation remains.\u201d Gore said her organisation was exploring routes to allow more aid into Gaza, including a maritime corridor. Using cargo ships to deliver aid has drawn criticism from relief groups including the UN, amid criticism it is a less efficient way to deliver vital goods than over land. Data from the UN shows that about 250 aid trucks enter Gaza each day, about half of what aid groups say are needed, amid reports of imminent famine in parts of the territory. As WCK resumed operations, a coalition of activists and relief groups said they had postponed a plan to sail three ships from Turkey to Gaza carrying ambulances, anaesthetics and other forms of relief. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, a group comprising hundreds of international activists spearheaded by the Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH), said the flag carrier Guinea-Bissau removed its flag from two of the ships. \u201cWithout a flag, we cannot sail. But this is not the end,\u201d they said in a statement. Organisers said the shipping registry of Guinea-Bissau, administered by an Athens-based corporation, G-B International, contacted them to demand further inspection of one of their ships, the Akdeniz, a large passenger ship moored in an Istanbul shipyard. Before the inspection was completed, they said, G-B International told them it had withdrawn the flag from the Akdeniz and a cargo ship. IHH has sent multiple cargo ships of aid to Al-Arish in Egypt, which then enters Gaza through the Rafah crossing with the consent of the Israeli authorities. However, in this instance activists onboard the flotilla said they would not cooperate with Israel in any way to deliver the aid onboard once they reached Gaza. The organisers said G-B international demanded \u201ca formal letter explicitly approving the transportation of humanitarian aid and a complete manifest of the cargo\u201d. Eirini Sampani, a legal officer with G-B international, said signing up to its register entailed a commitment not to \u201cengage on a unilateral basis in war zones against internationally followed practices and UN resolutions, such as the Gaza area\u201d. Sampani and G-B international said they were \u201cclosely monitoring the situation and cooperating with relevant authorities to ensure that any potential commercial activity adheres to applicable laws and regulations\u201d. They declined to answer further questions about what had prompted the company to suddenly withdraw the flags, or what information was provided by IHH about the ship\u2019s purpose or destination during registration. The activists\u2019 efforts to reach Gaza from Turkey marked a repeat of an attempt in 2010 in which the boats were boarded by Israeli commandos in international waters. Nine people were killed on one of the boats. Activists and IHH said reports of imminent famine in Gaza and the rising loss of life made them decide to reprise the flotilla, even though the 2010 incident prompted a dramatic break in Turkish-Israeli relations that lasted for years. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was pressed into apologising to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, for the incident by the then US president, Barack Obama. Aid groups say maritime deliveries and airdrops are not enough to ward off famine. The relief organisation Oxfam said Israel should \u201clift its total blockade of Gaza\u201d and stop arbitrary blocks that prevented relief from entering. The White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told ABC News that a floating pier built by the US military would be operative in two or three weeks\u2019 time. He said that while it was designed to increase aid into Gaza, the maritime route remained a limited way to bring in relief. \u201cNothing can replace the ground routes and the trucks that are getting in,\u201d he said. The Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "date": "2024-04-24T00:08:26Z",
            "content": "The US Senate voted resoundingly on Tuesday to approve $95bn in wartime aid for Ukraine and Israel, along with defence support to Taiwan, as a bipartisan super-majority united to send the long-stalled package to Joe Biden\u2019s desk for signature. The final vote was 79 to 18. In a call on Monday, Biden informed the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that he would \u201cmove quickly\u201d to send desperately needed military aid, including air defence weaponry, after the bill\u2019s passage by the Senate. The legislation includes $60.8bn to replenish Ukraine\u2019s war chest as it seeks to repel Russia from its territory; $26.3bn for Israel and humanitarian relief for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8.1bn for the Indo-Pacific region to bolster its defences against China. Russian missiles attacked a residential district of Kharkiv early on Wednesday, said the mayor, Ihor Terekhov. Information on casualties was being clarified, he added. Public broadcaster Suspilne said civil infrastructure had been destroyed in the assault. The air raid alert in Kharkiv region was subsequently lifted. Russian authorities have arrested Timur Ivanov, a deputy defence minister, on suspicion of taking an especially large bribe. Russia\u2019s state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying that both Vladimir Putin, the president, and Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, were informed. Ivanov, 48, is one of Russia\u2019s 12 deputy defence ministers, and is under Europe and EU sanctions over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces have made significant advances in a narrow corridor in eastern Ukraine, as an offensive to take territory before a fresh injection of western military aid arrives appears to be gathering pace, Dan Sabbagh in Kyiv and Luke Harding report. Footage from Kremlin military bloggers showed a Russian tricolour flying above the shattered village of Ocheretyne, north-west of the occupied town of Avdiivka, after advancing about 5km in 10 days. Farther north, a large Russian offensive is under way to seize the town of Chasiv Yar. Ukraine\u2019s eastern military command has said 20,000-25,000 enemy troops are trying to storm the hilltop town and surrounding districts. Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry is suspending consular services for military-age men living abroad, except for those heading back to Ukraine, in a move designed to increase conscription. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said: \u201cA man of conscription age went abroad, showed his state that he does not care about its survival, and then comes and wants to receive services from this state. It does not work this way. Our country is at war.\u201d Since Russia\u2019s full-scale 2022 invasion, men between the ages of 18 and 60 have to stay in Ukraine, with exceptions. The Eurostat database estimates about 4.3 million Ukrainians were registered in European Union countries as of January 2024, of whom about 20% are adult men \u2013 roughly 860,000 people. Authorities in Ukraine\u2019s Sumy oblast bordering Russia reported four injuries from 51 attacks by Russian forces on Tuesday. Emergency services in Russian-held parts of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia region said a Ukrainian drone strike on Tuesday killed four people in a car north of the town of Melitopol."

            "title": "Micronesia president says US beefing up military capabilities in the Pacific country",
            "date": "2024-04-10T02:41:23Z",
            "content": "The US is considering military projects across the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) as it pushes ahead with plans for a $400m airport upgrade in the country to boost defence capabilities in the Pacific, President Wesley Simina said. The region is of growing strategic importance to the US amid a battle for influence with China. FSM has been identified as a key part of the US Indo-Pacific strategy aimed at countering Beijing in the region. An agreement between the US and FSM, known as the Compact of Free Association (Cofa), gives FSM funding and support, while the US gains exclusive defence rights to the Pacific nation. \u201cThe Federated States of Micronesia is open for US consideration for any kind of defense-related activities, including use of our lands and oceans,\u201d Simina said. The airport upgrade is on the island of Yap, one of four states that form the FSM. Washington\u2019s plans were made public in budget proposals released last month. Speaking to the Guardian as part of a series of interviews with Pacific leaders, Simina said the US was also looking at the states of Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae for \u201cother kinds of projects\u201d. \u201cBut so far, those are yet to be disclosed,\u201d he said. Simina said the US was \u201cwell advanced into its planning in the use of [the] airport area\u201d on Yap and would also conduct more military exercises from the island. \u201cWe know they want to expand it. They want to install different infrastructure there to help support their military activities in Japan,\u201d he said. Katherine Koenig, spokesperson for the Joint Region Marianas mission, which manages US military operations in parts of the Pacific, said the proposed budget for the 2025 fiscal year includes $400m for the development of Yap\u2019s airport and seaport. \u201cThe project will include an extension of the runway to accommodate larger aircraft to land and take off in support of training operation and humanitarian mission at the Yap airport,\u201d Koenig said. If approved by Congress, an initial amount of $96m is proposed to be invested in 2025, she said. Other US military sites in the Pacific include naval, air force and marine bases in Guam, as well as an army base in the Marshall Islands. In its budget proposal, the US air force said FSM and Yap were \u201cstrategically located\u201d in the western Pacific. \u201cDevelopment of Yap Airport is essential because there are very few divert or contingency airfields available as potential United States defense sites in the region,\u201d the US air force said. Michael Walsh, affiliate researcher at the Center for Australian, New Zealand and Pacific Studies, said the US was seeking to expand airbases in the region to add \u201ccomplexity\u201d to its operations. \u201cIt is hoped that this increased complexity will make it far more difficult for adversaries to be able to accurately predict the ways the United States military will respond in the event of [any military challenges],\u201d he said, using examples of an attack on the US or in the defence of Taiwan. Yap, which is about 24km long, will also be part of increased US military exercises in the Pacific region. Training opportunities were discussed during a meeting between Simina and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin in Washington in March. Austin said they discussed \u201cnew opportunities for defence posture cooperation between our two countries\u201d. Simina said he was working with the US defence and air force departments on the details of the exercises. \u201cAs of now, we\u2019re not aware of any specific number of exercises to be done in Yap each year or each month,\u201d Simina said. In August 2023, the Micronesian government disclosed US air force plans to deploy \u201cair defence assets\u201d to Yap. However, details have not been made public. \u201cThe US will have to notify us [about any defence assets],\u201d Simina said. The economic provisions of the Cofa agreements were recently renewed, and the FSM is set to receive $140m each year for the next 20 years from the US. The residents of Yap \u201chave been very receptive and supportive\u201d of the defence developments, Simina said. \u201cObviously, there might be some concerns here and there, especially on the environmental side. But the US department of Defense is very much aware of that.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-18T00:26:45Z",
            "content": "Philippine and US forces will carry out their first ever military exercises outside the south-east Asian country\u2019s territorial waters, in a move China has said will only lead to greater insecurity in the South China Sea. The annual Balikatan or \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder\u201d drills \u2013 which will run from 22 April to 10 May \u2013 will involve 16,700 soldiers simulating retaking enemy-occupied islands in areas facing Taiwan and the South China Sea. It will be the first time the maritime exercises are carried out beyond Philippine territorial waters, according to Michael Logico, a Philippine army colonel overseeing the exercises. It will also be the first time the Philippine Coast Guard has taken part in military exercises. The coast guard has increasingly been at the forefront of clashes with China, particularly around the disputed Second Thomas Shoal. In response to the planned drills, China\u2019s foreign ministry warned that the Philippines should be \u201csober enough to realise\u201d that bringing in external countries to show off their force in the South China Sea and provoke confrontation will only aggravate tensions and undermine regional stability. \u201cAttempts to bring in external forces to safeguard its so-called security will only lead to greater insecurity for itself,\u201d ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a scheduled news conference, urging both countries to stop provocation. Chinese state media was also critical of the drills, which they said would have a \u201cdestructive impact on regional security\u201d. On Thursday the Philippines\u2019 foreign ministry said its decision to strengthen ties with Japan and the US was a \u201csovereign choice\u201d, and urged China to \u201creflect upon its own actions\u201d in the South China Sea. \u201cThe source of tension in our region is well known to all,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cIt is China\u2019s excessive maritime claims and aggressive behaviour, including its militarisation of reclaimed features, that are undermining regional peace and stability and raising tensions.\u201d Logico said US troops and their Philippine counterparts will simulate retaking islands occupied by hostile forces in the northernmost islands of the country, close to Taiwan and in the western Palawan province facing the South China Sea. More than 16,700 Filipino and US troops will take part. On Thursday Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesperson Rear Adm Armando Balilo said six PCG vessels would take part for the first time. In previous years they have only patrolled the perimeter to keep out other parties. A small French contingent will join this year\u2019s drills for the first time since the annual exercise began in 1991, deploying a frigate that will sail jointly with Philippines and US naval vessels in Manila\u2019s exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. About 14 nations will join as observers, including Japan, India and countries in Asean and the European Union, Logico said. Aimed at improving communication and coordination between the US and Philippine militaries, the drills come against the backdrop of recent aggressive behaviour from Beijing in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, flashpoints for Chinese and US tensions. The so-called \u201cgray-zone\u201d harassment by China has included shining military-grade lasers at the Philippine Coast Guard, firing water cannon at vessels and ramming into Philippine ships running resupply missions near the Second Thomas Shoal, which both Manila and Beijing claim. Some Filipino crew have been injured in the clashes. China claims almost the entire South China Sea despite a 2016 ruling by an international tribunal that found Beijing\u2019s sweeping claims had no legal basis. Last week, Joe Biden pledged to defend the Philippines from any attack in the South China Sea, as he hosted the first joint summit with Manila and Tokyo amid growing tensions with Beijing. On Thursday, China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi kicked off a tour of south-east Asia that will see him visit Indonesia, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea. Indonesia\u2019s president-elect Prabowo Subianto visited China at the beginning of April, where President Xi Jinping praised their ties and laid out a vision for regional peace. China is one of the biggest sources of foreign direct investment in Indonesia and has poured billions of dollars into projects in the country. Wang will finish the tour in Papua New Guinea, where in recent years Beijing has tried to chip away at US and Australian influence.

            "date": "2024-04-07T22:43:20Z",
            "content": "The head of the UN\u2019s atomic watchdog agency has condemned a drone strike on one of six nuclear reactors at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine, saying such attacks \u201csignificantly increase the risk of a major nuclear accident\u201d. In a statement on X, Rafael Grossi confirmed at least three direct hits against the ZNPP main reactor containment structures. \u201cThis cannot happen,\u201d the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. Grossi said it was the first such attack since November 2022, when he set out five basic principles to avoid a serious nuclear accident with radiological consequences. Russian officials at the plant claimed the site was attacked on Sunday by Ukrainian military drones, including a strike on the dome of the plant\u2019s sixth power unit. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence agency has denied responsibility for the strike. \u201cRussian strikes, including imitation ones, on the territory of the Ukrainian nuclear power plant ... have long been a well known criminal practice of the invaders,\u201d a spokesperson told local media. The Guardian has been unable to verify the claims. According to the plant authorities, there was no critical damage or casualties and radiation levels at the plant were normal after the strikes. Later on Sunday, however, Russian state-owned nuclear agency Rosatom said three people were wounded in the \u201cunprecedented series of drone attacks\u201d, specifically when a drone hit an area close to the site\u2019s canteen. The IAEA said on Sunday that its experts had been informed of the drone strike and that \u201csuch detonation is consistent with IAEA observations\u201d. In a separate statement, the nuclear watchdog confirmed the physical impact of drone attacks at the plant, including at one of its six reactors. One casualty was reported, it said. \u201cDamage at unit 6 has not compromised nuclear safety, but this is a serious incident with potential to undermine integrity of the reactor\u2019s containment system\u201d it added. The power plant has been caught in the crossfire since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022 and seized the facility shortly afterwards. The IAEA has repeatedly expressed alarm about the nuclear power plant, Europe\u2019s largest, amid fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe. Both Ukraine and Russia have regularly accused the other of attacking the plant, which is still close to the front lines. The plant\u2019s six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features. Also on Sunday, three people were killed when their house was hit by a Russian projectile in the frontline town of Huliaipole in Ukraine\u2019s partly occupied south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. Later on Sunday, two people were wounded in another shelling of Huliaipole. Separately, three people were wounded in Russian shelling in Ukraine\u2019s north-east Kharkiv region, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. In Russia, a girl died and four other people were wounded when the debris of a downed Ukrainian drone fell on a car carrying a family of six people in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said."

We have had some more information come through about Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\u2019s visit to China on Monday and Tuesday. Talks between Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who extended the invitation to the Russian minister, will consist of bilateral cooperation as well as \u201chot topics\u201d, such as the crisis in Ukraine and the Asia-Pacific, the Russian foreign ministry said. On Saturday, the US warned allies that China has provided geospatial intelligence to Moscow in its war against Ukraine.

China\u2019s foreign ministry has not responded to a request for comment during a holiday weekend. Reuters reported last month that Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to China in May for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, in what might be the Kremlin chief\u2019s first overseas trip of his new presidential term. Flooding in Russia\u2019s Orenburg remains \u201ccritical\u201d. The mayor of the Russian city of Orenburg said on Sunday that the situation around flooding in the city remained \u201ccritical\u201d, and that water levels would continue to rise in the coming days, Reuters reports. Russia said on Saturday that it had evacuated more than 4,000 people in the Orenburg region, which lies near the Kazakhstan border, due to flooding after a dam burst. Orsk oil refinery, located in Orenburg, also suspended work on Sunday, Russian news agency cited the plant\u2019s press service as saying. They reported that the suspension of operations was aimed at avoiding ecological risks. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will make an official visit to China, China\u2019s foreign ministry said on Sunday. Earlier this week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told journalists in Guangzhou, \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear with China that we see Russia as gaining support from goods that China, Chinese firms are supplying to Russia.\u201d \u201cNeither of us want this to be an issue with our bilateral relationship. So we\u2019re working together,\u201d she added. Sergei Lavrov is expected to visit China on Monday and Tuesday. Three civilians were killed in a Russian attack on the frontline village of Guliaipole, in Ukraine\u2019s southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, on Sunday morning, the local governor has said. \u201cTwo men and a woman died under the rubble of their own house, which was hit by a Russian shell,\u201d Ivan Fedorov said on the Telegram messaging app. Fedorov said one more person was injured. The Guardian could not independently verify the report. Welcome to our continuing live coverage of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Here\u2019s an overview of the latest news on day 774 to bring you up to speed. Ukraine\u2019s forces destroyed 17 attack drones launched by Russia overnight, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday. \u201cAt night the Russian occupiers attacked Ukraine once again, using 17 attack drones. The Ukrainian air defence forces destroyed all of them,\u201d the Ukrainian General Staff said on Facebook. Earlier, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that Ukraine could run out of air defence missiles if Russia keeps up its intense long-range bombing campaign. More on that story shortly. In other key developments: Zelenskiy also said on Saturday that he hoped that he and Swiss president Viola Amherd would set a date within days for a world peace summit in Switzerland with 80 to 100 countries. Russia has said such a meeting would be pointless if it did not participate. Kyiv has previously proposed a world peace summit but has said Russia would not be invited. A close ally of populist prime minister Robert Fico has defeated a pro-western career diplomat to become Slovakia\u2019s new president. Critics worry Slovakia under Fico will abandon its pro-western course and follow the direction of Hungary under populist prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Thousands have repeatedly taken to the streets across Slovakia recently to rally against Fico\u2019s pro-Russian and other policies. Two Russian missile and drone strikes, one in the early hours of Saturday and a second in the afternoon, killed eight people and wounded at least 10 more people in northeastern Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second largest city, national emergency services and the city\u2019s mayor said on Saturday. Igor Terekhov also said in Telegram post that the attack had targeted Shevchenkivskyi, a northern area of the city, Agence France-Presse reports. Terekhov said Iranian-made drones had carried out the attack, hitting at least nine high-rise buildings, three dormitories and a petrol station. Oleg Synegubov, the region\u2019s governor, said earlier that two men were killed in Shevchenkivskyi. Police confirmed the deaths and said a further eight people were hospitalised \u201cwith blast injuries and shrapnel wounds\u201d. Police added that there were no casualties in a separate attack on Mala Danylivka, a village on Kharkiv\u2019s north-west outskirts. In the eastern region of Donetsk, artillery shelling killed four people in the village of Kurakhivka including a 38-year-old woman and her 16-year-old daughter, and a 25-year-old man in the village of Krasnohorivka was killed, local officials said. Russia on Saturday condemned as a provocation a drone attack on a military facility of pro-Russian separatists in Moldova\u2019s breakaway Transnistria region and called for an investigation. An explosive drone hit a facility belonging to the separatist authority\u2019s defence ministry six km (four miles) from the border with Ukraine, the region\u2019s security ministry said on Friday. Ukrainian forces are still in control of the town of Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine despite attempts by Russian troops to break through their defences, commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said. Russia\u2019s RIA news agency on Friday cited an official as saying Russian forces had entered the suburbs of the town, which Moscow sees as an important staging point for Kyiv\u2019s troops. Ukrainian military said the report was untrue, Reuters reported. \u201cChasiv Yar remains under our control, and all enemy attempts to break through to the settlement have failed,\u201d Syrskyi said on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday. On the ground in Ukraine, Russian forces were advancing, and pushing back against them was \u201cdifficult\u201d, said Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. Syrskyi said the situation in the Bakhmut area in the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region was particularly challenging, Reuters reported. He said Russian forces are carrying out offensive operations day and night, using assault groups with the support of armoured vehicles, as well as assaults on foot. Tajikistan\u2019s foreign ministry on Saturday rejected a claim by a top Russian security official that Ukraine\u2019s embassy in the Tajik capital was recruiting mercenaries to fight against Russia. \u201cWe note that this assertion by the Russian official has no basis to it,\u201d Russian news agencies quoted Tajik foreign ministry spokesperson Shokhin Samadi as saying."

            "date": "2024-04-03T05:00:19Z",
            "content": "The Arctic char (or charr), Salvelinus alpinus, has for centuries had a special place in Britain\u2019s largest natural lake, Lake Windermere. Since the ice age, when the glaciers retreated leaving behind a deep cold water lake, the char has lived in its depths. Similar to trout and salmon, the char has always been thought of as a culinary delicacy and for centuries was sold to the wealthier members of British society as a rare dish. Commercial netting was stopped in 1921 and now it is only a specialist angler that will try to lure one on to a hook. There are many other Arctic char populations, and it is thought to be the most northerly freshwater fish. Some are elsewhere in the UK, notably in Scotland\u2019s deep lakes, often isolated so long that they were once thought to be different species. The Windermere char was originally a migratory species, like salmon, but even though they could escape the lake they stay put. They grow slowly and a 10-year-old spawning fish will reach 30cm (1ft). Their existence and their cultural value contributed to Windermere being declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2017. Sadly, however, their future is in doubt. Raw sewage from United Utilities overflows has been flooding into Windermere. If this situation continues, the char habitat may never be the same."

            "content": "Israel has suspended leave for combat units and heightened its air defence command to deal with possible missile or drone attack from Iran following the killing this week in an airstrike of senior Revolutionary Guard commanders in Syria. The Israeli military is also considering reopening shelters in Tel Aviv as a precaution against a possible attack, according to Mehr News Agency. \u201cIn accordance with the situational assessment, it has been decided that leave will be temporarily paused for all IDF (Israel Defense Forces) combat units. The IDF is at war and the deployment of forces is under continuous assessment according to requirements,\u201d the military said in a statement. Iran has vowed revenge after an airstrike destroyed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, killing at least 11 people, including a senior commander in the al-Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said: \u201cWe consider this aggression to have violated all diplomatic norms and international treaties. Benjamin Netanyahu has completely lost his mental balance due to the successive failures in Gaza and his failure to achieve his Zionist goals.\u201d Iran\u2019s ambassador to Syria, Hossein Akbari, said Iran\u2019s response to the strike would be \u201cat the same magnitude and harshness\u201d. Iran\u2019s leaders in Tehran described the targeting of a diplomatic mission late on Monday as unprecedented and promised a harsh response. While Israel has not officially acknowledged its involvement, the incident has the potential to further destabilise the already volatile region. The IDF has also intensified GPS jamming efforts in response to the threat of an Iranian retaliation, causing disruptions to navigation services and impacting daily operations. The use of GPS jamming is an apparent measure meant to ward off guided missiles. Reports indicate that the jamming has expanded to key areas in Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. These measures have raised concerns about potential implications on aviation safety and daily life. Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli intelligence chief, told Reuters that Iran may choose this Friday \u2013 the last in the holy Muslim month of Ramadan and Iran\u2019s Quds (Jerusalem) Day \u2013 to respond to the Damascus strike, either directly or through a proxy. \u201cI will not be surprised if Iran will act tomorrow. Don\u2019t panic. Don\u2019t run to the shelters,\u201d said Yadlin, a senior fellow at the Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center at Harvard University, citing Israel\u2019s aerial defence systems. \u201cBe tuned for tomorrow and then, depending on the consequences of the attack, it may escalate,\u201d Yadlin said. On Thursday, Iran repatriated the bodies of seven IRGC members killed in the strike. \u201cThe bodies of the Iran embassy martyrs arrived at Mehrabad airport,\u201d in Tehran, the ISNA news agency reported.

            "date": "2024-04-19T15:28:40Z",
            "content": "The central Iranian city of Isfahan is home to a number of important military facilities, including nuclear facilities, a major airbase and factories associated with Iranian drone and other military production. Initial reports by Iran\u2019s Fars news agency from the Friday morning Israeli attacks centred on \u201cthree explosions\u201d heard near Qahjavarestan, close to Isfahan airport and the Shekari army airbase, while Iran\u2019s space agency spokesperson Hossein Dalirian said \u201cseveral\u201d drones had been \u201csuccessfully shot down\u201d. Iranian officials said that its nuclear facilities \u201cwere secure\u201d. The Natanz uranium enrichment plant, Iran\u2019s best known nuclear facility is located in the wider province, while a uranium conversion is carried in the city\u2019s south-eastern Zardanjan area. Video from the Tasnim news agency from Zardanjan showed two different anti-aircraft gun positions, and details of the video corresponded with known features of the Isfahan uranium conversion facility. \u201cAt 4.45, we heard gunshots. There was nothing going on,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cIt was the air defence, these guys that you\u2019re watching, and over there too.\u201d The facility at Isfahan, which began construction in 1999, operates three small Chinese-supplied research reactors, as well as handling fuel production and other activities for Iran\u2019s civilian nuclear programme. The site appears to have been hit by an explosion in November 2011. Isfahan is also home to a major Iranian airbase which has held Iran\u2019s ageing fleet of American-made F-14 Tomcats \u2013 bought before the 1979 Islamic revolution. Some initial speculation suggested that a radar facility at the base may have been the intended target of an attack. Equally important are Iran\u2019s weapons production facilities in and around the city. Early last year an attack, blamed on Israel, was launched on what was reportedly an advanced weapons production facility in the city, which like the current claimed strike involved three drones. As in the current attack there were wildly conflicting accounts from Iranian officials, who claimed that two drones had been shot down and another had inflicted only minor damage to the factory\u2019s roof."

            "content": "If you\u2019re familiar with Alan Ritchson from his turn as Jack Reacher in the Amazon series based on the phenomenally popular Lee Child thrillers, get ready to see a different side of him in this weepy based on a true story. He\u2019s once more playing a large, taciturn man (whether, per Reacher, his hands are still \u201cas big as dinner plates\u201d is not addressed), but here his problems cannot be solved by hitting things. Grieving the recent death of his wife, and drowning in debt from hospital bills, he\u2019s devastated by the news that his youngest daughter may have only weeks or months to live, due to a condition related to that which claimed the life of her mother. Her only hope is yet more expensive treatment. The revelation that a loud hairdresser with a drinking problem and zero sense of personal boundaries (played, effectively, by Hilary Swank at her most Dolly Parton), has read about his case in the local newspaper and decided to make the unfortunate family her personal recovery project is not immediately welcomed by the gruff widower. There\u2019s an interesting moral tension at work here: the self-appointed saviour is legitimately helpful, raising thousands of dollars, but she will not take no for an answer, and the unsolicited intrusion crosses the line at several points. And yet \u2026 her interventions, taken as a whole, do vastly more good than harm. Of course, the real villain of the piece is the American healthcare system; this is not a story that could be set in Europe. That a system exists where it is even possible to owe more than $400,000 to a hospital is the stuff of dystopian nightmares, but this film isn\u2019t in the business of confronting the politics around the family\u2019s predicament. Directed by Jon Gunn and written by Meg Tilly and Kelly Fremon Craig, the heartwarming spectacle of a maverick force for good rallying an entire community to save one unfortunate family makes for better drama than questioning why that family is in need of saving in the first place. Taken on its own terms as an old-fashioned character drama and showcase for Ritchson as a dramatic actor (he\u2019s genuinely really good), it does the job it set out to do. \u2022 Ordinary Angels is in UK and Irish cinemas from 26 April."

            "date": "2024-04-29T11:00:17Z",
            "content": "Florida is continuing to \u201ccallously\u201d strip healthcare coverage from thousands of children in lower-income households in defiance of a new federal law intended to protect them. Since 1 January, more than 22,500 children have been disenrolled from Florida KidCare, its version of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (Chip) that is jointly subsidized by states and the US government for families with earnings just above the threshold for Medicaid. Florida healthcare officials admit at least some were removed for non-payment of premiums, an action prohibited by the \u201ccontinuous eligibility\u201d clause of the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act that took effect at the beginning of this year. The clause secures 12 months of cover if at least one premium payment is made. Last week, the administration of the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, challenged the rule in federal court in Tampa, arguing it makes Chip an entitlement program that illegally overrides a state law requiring monthly payment of premiums. But it has chosen not to wait for a ruling before continuing to separate children from coverage. Figures from the Florida Health Justice Project show there were 5,552 removals in the month to 1 April, following 5,097 in March, 5,147 in February, and 6,780 in January. Florida argues the numbers include children ageing out or moving into other coverage, and that \u201cdisenrollment has been consistent at this level for years\u201d. Notably, the monthly average so far this year is more than 1,500 higher than the whole of 2023. \u201cIt\u2019s just enormously cruel and a crisis of callousness by our governor and state of Florida who are willing to sacrifice sick children for their political aims,\u201d said the Democratic US congresswoman Kathy Castor, who said she had been contacted by several families booted from KidCare, or \u201cunwinded\u201d from Medicaid as Covid-19 protections expired. \u201cIt\u2019s an important reform for parents because once you qualify you can stay on for a year, your child will get the care they need, consistent visits to the doctor\u2019s office, and if they have a complex medical condition they know it will be handled. \u201cIn the end, it saves everyone money, and saves families\u2019 heartache when young children can stay healthy and well. But Ron DeSantis loves a lawsuit. Florida is the only state in the country that is so upset that children are going to get healthcare that he\u2019s suing in federal court.\u201d Castor said one family she had spoken with had a two-and-a-half-year-old toddler who was born three months prematurely. \u201cShe is fed exclusively through a tube. She has extreme developmental delays and requires 24-hour nursing care,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said since birth she has faced challenges including five months in neonatal intensive care, hernia surgery, air tube surgeries and seizures, and ongoing treatment. So the state now has ended her coverage. It\u2019s heartbreaking, it\u2019s cruel and it\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d Independent experts also question the purge. \u201cWhile Florida is not alone in rapidly disenrolling children from Medicaid during the unwinding process \u2013 many of whom likely remain eligible \u2013 families should know that Florida is distinguishing itself in an apparent violation of federal law by kicking children off Chip as well,\u201d Joan Alker, executive director of the non-partisan Center for Children and Families and a research professor at the Georgetown McCourt school of public policy, said in an analysis published last week. \u201cFlorida is one of just nine states that charges premiums to children below 150% of the poverty line. Seven states have dropped all premiums in Chip at any income level in recognition of the barriers they pose for low and moderate income families. \u201cWith the litigation, [Florida\u2019s] efforts to block children from retaining affordable health coverage are not stopping at its borders. Depending on how it is framed, a ruling in Florida\u2019s favor could give all states the green light to terminate the coverage of Chip kids if their parents miss a premium payment.\u201d Florida\u2019s agency for healthcare administration did not return a request for comment. In a statement published on 19 April, the agency called previous media coverage of the issue \u201cmisleading\u201d, but did not dispute the accuracy of the disenrollment figures. \u201cAllowing disenrollment for nonpayment of premiums is crucial to maintaining the integrity and long-term sustainability of the program and helps Florida continue to maintain its high level of quality service for KidCare participants,\u201d it said. The agency also noted that, in 2023, DeSantis signed legislation that increased income eligibility to 300% of the federal poverty level. They claim that the legislation, which has not yet been enacted, would open Chip to a further 68,000 children. Overall, the agency said 182,000 Florida children were covered by KidCare \u2013 66% more than in May 2023. Castor, however, says the state\u2019s illegal dropping of enrolled children, and other recent developments \u2013 namely Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban that will take effect on Wednesday \u2013 prove the state is more determined to restrict healthcare than expand it. \u201cHypocrisy abounds,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the ability of women to control when they have kids, and if they have kids, the state of Florida and Ron DeSantis says: \u2018You have to have children, you have to.\u2019 \u201cThen if you have a child, it says: \u2018OK, you\u2019re on your own,\u2019 even in the face of a new federal law. All of the research shows that if children get the care they need, especially in their early years, they\u2019re going to be more successful in school, have higher reading scores, higher graduation rates, they\u2019ll be more productive in life. \u201cThis is a self-inflicted wound on the ability to have a healthy, functioning state of Florida.\u201d"

            "title": "What implications does England\u2019s review of trans healthcare have for Australia?",
            "date": "2024-04-19T15:00:05Z",
            "content": "The Victorian government is \u201cfiercely proud\u201d of its transgender health clinics, the state\u2019s health minister has said in response to findings from a long anticipated review of gender-affirming care for young people in England. Chaired by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, the review was commissioned by England\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) in 2020, with the final report published in April 2024. The review found the evidence base underpinning medical and non-medical interventions for children and young people with gender dysphoria must be improved and that the NHS should exercise \u201cextreme caution\u201d in prescribing masculinising or feminising hormones from 16 years old. Australian experts, including clinicians, politicians and peak medical bodies, spoken to by Guardian Australia all said the trans and gender-diverse care provided by states and territories is substantially different from that in England, and is based on holistic, best-practice care with various levels of assessments. Guardian Australia understands neither New South Wales or Victoria have plans to make changes to puberty blocker prescribing or accessibility as a result of the Cass review. Victoria\u2019s health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, said: \u201cOur gender clinics offer some of the most vulnerable young people in our community the support they deserve \u2013 we\u2019re fiercely proud of the important work they do. \u201cWe will continue engaging with trans and gender-diverse community and health service partners to ensure that trans and gender-diverse people can access the care they need.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup What the Cass review recommended While the Cass review recommends every case considered for medical treatment should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team, Australian standards of care and treatment already include a multidisciplinary assessment of pubertal status, mental health needs, medical needs and social context. Medical treatment is only initiated where clinically and legally appropriate, with informed consent from the young person, their carer and medical team all required. This may include prescribing puberty blockers, which can be used to delay the changes of puberty in transgender and gender-diverse youth. The Cass review raised concerns that when puberty blockers were being prescribed within the NHS, young people, including older adolescents finished with puberty, only had to see psychologists. In Australia, puberty blockers are seldom used for young people who have finished puberty. The Cass review also raised concerns that puberty blockers can decrease bone density. In Australia, measures to counteract this are recommended, such as weight bearing exercises, vitamin D supplementation and calcium intake. Associate Prof Ada Cheung, an endocrinologist with the Trans Health Research Group, said there are cases where \u201cnot providing, or delaying, wished-for and medically indicated treatment for transgender young people is emotionally distressing and is associated with poorer outcomes\u201d. \u201cDoing nothing carries significant risk.\u201d While the Cass review found insufficient and inconsistent evidence around the impact of puberty blockers on psychosocial wellbeing, Cheung said it is important to note it found no studies which show worsening psychological functioning as a result of treatment with puberty blockers. The Cass review did state: \u201cclinicians agreed that puberty blockers and hormones provided an important pathway for care alongside therapeutic support\u201d. Ensuring their safe use and considering long-term consequences is important, the review found. Cheung said clinical guidelines elsewhere, including in Canada and Germany, support clinicians being able to confidently prescribe puberty blockers where appropriate. She is concerned the Cass review \u201cdownplays the risk of denying treatment to young people with gender dysphoria and limits their options by placing restrictions on their access to care\u201d. As a result of Cass\u2019s preliminary findings, released in 2022, the NHS has banned the routine use of puberty blockers to treat children and young people who have gender dysphoria outside clinical research settings. Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland have taken a similar approach. In Australia, puberty blockers are prescribed \u201calways with individual weighing-up of the young person\u2019s needs and wishes, and the benefits, risks and unknowns of the treatment in their personal situation,\u201d Cheung said. It is not routine treatment. \u201cThe UK have one single clinic with ridiculously long waiting lists with thousands who can\u2019t access care and their approach is different to the holistic gender-affirming approach in Australia,\u201d Cheung said. Takeaways from the review The Cass review highlights the importance of working with young people to explore their concerns and experiences around gender, \u201cnot to change who they are\u201d but to \u201chelp alleviate their distress regardless of whether or not the young person subsequently proceeds on a medical pathway\u201d, it said. The president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP), Dr Elizabeth Moore, said it was important to make clear that being trans or gender diverse is not a mental health condition. \u201cRANZCP also acknowledges stigma, discrimination, trauma, abuse and assault contribute to trans and gender-diverse people experiencing higher rates of mental illness than the general population,\u201d she said. \u201cPsychiatry has a role and a responsibility to help counter, prevent and protect against this.\u201d The vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Danielle McMullen, said a key message from the Cass review was that trans and gender-diverse young people are a very vulnerable population that requires the best care and support available. \u201cIt is extremely important that every child who is gender-questioning has timely access to both clinical and mental health services that are multidisciplinary and responsive to their individual needs,\u201d she said. Issues with applying the Cass review to Australia A spokesperson for the federal health minister, Mark Butler, said clinical treatment of transgender children and adolescents is a complex and evolving area in which longer-term evidence to inform treatment protocols is still developing. \u201cThe clinical care pathways are different in the UK from Australia,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe provision of public gender services to young people in Australia is led by the states and territories, who are responsible for the relevant services.\u201d The Cass review has been criticised by some Australian clinicians and trans health experts for having an unrealistic threshold for high-quality evidence, effectively discounting some moderate-quality observational studies and placing a high emphasis on the need for randomised control trials, considered the gold standard of scientific research. They say Cass\u2019s threshold for scientific evidence is unrealistic when it comes to trans gender health. Randomised control trials are not always feasible or ethical to conduct, the vice-president of the Australian Professional Association for Trans Health (AusPATH), Dr Portia Predny, said. Many areas of medicine, including perinatal care and paediatric care, lack randomised control trials, she said. \u201cAdditionally, when you have multiple observational studies looking at a particular intervention and those studies are producing similar findings, the cumulative evidence becomes compelling.\u201d Applying the findings and recommendations of the Cass review to the care of young people in Australia \u201cwas fundamentally flawed\u201d because it looked specifically at the NHS system, she added. The Queensland health minister, Shannon Fentiman, said the state\u2019s Children\u2019s Gender Service \u201cis considered one of the best in the country, and continually reviews its models of care to ensure it is based off the best available evidence\u201d. \u201cAll trans young people deserve access to high-quality and timely healthcare and that is something we are committed to continue providing,\u201d she said. The NSW health minister, Ryan Park, said trans and gender-diverse healthcare is a complex and evolving practice area. \u201cNSW Health continues to monitor developments in the evidence to ensure the care we provide remains consistent with national and international best practice,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 May 2024 to clarify some details about criticisms of the Cass review."

The Guardian spoke to volunteer healthcare workers from the UK who have travelled to Gaza with aid organisations since 7 October who claimed the Israeli military was deliberately targeting healthcare infrastructure. They also expressed concerns about continuing their humanitarian work in Gaza after seven international aid workers, including three Britons, were killed by an Israeli airstrike. Aid and health workers account for at least 700 of the more than 32,000 people killed in Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza, according to the UN and the Palestinian health ministry. Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, only 10 are partly functioning, according to the World Health Organization. Hospitals have been battlegrounds since the start of the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which followed an attack by Hamas in Israel on 7 October that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The IDF, which has been approached for comment, has previously said that Hamas \u201csystematically\u201d uses hospitals and medical centres to conduct terror activities. Volunteer medical workers have described a health system on its knees: treating traumatic injuries, many in children, in overwhelmed hospitals with limited resources, staff and nutrition. Hospitals, health workers and patients are protected under international humanitarian law. \u201cThey\u2019ve been deliberately targeting healthcare workers, healthcare vehicles, healthcare buildings since October 7th,\u201d said Maynard, who led a medical emergency team to Gaza in December with Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) and the International Rescue Committee. The IDF chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, said the strike that killed all seven members of a convoy of humanitarian workers from World Central Kitchen was a \u201cmistake\u201d after a misidentification at night. In the UK, the airstrike has drawn intense scrutiny over the government\u2019s decision to continue arming Israel. \u201cI\u2019m in no doubt in my mind this is just yet another example of a deliberate targeting of healthcare professionals and healthcare vehicles,\u201d said Maynard. In January, after Maynard\u2019s team had left and was followed by another, an Israeli airstrike hit their accommodation compound in al-Mawasi, injuring a number of team members and the compound\u2019s security guard. At a press briefing on Wednesday, the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the killing of the seven humanitarian workers, adding he was also \u201cappalled\u201d that al-Shifa hospital had been put out of action after a two-week military siege. The UN condemned the destruction and killing at the hospital, with health workers and patients among those reportedly killed. \u201cAt this point, we are no longer discussing availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of healthcare received in dignity, but the annihilation of any infrastructure capable of providing basic first aid,\u201d the UN human rights office said. \u201cThat level of destruction is unbelievable,\u201d said Dr Abdel Hammad, a transplant surgeon from Liverpool who was working at al-Shifa with a transplant charity in October, before evacuating from Gaza in November. \u201cBecause they get away with the first strike on a hospital it became a normal routine in this war.\u201d Hammad said colleagues at al-Shifa had shared \u201cunbelievable\u201d stories of people and patients left to die. He was told a plastic surgeon, Dr Ahmed Almaqadma, was taken from the hospital with his mother, Yusra, and their bodies were found nearby as forces withdrew. The IDF described the operation at al-Shifa as one of the most successful of the nearly six-month conflict and cited the killing of 200 militants including senior operatives. The claim they were all militants could not be confirmed. Since the conflict began, the WHO has verified 906 attacks on healthcare in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Israel and Lebanon, resulting in 736 deaths and more than 1,000 injuries. \u201cHospitals must be respected and protected, they must not be used as battlefields,\u201d said Tedros. During his first sleepless night in Gaza, Dr James Smith tried to count the continuous thuds from airstrikes. At about 200 he lost count. \u201cAll you would do would be to think, where has that missile dropped? On whom has it landed?\u201d said the 35-year-old emergency doctor from London. \u201cTo be within such close proximity to fire and airstrikes every second of every day was incredibly frightening and to know that the only thing that was keeping us safe was that our location had been supposedly deconflicted with the Israeli military, that was terrifying, frankly.\u201d The severity of the injuries he encountered during a two-week trip to Gaza at al-Aqsa hospital were unlike anything he had ever seen. One child had a bilateral traumatic amputation, with two remaining limbs heavily mangled. Another child had severe, unsurvivable burns. People died on the floor without their relatives. Others bled to death. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable to me that these are not targeted attacks, whether they\u2019re against Palestinian people, whether they\u2019re against healthcare workers, whether they\u2019re against humanitarian workers,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf you target healthcare workers and if you target the healthcare system and healthcare facilities, you are demonstrating a form of psychological warfare wherein you say nobody and nowhere is safe.\u201d Dr Deborah Harrington, an obstetrician who works in Oxford and travelled to Gaza with MAP, described an overwhelmed al-Aqsa hospital with \u201chuge\u201d numbers of child casualties from bombings and traumatic injuries. During their time there, she and Smith said a bullet was shot through into the intensive care unit, though neither were present at the time. Harrington, who has been travelling to Gaza since 2016, described the attacks on hospitals as the \u201csystematic dismantling of the healthcare system\u201d. \u201cI am ashamed and disgusted that those protections are not afforded to anyone trying to deliver aid but also to civilians,\u201d she said. \u201cConflict should not be on civilians and it should not be on the people trying to help them.\u201d Upon arriving at the European public hospital in southern Gaza in February, Dr Konstantina Ilia Karydi and her team were told the hospital had about 1,000 patients for the hospital\u2019s 220-bed capacity before the war. Nearby, more than 22,000 people were sheltering in tents. \u201cYou cannot imagine all the terrible conditions that all these people live under,\u201d said the 43-year-old anaesthetist. Over two weeks they treated open fractures, reconstructive surgeries, blast or shrapnel injuries and gunshot wounds. Medical masks were washed and reused, she said, and opioids for pain relief were used only in operating rooms. The team limited their movements, remaining inside the hospital after the compound strike in January. \u201cIt\u2019s just impossible that IDF didn\u2019t know who was in the car,\u201d said Karydi of Monday\u2019s airstrike. Aid groups working in Gaza provide the coordinates of their movements to Israeli forces via a system of deconfliction, which operates through the UN. \u201cYou\u2019re targeting humanitarian organisations knowing that they will suspend their operations because they have to,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does this mean? You\u2019re trying to scare off people, you\u2019re trying to make them leave.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-05T14:00:07Z",
            "content": "Advertisements offering patients \u201csimple\u201d access to their superannuation to pay for medical treatments have been described by the peak consumer health body as a \u201cworrying trend\u201d amid the cost-of-living crisis. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) approved 37,400 individuals to access their superannuation early on compassionate medical grounds in 2022-23, releasing a total of $730m. That compares with 30,100 individuals and $545m the previous year. Of those approved in 2022-23, 13,540 people used the funds for dental treatment, 2,780 for IVF and 14,410 for weight loss treatments. The chief executive of the Consumers Health Forum, Dr Elizabeth Deveny, said: \u201cTogether with the rising cost of living, we believe that one of the reasons more people are dipping into their super to pay for their healthcare costs is because of the increasing privatisation of Australian healthcare. \u201cIt is a worrying trend.\u201d She said that as more services were offered privately \u2013 rather than through Medicare \u2013 people would increasingly need to pay large out-of-pocket amounts to cover their healthcare costs. There are strict rules about accessing super for medical treatment. Individuals must provide the ATO with a medical report from two registered medical practitioners, one of whom must be a specialist in the field of treatment. The reports must certify that the treatment is required to treat a life-threatening illness or injury, alleviate acute or chronic pain or alleviate an acute or chronic mental illness and that treatment is not readily available in the public health system. But numerous online advertisements, especially for dental treatment, describe accessing superannuation for medical purposes as a \u201cquick\u201d and \u201csimple\u201d process and offer services to help patients to do so. \u201cWe are concerned about a business model where private providers are helping people to access their super for this reason, in tandem with promoting clinics who offer a range of services,\u201d Deveny said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWhile we recognise that it is not illegal for dental practitioners to be advertising in this way, we aren\u2019t exactly thrilled by it either. For us, it is a worrying trend that more and more health professions might soon start encouraging their patients to dig into their super too.\u201d In February, the financial services minister, Stephen Jones, said in an address to the Sydney Institute: \u201cThere are surgeons and medical practitioners who view super as their personal river of gold. \u201cThey are encouraging, and even pressuring, patients to tap into their super for what might be termed life\u2011enhancing procedures like cosmetic surgery,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are business models set up to game the system. It is greedy.\u201d A spokesperson for the minister said he stood by the comments, and that the objective of superannuation was \u201cto preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement\u201d. The spokesperson said ATO data could not be examined at a more granular level to determine the process that led to the release of funds, but said the minister had been approached by \u201cconcerned stakeholders\u201d concerned that \u201cindividuals are actively encouraged to access their super to pay for medical procedures\u201d. An ATO spokesperson said staff thoroughly reviewed every application to determine whether they met a lawful ground for release of funds. But the scheme \u201cappropriately and necessarily relies on the professional ethics of medical professionals to provide accurate reports\u201d, the spokesperson said. \u201cATO staff are not equipped, or required, to question a patient\u2019s diagnosis or the required treatment strategy. \u201cIt would be deeply inappropriate for the ATO to interfere in the relationship between a patient and their medical professional and double-guess a diagnosis.\u201d The chief executive of the Australian Dental Association, Damian Mitsch, said if people could not access dental care unless they dipped into superannuation it was \u201cindicative of a healthcare system in which some people are desperate and unable to afford essential care\u201d. \u201cOur advice to Australians is that accessing superannuation can have long term financial effects \u2026 people should properly understand what the long term financial impact is before agreeing to sign off on a superannuation withdrawal.\u201d \u2022 Do you regret accessing superannuation for medical reasons? contact melissa.davey@theguardian.com"

            "date": "2024-04-15T10:01:18Z",
            "content": "Apple has lost its spot as the world\u2019s biggest mobile phone seller after a steep sales drop as South Korean rival Samsung retook the lead in the global market share. Samsung had been the biggest seller of mobile phones for 12 years until the end of 2023, when sales of Apple\u2019s iPhone models overtook it. Global smartphone shipments increased by 8% to 289.4m units during January-March, according to research firm IDC. Samsung won a 20.8% market share, beating Apple\u2019s 17.3% share, which has been dented by slowing sales in China. IDC said that Apple shipped 50.1m iPhones in the first quarter, down from the 55.4m units it shipped in the same period last year. It was the biggest drop in iPhone sales since Covid-19 lockdowns caused global supply chain chaos in 2022. The drop in Apple sales, despite a growing global market, was partly ascribed to difficulties in China. Local rivals including Xiaomi and Huawei have put pressure on Apple and Samsung. At the same time, China\u2019s government has moved to ban devices made by foreign companies from workplaces. Apple is still the dominant player at the top end of the global smartphone market, and sales of the iPhone are its most important product. The company\u2019s market value was $2.7tn (\u00a32.16tn) on Friday, far ahead of every other smartphone maker and behind only Microsoft, which has been boosted by expectations of a boom in artificial intelligence. However, the back-and-forth movement at the top of the market highlights the intense competition among smartphone makers for market share. Xiaomi, China\u2019s top smartphone maker, occupied the third position with a market share of 14.1% during the first quarter. Samsung launched its latest high-end S24 models at the start of the year, helping it to increase sales. Samsung has bet heavily on AI features such as automatic phone call translation and video editing software to promote the S24 series. Investors are hoping that Apple will give more details of its own AI capabilities at a developer conference in June. Apple has reportedly scrapped an effort to build its own electric car, partly to shift resources to working on AI."

            "content": "Robin McKie\u2019s article rings alarm bells for global health and our failure to control airborne pathogens (\u201cWhat virus will cause the next pandemic? It\u2019s flu, say scientists\u201d). We are rightly looking with concern at the spread of H5N1 and the risk it poses to humans, but we have still not applied the hard-won lessons learned from Covid 19. While all agencies and experts now (belatedly) admit to Covid\u2019s airborne spread, very little has been done to make indoor spaces safer for us all, and the clinically vulnerable in particular, for whom shops, workplaces, restaurants, and even clinical settings have become high-risk areas. With new Office for National Statistics data showing 2 million people reporting long Covid, we need to wake up to the need to improve indoor air quality through better ventilation, filtration or UV disinfection. This should be high on the agenda of the negotiating team crafting the pandemic agreement, to be unveiled at next month\u2019s World Health Assembly. But it remains silent on these essential public health protections. Without global commitment to action (and accountability) we will continue to be vulnerable to waves of deadly and debilitating diseases, with disastrous consequences for society, economy and health services.

Two weeks into a new job, driving to Faro to pick up my wife and baby daughter at the airport. Greeted by tanks on the runway blocking aircraft landing and Angolan soldiers with mirrored sunglasses brandishing AK47s in the arrivals terminal. There was nothing on the radio about a pop song linked to the revolutionary left. The rallying call of the revolution was A Life on the Ocean Wave, the anthem of the Royal Marines. I have no idea why. On 25 April 1974 that was played repeatedly on the radio, and for many days after. Whenever there was a rumour of a counter coup, A Life on the Ocean Wave was broadcast on state-controlled radio, mobilising shotgun-armed farmers in the Alentejo and Algarve to blockade roads to Lisbon and mobilising students armed with AK47s in Lisbon to career around the streets in army trucks. Whenever you heard the anthem, it was time to stay home with your head down. Christopher Walton Launceston, Cornwall In negativity, nobody wins Stewart Lee is spot on (\u201cAndrew Neil needs to be more Vorderman, less Voldemort\u201d). The reason this world is in such a mess is entirely due to greed, ignorance, loss of faith in ourselves, poverty, overbreeding and worship of money. The humanitarians are doing their best to climb mountains. The charities are saving lives. George Monbiot is raising awareness of the responsibility we all have to take care of the planet. The thing we all have is an ability to create. If we choose positivity and good works, we flourish. If we wallow in negativity, nobody wins. Ultimately, we all have an opportunity to choose life, health and happiness over death and destruction. The only real power we have is our signature, and our ability to vote. Consider your own conscience and your own family and friends. Do not accept the lies told without checking the facts. The world can do better. Julie Taylor Kippax, Leeds The Observer has historically been the vehicle and stimulus for many changes for the better in the UK. Could you not initiate a movement to invite Stewart Lee to be in charge of, you know, everything? Brian Smith Berlin Denim, legacy of empire \u201cDoes this painting prove denim predates Levi\u2019s by 200 years?\u201d asks your article. Denim is a legacy of empire. Far from being western, the origins of denim go back to India in the 16th century to the port of Dongri, from where we get the word dungarees. Sailors on the ships using Dongri wore this hardwearing blue fabric and the production of cotton and indigo in this part of the world was primarily by slave labour. This was beautifully depicted by The Singh Twins in their piece entitled Indigo: The Colour of India as part of their Slaves of Fashion exhibition (2018). Jenny Payne Colchester Change debt collection law Given that the fundamental principle of English law is that one is innocent until proven guilty, should debt collection agencies not be required to prove beyond all reasonable doubt their accusations against people whom they claim owe money (\u201cUnregulated \u2018identity tracers\u2019 harass people for debts they do not owe\u201d)? One recalls the tragic case of Beryl Brazier, who was falsely accused and harassed by one such agency over a debt and in 2012 was driven to suicide. While regulation of debt collection agencies is to be welcomed, a change in the law is needed immediately. Chris Waller Bristol Why the silence on Qatar? Thank you to Kenan Malik for mentioning the shutdown of the congress for Palestine in Berlin on 12 April (\u201cLeft silences right, right silences left. But censorship stops us pushing for change\u201d). As a German national, I find it difficult to believe how little coverage the shutdown and the muzzling of Yanis Varoufakis was given in the German media. I also find it surprising how little protest there is against the state of Qatar, which is happily giving refuge to the leaders of Hamas. Where are the calls to shut down ties with Qatar for supporting Hamas? Or is it that there is just too much capital involved in Qatar and therefore Qatar is beyond criticism? Dr Britta Kleinsorge Cambridge A royal development too far Rowan Moore\u2019s article on Faversham is not the first and I fear will not be the last (\u201cIs Kent ready for the next Poundbury?\u201d). In the last few years, the town has grown enormously; in fact, it is encircled by new developments. I have always respected King Charles\u2019s foresight on environmental issues, but to build a Poundbury mark 2 on our town\u2019s boundary, using up yet more productive land, is a travesty. With Poundbury, a point has been made as to how new developments could be. Leave it at that. With respect to his majesty, he is not a property developer, nor should he be.

            "content": "Influenza is the pathogen most likely to trigger a new pandemic in the near future, according to leading scientists. An international survey, to be published next weekend, will reveal that 57% of senior disease experts now think that a strain of flu virus will be the cause of the next global outbreak of deadly infectious illness. The belief that influenza is the world\u2019s greatest pandemic threat is based on long-term research showing it is constantly evolving and mutating, said Cologne University\u2019s Jon Salmanton-Garc\u00eda, who carried out the study. \u201cEach winter influenza appears,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could describe these outbreaks as little pandemics. They are more or less controlled because the different strains that cause them are not virulent enough \u2013 but that will not necessarily be the case for ever.\u201d Details of the survey \u2013 which involved inputs from a total of 187 senior scientists \u2013 will be revealed at European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) congress in Barcelona next weekend. The next most likely cause of a pandemic, after influenza, is likely to be a virus \u2013 dubbed Disease X \u2013 that is still unknown to science, according to 21% of the experts who took part in the study. They believe the next pandemic will be caused by an as-yet-to-be-identified micro-organism that will appear out of the blue, just as the Sars-CoV-2 virus, the cause of Covid-19, did, when it started to infect humans in 2019. Indeed, some scientists still believe Sars-CoV-2 remains a threat, with 15% of the scientists surveyed in the study rating it their most likely cause of a pandemic in the near future. Other deadly micro-organisms \u2013 such as Lassa, Nipah, Ebola and Zika viruses \u2013 were rated as serious global threats by only 1% to 2% of respondents. \u201cInfluenza remained \u2013 by a very large degree, the number one threat in terms of its pandemic potential in the eyes of a large majority of world scientists,\u201d added Salmanton-Garc\u00eda. Last week, the World Health Organization raised fears about the alarming spread of the H5N1 strain of influenza that is causing millions of cases of avian flu across the globe. This outbreak began in 2020 and has led to the deaths or killing of tens of millions of poultry and has also wiped out millions of wild birds. Most recently, the virus has spread to mammal species, including domestic cattle which are now infected in 12 states in the US, further increasing fears about the risks to humans. The more mammalian species the virus infects, the more opportunities it has to evolve into a strain that is dangerous to humans, Daniel Goldhill, of the Royal Veterinary College in Hatfield, told the journal Nature last week. The appearance of the H5N1 virus in cattle was a surprise, added virologist Ed Hutchinson, of Glasgow University. \u201cPigs can get avian flu but until recently cattle did not. They were infected with their own strains of the disease. So the appearance of H5N1 in cows was a shock. \u201cIt means that the risks of the virus getting into more and more farm animals, and then from farm animals into humans just gets higher and higher. The more the virus spreads, then the chances of it mutating so it can spread into humans goes up and up. Basically, we are rolling the dice with this virus.\u201d To date, there has been no indication that H5N1 is spreading between humans. But in hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals over the past 20 years, the impact has been grim. \u201cThe mortality rate is extraordinarily high because humans have no natural immunity to the virus\u201d, said Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization. The prospect of a flu pandemic is alarming, although scientists also point out that vaccines against many strains, including H5N1, have already been developed. \u201cIf there was an avian flu pandemic it would still be a massive logistical challenge to produce vaccines at the scale and speed that will be needed. However, we would be much further down that road than we were with Covid-19 when a vaccine had to be developed from scratch,\u201d said Hutchinson. Nevertheless, some lessons of preventing disease spread have been forgotten since the end of the Covid pandemic, said Salmanton-Garc\u00eda. \u201cPeople have gone back to coughing into their hands and then shaking hands with other people. Mask-wearing has disappeared. We are going back to our old bad habits. We may come to regret that.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-15T10:00:45Z",
            "content": "The devastating impact of the pandemic on the world\u2019s poorest countries has brought poverty reduction to a halt and led to a widening income gap with nations in the rich west, the World Bank has warned. In a report released to coincide with its half-yearly meeting, the Washington-based organisation said half of the world\u2019s 75 poorest nations had seen income per head rise more slowly than in developed countries over the past five years. Urging governments and the private sector to do more to help tackle what it called a \u201cgreat reversal\u201d, the Bank said that since 2019 there had been a surge in food insecurity and debt distress. The Bank\u2019s data showed that one in three countries eligible for grants and concessional loans under its International Development Association (IDA) arm was poorer, on average, than it was on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic. Not since the last five years of the 20th century had more than half of the poorest countries experienced income per head grow more slowly than in developed countries. Ajay Banga, the World Bank\u2019s president, will use the bleak findings of the report to press donors \u2013 who meet every three years to replenish IDA \u2013 to be generous. Final pledges will not be made until the end of 2024 but Banga has already said the needs of poor countries mean the next round of funding should be the \u201clargest of all time\u201d. Although countries rich and poor were affected by the pandemic, the Bank\u2019s study found the extreme-poverty rate in the most hard-pressed countries was more than eight times the average in the rest of the world. One in four people in IDA countries had to manage on less than $2.15 a day \u2013 the global definition of poverty. \u201cThese countries now account for 90% of all people facing hunger or malnutrition,\u201d the Bank said. \u201cHalf of these countries are either in debt distress or at high risk of it. Still, except for the World Bank Group and other multilateral development donors, foreign lenders \u2013 private as well as government creditors \u2013 have been backing away from them.\u201d More than half of all IDA countries \u2013 39 of the 75 \u2013 are in sub-Saharan Africa, while 14, mainly small island states are in east Asia. Eight are in Latin America and the Caribbean, and in south Asia, only India is not an IDA country. The Bank said 31 IDA countries had per capita incomes of less than $1,315 a year (\u00a31,050), while 33 were fragile and conflict-affected states. On the positive side, the Bank said at a time when populations were ageing nearly everywhere else, IDA countries would enjoy a growing share of young workers through 2070 \u2013 a potential \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d. They were also rich in natural resources, had high potential for solar-energy generation, and boasted a large reservoir of mineral deposits that could be crucial for the world\u2019s transition to clean energy. \u201cThe world cannot afford to turn its back on IDA countries,\u201d said Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist. \u201cThe welfare of these countries has always been crucial to the long-term outlook for global prosperity. Three of the world\u2019s economic powerhouses today \u2013 China, India, and South Korea \u2013 were all once IDA borrowers. All three prospered in ways that whittled down extreme poverty and raised living standards. With help from abroad, today\u2019s batch of IDA countries has the potential to do the same.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-21T21:12:47Z",
            "content": "The Senate committee that has been examining Australia\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has recommended the establishment of a royal commission, arguing the case for a full-blown inquiry with investigative powers is \u201coverwhelming\u201d. In a report tabled out of parliamentary session on Friday, the Senate\u2019s legal and constitutional affairs committee said a royal commission should be created to examine the key elements of the pandemic\u2019s emergency phase. These should include virus testing, contact tracing, quarantine protocols, the impact of lockdowns, the procurement of vaccines and the capacity of the health, education, aged care and housing and domestic violence systems to respond to the crisis. It advocated looking at all this in light of costs and benefits, in order to record lessons to be learned. The report also said the commission should look at the impact of these policies on different sections of the community. Among the committee\u2019s seven members, the decision to call for a royal commission was not universal. The Coalition members \u2013 whose government under Scott Morrison was in office through the pandemic\u2019s emergency phase \u2013 called for the further inquiry, along with the Greens. Members who were part of the Albanese Labor government argued their own now-completed Senate inquiry would suffice. \u201cThere are strong views with respect to a range of issues, including the response of federal and state governments,\u201d the committee\u2019s majority report said. It was \u201cimperative\u201d that Australia learn from Covid-19 in preparing for any future pandemic. The committee is chaired by the Liberal senator Paul Scarr and has one other Liberal and one Nationals member. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The sole Greens representative, senator David Shoebridge, also endorsed the call. \u201cWhen an extraordinary event of the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic occurs it would be foolish not to reflect on how society responded to it, to learn valuable lessons that can be applied in the future,\u201d Shoebridge says in additional remarks in the report. \u201cA royal commission has the independence needed, including the power to compel answers from often unwilling governments, to give the public confidence that its final report and any recommendations will be credible and unbiased. \u201cWith all the sacrifices we made Australians deserve at least this\u201d. In disagreeing with the royal commission call, deputy chair and Labor senator Nita Green and fellow Labor senator Varun Ghosh pointed to a separate government-commissioned independent 12-month inquiry into the Covid-19 response, led by Robyn Kruk AO, which is due to report on 30 September. Its scope does not include state and territory decisions, including on lockdowns. The Labor senators said that inquiry will report \u201csignificantly earlier than a royal commission would have reported, thereby allowing Australia to learn the lessons of the Covid-19 response and improve our preparedness for future pandemics earlier than a royal commission would have permitted\u201d. \u201cIn recent times, some royal commissions have taken many years \u2013 up to half a decade \u2013 to report,\u201d they say. The pair argued there was \u201cunnecessary duplication\u201d between the proposed royal commission and \u201cnumerous\u201d other inquiries. The report said there should be particular scrutiny of the policies and practices relating to lockdowns, school closures, social distancing, mask mandates, remote working arrangements, border closures, quarantine rules, vaccine mandates, the vaccine-claims system, governance structures, government decision-making and communications, supply chains, the labour market and business sustainability. It said a commission should examine the adequacy of planning on the heath, social, economic and human rights implications of the pandemic, the consistency between planning and actual response and the level of coordination between governments. It also recommended that the federal government encourage the states and territories to pass complementary legislation to allow them to also participate in a national royal commission. \u201cThe committee considers that there is an overwhelming case for the establishment of a Covid-19 royal commission,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe people of Australia deserve an opportunity to learn from the experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the response to it.\u201d"

            "content": "The grocery courier firm Getir is to quit the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and the US to focus on its home market of Turkey amid heavy competition and waning demand for rapid home deliveries. The closure marks the latest shakeout of the fast grocery delivery industry which grew rapidly during the Covid pandemic but has sharply retreated since. It is not clear how many jobs are affected. In late 2021 the group had 1,500 employees in the UK, according to accounts filed at Companies House, most of whom were likely to be delivery riders. However, the group has since ceased operating in several British cities including Liverpool and Birmingham. The latest retreat comes after Getir cut 2,500 jobs \u2013 more than a tenth of its workforce \u2013 last year. The company pulled out of France, Spain, Italy and Portugal as the cost of living crisis dampened demand for grocery deliveries in less than 20 minutes, while its own costs have also gone up. Getir said it would retain its US arm FreshDirect \u2013 only bought a few months ago \u2013 and said the closures only affected 7% of sales. Set up in 2015, Getir grew into one of the largest of more than a dozen delivery app companies, promising to deliver groceries in minutes and offering hefty discounts to attract customers. However, most of its rivals have been sold or closed down. Those that remain have tightened their operations, laying off riders and selling warehouses. Getir bought its German rival Gorillas in a $1.2bn (\u00a3960m) deal in 2022 after snapping up the UK\u2019s Weezy a year earlier. The smaller London-based firm Jiffy ceased deliveries in 2022 while the US operator Gopuff bought Fancy and Dija, both UK companies, in 2021. Getir was valued at up to $11.8bn when it raised funds in March 2022, but its valuation was slashed to $6.5bn in a funding round in April last year. The market continues to be highly competitive: the takeaway delivery firms Deliveroo, JustEat and Uber Eats have tied up with supermarkets to deliver groceries, while Tesco has its in-house service Whoosh, Sainsbury\u2019s has Chop Chop and Ocado has Zoom. One of the last remaining quick grocery specialists, Gopuff, launched in the UK in 2021, and operates in London and other big cities including Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham, Leeds and Cardiff. Zapp continues to operate in London."

            "date": "2024-04-04T06:00:07Z",
            "content": "Delivery app riders pedalling through cities and tailbacks at drive-throughs were familiar signs of Britain\u2019s hunger for takeaway food at the peak of the Covid pandemic. Now a study suggests it became an enduring habit. After a boom in orders on Deliveroo, Just Eat and other platforms by locked-down consumers, research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests the popularity of takeaways, meal deliveries and food-on-the-go bought from retailer such as sandwiches and crisps has remained above pre-pandemic levels after the removal of Covid restrictions. Analysing data on shopping habits from thousands of consumers, the thinktank said calorie consumption from takeaway food grew by more than 50% during the height of the pandemic \u2013 and had stayed high thereafter, as households continued to opt for a night in front of the TV instead of a meal at restaurant or pub. Highlighting a big shift in the country\u2019s diet and sources of nutrition, the IFS said a legacy of the Covid lockdowns could include long-term effects on health and weight. The study, which was funded by the Obesity Policy Research Unit at University College London, estimated that before the pandemic, the average UK adult consumed about 270 calories a week from takeaways. This increased to 395 calories a week during the first lockdown in 2020, when restaurants, pubs and cafes were forced to close as the pandemic spread. While the reopening of hospitality later in the year fuelled a decline in takeaway consumption, levels still remained higher than before the pandemic \u2013 even while the government\u2019s \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme was in place. During the third national lockdown in England in 2021, calorie consumption from takeaways ballooned further to an average of 470 calories a week as the country adapted to living with the pandemic and more restaurants and pubs switched to accommodate takeaway orders. However, despite the easing of restrictions, these higher levels endured after the widespread reopening of hospitality venues, at about 400 calories a week by early 2022 \u2013 50% above pre-pandemic levels. The researchers said they had only been able to examine data up to the first quarter of 2022 , before the cost of living crisis. This meaning it is not entirely clear whether the UK\u2019s takeaway habit survived the sharpest jump in food prices since the 1970s. However, the initial findings suggest a marked shift. The study also found the size of households\u2019 food shopping baskets increased at the height of the pandemic in 2020, but then largely returned to normal. Overall calorie purchases had returned to 2019 levels by 2022, suggesting that the increase in takeaways has come at the expense of coffee shops, pubs and restaurants. Andrew McKendrick, a research economist at IFS, said: \u201cLockdowns and closures of hospitality left a bigger role for consumption of food at home and for takeaways. But, by the start of 2022, most of these changes had been reversed: households had largely gone back to purchasing as much as they did in 2019. \u201cThe pandemic did leave one legacy, though, in the much-increased use of takeaways.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-26T10:20:58Z",
            "content": "Doctors have begun trialling in hundreds of patients the world\u2019s first personalised mRNA cancer vaccine for melanoma, as experts hailed its \u201cgamechanging\u201d potential to permanently cure cancer. Melanoma affects about 132,000 people a year globally and is the biggest skin cancer killer. Currently, surgery is the main treatment although radiotherapy, medicines and chemotherapy are also sometimes used. Now experts are testing new jabs that are custom-built for each patient and tell their body to hunt down cancer cells to prevent the disease ever coming back. A phase 2 trial found the vaccines dramatically reduced the risk of the cancer returning in melanoma patients. Now a final, phase 3, trial has been launched and is being led by University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH). Dr Heather Shaw, the national coordinating investigator for the trial, said the jabs had the potential to cure people with melanoma and are being tested in other cancers, including lung, bladder and kidney. \u201cThis is one of the most exciting things we\u2019ve seen in a really long time,\u201d said Shaw. \u201cThis is a really finely honed tool. To be able to sit there and say to your patients that you\u2019re offering them something that\u2019s effectively like the Fat Duck at Bray versus McDonald\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s that level of cordon bleu that\u2019s coming to them \u2026 The patients are really excited about them.\u201d The vaccine is an individualised neoantigen therapy. It is designed to trigger the immune system so it can fight back against a patient\u2019s specific type of cancer and tumour. Known as mRNA-4157 (V940), the vaccine targets tumour neoantigens, which are expressed by tumours in a particular patient. These are markers on the tumour that can potentially be recognised by the immune system. The jab carries coding for up to 34 neoantigens and activates an anti-tumour immune response based on the unique mutations in a patient\u2019s cancer. To personalise it, a sample of tumour is removed during the patient\u2019s surgery, followed by DNA sequencing and the use of artificial intelligence. The result is a custom-built anti-cancer jab that is specific to the patient\u2019s tumour. \u201cThis is very much an individualised therapy and it\u2019s far cleverer in some senses than a vaccine,\u201d said Shaw. \u201cIt is absolutely custom-built for the patient \u2013 you couldn\u2019t give this to the next patient in the line because you wouldn\u2019t expect it to work. \u201cThey may have some shared new antigens, but they\u2019re likely to have their own very individual new antigens that are important to their tumour and so, therefore, it is truly personalised.\u201d The ultimate aim to permanently cure patients of their cancer, Shaw said. \u201cI think there is a real hope that these will be the gamechangers in immunotherapy,\u201d she said. Patients received 1mg of the mRNA vaccine every three weeks for a maximum of nine doses, and 200mg of Keytruda every three weeks (maximum 18 doses) for about a year. The phase 3 global trial will now include a wider range of patients, and aims to recruit about 1,100 people. The UK arm aims to recruit at least 60 to 70 patients across eight centres, including in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Leeds. One of the first patients on the trial at UCLH is Steve Young, 52, from Stevenage in Hertfordshire. \u201cI\u2019m really, really excited,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my best chance at stopping the cancer in its tracks.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 26 April 2024 to add relevant personal details to the main image caption."

            "date": "2024-04-12T13:00:55Z",
            "content": "On a particularly warm autumn afternoon in Buenos Aires, Michelly Natal\u00ed Barreto S\u00e1nchez, 22, began to feel unwell. As she served customers at La Boca, the bar she had opened in Villa 31, one of the capital\u2019s largest slums, she suddenly started to experience severe headaches and dizziness. She told her customers, who are among the 70,000 people who live in this densely populated area close to the city centre, that she would have to close the bar, and she headed home. \u201cIt was a matter of hours before I felt pains all over my body,\u201d she says. \u201cMy bones hurt. I tried to eat, and everything came back up, and in the following days, I couldn\u2019t even swallow water. I vomited the medication I took and had to hold on to the walls to walk.\u201d Dengue in Argentina broke a record this year. In the first eight weeks of 2024, authorities reported 57,461 confirmed cases and 47 deaths, a 2,153% increase compared with the same period last year. Recent data from the health ministry indicates a new record was reached in March when cases rose to 233,000 and deaths to 161. The spike in cases occurred in the same year Argentina registered record temperatures, providing the conditions for the Aedes aegypti mosquito to thrive. An as-yet-unpublished report from the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Conicet) associated with the University of Buenos Aires, two leading Argentine institutions, paints a picture of the current state of the epidemic in the country. \u201cOur study shows that the thermal favourability for the mosquito to continue acting for longer has increased and, in this year\u2019s case, has spread among more people,\u201d says Sylvia Fischer, a researcher at Conicet and a co-author of the forthcoming report. \u201cThe conditions of large cities, with a large part of the population living in densely populated areas, is another significant factor.\u201d Hospital overcrowding aggravates the epidemic\u2019s impact on vulnerable people. Natal\u00ed Barreto witnessed dreadful scenes when she spent a week at a public hospital. \u201cI waited 11 hours to be seen in a waiting room where people screamed in pain from their bones,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are many interns there. They kept missing my vein, and I was reluctant to let them draw my blood any more.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Salgado, 31, is a cartonero, a cardboard collector in the city\u2019s rubbish dumps, who contracted dengue haemorrhagic fever, a severe form of the disease. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very clear to me how exposed I was until the doctors who treated me later explained. I feel that there aren\u2019t information campaigns, at least not as there should be, in the densely populated neighbourhoods,\u201d says Salgado, who lives in Berazat\u00e9gui, a district in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. \u201cDigging through trash, which for many Argentinians is their only job, is highly dangerous amid a dengue epidemic,\u201d says Fischer. More than 57% of Argentina\u2019s 46 million people live in poverty. A 2022 report from the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development under the Peronist government of Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez noted: \u201cIn rural populations and densely populated urban neighbourhoods, the conditions of temperature, humidity, and water precipitation favour the reproduction of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. This risk is especially present in areas of unplanned urban expansion.\u201d That is the case in Berazat\u00e9gui: children playing football on vacant land punctuated by puddles of water \u2013 a breeding ground for mosquitoes \u2013 is a common sight. Environmentalists point to the government\u2019s responsibility for the high dengue figures. Camila Mercure, responsible for climate policy at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation, argues that far-right president Javier Milei\u2019s decision to downgrade the environment ministry \u201cdoes not aid in the formulation of public policies\u201d. Carlos Regazzoni, a doctor and former Buenos Aires secretary of social development, says vaccination would be essential to fight the dengue epidemic. However, although approved by the National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Technology (Anmat), the vaccine is not on the agenda. The government argues that there is no evidence to prove its efficacy across all age groups and that vaccinating now would not combat the current outbreak, as it would only protect people from future outbreaks. Only those who can afford to pay private clinics between $150 and $160 (\u00a3120 to \u00a3127) get vaccinated. \u201cIt would be worrying and frustrating if this decision were related to a government\u2019s denialist stance,\u201d says Regazzoni. When asked about the government\u2019s concern regarding dengue, Milei\u2019s government spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said: \u201cAnything that kills human beings is a concern for the government, including car accidents.\u201d On ruling out the inclusion of the dengue vaccine in the country\u2019s vaccination schedule in March, Adorni told a press conference: \u201cImmunity is obtained with time, so by vaccinating now, that immunity will only be obtained in four months, when the mosquito is no longer an inconvenience, and the effectiveness has not been proven.\u201d The president\u2019s statements on the climate crisis reinforce the suspicion of vaccine denialism on the part of the Milei government. Milei has said that Argentina would not continue with the Paris Agreement and that global heating was a cyclical issue that would eventually pass. Milei\u2019s administration has made no secret of its contempt for environmental matters, and the president called the climate crisis a \u2018\u201csocialist lie\u201d, and reduced the health ministry\u2019s budget by 40%. On 2 April, the health ministry published a note on X that questioned the vaccine\u2019s efficacy, saying it would wait for \u201cmore scientific evidence\u201d before offering it to the public. \u201cThe vaccine is not a validated tool for controlling the transmission of the disease in the context of the outbreak, as expressed by the Pan American Health Organization\u201d, the note said. Mercure says the far-right government doesn\u2019t appear to care about the climate crisis or its consequences, such as the dengue fever outbreak. \u201cThe government seems to act as if it doesn\u2019t acknowledge global warnings and doesn\u2019t respect international commitments to mitigate the effects of climate change,\u201d she says. One consequence of this lack of interest is that stocks of mosquito repellants in Buenos Aires are not meeting demand. \u201cMy main issue with the government is not just the lack of public policies to combat dengue but also this shortage of repellants, which could be mitigated by government purchases and distribution to the public,\u201d Fischer says.

            "date": "2024-04-21T21:12:47Z",
            "content": "The Senate committee that has been examining Australia\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has recommended the establishment of a royal commission, arguing the case for a full-blown inquiry with investigative powers is \u201coverwhelming\u201d. In a report tabled out of parliamentary session on Friday, the Senate\u2019s legal and constitutional affairs committee said a royal commission should be created to examine the key elements of the pandemic\u2019s emergency phase. These should include virus testing, contact tracing, quarantine protocols, the impact of lockdowns, the procurement of vaccines and the capacity of the health, education, aged care and housing and domestic violence systems to respond to the crisis. It advocated looking at all this in light of costs and benefits, in order to record lessons to be learned. The report also said the commission should look at the impact of these policies on different sections of the community. Among the committee\u2019s seven members, the decision to call for a royal commission was not universal. The Coalition members \u2013 whose government under Scott Morrison was in office through the pandemic\u2019s emergency phase \u2013 called for the further inquiry, along with the Greens. Members who were part of the Albanese Labor government argued their own now-completed Senate inquiry would suffice. \u201cThere are strong views with respect to a range of issues, including the response of federal and state governments,\u201d the committee\u2019s majority report said. It was \u201cimperative\u201d that Australia learn from Covid-19 in preparing for any future pandemic. The committee is chaired by the Liberal senator Paul Scarr and has one other Liberal and one Nationals member. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The sole Greens representative, senator David Shoebridge, also endorsed the call. \u201cWhen an extraordinary event of the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic occurs it would be foolish not to reflect on how society responded to it, to learn valuable lessons that can be applied in the future,\u201d Shoebridge says in additional remarks in the report. \u201cA royal commission has the independence needed, including the power to compel answers from often unwilling governments, to give the public confidence that its final report and any recommendations will be credible and unbiased. \u201cWith all the sacrifices we made Australians deserve at least this\u201d. In disagreeing with the royal commission call, deputy chair and Labor senator Nita Green and fellow Labor senator Varun Ghosh pointed to a separate government-commissioned independent 12-month inquiry into the Covid-19 response, led by Robyn Kruk AO, which is due to report on 30 September. Its scope does not include state and territory decisions, including on lockdowns. The Labor senators said that inquiry will report \u201csignificantly earlier than a royal commission would have reported, thereby allowing Australia to learn the lessons of the Covid-19 response and improve our preparedness for future pandemics earlier than a royal commission would have permitted\u201d. \u201cIn recent times, some royal commissions have taken many years \u2013 up to half a decade \u2013 to report,\u201d they say. The pair argued there was \u201cunnecessary duplication\u201d between the proposed royal commission and \u201cnumerous\u201d other inquiries. The report said there should be particular scrutiny of the policies and practices relating to lockdowns, school closures, social distancing, mask mandates, remote working arrangements, border closures, quarantine rules, vaccine mandates, the vaccine-claims system, governance structures, government decision-making and communications, supply chains, the labour market and business sustainability. It said a commission should examine the adequacy of planning on the heath, social, economic and human rights implications of the pandemic, the consistency between planning and actual response and the level of coordination between governments. It also recommended that the federal government encourage the states and territories to pass complementary legislation to allow them to also participate in a national royal commission. \u201cThe committee considers that there is an overwhelming case for the establishment of a Covid-19 royal commission,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe people of Australia deserve an opportunity to learn from the experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the response to it.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-02T14:32:54Z",
            "content": "Cheaper private Covid jabs could end up being just as expensive as their pricier alternative because the vaccine must be given in groups of five, experts have warned. Boots and pharmacies that partner with the company Pharmadoctor are offering Pfizer/BioNTech jabs to those not eligible for a free vaccination through the NHS, with the former charging almost \u00a3100 a shot. The latter is also offering the latest Novavax jab, a protein-based vaccine, at a cost of about \u00a350. While experts have welcomed access to the jabs, they have also warned their high cost could widen inequalities. Concerns have been raised over the use of the Novavax jab, given each vial of the vaccine contains enough for five doses, which \u2013 once opened \u2013 must be used within 12 hours if refrigerated, and preferably immediately. Nathan Burley, a public health pharmacist and president of the Guild of Healthcare Pharmacists, said that while multidose vaccine vials were used during the pandemic for Covid-19 vaccines to maximise doses available for rapid rollout en masse, they come with a number of pharmaceutical concerns, including logistical issues. \u201cIf patient scheduling is lax or patients do not attend then doses can be wasted,\u201d he said. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, said the Novavax jab was just as effective in protecting against severe disease as the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs, and it was also cheaper and easier to store. He said there was some evidence protein-based jabs had fewer side-effects, while other research had indicated a \u201cmix and match\u201d approach using different vaccines resulted in a better immune response. He also stressed that once a Novavax vial was opened, five doses needed to be administered. \u201cThis might not be cost-effective for pharmacies and could result in wastage of the vaccine if less than five people are booked in for vaccination,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt could also result in pharmacies increasing the cost of the Novavax vaccine to compensate for any wastage.\u201d The Guardian has seen communications suggesting some pharmacies are already adopting a flexible charging approach. One pharmacy sent out an email to customers stating Novavax jabs would be reserved for patients with multiple bookings involving friends or family. If only two individuals received Novavax jabs on the same day, the charge would be \u00a390 per person. \u201cFor three individuals, the charge will be \u00a365 each, for four individuals, it will be \u00a355 each, and for five individuals, there will be a flat rate of \u00a350 per person,\u201d the email stated. Lara Wong, the founder of the support and advocacy group Clinically Vulnerable Families, said the approach was problematic. \u201cCoordinating group vaccinations to fully utilise each multidose vial presents a significant challenge, particularly for patients who, due to health vulnerabilities or logistical constraints, cannot easily organise themselves into groups. This could lead to higher individual costs for those unable to form groups. We are deeply concerned that this situation will introduce barriers to vaccination,\u201d she said. Graham Thoms, the chief executive of Pharmadoctor, said each of its partner pharmacies set its own prices, adding that Pharmadoctor did not charge a fee and did not take a cut from the pharmacy. Thoms said strategies were in place to avoid wastage. He said: \u201cSome of our individual partner pharmacists already received over 160 patient appointment requests from Pharmadoctor for April, therefore they will simply need to arrange the appointments in blocks of five patients so that there is no wastage. Most of our partner pharmacies are already planning for this.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-03T06:00:20Z",
            "content": "Private Covid boosters are available for people who do not qualify to receive these vaccines on the NHS. But is it worth paying for a shot? With most people now having been exposed to Sars-CoV-2 through previous vaccination and/or infection, our immune systems are generally well equipped to recognise and kill the virus if we become infected. Even so, unless we\u2019ve recently been infected or received a booster, the number of antibodies circulating in our blood is likely to be low. Antibodies help to prevent us from catching Covid by binding to the virus and stopping it entering our cells. Although memory cells will quickly start churning out new antibodies if they encounter Sars-CoV-2, there will be a slight time lag before they reach high enough levels to block infection, potentially providing a window for Covid to take hold. Such infections will still usually be shorter and milder than if you\u2019d never experienced Covid, but they remain an unpleasant inconvenience. Covid boosters are a quick and safe means of topping up these antibodies. Yet, in the UK, eligibility for the free NHS spring 2024 booster Covid vaccine is restricted to people aged 75 years and older, residents in care homes for older people, and those aged six months and over with a weakened immune system. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people aged 65 and above should receive an additional dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed that everyone is offered an annual, single-dose booster \u2013 similar to the annual flu shot \u2013 with a second dose for those at greater risk of severe disease, including children under two years and adults aged 50 or older. According to a modelling study published in Annals of Internal Medicine in March, this strategy could result in 123,\u2009869 fewer hospitalisations, 5,524 fewer deaths and save $3.63bn (\u00a32.9bn) in direct healthcare costs each year \u2013 assuming uptake was similar to that of the annual flu shot \u2013 compared with a scenario where just 20% of the population received an annual Covid booster. Prof Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, is not surprised by these results and favours the FDA\u2019s approach. \u201cIt is based on a very good assessment of clinical benefits, hence recognising the importance of protecting both young children as well as over 50s,\u201d he said. \u201cKids under five are at heightened risk after Sars-CoV-2 infection compared to primary schoolchildren \u2013 especially under ones \u2013 and there is no reason why they should be exposed to infection when a very good, safe vaccine is available.\u201d One issue is that the UK has tended to focus on hospitalisations and deaths in its cost-benefit analysis, rather than considering other outcomes such as long Covid, Griffin added. Even so, he and other UK experts have welcomed the expansion of access to Covid boosters \u2013 though they worry the cost is likely to limit their uptake. Prof Neil Mabbott, an immunopathologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cWhen people are having to prioritise other needs during a cost of living crisis, they shouldn\u2019t necessarily be worrying about should I pay for a vaccine or not.\u201d Mabbott believes that anyone over the age of 50 would benefit from a further booster, \u201cbecause their immunity from previous boosters will be waning\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s also the issue of long Covid to consider,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a large amount of people who have it or may develop it, through even having what can be a relatively mild dose of Covid-19.\u201d Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, thinks having a booster makes sense for those aged 65 and older, those with clinical conditions such as diabetes, heart problems and autoimmune conditions, and those living with vulnerable individuals. \u201cThis will not only provide personal protection from severe Covid and limit infection of more vulnerable individuals, but will also restrict the spread of the virus, and hopefully any new variants, in the general population,\u201d he said."

Lamarre handed himself into Bondi police station and was charged with the men\u2019s murders four days after they were allegedly killed. Their bodies were found near a fence line of the Bungonia property the following week. Police allege the murder of Baird was premeditated and that Davies was killed because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

            "date": "2024-04-29T06:00:28Z",
            "content": "A man whose mother killed herself after going three months without an NHS psychiatric appointment has said it is wrong that a public inquiry will not investigate her death and others like hers. The Lampard inquiry is looking into the deaths of almost 2,000 mental health patients in Essex since 2000 but Andrea Waddington\u2019s will not be included because it occurred in February, after the inquiry\u2019s chosen cut-off date of the end of last year. Additionally, Waddington, who was 59 when she died, does not qualify because she was being treated in the community. Her son James, 29, said the exclusion did not make sense. \u201cThe experience of an outpatient is just as bad if not worse,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although she passed [away] outside of the period, obviously the difficulties in her treatment journey were within the last year, so it\u2019s still in the period.\u201d He also said he had been told there were no beds available even if she were to have been sectioned. James said his mother was sectioned in 2012, put on an antidepressant and was well until the beginning of last year when her own mother fell ill. He said her mental health went downhill after a doctor responded by changing her medication, and the type and dose changed frequently over the next few months. When she began having suicidal thoughts, a mental health crisis team started to make visits but then stopped, he said. James estimated that his mother had five psychiatrist appointments in a year, three of which were by phone. In October last year a psychiatrist told Waddington they were leaving the area, and the next appointment, which was on the phone, was not until 2 February, when another psychiatrist said they too were leaving, James said. Two days later his father found her dead in the loft. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a three-month window where you\u2019ve had no help from the NHS and yet her thoughts were still the same,\u201d James said. \u201cDuring that period of October to February, there was no one involved. The mental health team could have stepped in and said \u2018OK, because you haven\u2019t got a psychiatrist, we\u2019ll resume the visits\u2019. There was basically nothing \u2013 just a void. \u201cIf I put myself in my mum\u2019s mind, she\u2019s been waiting all that time, you finally have a call and the person basically just tells you that [they\u2019re leaving].\u201d He said that before his mother became unwell last year she was \u201creally bubbly\u201d, and she enjoyed gardening, yoga and playing the piano. \u201cI would have expected another 30 years with her,\u201d he said. Priya Singh, a senior associate at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen who is representing the family, said there were many others in the same boat. \u201cThey have valuable evidence to share and the [inquiry] chair needs to give urgent consideration to the position regarding such families,\u201d she said. Ann Sheridan, an executive nurse at Essex Partnership University NHS foundation trust, said their thoughts were with the Waddingtons and \u201cwe are constantly striving to improve care that we offer those with often complex needs. We will of course take onboard any recommendations from a future inquest.\u201d An inquiry spokesperson said that \u201cunfortunately\u201d there was a \u201cnecessity for an end date\u201d, and that including all community care \u201cwould significantly broaden the scope beyond the inquiry\u2019s core purpose of examining inpatient deaths\u201d. Expressing sympathy for his mother\u2019s death, they added: \u201cWe would urge Mr Waddington (and anyone impacted) to contact the inquiry, either himself or through his legal representatives.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "date": "2024-04-09T23:01:32Z",
            "content": "A long-awaited review by consultant paediatrician Hilary Cass into the NHS\u2019s gender services for children calls for a dramatic shift in the type of treatment offered to children and young people with gender dysphoria. The report proposes that instead of being offered mainly medical treatment, young people referred to NHS gender services should \u201creceive a holistic assessment of their needs to inform an individualised care plan\u201d, meaning that questions of gender identity should be treated alongside other possible mental health concerns. It found that a medical pathway, such as puberty blockers, would not necessarily be the best option for children with gender dysphoria, and should not be provided \u201cwithout also addressing wider mental health and/or psychosocially challenging problems\u201d. The review suggests this \u201cshould include screening for neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, and a mental health assessment\u201d. The idea of a holistic assessment has so far been welcomed by medical experts, such as Dr Lade Smith, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, who said: \u201cChildren who are gender questioning also commonly experience mental illness. It is extremely important that every child who is gender questioning has timely access to services that are holistic and respond to their individual needs.\u201d But the proposals will have major implications for wider children\u2019s mental health services, which are already overstretched. The waiting lists for gender-affirming care on the NHS are incredibly long. As of August 2022, there were 26,234 adults waiting for a first appointment with an adult gender dysphoria clinic, of whom 23,561 had been waiting more than 18 weeks. The number of children on the waiting list was approximately 7,600, of whom about 6,100 had been waiting more than 18 weeks. In October, a coroner concluded that long waiting lists and barriers that prevent transgender people accessing gender-affirming care in the UK contributed to a decline in the mental health of Alice Litman, a young trans woman who killed herself in 2022. The Cass report acknowledges that long waiting lists are a barrier to the NHS\u2019s ability to provide effective gender-affirming care. It states: \u201cIt is only when they have been on very long waiting lists, and sidelined from usual care in local services, that they are forced to do their own research and may come to a single medical answer to their problems.\u201d However, general mental health services for young people are no better. More than a quarter of a million (270,300) children and young people in England are still waiting for mental health support after being referred to children and young people\u2019s mental health services in 2022-23, according to the children\u2019s commissioner. Between July and September of last year, children and young people who had an appointment for suspected autism had waited on average nine months (295 days) after their initial referral. This is despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommending that people with suspected autism should be diagnosed within three months of a referral. Cass\u2019s report said long waiting lists for gender services were in part due to an \u201cunprecedented\u201d increase in demand in recent years, which created \u201can unsustainable service model\u201d. \u201cPrior to 2009, Gids (the gender identity development service) did not attract significant attention. At that time, the service saw fewer than 50 children a year, with even fewer receiving medical treatment,\u201d the report states. Since the closure of the Gids clinic at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust in London in 2023, NHS England pledged to open eight regional clinics delivering a \u201cdifferent model of care\u201d. The report has welcomed this, saying the regional centres \u201cshould allow care and risk to be actively managed \u2026 reducing waiting times for specialist care\u201d. But since only one of these regional centres has opened, waiting lists will remain high for the foreseeable future."

            "content": "Southern California sheriff\u2019s deputies shot and killed a 17-year-old boy with mental health issues after he armed himself with a knife and locked himself inside a bathroom at a home, authorities said on Wednesday. The teen was being transferred from a hospital, where he had been treated after cutting himself, to a mental health facility when he escaped on Tuesday, the San Bernardino county sheriff, Shannon Dicus, said. The boy, a foster youth who lived in Hesperia, later showed up at a home in Victorville, about 90 miles (145km) east of Los Angeles, where his sisters live in foster care, Dicus said. Someone at the home called deputies to come arrest him, Dicus added, because he had caused trouble there before. The teen, who had a knife, locked himself in a bathroom, and deputies tried to get him to come out for about a half-hour, according to the sheriff. But when the boy threatened to harm himself, deputies kicked down the door and tried to apprehend him, Dicus said. A video and still images of the encounter show the teen holding a knife, the Riverside Press-Enterprise reported. Deputies pepper-sprayed him, and one deputy\u2019s hand was sliced by the knife, the newspaper said. The teen was backed into a bathtub, where police shot him, Dicus said. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. The death came less than a month after San Bernardino deputies shot and killed 15-year-old Ryan Gainer, who had also been a foster child but was adopted as a toddler. He was killed on 9 March when officers responded to a 911 call from one of his family members, who reported he was breaking things in their house in Apple Valley \u2013 two hours east of Los Angeles \u2013 and \u201chitting\u201d his sister, but that she wasn\u2019t injured. Body-camera footage shows that two San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s deputies shot Ryan within roughly five seconds of seeing him. \u201cHe was strong and always happy, no matter what he was going through,\u201d his father, Norman Gainer, said. The shooting death of the 17-year-old, who was not identified by the sheriff, also follows the recent release of law enforcement footage of San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s deputies shooting 15-year-old Savannah Graziano, whose father, Anthony Graziano, was suspected to have had abducted her after fatally shooting her mother the day before. Savannah was killed on 27 September 2022. In California highway patrol (CHP) footage released on 29 March, Savannah can be seen getting out of a vehicle on the side of the highway in Hesperia, 80 miles (130km) east of Los Angeles, as law enforcement yells for her to walk toward them before deputies begin shooting at her. After the shooting, a CHP dispatcher can be heard saying: \u201cOh, no.\u201d Dicus said on Wednesday that in both Ryan Gainer\u2019s and the 17-year-old\u2019s cases, deputies had been met with violence. He said parents need more access to mental health services for their troubled children, so that law enforcement isn\u2019t the only option in times of crisis. \u201cMy record as sheriff for the last several years is I have championed having a better mental health system,\u201d Dicus said. \u201cThe corrections environment and our public environment have been challenged a number of times where the only mental health resource we have in our community is law enforcement, and that\u2019s the only 24/7 resource that we have.\u201d"

            "content": "The destruction of nature over the rest of the decade could trigger a bigger economic slump in Britain than those caused by the 2008 global financial crisis and the Covid pandemic, experts have warned. Sounding the alarm over the rising financial cost from pollution, damage to water systems, soil erosion, and threats from disease, the report by the Green Finance Institute warned that further breakdown in the UK\u2019s natural environment could lead to a 12% loss of gross domestic product (GDP) by the 2030s. In a report that received input from experts across academia and government, the authors argued that \u201cgradual, year-to year environmental degradation is as detrimental or more so than climate change\u201d. The continued loss of natural habitats in urban and rural areas would compare unfavourably with the financial crisis of 2008, which took about 5% off the value of UK GDP, while the Covid pandemic cost the UK 11% of its GDP in 2020. The academics used three scenarios to construct the report: domestic risks from continued UK environment breakdown; international risks \u2013 including destruction to nature in countries which are key UK trading partners; and a health scenario, focusing on the dangers of a fresh global pandemic. All three took into account current trends in environmental breakdown \u2013 including water and air pollution, soil health erosion and biodiversity loss \u2013 resulting in a hit to GDP worth up to 3%, or about \u00a370bn by the late 2020s. The report then added \u201cacute risks\u201d on top of these trends \u2013 including floods, droughts and wildfires \u2013 which would result in a 6% loss to GDP in the domestic and international scenarios, and a 12% hit in a health scenario, reflecting the extreme dangers to the UK economy from a renewed pandemic. Ministers are expected to take an interest in the report amid concern over the potential dangers to the economy from nature breakdown. Environment minister Richard Benyon said the report showed that nature \u201cunderpins the health of our economy and it is under threat from a global nature crisis\u201d. The former Conservative MP, whose family controls a 5,600-hectare (14,000-acre) estate in west Berkshire, southern England, said the responsibility to conserve nature \u201clies with all sectors and sections of society, and green finance has a crucial role to play\u201d. He said: \u201cThe findings in this report will help people and institutions across the corporate and finance sectors understand that it is in their own interests to go further and faster for the planet to protect it for future generations.\u201d Shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, blamed the government for the UK becoming \u201cone of the most nature-depleted countries in the world\u201d. Saying that the UK needed \u201cto reverse the tide of destruction\u201d, Reed committed Labour to cleaner air and water \u201cand growing nature-rich habitats for wildlife to thrive\u201d. The Green Finance Institute describes itself as the UK and Europe\u2019s \u201cprincipal forum for innovation in green finance\u201d bringing together banks, academics, philanthropists and government bodies to develop climate-friendly policies and financial products. The report warned that unless action is taken, UK banks will need to reduce their exposure to the worst hit industries or find themselves increasing the risk of losses from bad loans. About 50% of the extra cost will come from the loss of nature overseas that the UK relies on to provide food, natural resources and trade. Partly funded by the government with input from the Treasury and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the authors also relied on advice and information from the Bank of England, Oxford and Reading universities, the UN\u2019s environment programme, and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The report said: \u201cThe impacts of biodiversity loss and environmental degradation will not be felt alone but will compound with climate risks. Both are happening at once and there are strong feedback effects between the loss of natural capital and climate change.\u201d The study follows a Treasury-backed review in 2021 by the Cambridge economist Sir Partha Dasgupta, who found that the world was being put at \u201cextreme risk\u201d by the failure of economics to take account of the rapid depletion of the natural world. Last year, the government agency Natural England launched its Nature Returns programme to coordinate efforts across government and the private sector to explore how the UK can best use land in England \u201cto address climate change whilst producing food and promoting thriving nature\u201d. The agency said it wanted \u201cto mobilise the billions in private investment that government estimates we need to meet our national net zero commitments\u201d."

            "title": "There\u2019s a hard-right tidal wave about to hit Europe \u2013 and it will only make the economic crisis worse | Gordon Brown",
            "date": "2024-04-29T05:00:25Z",
            "content": "By the time of the European parliament elections in June, this year\u2019s rightward drift in European politics will have turned into a tidal wave. Ultra-nationalist demagogues and populist-nationalists are now leading the polls in Italy, the Netherlands, France, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia, and running second in Germany and Sweden. There are two hard-right groupings in the European parliament \u2013 Identity and Democracy and European Conservatives and Reformists. Between them, they could secure as much as 25% of the June vote. But even more ominously, in almost every part of Europe including Britain, these factions are forcing the hand of the traditional centre-right parties \u2013 which, one by one, are capitulating to ever more extreme anti-immigration, anti-trade and anti-environment positions. The rightward shift is, of course, a western and not just European phenomenon, with Trump 2.0 advocating a far more aggressive protectionist and nationalist agenda than Trump 1.0. But Europe stands out from the US in one important respect. While the US economy roars forward \u2013 even if the average American voter does not feel the full benefits \u2013 Europe, and especially its industrial engine-room, Germany, continues to suffer from near-zero growth and stagnation in terms of living standards. And having lived through a decade of consistently low growth, the continent is now divided between an optimistic but declining minority, who still hold to the expectation that a rising tide lifts all boats, and the growing and more pessimistic majority who now see life as a zero-sum game. The latter is a mindset that, recognising the economic pie is not growing, leads people to an erroneous conclusion: \u201cI will only do well if someone else does badly.\u201d Once embraced, this adversarial view is hard to shake. The supporting evidence is clear: in the largest western European countries, many people are pessimistic about their prospects, believing that their generation will do worse than their parents. Only 26% of French people and just 33% of Italians think they will do better in future, according to a seven-nation poll by Focaldata. In the Netherlands and Germany, as many are pessimistic as optimistic. While Ireland and Sweden top the league for optimism, only 46% and 40% respectively feel they will fare better, with 39% and 35% taking the opposite view. In no country are a majority of people optimistic about their future. The pollsters also tested the classic zero-sum proposition that you can only get rich at the expense of others. In every major European country, the results are dramatic: 59% of British respondents believe they can only enhance their personal wealth if others do badly, and just 17% disregarded this notion. Similarly, in Germany and the Netherlands, 60% and 58% respectively hold this view, compared with only 16% and 15% who rejected it. In almost all countries, more than 50% displayed a zero-sum mentality. There are good reasons why these trends are becoming entrenched. A low-growth economy creates a doom loop as pessimism begets a blame culture \u2013 and the more we blame others, the more pessimistic we become. Once people convince themselves that the state of their economy is so weak that they can only improve their lot at someone else\u2019s expense, they vote for parties that specialise in targeting those they think are holding them back \u2013 immigrants, foreigners and minorities. These parties offer nothing in terms of economic policies to generate long-term growth. The result is that zero-sum politics exacerbates the downward economic trends, and this, in turn, intensifies and widens the appeal of zero-sum thinking. The problem Europe now faces is that the very measures it must adopt to escape this doom loop \u2013 new investment in technology, clean energy and medical advances \u2013 are being rendered impossible by its policy of fiscal retrenchment. The European growth and stability pact rules out member states having deficits above 3%, and perhaps as importantly, makes no distinction between public spending on consumption and spending on investment. Added to that, Germany has a debt brake enshrined in its constitution which limits the government\u2019s structural deficit to 0.35% of GDP. This casts a shadow over the whole of Europe, with the German people facing severe cuts in public spending \u2013 cuts that will torpedo any chance of repairing the country\u2019s beleaguered infrastructure and frustrating its transition from heavy engineering to IT and AI-based industries. While China can subsidise to the point of undercutting Europe on electric cars, batteries and other new technologies, and Bidenomics is running huge deficits that are stimulating the economy, Europe is stuck in a fiscal bind. The European recovery and resilience facility ends for good in 2026, with no replacement. The stability and growth pact, which has restrictive conditions that were suspended during the Covid crisis, resumes its tough regime next year. France and 11 other European countries are already in trouble, unable to invest more because they are already running allegedly unsustainable deficits. So, at the very time that investment needs to increase, it is likely to fall. And the European election results are unlikely to make things any better. Essential green investment will fall down the agenda as anti-environmentalist parties gain an upper hand. Protectionism will become the order of the day with trade wars, which hit Europe harder than anywhere else. Unless something gives, a low-growth Europe will remain stuck in its rut \u2013 and the populist xenophobes will triumph. The nationalist timebomb is ticking. Across the continent, Europeans need a plan for better jobs through economic and environmental transformation. When the Polish trade union Solidarity was first formed, its anti-Soviet slogan was \u201cNo solidarity without freedom\u201d. But soon many realised that free-for-all neoliberal economics would mean rising inequality and low living standards for the mass of people, and so a new slogan soon rang out: \u201cThere is no solidarity in freedom.\u201d If progressives want to prevent an election campaign dominated by anti-immigrant propaganda, they will have to stand up to protectionism and xenophobia by showing the benefits of cooperation. Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010"

            "title": "Ratings agency downgrades China debt outlook over economic uncertainty",
            "date": "2024-04-10T08:04:53Z",
            "content": "Fitch has downgraded the outlook on China\u2019s debt as it warned of increased risks to the economy while the country moves away from its reliance on growth from the property sector. On Wednesday the US-based agency said it had revised China\u2019s sovereign credit rating from stable to negative, saying this reflected the \u201cincreasing risks to China\u2019s public finance outlook\u201d as the country \u201ccontends with more uncertain economic prospects\u201d. The downgrade comes amid a prolonged crisis in the country\u2019s property sector that has been running since 2021, when a regulatory crackdown on debt-fuelled construction triggered a liquidity squeeze. The huge Chinese property company Evergrande was ordered to go into liquidation earlier this year, while last week the rival crisis-hit developer Country Garden suspended trade in its shares in Hong Kong after delaying the publication of its annual financial results. Beijing has responded with moves to address the issues and recently announced a series of targeted measures to move growth to other parts of the economy. This has included steps to help other sectors, including the issuance of billions of dollars in sovereign bonds, aimed at boosting infrastructure spending and spurring consumption. Fitch said that the country\u2019s economic prospects were uncertain because of this transition away from \u201cproperty-reliant growth\u201d, to what the government views as a more \u201csustainable growth model\u201d. It said: \u201cWide fiscal deficits and rising government debt in recent years have eroded fiscal buffers from a ratings perspective.\u201d The agency added that while the Chinese government\u2019s fiscal policy was likely to play an important role in driving growth in the coming years, it could also keep debt on a \u201csteady upward trend\u201d. Fitch forecasts that the general government deficit will rise to 7.1% of gross domestic product in 2024, from 5.8% in 2023. While it lowered its outlook from \u201cstable\u201d, indicating a downgrade is possible over the medium term, the agency affirmed China\u2019s issuer default rating at A+. The Chinese government said the decision was \u201cregrettable\u201d and said the ratings methodology had \u201cfailed to effectively reflect the positive effects of China\u2019s fiscal policies on boosting economic growth\u201d. Beijing last month set a goal of 5% growth for the world\u2019s second biggest economy in 2024. Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said China needed to strike a careful balancing act. \u201cFiscal support in our view is important in order to avoid falling \u2026 into a negative feedback loop of weak confidence, falling asset prices, and slower economic growth. This will cause government debt levels to rise in the near term,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, long-term fiscal consolidation efforts remain important. In China\u2019s case, finding a viable alternative for land sales is an important step to take in the medium term, but the obvious solutions to this \u2013 like increasing other taxes \u2013 are unpalatable.\u201d Dan Wang, the chief economist of Hang Seng Bank China, said Fitch\u2019s move reflected \u201cfundamental concern\u201d over China\u2019s fiscal health and its ability to drive long-term growth. Gary Ng, an Asia-Pacific senior economist at Natixis, stressed that the downgrade did not mean China would default any time soon, adding: \u201cFitch\u2019s outlook revision reflects the more challenging situation in China\u2019s public finance regarding the double whammy of decelerating growth and more debt.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-28T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "Now, let me get this straight. We have a fissiparous, Brexit-supporting government, many of whose MPs are stepping down, convinced that their party is heading for its wilderness years. Correspondingly, we have a Labour opposition that is riding high in the polls, led by Keir Starmer, who \u2013 unlike his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 played a noble part in the remain campaign and argued passionately for a second referendum. Proponents of a second referendum hoped that the country would acknowledge its historic mistake, and return to the European Union it should never have left. I was one of them. We failed. Since that failure, what we were worried would manifest itself has indeed manifested itself. Brexit is an economic disaster, with the Office for Budget Responsibility and National Institute of Social and Economic Research estimating the hit to the nation\u2019s GDP at anything between 4% and 6%. There are daily reports now of the bureaucratic disruption at customs to what was once the ordinary course of business for small and medium-sized firms. Exports and imports alike are affected. There are mounting supply chain shortages; costs are rising as a direct result of Brexit, with more disruption to come. Farmers who voted for Brexit now regret not having been more careful about what they wished for. As for those famous trade deals, promised as substitutes for deals with our nearest and largest market, they have been replaced by \u2013 er, well, let\u2019s face it, they have not been replaced. It\u2019s pathetic: a national example of self-harm that makes us an international laughing stock. But the disaster is not just about business, trade and the economy. It embraces people\u2019s rights, privileges and opportunities \u2013 made possible, indeed taken for granted, via our membership of the EU. This is especially bad for the young, not least for the 60% of 18- to 24-year-olds who, surveys indicate, think leaving the EU was a mistake. Defeatists tend to say that the EU would not want us back. Certainly they would want to deal with trustworthy people, which Boris Johnson and co were not. But they too are troubled by the consequences of Brexit \u2013 although, as I have said before, they know that what has happened to Britain has acted as a brake on potential leavers in the remaining EU nations. But what happens when the EU offers an olive branch \u2013 a plan for 18- to 30-year-olds in all member countries and the UK to be able to work and study throughout the EU for up to four years? Rishi Sunak rejects it immediately, and Labour follows suit with all that guff about \u201cred lines\u201d. Now, wait for it, the reductio ad absurdum of Labour\u2019s position is this: we are told that it will fight the coming election on the Conservatives\u2019 \u201ceconomic failure\u201d, not on Brexit. This is, I think, a classic example of what my philosopher friends term a \u201ccategory mistake\u201d. Brexit constitutes an integral part of this government\u2019s economic failure. Highlighting that failure, and promising to reverse it, should be central to Labour\u2019s strategy. The fact of the matter is that Starmer was right about Brexit, and the Brexiters who captured the Tory party were wrong. I gather that there are rejoin candidates in the imminent local elections. It might strengthen Starmer\u2019s arm if they do well. It is a commonplace that the British economy is suffering from years of underinvestment, and that this has undoubtedly affected its productivity. There are too many international comparisons from which the UK emerges poorly. In part, the situation resembles the way that successive Conservative and Labour governments in the 1950s and 1960s were concerned about what was known as \u201crelative decline\u201d and decided that one way of dealing with this was to join what was then the Common Market. Association agreements were not enough. We needed the full works. After several failed attempts, we entered the European Economic Community in 1973, and that evolved into the EU, with the added benefit of the formation of the internal \u2013 single \u2013 market, in whose formation we played a crucial role. That gave a vital boost to our economic performance. Now, at a time when there are so many repair jobs to be addressed, but endless complaints about the cost, UK plc needs another boost, and what Keynes called the \u201canimal spirits\u201d of entrepreneurs require a shot in the arm. In my view, a more confident Starmer could provide that if he ceased being mesmerised by \u201cred wall\u201d Brexiters and returned to first principles. Most people now regard Brexit as a serious mistake. Re-entry would be good for investment \u2013 and for growth and tax revenue. As the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney puts it: \u201c\u2018Take back control\u2019 was actually code for \u2018tear down your future.\u2019\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-06T11:00:33Z",
            "content": "As fast-food workers celebrated a pivotal wage increase to $20 an hour in California last week, an old economic debate was awakened by business groups and others claiming the increase will wind up hurting workers through reduced hours and layoffs, hurt customers with price hikes, and harm the franchise owners of fast-food restaurants. Their critics are not so sure. The hard-fought wage increase to $20 an hour from California\u2019s current minimum wage, $16 an hour, was a compromise to initial demands of $22 an hour with annual wage increases. Representatives of fast-food workers and the fast-food industry came to a deal to avoid what would have been a costly ballot initiative over the passage and signing of the California fast-food sector bill last year. \u201cFrontline workers like me organized, went on strike, and fought to pass a historic law that raises our wages and gives us a seat at table with some of the biggest fast-food corporations in the world,\u201d said Anjelica Hernandez, a McDonald\u2019s worker in Los Angeles for nearly 20 years. \u201cEven though we are the engine of a billion-dollar industry, too many of us struggle to keep up with rent, our bills and the rising cost of living.\u201d The minimum wage for fast-food workers at larger chains was agreed last September and increased to $20 an hour on 1 April, but numerous reports have already been made that the wage hike is resulting in job losses and price increases for customers. The decision by two Pizza Hut franchises in California to lay off more than 1,000 delivery driver employees and rely on gig delivery drivers instead has been cited in claims that the minimum wage rise will result in layoffs and job losses. \u201cThe reality is that delivery drivers have become more numerous in the last couple years because of Covid,\u201d said Michael Reich, UC Berkeley chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. \u201cThe pizza companies have been moving to make their delivery drivers not employees but instead rely on these delivery services for quite some time. And I think Pizza Hut is going to make this change anyway.\u201d Reich also argued that previous research had found employment increases as a result of higher minimum wage, lowers turnover rates for businesses, and makes it easier to recruit and retain employees. The research is unlikely to deter attacks. A group representing fast-food franchise owners poured more than half a million dollars into political donations for ads opposing elected officials who helped craft and pass the legislation. A Wall Street Journal op-ed referred to the California wage increase as \u201ccrazy\u201d for paying \u201cburger flippers\u201d $20 an hour. The New York Post claimed Los Angeles fast-food chains increased prices on 1 April in response to the law, including citing price increases at the actor Kevin Hart\u2019s chain Hart House, which doesn\u2019t have enough locations to be subjected to the new law, which stipulates the chains must have at least 60 restaurants nationwide. A McDonald\u2019s franchise owner of 21 locations complained to a local Los Angeles news outlet that they could not \u201craise prices enough\u201d. McDonald\u2019s and Chipotle blamed the wage increase for anticipated price hikes in California ahead of the wage increase taking effect. El Pollo Loco claimed it would be looking into automation to cut labor costs due to the law. The Center for Union Facts, a non-profit founded by a Washington lobbyist, Rick Berman, who 60 Minutes referred to as \u201cDr Evil\u201d for his tactics in advocating for business interests, is running television advertisements in California claiming the wage increase is a \u201cwrecking ball\u201d for the fast-food industry. But researchers have long criticized these claims of causation which have frequently been made in response to minimum wage increases around the US, all of which have come at the state level because Washington has failed to act on raising the federal minimum wage from the $7.25 an hour minimum last passed in 2009. \u201cOverall, study after study shows that increases to the minimum wage actually have a net gain. They produce a stimulus effect. If you give poor people more money, they\u2019re going to spend it locally, including on rent, utilities and housing. It doesn\u2019t get much more local than that, and that increased spending actually produces jobs,\u201d said Tia Koonse, legal and policy research manager at the UCLA Labor Center. An analysis of financial data over the past decade by researchers at the Roosevelt Institute found the fast-food industry has more than enough profits to raise wages without affecting prices and employment and have been hiking prices far beyond their operating costs for years. \u201cIn 2023 alone, the 10 largest publicly traded fast-food companies spent $6.1bn on share repurchases,\u201d noted the report. \u201cAs with most industries, the fast-food industry has historically charged higher prices than their marginal costs. However, between 2014 and 2023, markups increased at an annual rate of 2.2%, faster than at any period since 1978.\u201d Ali Bustamante, author of the report and deputy director of worker power and economic security at the Roosevelt Institute, added: \u201cThere\u2019s really an opportunity here to revert profits back into workers back into the source of productivity for these businesses in a way that is going to be beneficial, not just for the overall economy, but certainly for these businesses in the long term.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-11T04:00:22Z",
            "content": "Last July, Wael Sawan, the chief executive of Shell, told the BBC about the terrific time he had on a visit to the New York stock exchange. The welcome was \u201cexemplary\u201d, he enthused, and the locals even flew the Shell flag next to their own. \u201cThey [the NYSE officials] said we continue to value a company that provides us the energy we desperately need,\u201d he continued, adding that he wouldn\u2019t rule out moving Shell\u2019s stock market listing to the US in time, an inflammatory suggestion given the general angst over the state of the London market. Now he\u2019s at it again. In remarks to Bloomberg published this week, he said Shell had \u201ca location\u201d \u2013 meaning London \u2013 \u201cthat clearly seems to be undervalued\u201d. His beef is the perceived undervaluation of Shell\u2019s shares versus those of New York-listed rivals Chevron and ExxonMobil. If the valuation gap doesn\u2019t close, \u201cwe have to look at all options. All options,\u201d he emphasised. For good measure, his predecessor as chief executive, Ben van Beurden, joined the grumbling, telling an FT conference this week that Shell is \u201cmassively undervalued\u201d in London and that deeper pools of capital in the US, higher valuations and the \u201cmore positive\u201d attitudes of investors \u201cconspire\u201d against all European energy companies. \u201cSomething will have to give,\u201d opined Van Beurden. This is starting to sound like a campaign to create an air of inevitability around a switch to the US. Or, if it isn\u2019t that, Shell\u2019s top operatives seem transfixed by the notion that a relisting will cure all their troubles. It\u2019s their job to fret about the share price, but it\u2019s hard to overstate how detrimental this is for the London Stock Exchange. The biggest company on the market is openly threatening to leave. That is a different order of seriousness than seeing Flutter, Ferguson and CRH flee to the US. If Shell goes, who\u2019s next? Glencore? Even BP? But here\u2019s one basic question about Sawan\u2019s thesis: is it even correct? Does the undervaluation, in terms of earnings and cashflow multiples, exist solely by virtue of the fact that Shell is listed in London? One doubts the story is as simple as that. It\u2019s not as if US investors currently have any difficulty buying shares in Shell, whether directly or through American depositary receipts. On the company\u2019s own numbers, 45% of its institutional register is already American versus 29% from the UK. Unlike Ferguson or CRH, there seems to be no difficulty getting noticed by American money. That is hardly surprising: we are talking here about a \u00a3180bn company. It seems unlikely the market would leave a 25% discount, which seems to be Shell\u2019s rough current analysis, on the table unless other factors were at work. The real explanation, perhaps, is that the stock market (sadly) is deeply sceptical about the pace of energy transition and the returns on capital in renewables. Thus, the most oily firms, such the two US titans, are prized over those with a sideline in renewables, such as Shell, which in turn is valued more highly than those with a slightly greener hue, such as BP. This price signal is terrifying from a climate perspective, but the point is that a mere relisting of Shell\u2019s shares wouldn\u2019t change the make-up of its assets. Maybe Sawan would like to water down further Shell\u2019s emission-reduction targets and thinks it would be easier to do so from the US. But if that\u2019s the case, he should say so openly. There is a strong whiff here that what Shell and Sawan really dislike is the climate policies of European governments. That is a separate argument to the questionable claim that the same earnings are valued wildly differently in different markets. The London Stock Exchange gets a lot of flak, including from this column, for its seeming lack of concern about departees and the lack of new arrivals. But on this occasion, one can feel some sympathy. Shell \u2013 possibly the most liquid, deeply researched and widely owned stock in town \u2013 seems to have alighted on the \u201cundervaluation\u201d theme without showing evidence that location is the problem in its case. In the LSE\u2019s shoes, you\u2019d be furious. Shell\u2019s loose \u201cmaybe we will, maybe we won\u2019t\u201d talk is seriously damaging."

The immediate point is that 93p a share, or \u00a31.1bn, is a lot better than shareholders were looking at in recent months. The price went as low as 60p during the company\u2019s bust-up with its own investment adviser, a suspension of dividends (unforgivable for a fund designed to turn royalties into income) and a writedown in the value of assets after a tortuous debate about valuation methodologies. Those shareholders voted last year against \u201ccontinuation\u201d, in the lingo of investment trusts, which amounted to an order to the board to find a new strategy and establish some hard value. Robert Naylor came in as chair last November and has found a credible buyer in the form of Concord Chorus, a fund ultimately backed by state pension money in Michigan; the same US fund last year bought Round Hill Music, the only other UK-listed royalty fund. For Hipgnosis investors, 93p doesn\u2019t represent Good Times, to pick on one song in the portfolio, but nor is it a reason to (Le) Freak out. It\u2019s a smidgeon above the revised asset value; on the other hand, the asset value may increase by a notch or two by the time the deal completes. There is also an entertaining subplot whereby the fund is inviting its investment adviser \u2013 a firm majority-owned by Blackstone but with Hipgnosis pioneer Merck Mercuriadis on lead vocals \u2013 to go quietly by terminating its management contract, to allow an extra $25m (\u00a320m) to flow to shareholders. We\u2019ll wait to see how that request is received given the past toxicity of the relationship. But the longer-term point demonstrated by Hipgnosis\u2019s entertaining life as a FTSE 250 stock is that this type of \u201calternative\u201d asset is ill-suited to public markets. As soon as interest rates started to rise, the share price wobbled. Then came the kerfuffle over valuation techniques in an illiquid market for back catalogues, plus the tensions with Blackstone and Mercuriadis. And it all happened within the context of an industry-wide lack of transparency over the price at which catalogues are bought and sold. In the circumstances, Naylor is surely spot on when he says the fund would have to undergo \u201csubstantial financial and governance changes\u201d to improve its share price materially under its own steam, and that the alternatives \u201ccarry significant risks, uncertainties and limitations\u201d. You bet: in an investment trust sector where discounts to published asset values are already the norm, you don\u2019t want to add complications on top. Selling up at 93p is reasonable. Shareholders with a combined stake of 29% have already backed the decision. The shame is that the basic idea had appeal: a broad and constantly refreshed portfolio of music rights should be able to provide a stable source of income. But pension money, with its multi-decade investment horizons, looks a more natural owner, away from public markets. Hipgnosis was just too noisy."

            "content": "America\u2019s leading stock indices came under pressure on Thursday after official data revealed that US economic growth slowed sharply to its weakest rate in almost two years. But as high interest rates take their toll on the world\u2019s largest economy, inflation continues to loom large. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 1.8% in New York before recovering to close down 1%. The S&amp;P 500 also dropped by as much as 1.5%, before finishing down 0.5%. The technology-focused Nasdaq declined 1.9%, before clawing back some of its losses to close down 0.6%. Gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first quarter, significantly short of the 2.4% rate expected by economists. But a closely watched measure of inflation also rose faster than anticipated, raising questions about the Federal Reserve\u2019s next steps in its fight to bring down price growth. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2013 which strips out volatile food and energy costs \u2013 rose 3.7% in the first three months of the year, according to a report published by the commerce department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. The same measure rose by 2% in the last quarter of 2023. While economists had expected an acceleration, the reading was higher than the average 3.4% forecast. Inflation has been easing in the US, with unemployment remaining low and growth largely resilient, raising hopes that the Fed will guide the world\u2019s largest economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. But Thursday\u2019s data on the first quarter \u2013 with growth fading, and inflation on the rise \u2013 will test this confidence. \u201cQ1\u2019s sluggish increase in GDP likely sets the tone for the rest of 2024,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicting that core PCE inflation \u201cwill rise at an annualized rate much closer to 2%\u201d over the next few months. The first quarter\u2019s core inflation reading could \u201cspook the Fed a little\u201d, said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe core PCE deflator rose 3.7% at an annualized rate in Q1, nearly double the clip seen in each of the prior two quarters and stronger than either we or the consensus anticipated.\u201d While inflation has slowed dramatically since peaking at its highest level in a generation two summers ago, prices still remain far higher than where they stood before the pandemic. The economy is at the heart of this year\u2019s presidential election campaign, as voters mull whether they felt better off under Joe Biden, or the Trump administration. \u201cThe landing is, and will be, soft,\u201d Biden declared during his State of the Union address last month. \u201cIt takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.\u201d But Donald Trump, who is fighting to regain the presidency in November, has claimed inflation is \u201ckilling America\u201d under Biden. On Thursday Janet Yellen, Biden\u2019s treasury secretary, told Reuters that the US economy \u201ccontinues to perform very, very well\u201d, describing the latest growth as \u201cpeculiar, but not concerning\u201d.

            "date": "2024-04-25T13:46:10Z",
            "content": "Shareholders have voted in favour of doubling the pay packet of London Stock Exchange Group\u2019s chief executive to \u00a313m on the same day that fears were reignited about an exodus of UK-listed firms. Investors backed the group\u2019s plans to increase David Schwimmer\u2019s maximum pay levels from \u00a36.25m to more than \u00a313m. The resolution passed, with nearly 89% voting in favour of the new pay policy. The LSEG annual shareholder meeting was held as it emerged that two large UK-listed companies, Unilever and Anglo American, may leave the London market for lucrative deals and listings abroad. The Australian mining company BHP has a \u00a331bn offer for rival Anglo American, a move that could result in the cancellation of FTSE 100-listed firm\u2019s UK shares. Two years ago, BHP dropped its dual Australia-UK listing in favour of a single home on the Sydney stock exchange. Meanwhile, the chief executive of Unilever, Hein Schumacher, said the consumer goods company was \u201cconsidering all options\u201d for a potential listing of its ice-cream business, which makes brands including Magnum and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, and could be valued at up to \u20ac17bn (\u00a314.6bn). Schumacher said he was \u201ctalking to many different stakeholders in the process\u201d and had discussed a potential Amsterdam listing with the Dutch economic affairs minister. However, he did not confirm whether he met the equivalent UK minister, raising fears that London could miss out on another bumper stock market float. Schumacher added that he had \u201cregular conversations with governments including the UK government\u201d. There has been much handwringing in the City and Whitehall over an exodus of listed firms from the London stock market. Those leaving include the travel group Tui, which will shift its listing to Germany, and the Dublin-based betting firm Flutter, which is asking shareholders to consider moving its shares to the US market. Schwimmer tried to appear upbeat, telling shareholders on Thursday the pipeline of floats was \u201cencouraging\u201d and that a pending shake-up of listings rules, which include simplifying some requirements for companies, would be helpful. \u201cWe are very pleased with the direction of travel for the London market,\u201d he said. The influential shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis had advised shareholders to reject Schwimmer\u2019s pay policy, saying in a report this month that the company had not \u201csufficiently rationalised an increase of this magnitude in a lump sum approach, particularly given the CEO\u2019s pay relative to UK peers\u201d. However, Schwimmer had argued that the group had to compete with peers in the US, where executives can expect much higher renumeration. \u201cIf London has an ambition to be a globally leading financial centre and to attract world-class companies, that means it has to attract world-class talent,\u201d he said in February. LSEG said this month that it was \u201cfocused on securing and retaining the calibre of talent required in a highly competitive global market\u201d while \u201censuring delivery of strong performance\u201d was rewarded."

            "date": "2024-04-24T16:26:15Z",
            "content": "Former president Donald Trump qualified for a bonus worth $1.2bn after shares in his social media company remained above a certain value despite falling sharply. Trump is poised to receive 36m additional shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), owner of his Truth Social platform, under an \u201cearn-out\u201d windfall which boosts the paper value of his stake in the business to about $3.7bn. He was able to receive the bonus if TMTG\u2019s stock traded above $17.50 a share for 20 days out of any 30-day period within the first three years of the firm\u2019s stock market debut \u2013 a milestone it reached after closing at $32.57 on Tuesday. Trump\u2019s shares in his social media company have offered him a financial lifeline as he faces about $500m in legal penalties after being found liable in civil fraud, defamation and sexual abuse cases. While he cannot sell his stock until September due to the terms of a lockup agreement, the shares\u2019 fluctuating value have at times made him one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people on paper. After a stunning landing on New York\u2019s Nasdaq stock exchange, the value of Trump\u2019s social media company \u2013 which trades as DJT \u2013 has fallen drastically. The stock hit a high of almost $80 on its opening day, but declined in fits in the following weeks. Trump Media\u2019s CEO, Devin Nunes, has suggested that short sellers betting on the loss of value may have been responsible for manipulating the stock. Shares in Trump Media tanked further last week, falling 12% after the company revealed it could sell millions of additional shares in the coming months. They fell another 8% on Tuesday, even as they enabled Trump to qualify for his earn-out shares. The company has also faced political scrutiny over the firm\u2019s financial backers. A Democratic-aligned group issued a call earlier this month for lawmakers to investigate the company over allegations of influence peddling, after the Guardian reported that a Russian-American businessman under federal criminal investigation helped prop up the company. Truth Social has become a personal soapbox for Trump to issue statements to his supporters since its launch in 2022. While its user base is tiny compared with more established social networks, such as X (formerly Twitter), the platform has outgrown other rightwing apps. Trump is now on trial in a Manhattan courtroom, with prosecutors alleging that he sought to undermine the 2016 presidential election through making illegal hush-money payments to cover up his affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump\u2019s defense lawyers have maintained he is innocent of all 34 felony counts of falsifying business documents, in what is the first criminal trial of a former president in US history."

            "content": "Prices in UK shops rose at their slowest rate since late 2021 in April as deep discounts by clothing and footwear retailers put the brakes on inflation, the latest snapshot of high street spending trends has shown. The monthly bulletin from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) \u2013 the lobby group for the industry \u2013 found that the battle by store owners to offload summer stock in cold and wet weather meant prices in non-food stores were lower this month than a year earlier. The BRC said the cost of non-food goods fell at an annual rate of 0.6% in April, while the price of food increased by 3.4%, down from 3.7% in March. Taken together, food and non-food inflation stood at 0.8% in April, compared to 1.3% in the year to March \u2013 the lowest level since December 2021. Data for the BRC\u2019s shop price bulletin was collected early in the month and points to another fall in the official inflation figure for April when it is released next month. Inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022 \u2013 the highest level in four decades \u2013 but has since been on a downward trend. In the year to March, the Office for National Statistics said prices rose by 3.2%, but the Bank of England expects lower energy bills to bring the annual inflation rate down to about 2% in April. Despite the easing of cost-of-living pressures, food prices are 25% higher than they were when Russia invaded Ukraine just over two years ago, while prices overall have increased by 14%. Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said shop price inflation levels were showing signs of normalising. She added: \u201cBoth food and non-food have seen shop inflation rates ease to more manageable levels. In April, non-food prices fell, especially in clothing and footwear, where retailers ramped up promotions to encourage consumer spend. \u201cFood inflation slowed for the 12th consecutive month as fresh products, such as butter, fish and fruits, continued to fall in price due to easing input costs and intense competition between grocers.\u201d Amid warnings from farmers that months of wet weather could lead to food shortages and higher prices, Dickinson said geo-political tension also posed a threat to price stability. \u201cRetailers will continue to do all they can to keep prices down, but government has a role to play with pro-growth policies that allow businesses to invest in the customer offer,\u201d she added."

            "date": "2024-04-10T13:07:26Z",
            "content": "Global financial markets have scaled back expectations for an imminent cut in interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic after figures showed US inflation rose by more than expected in March. Figures from the US Department of Labor show a jump in fuel and housing rental costs drove up the consumer price index (CPI) to 3.5% in March compared with a year earlier, higher than expected by Wall Street economists. In a development triggering a sell-off in financial markets, monthly inflation and core CPI \u2013 which removes volatile items including energy and food \u2013 also rose by more than predicted. US government bond yields rose sharply, while shares fell in New York amid speculation that stubborn inflationary pressures could force the US Federal Reserve to delay cutting interest rates. \u201cExpectations for a June Federal Reserve interest rate cut have collapsed,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist at the Dutch bank ING. \u201cJuly is also doubtful, meaning September is the more probable start point of any easing, which would limit the Fed to a maximum of just three rate cuts this year.\u201d The figures also led traders to slash bets for the Bank of England to cut borrowing costs in June, amid concerns that inflation in the US and the UK could persist at higher levels than previously thought. Financial markets are now pricing a 54% chance of the UK central bank keeping interest rates unchanged in June, having previously reflected a greater probability of a cut before the US inflation figures were released. Inflation in the world\u2019s largest economy has fallen sharply from a high of over 9% in 2022 but has remained stubbornly above the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2%. Inflation in the UK has fallen from over 10% last year to 3.4% in February. Figures for March are due to be published next week. The latest figures from the US show March\u2019s increase was driven by rising costs for shelter and gasoline. \u201cCombined, these two indexes contributed over half of the monthly increase in the index,\u201d the labor department said. Gasoline rose 1.7% from the previous month and is 1.3% higher than the same time last year. Shelter is 5.7% higher than a year ago and rose 0.4% over the month. Ryan Stewart, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, pointed out that gasoline prices typically rise this time of year. \u201cBut it still has economic costs as every $0.01 rise in retail gasoline prices reduces consumer spending between $1bn and $1.5bn over the course of a year,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors. The Fed increased its benchmark interest rate from near zero to over 5% over the last 16 months in a bid to cool inflation. Recently the central bank has held off on further rate rises and economists had expected rate cuts later this year. Those hopes have faded in recent weeks amid signs that inflation has remained sticky. The US central bank has a twin mandate \u2013 to keep prices under control and achieve maximum employment. The jobs market has remained robust despite the Fed\u2019s attempts to cool the economy, adding 303,000 positions last month. The inflation news will further complicate November\u2019s US elections, as Joe Biden attempts to point to progress in the American economy. Nearly 15.2m jobs have been created since he took office and unemployment has remained below 4% for the longest stretch in 50 years. Meanwhile stock markets have hit record highs and inflation \u2013 while above the Fed\u2019s target \u2013 has fallen sharply. But polling shows that voters are unhappy with the president\u2019s economic stewardship, inflation and high interest rates. Some economists are now predicting that the Fed may not begin cutting rates until after the election. In a statement, Biden said: \u201cToday\u2019s report shows inflation has fallen more than 60% from its peak, but we have more to do to lower costs for hardworking families. Prices are still too high for housing and groceries, even as prices for key household items like milk and eggs are lower than a year ago.\u201d Biden called on corporations to use their \u201crecord profits to reduce prices\u201d and attacked Republicans who he said \u201cwant to slash taxes for billionaires and big corporations, while helping special interests and big pharma raise prices\u201d. On his social media site Truth Social, Biden\u2019s presidential rival Donald Trump wrote: \u201cINFLATION is BACK\u2014and RAGING! The Fed will never be able to credibly lower interest rates, because they want to protect the worst President in the history of the Untied [sic] States!\u201d"

            "content": "Inflation in shop prices in the UK has eased to the lowest level for more than two years after retailers cut prices on Easter treats, clothing and electrical goods amid a slowdown in spending by consumers in the cost of living crisis. Industry figures show prices rose at an annual rate of 1.3% in March, down from a rate of 2.5% in February \u2013 the slowest pace since December 2021, according to the latest monitor from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body and the market research firm NielsenIQ. Non-food inflation dived to just 0.2% from 1.3% in the previous month, while food inflation fell to 3.7% from 5%. The figures come amid growing hopes that the worst of the toughest increase in inflation for 40 years has passed, with anticipation that the Bank of England could begin cutting interest rates within months to ease pressure on households. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said inflation had fallen back amid fierce competition between retailers to entice consumer spending, as hard-pressed households cut back to make ends meet. \u201cWhile Easter treats were more expensive than in previous years due to high global cocoa and sugar prices, retailers provided cracking deals on popular chocolates, which led to price falls compared to the previous month,\u201d she said. \u201cDairy prices also fell on the month as farm gate prices eased, and retailers worked hard to lower prices for many essentials. In non-food, prices of electricals, clothing and footwear fell as retailers increased promotions to entice consumer spending.\u201d Competition has stepped up as households continue to rein in spending on non-essentials amid high energy bills and food costs as well as increases in mortgages and rents as a result of higher interest rates. The advisory firm BDO\u2019s regular survey of mid-sized retailers, many of which are fashion chains, found shoppers spent about 2% less in equivalent stores in the week to 24 March compared with the same week a year before, with homewares and fashion hit particularly hard. In-store sales were poor despite more people visiting shopping destinations, where footfall was up by about 2%. Mike Watkins, the head of retailer insight at NielsenIQ, said that a key driver of easing inflation was weaker growth in food prices: \u201cA year ago, food inflation was 15% so this was to be expected. But it is also helped by intense competition among the supermarkets as they look to drive footfall, with focused price cuts and promotional offers earlier in the month for Mother\u2019s Day and now again in the weeks leading up to Easter.\u201d The fall in shop prices will increase hopes that overall inflation is dropping closer to the Bank of England target of 2%. The Bank is forecasting that headline inflation as measured by the consumer prices index will fall below that level in April. However, a drop in the rate of inflation does not mean the overall cost of living will fall \u2013 prices will continue to rise but at a slower pace than over the past year. Financial markets expect Threadneedle Street to begin cutting rates from the current level of 5.25% from as early as May or June. Such a development would be seized on by Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, as evidence of progress in the economy as the Conservatives battle to overturn a commanding Labour lead in opinion polls. However, Dickinson warned that increases in the legal minimum wage and business rates for many firms, combined with additional Brexit-related border checks and new recycling plans \u201ccould put progress on bringing down inflation at risk\u201d. These costs include a 6.7% business rates rise, recycling proposals and new border checks. The national living wage also increased from Monday from \u00a310.42 an hour to \u00a311.44 an hour, the largest funding increase for more than a decade. \u201cThe industry needs pro-growth government policy that supports investment and helps keep down prices for households up and down the country,\u201d she said."

            "content": "The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has shrugged off a smaller-than-expected drop in inflation last month, saying he expected a sharp fall towards the government\u2019s 2% target next month. Speaking in Washington after news that the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living had eased from 3.4% in February to 3.2%, Bailey said the path of inflation was broadly in line with what Threadneedle Street had predicted in its quarterly health check on the economy. Financial markets had predicted a bigger drop in the annual rate in March to 3.1% and saw the latest data on price pressures as putting back the timing of interest rate cuts. But Bailey said: \u201cWe are pretty much on track with where we thought we would be \u2013 a bit under in February and a bit over in the latest figures. Next month will see quite a strong drop.\u201d While the UK was experiencing strong disinflation, the governor said the fall was unbalanced. He said that in April household energy bills were likely to be 25% lower than a year earlier, but service sector inflation is running at 6%. Decisions on interest rates would be influenced by service sector inflation, earnings growth and the state of the labour market, he said. \u201cIt looks like we are getting a loosening of the labour market,\u201d Bailey said after this week\u2019s news of a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.2%. \u201cBut we are disinflating at full employment.\u201d Bailey\u2019s comments followed the release of data showing the annual inflation rate at its lowest level since September 2021 \u2013 helped by food prices rising more slowly than a year earlier. Jeremy Hunt said: \u201cThe plan is working: inflation is \u2026 down from over 11% to 3.2%, the lowest level in nearly two and a half years, helping people\u2019s money go further.\u201d Speaking in Washington on Wednesday night, the chancellor said the economy had achieved a \u201csoft landing\u201d and been transformed since Rishi Sunak became prime minister. Asked whether he was disappointed that there had been no improvement in the Conservative party\u2019s poll ratings despite falling inflation, Hunt said: \u201cHow people feel is subjective and beyond my control. All I can do is take the right decisions about the fundamentals of the British economy. I think those have been transformed in the period since Rishi Sunak became prime minister.\u201d Hunt said that when he arrived at the Treasury in late 2022, the Bank of England was predicting the longest recession in 100 years and the Office for Budget Responsibility was expecting a record drop in living standards. \u201cIt looks like we have achieved a soft landing,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cLiving standards have risen, not fallen.\u201d Investors reacted to the March figure by trimming bets for an imminent reduction in borrowing costs, pricing in the first quarter-point rate cut in September or November. A matter of weeks ago, investors had been expecting a first cut in June. The Bank has raised interest rates to 5.25% as it tries to bring CPI inflation back down to its target of 2%. However, on Wednesday, Megan Greene, an independent economist on the Bank\u2019s nine-strong rate-setting committee, told an event in Washington that recent tensions in the Middle East could pose a risk to achieving that aim, including by heightening inflation expectations. \u201cI do think that what\u2019s going on in the Middle East does pose a risk,\u201d Greene told the Institute of International Finance. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the sort of an energy price shock and other supply-side shock, which obviously follow a number of supply-side shocks we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years, and what that might do to inflation expectations.\u201d The ONS said cooling inflation in food and drink prices contributed most to the decline, after a fall in the prices of bakery products including chocolate biscuits and crumpets. However, this was offset by rising fuel prices and stubbornly high inflation in services prices. A reduction in the rate of inflation does not mean that prices are falling, just that they are rising more slowly. The latest snapshot showed consumer prices continuing to rise across a broad range of categories, including car insurance, which soared by almost 30% compared with a year earlier. The cost of mobile phone and broadband packages also shot up and prices for hotels, beer and other alcoholic drinks rose as well. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the figures showed households remained worse off. \u201cPrices are still high in the shops, monthly mortgage bills are going up and inflation is still higher than the Bank of England\u2019s target,\u201d she said. The latest snapshot from the ONS showed that core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy, food and tobacco prices and is closely monitored by the Bank \u2013 slowed to 4.2% from 4.5% in February, but remained higher than forecast by City economists and the Bank. Services inflation, which the Bank also watches closely, eased slightly to 6% from 6.1% a month earlier, but was also marginally higher than predicted."

This poses a conundrum for central bankers who have made it clear they want to see further evidence that inflation is cooling before they cut interest rates. The Fed\u2019s high interest rates haven\u2019t pushed America to the brink of a recession, fortunately, but they haven\u2019t slowed inflation as much as policymakers had hoped. The question is whether Fed officials can cut interest rates at all this year. Joe Biden acknowledged that \u201cprices are still too high for housing and groceries\u201d, and said he was \u201ccalling on corporations, including grocery retailers, to use record profits to reduce prices\u201d. What\u2019s the president getting at? Corporate profits reached a record high in the fourth quarter of last year. The easiest explanation for record corporate profits at the same time prices remain elevated is that corporations have enough monopoly power to keep prices high. (Note that many corporations are also shrinking the size of the products you\u2019re buying without lowering their prices \u2013 a variant of the same thing.) This is one of the biggest reasons the American public is not yet crediting Biden with a great economy. Most people still aren\u2019t feeling it. In 2023, PepsiCo\u2019s chief financial officer said that even though inflation was dropping, its prices would not be. Pepsi hiked its prices by double digits and announced plans to keep them high in 2024. If Pepsi were challenged by tougher competition, consumers would just buy something cheaper. But PepsiCo\u2019s only major soda competitor is Coca-Cola, which \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 announced similar price hikes at about the same time as Pepsi and has also kept its prices high. The CEO of Coca-Cola claimed that the company had \u201cearned the right\u201d to push price hikes because its sodas are popular. Popular? The only thing that\u2019s popular these days seems to be corporate price gouging. We\u2019re seeing this pattern across much of the economy \u2013 especially with groceries. At the end of 2023, Americans were paying at least 30% more for beef, pork and poultry products than they were in 2020. Why? Near-monopoly power. Just four companies now control processing of 80% of beef, nearly 70% of pork, and almost 60% of poultry. So of course it\u2019s easy for them to coordinate price increases. The problem goes well beyond the grocery store. In 75% of US industries, fewer companies now control more of their markets than they did 20 years ago. What should be done? First, antitrust laws must be enforced. Kudos to the Biden administration for enforcing antitrust more aggressively than any administration in the last 40 years. This administration has taken action against alleged price fixing in the meat industry \u2013 which has been a problem for decades. The Biden administration has sued to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons \u2013 two giant grocery chains. Kroger operates 2,750 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The company\u2019s 19 brands include Ralphs, Smith\u2019s, King Soopers, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, Mariano\u2019s, Pick \u2019n Save, and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states. Its 15 brands include Safeway, Jewel-Osco, Vons, Acme and Shaw\u2019s. Together, Kroger and Albertsons employ around 700,000 people. The Biden administration is suing Amazon for using its dominance to artificially jack up prices, in one of the biggest anti-monopoly lawsuits in a generation. The Biden administration is suing Apple for using its market power to control its apps and prevent other businesses from offering them. The administration successfully sued to block the merger of JetBlue and Spirit Airlines, which would have made consolidation in the airline industry even worse. But given how concentrated American industry has become, there\u2019s still a long way to go. Biden should make his antitrust enforcement against corporate power a centerpiece of his campaign. Second, big corporations must not be allowed to use their power to gouge consumers. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others recently unveiled the latest version of their Price Gouging Prevention Act. \u201cGiant corporations are using supply chain shocks as a cover to excessively raise prices and sometimes charging the same price but shrinking how much consumers actually get,\u201d Warren charges. The bill would empower the Federal Trade Commission (which would also get $1bn in additional funding) and state attorneys general to stop companies from charging \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d prices, regardless of where alleged price gouging took place in a supply chain. The legislation would also protect small businesses \u2013 those earning less than $100m \u2013 from litigation if they had to raise prices in good faith during crises, and require public companies to disclose more about their costs and pricing strategies. I don\u2019t have any illusions that this bill will find its way into law soon. Democrats hold a slim majority in the Senate, and not all Democrats support it. Meanwhile, Republicans and their business backers are dead set against it \u2013 and are eager to blame continued high prices on Biden, not on corporations. But this bill is just as necessary as aggressive antitrust enforcement \u2013 and an example of what could and will be done if Democrats sweep the 2024 elections. The record profits of large corporations are coming out of the paychecks of average Americans, who are still struggling to get by. Biden and the Democrats must say this loudly and clearly and tell the public what they are doing \u2013 and will do \u2013 to stop corporate monopolies and price gouging.

            "content": "The eurozone has bounced back from its shallow technical recession after a stronger than expected performance by its \u201cbig four\u201d economies in the first three months of 2024. After two successive quarters of 0.1% contraction in the second half of 2023, the 20 nations that use the single currency posted growth of 0.3% between January and March. Figures from the European Commission\u2019s statistical agency \u2013 Eurostat \u2013 showed the eurozone had put in its best growth performance since the third quarter of 2022. Financial markets had been expecting 0.2% growth. Lower energy prices, falling inflation, rising real wages and the prospect of cuts in interest rates helped to boost activity after a downbeat 2023 in which the eurozone only grew in one quarter. Europe\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 grew by 0.2%, while Italy and Spain posted growth of 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. Germany\u2019s performance in the final three months of 2023 was worse than originally thought: the economy contracted by 0.5% rather than 0.3%. Of the smaller EU economies, the best performing were Ireland, which grew by 1.1% in the first three months of 2024, and Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary, which expanded by 0.8%. Separate Eurostat data showed headline eurozone inflation remained unchanged in April at 2.4%, while core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy and food \u2013 came down from 2.9% to 2.7%. Although the eurozone\u2019s growth performance in the first quarter was stronger than the European Central Bank had been forecasting, analysts said lower inflation paved the way for interest rate cuts in the months ahead. Sam Miley, the managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \u201cThis morning\u2019s confirmation of quarterly growth in the first quarter has put an end to a short-lived recession in the eurozone, with the economy having turned a corner since the beginning of 2024. \u201cProspects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by the expectation of interest rate cuts.\u201d Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWhile the eurozone\u2019s mild recession appears to be over, we think the economy will expand at only a moderate pace over the rest of the year.\u201d Some of the improvement in the first three months of 2024 was due to temporary factors, such as a rebound in construction, while business surveys also pointed to sluggish growth, Kenningham said. UK first quarter growth figures are due out next week, with the financial markets anticipating 0.3% growth and an end to the mild recession recorded in the second half of 2023. Figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals for house purchases rose from 60,500 in February to 61,300 in March, taking them to the highest level since September 2022. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will make its latest decision on interest rates next week, but is expected to leave official borrowing costs unchanged at 5.25%. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2024. An earlier version said that Hungary was in the eurozone instead of in the EU."

            "content": "Time to wrap up\u2026. here\u2019s the main stories, on the day the eurozone bounced out of its technical recession, and take-up of UK mortgages rose. France\u2019s central bank governor has suggested the European Central Bank now has the confidence it needs to cut interest rates at its next meeting in early June. Reuters has the details: French and euro-zone inflation data released on Tuesday gives confidence the European Central Bank will be able to start lowering interest rates in early June, ECB member and Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on social network Linkedin. As we covered this morning, eurozone annual inflation was unchanged at 2.4%, close to the ECB\u2019s 2% target, while France\u2019s inflation rate slipped to just 2.2%. This year\u2019s early Easter helped the eurozone to beat growth expectations in the first quarter of the year, say analysts at ABN AMRO. They told clients today: Eurozone GDP growth came in at 0.3% qoq in 2024Q1, stronger than our and consensus expectations for a more modest 0.1% rise. Today\u2019s upward surprise comes after a 5 quarter period in which the bloc\u2019s economy stagnated. We only have details for some individual countries, but based on this and monthly aggregate data the strength was probably driven by net exports, services consumption (partly due to the earlier timing of easter), and stronger construction activity due to the mild winter. Looking ahead, we expect GDP growth be somewhat weaker again in Q2 as some of the temporary supports for activity unwind, but we continue to expect a more sustained recovery in the second half of this year, supported by rising real incomes and easier financial conditions. Home prices across the US have continued to climb, despite Americans facing higher mortgage costs. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index shows that US house price rose by 6.4% in the year to February, up from 6% in January. Prices in the 10 largest cities jumped by 8% per year, up from 7.4%. \u201cFollowing last year\u2019s decline, U.S. home prices are at or near all-time highs,\u201d says Brian D. Luke, Head of Commodities, Real &amp; Digital Assets at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. He explains: \u201cOur National Composite rose by 6.4% in February, the fastest annual rate since November 2022. Our 10- and 20-City Composite indices are currently at all-time highs. For the third consecutive month, all cities reported increases in annual prices, with four currently at all-time highs: San Diego, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York. On a seasonal adjusted basis, our National, 10- and 20- City Composite indices continue to break through previous all-time highs set last year.\u201d Over in the US, wages are rising faster than the country\u2019s central bank would like. US wages and salaries increased by 1.1% in the first quarter of this year, matching the growth in the two previous quarters. And in the 12 months to March, wages and salaries increased by 4.4%, and by 4.3% for private industry workers. The persistence of wage growth could encourage the US Federal Reserve to take its time on rate cuts. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out that productivity growth is an important factor: The big question is whether wage growth is low enough to be consistent with hitting the 2% price inflation target on a sustained basis? 4.3% is still well above the pre-Covid average, but productivity growth is also significantly higher. Property experts are hailing this morning\u2019s news showing that UK mortgage approvals hit their highest for 18 months in March. Anthony Codling, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says rising mortgage approvals are good news for housebuilders: Given the recent increases in mortgage rates it was comforting to see mortgage approvals rise in March by 1.3% (seasonally adjusted) to 61,300, a level 20% higher than they were one year ago. We continue to believe that the UK housing market is slowly recovering even in the face of stubborn economic, mortgage rate headwinds, and election date uncertainty. But, there are also forecasts that the recovery will tail off, as borrowers are facing rising mortgage rates. Hina Bhudia, partner at Knight Frank Finance, says the recovery in housing market activity continued into March: At 61,300, mortgage approvals for house purchase are now approaching the 65,000 or so monthly approvals we saw during the three years leading up to the pandemic. \u201cThe market is currently dominated by buyers that really need to move, and that\u2019s unlikely to change in the near-term. Mortgage rates are rising once again, and both Natwest and Santander raised rates on their product ranges this morning. \u201cThat will inevitably cause some would-be buyers to sit out this spring selling season, which should be gathering pace this week. The sun is out and buyers are returning from their Easter break, so we\u2019d usually expect these to be the busy weeks before the summer, however the uncertain outlook for mortgage rates will undoubtedly weigh on activity. \u201cIt\u2019s not just buyers that are frustrated. The lenders are eager to rebuild their businesses after a subdued 2023, however they are constrained by stubborn inflation and the resulting impact on their cost of funding.\u201d Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist, warns that mortgage rates are set to edge up further, as the impact of higher swap rates feeds through. That means the recovery in mortgage approvals will continue to cool, Arnold predicts: \u201cThe recovery in mortgage demand continued in March, with approvals for new house purchases rising to 61,325, an 18-month high. However, the increase in mortgage interest rates over recent months appears to have taken some of the momentum out of the recovery, with the rise in approvals between February and March being much smaller than the previous two months. Net mortgage lending slipped to just \u00a30.3bn in March, from \u00a31.6bn in February, but February\u2019s outturn had been flattered by a temporary slump in repayments. \u201cWith swap rates having climbed further during April, and mortgage rates continuing to edge up in response, the EY ITEM Club expects the recovery in approvals to continue to cool in the near-term. Canada has joined the GDP party, but its growth figures are a bit of a damp squib. Canadian growth slowed in February, with GDP rising by 0.2% in February \u2013 weaker than the 0.3% expected \u2013 following a 0.5% gain in January. Statistics Canada says: Services-producing industries (+0.2%) led the growth for a second month in a row, fuelled by gains in transportation and warehousing. The goods-producing industries aggregate was essentially unchanged as the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector expanded while the utilities and manufacturing sectors contracted in February. Statistics Canada also estimates that Canada\u2019s economy expanded 0.6% in the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 which would be twice as fast as the eurozone. The FTSE 100 share index has touched a new alltime high today, as its rally continues. The index of major blue-chip companies listed in London hit 8199.95 points for the first time today, above yesterday\u2019s record high of 8189.14 points. Premier Inn owner Whitbread is the top riser, up 4.6%, after hiking its dividend, announcing a \u00a3150m share buyback plan and 1,500 job cuts. HSBC are also rallying, up 4% after beating profit forecasts this morning. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index, says: The FTSE 100 is rising on Tuesday and is set to record its second straight month of gains, boosted by upbeat corporate earnings and despite mixed data from China. HSBC is up 2.5% after the bank posted better-than-expected pretax profits and announced a $3 billion share buyback, offsetting the news that CEO No Quinn will retire. The Asian-focused bank posted a 3% rise in revenue to $20.8 billion, well ahead of the $16.94 forecast. Pre-tax profit was $12.65 billion, down 2% annually, but still ahead of estimates. Adding to the good news, the British Retail Consortium noted that inflation was easing in the UK as shop prices rose at the slowest pace in more than two years in April. The data adds to signs that inflationary pressures are cooling, which could bring some relief to the Bank of England as policymakers consider when to start cutting interest rates. Heavyweight miners were in edging higher after Chinese factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in 14 months in April thanks to rising new export orders. In a busy day for growth data, Mexico\u2019s economy has expanded by 0.2% in the last quarter, beating forecasts for stagnation. On an annual basis, though, growth slowed to 1.6% per year, missing forecasts of 2.1%: The fast-food restaurant business McDonald\u2019s has missed sales forecasts as boycotts over war in the Middle East hit its takings. McDonald\u2019s has reported that global sales rose by 1.9% in January-March, missing Wall Street\u2019s forecast of a 2.1% increase. McDonald\u2019s says that like-for-like sales in its international markets division were slightly negative, falling by 0.2%, as the segment \u201ccontinued to be impacted by the war in the Middle East\u201d. CEO Chris Kempczinski says: Our global comparable sales growth in the first quarter marks 13 consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth with 30% growth over the last four years. As consumers are more discriminating with every dollar that they spend, we will continue to earn their visits by delivering leading, reliable, everyday value and outstanding execution in our restaurants. McDonald\u2019s has been hit by boycotts across the Middle East and in Muslim-majority markets like Indonesia and Malaysia since October, AP reports, when its Israel franchise announced shortly after the Hamas attack of 7 October that it would be donating free meals to the Israeli military. McDonald\u2019s took control of this franchise from Alonyal Ltd at the start of April. The eurozone has bounced back from its shallow technical recession after a stronger than expected performance by its \u201cbig four\u201d economies in the first three months of 2024. After two successive quarters of 0.1% contraction in the second half of 2023, the 20 nations that use the single currency posted growth of 0.3% between January and March, my colleague Larry Elliott writes. Figures from the European Commission\u2019s statistical agency \u2013 Eurostat \u2013 showed the eurozone had put in its best growth performance since the third quarter of 2022. Financial markets had been expecting 0.2% growth. Lower energy prices, falling inflation, rising real wages and the prospect of cuts in interest rates helped to boost activity after a downbeat 2023 in which the eurozone only grew in one quarter. More here. In the currency markets, Japan appears to have burned through $35bn supporting the yen yesterday. Bank of Japan data suggests Japanese officials may have spent some 5.5 trillion yen ($35.06bn) supporting the currency on Monday, Reuters flags. The intervention came after the yen dropped to a 34-year low of 160 yen to the dollar, and helped it strengthen back to around 155/$, Japanese officials have not said whether they intervened. The yen has dropped by around 11% against the US dollar this year. It has come under pressure even though the Bank of Japan raised interest rates out of negative territory in March. Traders are wagering that the BoJ will be cautious about raising interest rates higher, while the dollar is benefiting from bets that the US Federal Reserve will be cautious about cutting US rates this year. That is putting pressure on the yen. Anglo American\u2019s chairman, Stuart Chambers, has assured shareholders over the company\u2019s future resilience days after rejecting the \u00a331bn takeover proposal from larger rival BHP. He told shareholders gathered for the company\u2019s Annual General Meeting in London today that the board had unanimously agreed to oppose BHP\u2019s \u201copportunistic\u201d approach in the \u201cclearest terms\u201d because it undervalued the company. When questioned by one shareholder, Chambers said the UK\u2019s takeover code meant the board would be unable to elaborate on its decision beyond the statement it released on Friday. \u201cBut I will be meeting with shareholders and listening very carefully, particularly [to] the larger ones in the top 30 of the register, to hear what they feel,\u201d Chambers said. He added: \u201cThe board doesn\u2019t buy or sell the company - the shareholders decide.\u201d Back in the UK, more than 400 jobs are at risk as the consumer healthcare company Haleon plans to shut a manufacturing site in Berkshire. Haleon is planning to shut down its manufacturing site in Maidenhead by 2026, a move which will affect 435 jobs. That factory makes Haleon products such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Parodontax mouthwash. A Haleon spokesperson told Reuters: Following a strategic review of our global manufacturing capabilities, we have determined that our Maidenhead site is no longer a viable option for the manufacture of our products. The Guardian reported in July last year that Haleon was planning widespread layoffs in the UK and around the world, a year after being spun off from Britain\u2019s second-biggest drugmaker GSK. The Eurozone economy exited stagnation \u201cwith a bang rather than a whimper\u201d, says Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 senior economist Kamil Kovar. Kovar says the \u201calmost normal above-consensus growth of 0.3%\u201d could encourage the European Central Bank to take cautious approach to interest rate cuts: This confirms that 2024 will mark the long-postponed recovery in euro zone. However, it was not all cheers, with details showing some weakness beneath the strong headline figure: consumptions was still weak in many places, and only strong construction, driven by warm weather, and increase in net exports ensured the strong number. Still, the ECB hawks will point to the strong GDP number as argument that ECB can take its rates lower gradually. A June cut will still occur, but a further cut in July just became bit more unlikely.\u201d There\u2019s not much financial market reaction to the eurozone\u2019s better-than-expected growth report. The euro has gained about 0.06% to $1.0725 against the US dollar against this morning. It\u2019s gained 0.2% against the pound, dragging sterling down to \u20ac1.1694. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says: The euro is back above $1.0720 vs. the US dollar after stronger than expected European GDP for Q1. Quarterly GDP rose by 0.3%, which was stronger than the 0.1% expected, and \u2018bounced\u2019 back from the -0.1% dip in growth registered in Q4. Growth was broad-based across the currency bloc. However, southern European economies continue to outperform their Northern counterparts. But, this is unlikely to influence the European Central Bank, Brooks argues: The interest rate futures market is still expecting the ECB to cut rates in June, due to the April inflation print, which was in line with expectations at 2.4%. Core prices were slightly higher than expected at 2.7%, however this is still lower than the 2.9% recorded for March and the lowest level for nearly 2 years. German and French CPI also registered 2.4% annual CPI growth, which is within touching distance of the ECB\u2019s 2% target. Today\u2019s economic data out of the Eurozone point to an improving picture, reports Daniele Antonucci, chief investment officer at Quintet Private Bank: Looking at the change relative to the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the beat versus consensus exceeds the highest prediction in the key polls of forecasters. That\u2019s the glass-half-full story, especially following the shallow recession the region has gone through in the second half of last year, though the caveat is that consumer spending across many European countries remains quite feeble. The glass-half-empty story is that the pace of growth remains rather anaemic, with the forward-looking indicators pointing to moderately positive economic conditions. The contrast with the US, where domestic demand looks resilient and GDP growth appears to be re-accelerating, is stark. This is important when prospects for the overall economy are seen in the context of the inflation data that is coming in. In the US, inflation has surprised to the upside lately. In the Eurozone, today\u2019s data show a sideways trajectory for overall inflation, in line with expectations and lower in absolute terms than in the US. Although 0.3% quarterly growth isn\u2019t exactly stellar, it\u2019s the eurozone\u2019s strongest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2022, early in Europe\u2019s energy crisis. Bert Colijn, ING\u2019s senior eurozone economist, says the eurozone economy has clearly entered a better phase with economic recovery, low unemployment and more moderate inflation. Lower energy prices, following the surge in oil and gas after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, are helping the economy. Colijn explains: The economy is profiting from a more stable energy supply, with costs having substantially eased, resulting in lower inflation. Wage growth, in turn, has accelerated to make up for lost purchasing power, which is currently benefiting consumers. We have yet to get the details, but judging from what\u2019s happening in France, we see that household consumption led the way The eurozone is set to grow faster this year than in 2023, predicts Sam Miley, managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research: This morning\u2019s confirmation of quarterly growth in Q1 has put an end to a short-lived recession in the Eurozone, with the economy having turned a corner since the beginning of 2024. Prospects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by the expectation of interest rate cuts. Further data released this morning showed that inflation has now stood within one percentage point of target for seven consecutive months, suggesting a suitable environment for the European Central Bank to consider adopting looser monetary policy. Such policy changes will support growth this year. Cebr expects the Eurozone economy to expand by 0.6% in 2024, up from 2023\u2019s growth figure of 0.4%. The eurozone economy is \u201cmoving along nicely\u201d, says Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, following today\u2019s GDP data. Inflation in the eurozone came in as expected but is proving to be stickier than might have been hoped for, mirroring experiences elsewhere. The economy is moving along nicely though, meaning that, all in all, the ECB will be able to stay on track to be the first of the major central banks to push the \u201ccut\u201d button on interest rates, probably in June. The prospects for the Eurozone are on the up, at a time when there is doubt creeping in for other economies\u2019 prospects. Here\u2019s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, on today\u2019s eurozone data: Inflation across the eurozone was unchanged in April. Eurostat reports that consumer price inflation was 2.4% per year, matching March\u2019s reading. Services inflation did slow, to 3.7% from 4% in March, but food, alcohol &amp; tobacco inflation picked up to 2.8% from 2.6%. Non-energy industrial goods prices rose by 0.9%, down from 1.1%. Energy has less of a deflationary effect, though, with prices down by 0.6% year-on-year, from -1.8% in March. Disappointingly, core inflation fell by less than expected. Inflation, stripping out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, fell to 2.7% per year in April, down from 2.9%, but ahead of forecasts of a larger fall to 2.6%. NEWSFLASH: The eurozone has escaped recession, and beaten forecasts for growth at the start of this year. GDP across the eurozone expanded by 0.3% in January-March, statistics body Eurostat reports. This means the eurozone\u2019s shallow recession is over \u2013 its GDP shrank by 0.1% in both the third and fourth quarters of last year, which was a technical recession. Eurozone growth has been held back by high interest rates, as the European Central Bank has battled inflation, while the cost of living crisis hit consumer spending. Euro area GDP was lifted by stronger-than-expected growth in Germany, France, Italy and Spain (as we\u2019ve been blogging since early this morning). The wider European Union also grew by 0.3%. Eurostat says: Ireland (+1.1%) recorded the highest increase compared to the previous quarter, followed by Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary (all +0.8%). Sweden (-0.1%) was the only Member State that recorded a decrease compared to the previous quarter. The year on year growth rates were positive for nine countries and negative for four. France got the day off to a good start by reporting growth of 0.2% \u2013 which was hailed by its economy minister \u2013 before Spain posted a sizzling 0.7% growth. Germany then matched France, with 0.2% growth, while Italy expanded its GDP by 0.3%. In the UK, mortgage approvals are at their highest level since the chaos of Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. New Bank of England data show that lenders approved 61,300 in March, up from 60,500 in February, which is the highest total since September 2022. There was also some relief for borrowers; the \u2018effective\u2019 interest rate \u2013 which is the actual interest paid \u2013 on newly drawn mortgages decreased by 17 basis points, to 4.73% in March. Getting back to eurozone GDP\u2026 and Portugal has grown as a steady pace at the start of this year. Portugal\u2019s GDP grew by 0.7% in Q1 2024, the same rate as in Q4 2023, and was 1.4% larger than a year ago. Earlier this month, Portugal\u2019s new centre-right government predicted the economy would grow 1.5% in 2024. It is planning to roll out tax cuts for the middle class in an effort to spur growth and investment. The German sportswear brand Adidas has benefited from a sales pick-up in Europe and China that helped it to overcome a slowdown in the US. Adidas has reported that sales in Europe increased by 14% in the last quarter, while they grew by 8% in Greater China, but fell by 4% in North America. Adidas CEO Bj\u00f8rn Gulden reported that sales, gross margin, and operating profit were all better than expected, and warned that \u201cmarkets are still volatile and not easy\u201d. Gulden adds: We now look forward to celebrate the great sports events like the Euro 2024, Copa Am\u00e9rica, the Olympics and Paralympics. It is a great year for sports \u2013 let us all enjoy it! Next stop, Italy \u2013 where growth has accelerated at the start of this year. Italian GDP grew by 0.3% in January-March, statistics body ISTAT reports, comfortably ahead of forecasts of 0.1% growth. That\u2019s the third quarter of growth in a row, although Italy\u2019s economy was only 0.6% larger than a year ago. ISTAT says: The quarter on quarter change is the result of an increase of value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing, in that of industry and in services. From the demand side, there is a negative contribution by the domestic component (gross of change in inventories) and a positive one by the net export component. Last month, revised data showed that Italy had actually achieved the best recovery of any major European economy over the last four years. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s global head of macro, has welcomed Germany\u2019s GDP report \u2013 saying it proves that its economy can still grow. Brzeski says: Just as some German children have been asking their parents whether they remember a time when the economy was actually growing, the first estimate of 1Q GDP growth came in at 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, from a downwardly revised -0.5% QoQ in the fourth quarter. On the year, the German economy was still down by 0.2% when corrected for working days. There are no estimates for the GDP components but judging by the available monthly data, growth in the first quarter was mainly driven by the construction sector and net exports. Brzeski is also confident that Germany\u2019s economic cycle has started to turn for the better, after some tough quarters. He says: The words \u2018optimism\u2019 and \u2018German economy\u2019 together in one sentence have been a rarity for a long while. However, for a few weeks now, optimism has returned to the German economy. Today\u2019s GDP growth data is almost just the natural next step of stronger sentiment indicators and a pick-up in activity since the start of the year. Here comes the big one, Germany\u2019s GDP report\u2026 And Europe\u2019s largest economy has returned to growth! German GDP expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2024, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) reports, beating expectations of 0.1% growth. Destatis says this \u201cmodest growth\u201d was due to an increase in gross fixed capital formation in construction and in exports, while household consumption fell. This follows a deeper-than-first-thought contraction at the end of laast year. Destasis reports that Germany shrank by 0.5% in Q4 2023, worst than the 0.3% previously estimated. The number of people out of work in Germany rose more than expected in April, Reuters reports. Federal Labour Office figures this morning show that the number of unemployed grew by 10,000 in seasonally adjusted terms. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected that figure to rise by 9,000. The Czech Republic grew faster than forecast in the first quarter of this year \u2013 continuing the theme of the morning! Czech GDP rose by 0.5% in January-March, beating forecasts of 0.4% growth. Growth was driven by domestic demand, including higher spending by households and investment by businesses. Vladim\u00edr Kermiet, Director of the National Accounts Department of the Czech Statistical Office (CZSO), says: The total final consumption expenditure and an increasing external trade balance contributed to the year-on-year growth. Conversely, a decrease in gross capital formation continued. As the Czech Republic isn\u2019t in the eurozone, this won\u2019t help euro area GDP (due at 10am UK time), but it\u2019s another sign that the European economy is growing this year. On an annual basis, the Czech economy was 0.4% larger than a year ago. Austria\u2019s growth figures are also stronger than expected. Austrian GDP expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter of this year, better than the 0.1% which economists forecast. This is the first increase in GDP in a year, after the economy shrank by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2023, by 0.3% in Q3 2023, and then stagnated in Q4 last year. Growth was driven by private consumer demand, while Austria\u2019s industrial economy remained weak and |\u201dalmost stagnated\u201d, think tank WIFO reports, while investment demand declined again. Separately, inflation in Austria has fallen to an average of 3.5% in April, its lowest level since September 2021. Just in: Spain\u2019s economy has grown faster than forecast. Spanish GDP rose by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, new data from statistics body INS showed. That\u2019s rather faster than the 0.4% growth which economists had expected \u2013 an encouraging sign, especially after France grew faster than forecast (see earlier post). INS also revised up Spain\u2019s growth in Q4 2023, to 0.7% from 0.6%. On an annual basis, Spain\u2019s economy grew by 2.4%, mostly driven by \u201cnational demand\u201d, with \u201cexternal demand\u201d contributing 0.2 points. This stronger-than-forecast growth should cheer Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who yesterday announced he would stay on as PM despite a \u201charassment and bullying operation\u201d being waged against him and his wife by his political and media enemies. German carmaker Volkswagen has revealed that its operating profits slumped by a fifth in the first quarter of this year. Europe\u2019s top automaker was hit by lower sales and higher costs, but is sticking to its revenue and margin targets for 2024. Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen\u2019s CFO and COO, says the results \u201cshow a slow start to the year\u201d, but he insists that new models will help the company this year: A strong March, the solid order bank and the improving order intake in the past months are encouraging and should already have a positive impact in the second quarter. We expect additional momentum over the course of the year from the launch of more than 30 new models across all brands. Volkswagen\u2019s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped by 20% to \u20ac4.6bn, while sales were down 2%. French inflation has slowed, despite a pick-up in energy prices. France\u2019s consumer price index rose by 2.2% per year in April, statistics body INSEE estimates, down from 2.3% in March. The decrease was partly due to a slowdown in the price rises of food (1.2%) and tobacco (9%), and also to a slight drop (-0.1%) in the cost of manufactured goods. However, energy inflation rose to 3.8% from 3.4% in March, while services inflation stuck at 3%. France\u2019s economy minister has hailed today\u2019s news that the French economy grew more than expected in the first quarter. Bruno Le Maire declared that the government\u2019s strategy was working, after GDP rose by 0.2% in January-March. Le Maire says: \u201cTo all those who want us to believe that our economy is at a standstill: facts are stubborn. French growth is progressing. \u201cThis is a new sign showing the solidity of our economy,\u2026[the] government\u2019s strategy is paying off.\u201d This is the second piece of good news to drop into Le Maire\u2019s inbox in a week. Two major credit-rating agencies, Moody\u2019s and Fitch, left France\u2019s rating unchanged last Friday, despite concerns about its large national debt and deteriorating public finances. Hungary has returned to growth, in an encouraging sign for Eastern Europe\u2019s economy. Hungary\u2019s gross domestic product grew by 0.8% in the first quarter of this year, new data shows, having previously stagnated with 0% growth in the last quarter of 2023. Growth was driven by market services, such as real estate activities as well as information and communication, while the industrial sector shrank. Hotel firm Whitbread, which operates in the UK and Germany, is axing 1,500 jobs in a cost-cutting plan\u2026. and boosting returns to shareholders. Whitbread has today announced a new efficiency programme which will deliver \u00a3150m of cost savings over the next three years. It says: The plan we are announcing today will result in the reduction of around 1,500 roles out of a total UK workforce of 37,000. While these plans are still subject to consultation, we will seek to find alternative opportunities wherever possible through the roles created by this plan and our existing recruitment process that makes c.15,000 hires each year. We expect to retain a significant proportion of those affected who wish to remain with us and we will be providing dedicated support to our teams. Whitbread announced the plan alongside its latest financial results, which show revenues rose 13% in the last financial year, while pre-tax profits grew 21%. Its Premier Inn Germany division grew its sales by 62%, while its losses narrowed to \u00a336m from \u00a350m. Whitbread investors can look forward to higher returns; the company\u2019s board is recommending a 26% increase in the final dividend to 62.9p per share. It also plans to start a new \u00a3150m share buy-back (exactly the amount it intends to save through cost-cutting!), to run through the first half of this financial year. We haev encouraging economic news from Germany too, where consumer spending has risen faster than expected. German retail sales grew by 1.8% in March, beating forecasts of 1.1% growth, and largely reversing the 1.9% drop recorded in February. The broader picture is that France\u2019s economy has only grown modestly over the last nine months. The 0.2% rise in GDP in January-March reported this morning follows two quarters of 0.1% growth. Newsflash: France\u2019s economic growth has accelerated in the first quarter of this year, beating expectations. In an encouraging start to eurozone GDP day, French GDP expanded by 0.2% in January-March, a pick-up on the 0.1% growth recorded in October-December. Economists had only expected growth of 0.1%, so this may bolster hopes that the eurozone has returned to growth. Household spending helped drive the French economy, statistics body INSEE says, with final domestic demand bouncing back and contributing 0.4 percentage points to growth. But foreign trade\u2019s contribution to GDP growth fell to zero, with imports rising by 0.2% and exports up by 0.5%. There\u2019s big news in the banking sector this morning: HSBC\u2019s chief executive officer Noel Quinn is unexpectedly stepping down after nearly 5 years in the job. The board has begun a formal process to find a successor, firing the starting gun to find a replacement at Europe\u2019s largest bank. Quinn is stepping back after leading a series of strategic reviews, boosting HSBC\u2019s investment in its Asian business while cutting back on other markets such as France and the US. Looking ahead, Quinn explains why he\u2019s stepping down: \u201cAfter an intense five years, it is now the right time for me to get a better balance between my personal and business life. I intend to pursue a portfolio career going forward.\u201d Quinn was appointed CEO in March 2020, after a stint as interim chief executive, and steered the bank through the Covid-19 pandemic. He also faced pressure from major shareholder Ping An to separate out its Asian business. There\u2019s good news for UK shoppers this morning \u2013 prices are rising at their slowest rate since late 2021 this month, with non-food goods actually cheaper than a year ago. Deep discounts by clothing and footwear retailers put the brakes on inflation, the latest snapshot of high street spending trends has shown. The monthly bulletin from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) \u2013 the lobby group for the industry \u2013 found that the battle by store owners to offload summer stock in cold and wet weather meant prices in non-food stores were lower this month than a year earlier. The BRC said the cost of non-food goods fell at an annual rate of 0.6% in April, while the price of food increased by 3.4%, down from 3.7% in March. Taken together, food and non-food inflation stood at 0.8% in April, compared to 1.3% in the year to March \u2013 the lowest level since December 2021. More here: We already have some idea how the eurozone fared in the first quarter of this year, as Ireland and Belgium both released growth data yesterday. Ireland\u2019s GDP rose by an impressive-sounding 1.1%. in January-March, led by a rebound in its tech sector. That means Ireland\u2019s technical recession has ended, after its GDP shrank through 2023, including a 3.4% contraction in October-December 2023. GDP isn\u2019t a great way of measuring Ireland\u2019s economy, though, as the data is distorted by multinational companies based in the Republic. Belgium\u2019s data was altogether calmer \u2013 its GDP expanded by 0.3% in January-March, for the fourth quarter in a row. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The eurozone economy is in the spotlight today with new growth figures, and inflation data, being released across the single currency bloc. Having been held back by high interest rates, and the cost of living squeeze, economists are hoping the eurozone returned to growth in the first quarter of this year. Analysts predict that eurozone GDP grew by 0.1% in January-March quarter. That would pull the region out of a shallow recession, after it contracted by 0.1% in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Analysts at Investec are hopeful that we\u2019ll see some growth in the eurozone: Focus will also be on the inflation outlook in the Eurozone, with flash HICP for April due on Tuesday. This will be released at the same time as Q1 GDP. Recent revisions now mean that the Eurozone was in a technical recession in H2, albeit by the slimmest of margins. Given that economic data at the start of 2024 has been more positive, we expect the Eurozone exited that recession in Q1, with a 0.1% quarterly expansion in output. Inflation is expected to remain unchanged at 2.4% in April, while core inflation could slip to 2.6% from 2.9%. Easing inflationary pressures could leave the European Central Bank free to start cutting interest rates in June \u2013 especially if growth were to disappoint\u2026 Also coming up today Frankly, it could be a monster day for news. For starters, new post-Brexit charges on imports of EU food and plant products into Britain begin today. Fees of up to \u00a3145 will apply to small imports of animal products and plants, such as sausages, cheese and yoghurt, entering the UK from the EU through the port of Dover and through Eurotunnel at Folkestone. A flurry of big name companies are reporting financial results today; we\u2019ll hear from Whitbread, Glencore, Prudential, St James\u2019s Place and Howdens, while HSBC has just reported a small (1.5%) dip in profits for the last quarter, to $12.7bn. Over in Europe, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Adidas and Lufthansa are reporting, while on Wall Street McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Amazon will update the markets. Mining giant Anglo American is holding its annual general meeting, days after fending off a takeover proposal from rival BHP Group, who are now considering whether to improve their offer\u2026 And in parliament, MPs on the Treasury committee are holding an inquiry into financial sanctions on Russia this morning, while the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee will question supermarket bosses about food price inflation, profits and relationships with producers this afternoon.

            "title": "UK takes another step on path out of recession as GDP rises ",
            "date": "2024-04-12T06:09:22Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy has taken a step closer to exiting recession as official figures showed growth continued in February despite a washout month for construction and retail after one of the wettest starts to a year on record. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.1% in February, matching City economists\u2019 forecasts and extending a recovery after growth in January was revised up from 0.2% to 0.3%. Liz McKeown, an ONS director of economics statistics, said: \u201cThe economy grew slightly in February with widespread growth across manufacturing, particularly in the car sector. Services also grew a little, with public transport and haulage and telecommunications having strong months. \u201cPartially offsetting this there were notable falls across construction as the wet weather hampered many building projects.\u201d The UK met the technical definition of recession after contracting in the third and fourth quarters of last year. An end to the slump will require a continued expansion in March to meet a quarterly return to growth. Rishi Sunak is under pressure to show progress on the economy before sending voters to the polls in a general election expected later this year, with the Conservatives trailing Labour in opinion polls. The latest figures also show growth of 0.1% over the three months to the end of February, the first expansion over a three-month period since last summer, with activity recovering from a slump last year as households cut back on spending amid the cost of living crisis. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the figures were a \u201cwelcome sign that the economy is turning a corner, and we can build on this progress if we stick to our plan\u201d. Growth in February was driven by manufacturing in particular, with a sharp recovery in car production, where output was up by 17.8% compared with the same month a year earlier. However, construction output collapsed by 1.9% on the month as heavy rainfall forced cranes to sit idle on building sites. The UK\u2019s dominant services sector, which makes up about four-fifths of the economy, also struggled for growth momentum, with an expansion of only 0.1% on the month amid weaker activity in retail and wholesale distribution. The ONS highlighted figures showing it was the fourth wettest February on record in England, contributing to fewer sales by household goods and food stores but increased online sales. It also said conflict in the Middle East had disrupted global supply chains, hitting retailers, vehicle mechanics and health and social work, where approximately one in 10 businesses were affected. Economists said GDP would need to fall by an unlikely 1% or more in March for the economy to contract over the first quarter of 2024 as a whole, meaning an escape from a short and shallow recession is widely anticipated. Business surveys have also pointed to continued strength in private sector activity in March. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cAs a result, we can safely say, after lasting just two quarters and involving a total fall in GDP of just 0.4% or so, [that] the recession ended in the fourth quarter.\u201d However, growth is expected to remain weak while households and businesses remain under pressure from elevated Bank of England interest rates and significantly higher prices for goods and services than three years ago. Despite the monthly recovery in output at the start of 2024, GDP remains below its level of June 2023, and has stayed broadly flat since early 2022. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: \u201cOur economy is still smaller than this time last year, with growth stuck in the slow lane. Real wages are still worth less than in 2008. And millions are struggling to cover their bills. \u201cAfter 14 years of stagnation you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find many people who feel better off.\u201d The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: \u201cAfter 14 years of Conservative economic failure, Britain is worse off with low growth and high taxes. The Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-29T15:38:33Z",
            "content": "PS: The London stock market has ended the day at a new closing high, just. The FTSE 100 index has closed for the night up 7 points, or 0.1%, at 8147 points. That\u2019s its latest in a series of closing highs. Earlier in the session it nudged a new intraday high of 8189.14 points. Time to wrap up\u2026 here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories: Newsflash: Online grocery firm Ocado has been given a bloody nose by shareholders protest over its plan to give its CEO Tim Steiner a potential bonus of almost \u00a315m. But while one in five shareholders opposed the plan, it has been approved. At today\u2019s annual general meeting, 19.4% of shareholders opposed the approval of the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy. Another resolution, to approve the Ocado Performance Share Plan 2024, was passed with 80.62% votes in favour, and 19.38% against. As we reported this morning, shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis had urged investors to vote against Ocado\u2019s remuneration policy and performance share plan, citing \u201cegregious remuneration practices\u201d. Campaign group ShareAction planned to ask Ocado\u2019s board why it was comfortable proposing the multimillion-pound pay package for Steiner while \u201crefusing to pay hundreds of its workers a real living wage of \u00a312 an hour\u201d. Under Ocado\u2019s pay plan, Steiner could receive a bonus worth up to 1,800% \u2013 or an \u201cenhanced multiplier\u201d \u2013 of his \u00a3824,570 base salary if its share price hits \u00a329.69 in three years\u2019 time and other performance targets are met. Ocado shares hit \u00a329 during the pandemic when online shopping surged, but have since fallen, trading at 357p today. He would receive an award worth 600% of his base salary, or almost \u00a35m, if targets for total shareholder returns and other performance measures are met but the share price goal is missed. In the mining sector, BHP Group and Vale are proposing a $25.7bn settlement over Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster, the Mariana dam failure. The collapse of the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam in November 2015 killed 19 people, polluted a river and devastated livelihoods downstream of the Samarco Mariana Mining Complex. The dam was co-owned by Vale and BHP, through their Brazilian joint venture Samarco; they have been negotiating with the Brazilian State and Federal Government and other public entities. Today, they say: As part of the settlement negotiations, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale have submitted a non-binding, indicative settlement proposal which is within BHP Brasil\u2019s provision for the Samarco dam failure. The proposal is for a total financial value of approximately R$127 billion (approximately US$25.7 billion) on a 100% basis with Samarco as the primary obligor and a 50% contribution from each of Vale and BHP Brasil as secondary obligors if Samarco cannot fund. The new offer includes around R$37bn (US$7.7bn) already spent on remediation and compensation to date. Shares in Tesla have surged 12% at the start of trading in New York, recovering some of their recent losses. Investors appear to be pleased with Elon Musk\u2019s weekend work in Beijing, where he secured a deal for Tesla to use mapping data provided by web search company Baidu. That deal could be an important step towards Tesla introducing driver assistance technology in the world\u2019s largest car market. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: Baidu, which dominates web search in China, will provide mapping and navigation functions to help Tesla operate its driver assistance technology, which it calls \u201cfull self-driving\u201d, or FSD, according to sources cited by Bloomberg News. Mapping services \u2013 crucial to driver assistance technologies \u2013 are strictly controlled by China\u2019s government. Despite its name, FSD does not provide autonomous driving abilities: it requires a driver who has \u201chands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment\u201d. However, launching it in China could help Tesla in the fierce competition for market share in the country, and provide more income. It costs $8,000, or $99 (\u00a380) a month, although it is not available in many countries. As covered earlier (8.06am), Musk also met with China\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, during an unexpected trip to the Chinese capital. Tesla\u2019s shares are still down 25% so far this year, but have been recovering since mid-April when they sunk to around $140 each, amid concerns over slowing sales. Kristalina Georgieva then warns that Europe is facing two problems \u2013 low growth and high debt. She explains: Problem one: growth. Our World Economic Outlook shows the global economy converging back to a rather weak trend rate of growth. Yes, the US economy still looks like it\u2019s firing on all cylinders, but that is unlikely to last. In China, real-estate issues weigh on the outlook. In Europe, productivity growth lags behind, reflecting much less private investment in new technologies than in the United States. This is why we say it is vital to pursue structural reforms and scale-up innovation and investment. Europe needs faster productivity growth, and that means reforms\u2014including transformational ones in the energy and digital arenas, and the completion of the single market. Problem two: debt. After two massive shocks\u2014the pandemic and the energy-supply shock caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2014many countries are shouldering very heavy public debt burdens. This is why we say many countries must now pursue judicious, wellarticulated medium-term fiscal consolidation to rebuild buffers\u2014 appropriately tailored to country specifics, of course. This is \u201cnot a great place\u201d to start a big push to develop clean energy supply and fight climate change, Georgieva cautions, adding: But let us be clear: if we do not win the fight against climate change, all of humanity together, we will all suffer. Over in Brussels, the head of the International Monetary Fund has welcomed signs that inflation is easing in the eurozone. Kristalina Georgieva, IMF managing director, is addressing the Annual EU Budget Conference, and begins by hailing easing inflation. Georgieva says: The global environment. When we stare out at the horizon, what do we see? I see a hint of sunshine. But I also see a dull grey sky and some dark clouds. Let me start with the sunshine. After a global burst of inflation to levels many people have never seen in their lifetimes, it looks like the ECB\u2019s tight monetary policy is doing its work. This is something I need to say carefully because it\u2019s not over yet. But, yes, it looks promising: inflation down from its disturbingly high peaks and no deep recessions in Europe. Georgieva then warns, though, that the forget though, that \u201cthe last mile can be the hardest\u201d in the fight against inflation. No longer will the major central banks be marching in lockstep, as they did during the recent ratehiking cycle. No. From now on, each currency zone will have to chart its own path. An interest rate divergence looms, and maybe some exchange rate movements too. We save the champagne for later. Over at Heathrow Airport, members of Border Force have set up a picket line as a four-day strike in a dispute over working conditions. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union said more than 300 of its members will take part in the industrial action, which started at 5am today and will continue until 7am on Friday. The union said the workers, based at Heathrow\u2019s Terminals 2, 3, 4 and 5, are protesting at plans to introduce new rosters they claim will see around 250 of them forced out of their jobs at passport control. PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that, despite talks last week, the Home Office is not prepared to grant any flexibility to their new roster. \u201cNone of our dedicated and highly experienced members in the Border Force want to take strike action but the way they\u2019ve been treated by their employer leaves them with no option. \u201cThe Home Office still have time to prevent tomorrow\u2019s strike if they agree to abandon this unworkable new system.\u201d Just in: German inflation rise slightly this month. On an EU-harmonised basis, German consumer price inflation rose to 2.4% this month, up from 2.3% in March. On a non-harmonised basis, though, German inflation was flat at 2.2%, with services inflation slowing to 3.4% but goods inflation rising to 1.2%. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, eased to 3% in April from 3.3% in March. Inflation in Spain has risen, as Madrid\u2019s government cut back support for energy bills. Spanish consumer price inflation rose to 3.3% per year in April, up from 3.2% in March. Inflation was pushed up by gas prices \u2013 which rose this month but fell in April 2023 \u2013 after Spain\u2019s government stopped measures taken to ease rising inflation after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Food prices also rose. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices, fell to 2.9% from 3.3% in March. This data, and Germany\u2019s CPI report due in half an hour, will feed into the latest eurozone inflation data due at 10am tomorrow. Ireland\u2019s return to growth is a sign that tomorrow\u2019s eagerly-awaited eurozone GDP report may bring good news. Economists predict the eurozone returned to modest growth in Q1 2024, after shrinking slightly in the second half of last year (GDP fell by 0.1% in both Q3 and Q4 2023). Ireland\u2019s 1.1% growth, and the 0.3% recorded in Belgium this morning, will help that return to growth. Analysts at Investec said last Friday: Recent revisions now mean that the Eurozone was in a technical recession in H2, albeit by the slimmest of margins. Given that economic data at the start of 2024 has been more positive, we expect the Eurozone exited that recession in Q1, with a 0.1% quarterly expansion in output. Newsflash: Ireland has escaped a technical recession, after its economy returned to growth this year driven by its IT sector. Ireland\u2019s GDP is estimated to have risen by 1.1% quarter-on-quarter in January-March, new data from the Central Statistics Office shows. Growth was driven mainly by an increase in the Information &amp; Communication sector. That follows a 3.4% tumble in GDP in the final three months of 2023. Enda Behan, statistician in the National Accounts Data Collection and Quality Division, said: \u201cIn today\u2019s release, GDP is estimated to have expanded by 1.1% in Q1 2024 in volume terms when compared with Q4 2023. This was driven by an increase in the multinational dominated sector of Information &amp; Communication in Q1 2024. GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.8% when compared with the same quarter of 2023. Ireland\u2019s GDP fell in every quarter of last year, shrinking by 3.4% in Q1, 0.1% in Q2 and 2.5% in Q3. But\u2026.GDP is not a very precise way of measuring the Irish economy, as it is dominated by multinational companies based in the Republic. Ireland\u2019s government favours another measures, called modified domestic demand, which excludes the large transactions of foreign corporations. Unfortunately we did not have new MDD data today. Just in: economic sentiment has fallen marginally in the EU and the euro area, as Europeans fret about their employment prospects. The Economic Sentiment Indicator declined in the EU (by 0.3 points to 96.2) in April, and by more within the eurozone (where it fell by 0.6 points to 95.6). The employment expectations gauge fell slightly more sharply. Confidence among industrial firms, and among services companies, both fell; consumer confidence inched up, but remained in negative territory. Within individual countries, economic sentiment deteriorated significantly in France (-4.8 points) and more moderately in Italy (-1.3 points), while it improved markedly in Spain (+2.3), Germany (+1.5) and Poland (+1.5). The ESI remained broadly stable in the Netherlands (rising by 0.3). Tomorrow we learn whether the eurozone returned to growth, when GDP data for the first quarter of 2024 is released\u2026. Belgium\u2019s economy has continued to grow at a modest pace, new data from its central bank shows. Belgian GDP rose by 0.3% in January-March, the fourth quarter in a row in which a 0.3% expansion was recorded. Both industry and services grew by 0.3%, while the construction sector shrank by 0.2%. Sweden\u2019s economy has shrunk for the fourth quarter in a row, leaving it in recession. Swedish GDP shrank by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2024, Statistics Sweden reported this morning. Mattias Kain Wyatt, economist at Statistics Sweden, says: \u201cSwedish economic activity continued to weaken in the first quarter of 2024 with contractions in the months of February and March. This is the fourth consecutive quarter with negative growth.\u201d Marc Ostwald, chief economist &amp; global strategist at ADM Investor Service, says the data is much weaker than expected. Sweden\u2019s economy is in a poor run; GDP contracted by 0.8% in April-June 2023, then by 0.3% in July-September 2023, followed by a 0.1% contraction in October-December. New inflation data today has shown that prices rose in four German states this month. In Bavaria, the annual inflation rate rose in April to 2.5% from 2.3% in March, in Brandenburg it rose to 3.0% from 2.8%, in Saxony it rose to 2.7% from 2.5%, and in Hesse it rose to 1.9% from 1.6%. Inflation didn\u2019t rise everwhere, though; it was flat at 2.3% in North Rhine-Westphalia, and fell to 2.1% from 2.3% in Baden-Wuerttemberg. This tees up Germany\u2019s inflation report, due at 1pm today, which is expected to show a rise to 2.3% from 2.2% in March. Shares in Dutch medical device maker Philips have surged by a third this morning, after it settled a legal case in the US over its breathing devices, for less than feared. Philips has agreed to pay $1.1bn to settle all personal injury claims filed in the US over its sleep apnea machines. The devices were recalled in 2021, over concerns that they used foam which could degrade and become toxic, carrying potential cancer risks. Lawsuits (see here) have claimed that people who used these devices had developed cancer, lung problems or other injuries due to degraded foam. Uncertainty over the case had slashed Philips\u2019 market value in the past three years, with forecasts that it could cost around $4bn in a worst-case scenario. CEO Roy Jakobs told reporters today: \u201c$1.1 billion is a significant amount, however you put it. This is important to end uncertainty and to provide clarity on our way forward.\u201d The London stock market has begun the new week on the front foot, jumping to a new alltime high. The FTSE 100 share index jumped by 45 points, or over 0.5%, to a new intraday high of 8185 points. Prudential are among the top riser, up 3%, after fellow Asia-Pacific insurer AIA Group reported strong results. UK retailers Frasers are up 3.1% after announcing a new share buyback programme this morning, while Anglo American are also among the risers on speculation that BHP may make a higher bid. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u2018\u2019Sentiment is upbeat at the start of the week, fuelled by relief that inflationary pressures in the US aren\u2019t as bad as feared, and hopes return that a ceasefire could be negotiated in the Middle East. The FTSE 100 has scaled fresh heights, with another sprint higher in early trade. April has been a record-breaking month for the blue-chip index, with a glass-half full sentiment dominating. The Footsie has gained more than 11% over the last six months, with super-patient investors finally rewarded by this spurt of growth. The weaker pound against the dollar has been a key player in the power surge, with the greenback gaining ground against a basket of currencies on the latest interest rate expectations. Investor optimism has been buoyed by a rally on US markets on Friday, and developments in the Middle East. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas expected to meet in Egypt, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ups diplomatic efforts at the World Economic Forum in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. There\u2019s drama in the foreign exchange market today, with Japan\u2019s yen fluctuating wildly. The yen hit a new 34-year low, trading at 160 yen to the dollar for the first time since 1990. But it then rebounded, back to 155 yen/$, stronger than Friday night\u2019s 157 yen/$. The strength of this recovery has sparked speculation that Toyko may have intervened to support the yen. The yen weakened last Friday after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold, and didn\u2019t provide any sign that it might lift borrowing costs to support the yen. Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, points out that the BoJ is also committed to capping the yield (or interest rate) on government bonds; that makes it harder to take action to support the yen: In the City, shares in miner Anglo American have jumped 2.5% at the start of trading, as traders anticipate further takeover drama. Last Friday, Anglo rejected a \u00a331.1bn approach from larger rival BHP Group, saying it significantly undervalued the miner and its prospects. Since then, a source has told Reuters that BHP is considering making an improved bid, which could be made in the coming weeks. Anglo\u2019s shares have risen to \u00a327 this morning, for the first time in just over a year, further above BHP\u2019s initial offer of \u00a325.08 per share. Elon Musk appears to be flying back from China after a busy, if unexpected, trip to Beijing on Sunday. A plane linked to Musk has taken off from Beijing, Reuters reported at 6.22am UK time today. During his trip, Musk held talks with the country\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, and posted: Honored to meet with Premier Li Qiang. \u201cWe have known each other now for many years, since early Shanghai days. Over the weekend, Tesla reached a deal with Chinese search giant Baidu for its mapping and navigation functions, which could help the electric car company gain approval for its driver-assistance technology in China. In another breakthrough, local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on Tesla cars after the company\u2019s China-made vehicles passed the country\u2019s data security requirements. Previously, Teslas had been banned from some government-related properties due to concerns about what data was being collected. Tesla\u2019s vehicles were not the only ones that passed the data security rules, CNBC points out, adding: In addition to Tesla\u2019s Model 3 and Model Y, several new energy vehicles from BYD, Lotus, Nezha, Li Auto and Nio passed China\u2019s data security requirements, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers and the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China said Sunday. Prices for smaller homes such as flats have been increasing at a faster rate than bigger properties amid affordability constraints, according to lender Halifax this morning. Halifax reports that the \u201crace for space\u201d that was seen during the coronavirus pandemic has now gone into reverse, with buyers targeting smaller, cheaper homes. In the year to February, the average price of a flat increased by 2.7%, while the average terraced property value rose by 2.6%, Halifax said. Prices for semi-detached and detached homes increased at lower rates, rising by 1.7% and 2.0% respectively. Amanda Bryden, head of Halifax Mortgages, said: \u201cAs interest rates have stabilised and buyers adjust to the new economic reality of owning a home, one way to compensate for higher borrowing costs is to target smaller properties. \u201cThis is especially true among first-time buyers, who have proven to be resilient over recent years, and now account for the largest proportion of homes purchased with a mortgage in almost 30 years. \u201cWe see this reflected in property prices for the first few months of this year, with the value of flats rising most sharply, closing the \u2018growth gap\u2019 on bigger properties that\u2019s existed for most of the last four years.\u201d Zoopla\u2019s calculations showing a rise in mortgage costs come at a time when several mortgage lenders are increasing rates, blaming \u201cmarket uncertainty\u201d. The City currently expect just two interest rate cuts this year, less than they expected at the start of 2024, with the first cut fully priced in for September. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agents Knight Frank, says \u201cHousing market activity has rebounded over the last year but the shock of the mini-Budget was still reverberating during the early months of 2023. The pipeline of sales has grown since Christmas, largely as positivity from January translates into spring listings. Since then, the prospect of the first rate cut since March 2020 has become more remote with each release of economic data, which means mortgage rates have edged back up and house prices are once again under downwards pressure.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. A year and a half on from the mini-budget turmoil, UK households are still paying sharply more when they take out a mortgage. New research from property website Zoopla this morning shows that higher mortgage rates are adding to the affordability pressures on buyers, and dragging on house price inflation. Zoopla has calculated that the average home buyer taking out a 70% loan to value mortgage now face annual mortgage repayments that are 61% higher today than three years ago (in March 2021) before mortgage rates started to rise. That\u2019s because mortgage rates are around 4.5% today compared to below 2% in March 2021, meaning average annual mortgage repayments have risen from \u00a37,100 to \u00a311,400. However, only two-thirds of this increase is driven by higher mortgage rates, with a third down to the fact that house prices are 13% higher than 3 years ago, Zoopla adds. Londoners (where property prices are highest), face the largest increase, of \u00a37,500 per year. Buyers in the South West, South East and East of England face paying at least \u00a35,000 per year more. Across other regions and countries of the UK, the increase is lower, at between \u00a32,350 and \u00a33,900 a year. Mortgage rates had been rising in 2022 as the Bank of England lifted interest rates, and the City anticipated further tightening. But costs then jumped after the unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget of September 2022 alarmed investors, prompting a selloff in government bonds used to price fixed mortgages. Liz Truss, though, last week declined to apologise for the sharp rise in interest rates during her time in office, pointing out that mortgage rates have gone up across the world. But, UK government bond yields (which rise when prices fall) certainly did spike through September 2022: Zoopla\u2019s data also shows that house sales volumes are up 12% year on year, in the four weeks to 21 April, putting the market on track for 1.1m sales in 2024, up 10% on last year But prices dipped by 0.2% month-on-month, while almost two thirds (64%) of all homes are in local markets where prices are lower than a year ago. Factors including higher mortgage rates and stamp duty are behind ongoing price falls across the south of England, Zoopla reckons. Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, says the market is adjusting to higher borrowing costs; he doesn\u2019t believe prices will start to rise as buyers face much higher mortgage repayments than in the recent past, so sellers should remain realistic. \u201cThe rebound in sales being agreed continues for a fourth month as mortgage rates have fallen, consumer confidence improves and home buyers have much greater choice of homes for sale. The pipeline of sales is growing and we expect 100,000 more people to move home in 2024 than last year. Also coming up today Ocado faces a showdown with shareholders at its annual meeting today, over a new pay scheme that could hand boss Tim Steiner a bonus share award of up to \u00a315m. While in Whitehall, senior officials are worried that Thames Water\u2019s financial collapse could trigger a rise in government borrowing costs not seen since the chaos of the mini-budget. Officials in the Treasury and the UK\u2019s Debt Management Office fear that, unless the UK\u2019s biggest water company is renationalised as soon as possible, \u201cprolonged uncertainty\u201d about its fate could \u201cdamage confidence in UK plc at a sensitive time\u201d\u2026.

            "content": "The FTSE 100 benefited from anxiety over the Middle East today, as well as relief that the UK economy is growing, reports Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown \u201cThe FTSE has been lifted higher by the fresh breeze in the sails of the UK economy. It\u2019s still on a very slow course of growth but, with slender green shoots appearing, it\u2019s benefiting stocks reliant on the financial health of consumers and companies. With growth not shooting the lights out, and inflationary pressures easing, there is still plenty of optimism around about the prospect of interest rate cuts coming in the summer, which has given the FTSE 100 an extra surge of power. Gold\u2019s safe-haven credentials glimmered even brighter amid concerns about an escalation of conflict in the Middle East, while Brent Crude jumped by more than 2% to hover around $92 a barrel. Investors appeared rattled in early afternoon trade over warnings about an imminent attack by Iran on Israel, but the index gained back ground to edge to a record high at the close. The FTSE 100 has clearly regained its mojo as the defensive nature of the index comes to the fore. A large handful of FTSE 100 listed companies, which breached record levels earlier in the month, have been climbing back close to those highs, including Rolls Royce and BAE Systems. Aerospace stocks have been pushed higher by heightened geo-political tensions and post-pandemic demand. With violence having widened in the Middle East, and Ukraine appealing for more weapons to repel Russia, there is an expectation that military budgets will keep expanding. This has been reinforced by defence chiefs in Nordic countries, and the UK, calling for better military preparedness over the next decade.\u201d With hopes of a record FTSE 100 high dashed until at least Monday, it\u2019s time to wrap up. Here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories: Have a lovely weekend; we\u2019ll be back next week. GW The UK\u2019s blue-chip share index has failed to end the day at a new record closing high. The FTSE 100 index has closed for the night at 7995 points, up 71 points or 0.9%. That\u2019s its highest closing high since February 2023, when the index hit its record high of 8,047 points (which we NEARLY hit around lunchtime). Spirits in the City were lifted by the news that the economy continued to grow in February, with GDP up 0.1%. This has cemented hopes that the UK will officially exit recession by growing over the first quarter of 2024, with economic institute NIESR today predicting the recession was in the \u2018rearview miror\u2019. Jason Hollands, managing director of online investment platform Bestinvest, says improving optimism about the domestic economy helped lift stocks. \u201cToday\u2019s confirmation that UK GDP expanded by 0.1% in February, following on from growth of 0.3% in January, will be seen by many as the key reason for the latest market moves as the data signals that the technical recession that the UK entered at the end of last year is almost certainly over. But other, less cheery, factors are also lifting the FTSE 100, Hollands adds: Heightened tensions in the Middle East with the risk of a regional war between Iran and Israel breaking out imminently, have propelled both oil and precious metal prices higher. Among the best performers in the FTSE 100 today are mining and energy stocks. As at midday, Fresnillo \u2013 the world\u2019s second largest gold miner and largest silver producer \u2013 was the best performing FTSE 100 constituent \u2013 rising c5%, followed by major copper producer Antofagasta and Anglo American, the world\u2019s largest platinum producer. Energy is a major sector on the UK market, representing 12.8% of the FTSE 100, and both BP and Shell are on the rise against a backdrop of Brent Crude oil prices exceeding $90 a barrel. Shares in BP gained 3.6% today, after Reuters reported that Abu Dhabi\u2019s state-owned oil company had considered making a bid. Housebuilders were also among the top risers, after JP Morgan lifted its rating on several construction firms. Credit ratings agency Fitch has downgraded Thames Water\u2019s parent company, Kemble, into \u2018restricrive default\u2019, a week after it missed an interest payment. Fitch has announced that it has downgraded Kemble Water Finance Limited\u2019s (the holding company of Thames Water Utilities Limited)) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to \u2018Restricted Default\u2019 (RD) from \u2018C\u2019. Earlier this week Fitch lowered Kemble to C, which is one notch above default, while it waited to see if it made the missed interest payment on \u00a3149.8m. Fitch adds that the rating could yet be lowered further, to D, in the absence of an agreement with lenders and bondholders, leading to bankruptcy filings or other procedures. Oil has hit its highest level since last October tonight, amid fears of further Middle East tensions. Brent crude has hit $92 per barrel for the first time since last October, as Israel braces for the possibility of an attack by Iran, John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, has told reporters that the prospect of an Iranian attack on Israel is \u201cstill a viable threat\u201d.. Unless stocks manage a late rally in London, we won\u2019t get any record highs today after all. The FTSE 100 is still having a strong day, but has slipped back to 7993 points, up 70 points today (+0.9%). That wouldn\u2019t be enough for a closing high. The chair of parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee, Dame Harriett Baldwin, has welcomed Ben Bernanke\u2019s review into the Bank of England: Baldwin adds: We asked the Chair of Court in June last year to commission a review of what had gone wrong with the Bank\u2019s inflation forecasting. We look forward to scrutinising Dr Bernanke\u2019s review when he gives evidence to our Committee in May.\u201d Over in the US, consumer confidence has weakened as people remain anxious about inflation. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index has dropped this month, to 77.9, down from 79.4 in March. Those surveyed grew more pessimistic about current economic conditions, and a little less optimistic about economic expectations. Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu says: Sentiment moved sideways for the fourth straight month, as consumers perceived few meaningful developments in the economy. Since January, sentiment has remained remarkably steady within a very narrow 2.5 index point range, well under the 5 points necessary for a statistically significant difference in readings. Consumers perceived little change in the state of the economy since the start of the new year. Expectations over personal finances, business conditions, and labor markets have all been stable over the last four months. However, a slight uptick in inflation expectations in April reflects some frustration that the inflation slowdown may have stalled. Overall, consumers are reserving judgment about the economy in light of the upcoming election, which, in the view of many consumers, could have a substantial impact on the trajectory of the economy. Next\u2019s CEO, Lord Simon Wolfson, has been rewarded for the retailer\u2019s good 2023 with a bumper pay rise. Wolfson\u2019s total pay rose to \u00a34.5m for the 2023-24 financial year, up from \u00a32.5m the year before, Next\u2019s annual report shows. It looks to be his best year\u2019s pay since 2016. That included a salary of \u00a3908,000 (up from \u00a3865,000), an annual bonus of \u00a31.3m (up from \u00a3700,000), and long-term incentive plan payouts of \u00a32.07m, up from \u00a3704,000). Chairman Michael Roney says the last financial year was a very good year for Next, which \u201cmaterially outperformed\u201d expectations. Pre-tax profits rose 5% to \u00a3918m. Wall Street has opened in the red. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 229 points, or 0.6%, in early trading to 38,229 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down 0.6%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is 0.8% lower. The repricing of interest rate cut expectations continues to weigh on shares. But so do some mixed results from US banks; JP Morgan shares are down 3.6%. Over in Germany, inflation has sunk to its lowest level in almost three years. The annual inflation rate in Germany dipped to 2.2% in March 2024, statistics body Destatis reported this morning. That\u2019s down from 2.5% in February 2024, and 2.9% in January 2024, and the lowest reading since May 2021. Having approached the brink of a new alltime high this afternoon, the FTSE 100 has turned tail and headed south. The blue-chip index has now dropped back to 7,999 points, having earlier hit 8,044 \u2013 just three points off the record. Miners and oil companies are rallying, as are UK housebuilders after a positive research note from JP Morgan. But\u2026 the higher oil price is hurting the travel sector, with airlines easyJet (-4.9%) and IAG (-3.1%) leading the FTSE 100 fallers. In the tech world, Apple has lost a bid to throw out UK lawsuit over fees for its App Store A judge ruled today that Apple must face allegations it charged more than 1,500 UK-based developers unfair commission fees on purchases of apps and other content. Sean Ennis, a competition law professor and economist, is spearheading the case, which was filed at London\u2019s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) last year and alleges Apple charged developers unfair commissions of up to 30%. Ben Bernanke\u2019s report into the Bank of England\u2019s forecasting is measured but still quietly devastating, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: The Bank of England has got markedly worse at forecasting the economy in recent years. Its economic model is faulty. Its systems are out of date. It has been reluctant to admit past mistakes. Communication with the public could be better. If Threadneedle Street thought it was going to get an easy ride when it called in the former head of the US central bank, Ben Bernanke, to conduct a review of how decisions on interest rates have been made in recent years, it was mistaken. More here: JP Morgan Chase, the largest US bank, has reported better than expected first quarter earnings bolstered by the higher interest rate environment and its acquisition of First Republic, a smaller regional lender, last year. The US bank reported first quarter revenues of $42.55bn, beating analysts expectations of $41.85bn, and earnings per share of $4.44 against forecasts of $4.11 helped by lower provisions for credit losses. First quarter net profit rose 6 % to $13.42bn against $12.62bn in the same period of 2023. Analysts have said that JP Morgan\u2019s strong net interest income figures - broadly the difference between what it pays on deposits and what it earns on loans -were not likely to be sustainable in a lower interest environment as US Federal Reserve starts cutting rates later this year. This week it emerged that US inflation rose by more than expected in March which could force the US Federal Reserve to delay cutting interest rates and the market has priced in fewer cuts to rates than had previously been expected. Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, said earlier this week in his annual letter to shareholders that JP Morgan was ready for a \u201cvery broad range\u201d of interest rates from 2% to 8%. Dimon said on Friday that there seems to be \u201ca large number of persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue.\u201d although \u201cmany economic indicators continue to be favorable.\u201c He added: \u201cHowever, looking ahead, we remain alert to a number of significant uncertain forces. First, the global landscape is unsettling \u2013 terrible wars and violence continue to cause suffering, and geopolitical tensions are growing.\u201d Back in the City, the FTSE 100 index is getting pretty close to a new alltime high. The share index is now up 116 points, or 1.5%, at 8040 points \u2013 only a handful away from the record peak of 8,047 set over a year ago\u2026. Ben Bernanke has resisted recommending that the Bank of England adopt the so-called \u201cdot plot\u201d which he introduced at the Federal Reserve when he ran the US central bank. The dot plot outlines where each policymaker thinks interest rates will be over time, to communicate their thinking to the markets. There was speculation that Bernanke could propose they were brought in by the BoE, as part of today\u2019s review of the Bank\u2019s processes. But in the event, he decided that such a change would be \u201chighly consequential\u201d, so this issue should be left to \u201cfuture deliberations\u201d Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, thinks this is \u201ca real shame\u201d. Dales explains: Projecting interest rates would be the clearest way for the Bank to communicate what it thinks is required to hit the 2% inflation target. Ben Bernanke\u2019s review makes 12 recommendations to improve the Bank of England\u2019s forecasting and related processes. Some of them focus on software, including either improving or replacing the BoE\u2019s baseline economic model, known as COMPASS. Others look at ways to improving the bank\u2019s forecasts, and the way they are presented in the monetary policy report (MPR). Here\u2019s the list: The ongoing updating and modernisation of software to manage and manipulate data should be continued with high priority and as rapidly as feasible. Model maintenance and development should be an ongoing priority, supported by a significant increase in dedicated staff time and adequate resources, including specialised software as needed. Over the longer term, the Bank should undertake a thorough review and updating of its forecasting framework, including replacing or, at a minimum, thoroughly revamping COMPASS. Revamp the Bank\u2019s forecasting framework, including a rich representation of the monetary transmission mechanism, empirically based modelling of inflation expectations, models of wage-price determination that allow gradual adjustment and causation from prices to wages as well as from wages to prices, detailed models of key components of the UK economy, and a greater focus on the supply side of the economy. Encourage Bank staff to highlight significant forecast errors and their sources The Bank should review its personnel policies to determine if existing staff could be deployed in ways that improve the forecasting infrastructure and forecast quality. The monetary policy committee\u2019s central forecast should be regularly augmented by alternative scenarios, with the specific scenarios ideally decided upon at an early stage of each forecast round by the MPC and staff. Publish selected alternative scenarios in the MPR, along with the central forecast, to help the public better understand the reasons for the policy choice, including risk management considerations. The MPC should de-emphasise the central forecast based on the market rate path in its communications and be exceptionally clear in warning about situations in which it judges the standard conditioning assumptions to be inconsistent with its view of the outlook. The MPC should also replace or cut back the detailed quantitative discussion of economic conditions in the Monetary Policy Summary in favour of a shorter and more qualitative description, following the practice of most peer central banks. The fan charts published in the MPR should be eliminated Extra resources should be dedicated to implement the changes being recommended Newsflash: An eagerly awaited review of the Bank of England\u2019s forecasting methods, conducted by former top US central banker Ben Bernanke, is out\u2026 and it urges the UK central bank to fix its forecasts and technology. The Bernanke review has been billed as an opportunity for a \u2018once in a generation\u2019 overhaul of the BoE\u2019s forecasting. And it has found that the Bank has used out-of-date methods and failed to communicate clearly with the public. This undermined the BoE\u2019s record of forecasting inflation and the path of interest rates, according to the review. My colleague Phillip Inman reports: In a bruising assessment, the former US Federal Reserve boss Ben Bernanke said the Bank spent much of its time attempting to justify its poor judgment rather than admit its failures and change course. Accusing the Bank of appearing to \u201cat times suffer from excessive incrementalism\u201d, he said policymakers had raised rates too slowly over the past two years when it was clear inflation was already rising beyond normal levels. After an eight-month review, Bernanke says rather damningly that \u201cthe accuracy of the BoE\u2019s forecasts has deteriorated significantly in the past few years\u201d. But he also points out that other central banks have had similar problems. He also advises the BoE should scrap its fan charts, which it uses to show the likelyhood of a range of outcomes, in favour of a more qualitative assessment of risks \u2013 using alternative scenarios to show how the bank might act if economic conditions play out unexpectedly. Bernanke\u2019s review also found that \u201cthe most serious problems\u201d were the deficiencies of the Bank\u2019s forecasting infrastructure. These are the tools the staff uses to produce the quarterly forecast and supporting analyses. \u201cSome key software is out of date and lacks important functionality,\u201d the review says. The UK recession is now in the \u201crearview mirror\u201d, says forecasters at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, who predict GDP will grow by 0.4% in the first quarter of this year. This return to growth would mean that the recession, which began in the second half of last year, would be over. Following this morning\u2019s news that the economy grew by 0.1% in February, and by 0.3% in January, NEISR sees growth continuing. It says: We forecast GDP to grow by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2024. Our early forecast for the second quarter of this year sees GDP growing by 0.3 per cent. While exiting from the shallow recession in the second half of 2023 is welcoming, these forecasts remain broadly consistent with the longer-term trend of low, but stable economic growth in the United Kingdom. The rally on the London stock market today is partly driven by miners, as commodity prices strengthen. In London, the zinc price gained 3% this morning, with copper up 2%, while aluminium hit a two-year high in Shanghai. This has helped lift shares in mining giant Anglo American (+4%), with Chilean copper producer Angofagasta up 4.5%, and Glencore 3.7% higher. The pound has weakened to its lowest level against the US dollar so far this year. Sterling has lost over half a cent this morning, sending it down to $1.249 against the dollar this morning. That\u2019s the lowest since late November last year. It appears to be mainly due to dollar strength, with the US currency benefitting from forecasts that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates more slowly than expected. The euro is also down against the dollar, after the European Central Bank signalled yesterday it could start cutting interest rates in June. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says: The UK economy grew tepidly in February, with GDP expanding by 0.1%. Sterling remains under the cosh. The euro sank to its weakest since mid-November on anticipation of policy divergence. Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), points out that smaller UK businesses, especially in the retail and hospitality sector, are still struggling, even though the economy has been growing this year: \u201cPositive economic growth in February is certainly welcome, building on January\u2019s momentum and giving a measure of optimism to small firms, who have been battling against strong headwinds for some time now. There are signs of cautious recovery among the small business community \u2013 but it is important to emphasise that this is not evenly distributed between sectors. It will take more than flashes of growth to raise spirits in the hospitality and retail sectors, for example, whose confidence scores were way below the headline figure for all businesses at the end of last year, according to our Small Business Index. Today\u2019s ONS data shows that these sectors continue to struggle. The outlook for the UK economy is \u201cundoubtedly improving\u201d, argues ING\u2019s developed markets economist James Smith: \u201cThe UK\u2019s monthly GDP numbers have been on a wild ride over the past few months. But fresh data shows that the economy grew by 0.1% in February as widely expected. And that followed a decent rebound in activity in January after December was dragged down by a strangely weak Christmas trading period for retailers. Assuming we get another slight pick up in activity during March, we think the UK economy is poised to grow by 0.3% for the first quarter as a whole. That would mark the end of a very modest technical recession, albeit one where the aggregate figures masked steeper falls in per capita output. Share prices in London are rallying (see previous post) on relief that the UK economy continued to grow in February, reports Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. With the FTSE 100 index rising through the 8,000 point mark this morning, he says: \u201cThe second monthly GDP increase in a row for the UK has triggered a ticker tape parade from investors as they become more hopeful the country will come out of recession. \u201cBoth the FTSE 100 and the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 index jumped 0.8% at the market open, indicating investors are happy that the economy is moving forward, albeit at a snail\u2019s pace. Some growth is better than no growth at all. \u201cHousebuilders and supermarkets were in demand as investors took the view that a stronger economy will give a boost to consumer confidence and provide a better backdrop for spending. \u201cMiners also helped to give the FTSE 100 a lift as copper prices continued to climb thanks to the twin engines of supply fears and brighter demand prospects. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 share index has climbed back to 8,000 points, less than 50 points from its alltime high. The blue-chip index has now gained 78 points, or almost 1%, today, to trade at 8,004 points. That puts it nearer its alltime peack of 8,047 points. Markets are recovering after a choppy week, as investors weigh up Wednesday\u2019s high-than-expected US inflation reading which has undermined hopes of early interest rate cuts in America. Precious metals producer Fresnillo is the top riser, up 5%, after the gold price hit a new record high today. UK housbuilders Taylor Wimpey (+4.4%) and Persimmon (+3.5%) are close behind. And BP is still in the top risers (+2.5%), following last night\u2019s reports that the UAE\u2019s state oil company has explored a multibillion pound takeover. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has responded to today\u2019s GDP data, saying: \u201cAfter 14 years of Conservative economic failure, Britain is worse off with low growth and high taxes. The Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken. Hailey Low, associate economist at NIESR, agrees that the UK economy seems to be at a turning point\u2026. but also points out that it has effectively flatlined since 2022: Monthly GDP grew by 0.1% in February 2024, with contributions from all major sectors except construction following a revised 0.3% growth in January. In the three months to February, GDP growth was 0.2%, higher than what we forecasted last month. On the back of exiting a shallow recession in 2023, this seems to be a turning point, but in a broader perspective, the UK economy has flatlined since 2022. Increasing productivity will be a constant challenge that requires structural changes and long-term spending commitments to public investment and infrastructure.\u201d Shares have opened higher in London, as City traders digest the news that Britain is escaping recession. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has gained almost 0.9% or 68 points, to trade at 7992 points. Nearly every share on the Footsie is up, helping to move it closer to its alltime high of 8,047 points, hit in February 2023. BP is among the top risers, up 2.6%, after Reuters reported last night that the United Arab Emirates\u2019 state-owned oil company had considered launching a takeover bid for the UK oil giant! Those deliberations \u201cdid not progress beyond preliminary discussions\u201d, though. Although the economy expanded a little in February, it was actually smaller than a year ago! The ONS estimates that GDP fell 0.2% in February compared with the same month last year. Over the longer term, GDP is estimated to have fallen by 0.1% in the three months to February 2024 compared with the three months to February 2023. These chart shows the broader picture \u2013 UK growth has been lacklustre for months. The Institute of Directors don\u2019t share Jeremy Hunt\u2019s cheery take on today\u2019s GDP report. Dr. Roger Barker, Director of Policy at the Institute of Directors, points out that the economy barely grew in February, by expanding just 0.1%. This suggests that the economy is still in a fragile state, Barker warns, adding: After a strong start to the year, the consumer-facing parts of the economy \u2013 particularly accommodation and food services \u2013 took a backward step. Construction was also surprisingly weak, although there were encouraging signs of revival in production and manufacturing output. \u201cIt appears that the UK\u2019s ascent out of the mild technical recession of last year is a relatively shallow one. Although the latest figures suggest that the UK is likely to generate positive economic growth in the first quarter, there are few signs of a strong economic rebound. The assertion that the UK economy has decisively turned the corner, as recently asserted by the Prime Minister, is still yet to find confirmation in the data. City experts sound confident that the UK economy will pull itself out of recession. Today\u2019s news that the economy grew by 0.1% in February and 0.3% in January bolsters hopes that GDP did not shrink in the January-March quarter. If that happens, it would end the techncial recession that gripped the country in the second half of 2023, when GDP shrank in Q3 and Q4 2023. Having said that, though, growth 0f 0.1% in February isn\u2019t exactly rollicking. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, says: \u201cThe UK has continued its positive start to the year as GDP grew again in February, albeit only marginally, and looks on course to be pulled out of the short and shallow recession it entered at the end of last year. \u201cUK GDP is estimated to have risen 0.1% in February, a slight dip compared to January\u2019s 0.3% growth which was revised up from 0.2%, but still positive nonetheless. This uptick was driven primarily by improvements in the UK\u2019s services and production sectors. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, says: \u201cThe UK economy grew, albeit very modestly, in February, suggesting that any sort of meaningful recession will be avoided. With inflation tracking back, the Bank of England might be persuaded to start cutting rates sooner rather than later and after the CPI data out of the US and the ECB meeting over the last week, we could well see the Fed being the last of the three to take any action on rates. That would quite a shift over a period of a few months.\u201d \u201cThe sun is finally out but the UK economy outlook remains foggy\u201d says Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. \u201cDespite weaker momentum in February, the economy\u2019s ongoing recovery is the latest piece of evidence that the shallow technical recession is already behind us. Growth was helped by the January cut in National Insurance, a further boost to purchasing power from falling inflation, and an easing in cost pressures for businesses. Combined with more timely survey data, we expect GDP to grow at around 0.3% over Q1. \u201cNonetheless, there are limits to the UK\u2019s growth potential this year. Consumer spending remains fragile. Business investment could be dented by uncertainty related to the general election and growing speculation around a second fiscal event in the Autumn, while weakness in the housing market could further drag on construction by lowering the return on new housebuilding. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has welcomed the news that the UK economy grew by 0.1% in February, saying: \u201cThese figures are a welcome sign that the economy is turning a corner, and we can build on this progress if we stick to our plan. \u201cLast week our cuts to National Insurance for 29 million working people came into effect across Britain, as part of our plan to reward work and grow the economy.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy has taken a step closer to exiting recession after official figures showed growth continued in February despite a washout month for retailers after one of the wettest starts to a year on record. Here\u2019s the full story: The UK economy is putting further distance from last year\u2019s recession, says Jeremy Batstone-Carr, European strategist at Raymond James Investment Services \u201cData released this morning by the ONS shows that UK GDP expanded by 0.1% in February. This signals a further move away from the shallow economic contraction experienced over the second half of 2023. \u201cMore evidence supports this revival. Service sector output delivered a second consecutive month of expansion, which, paired with upbeat retail sales and forward-looking business surveys, point to strengthened activity in March. Industrial output remains below pre-pandemic levels, and gas and electricity output were subdued by mild weather. But a broad revival is nonetheless underway, as part of an improving global outlook. \u201cToday\u2019s data indicates that the UK\u2019s economic trajectory is on a shallow but steady upward course. The measures introduced in the March Budget will further enhance prospects in the short term. However, decelerating inflation paves the way for the Bank of England to commence its rate cutting process in the coming months, a decision which should also prove supportive to the growth outlook.\u201d Britain\u2019s industrial sector was the largest contributor to growth in February. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that production output grew by 1.1% in February, more than reversing a 0.3% drop in January. Manufacturing output rose by 1.2%, driven by a surge in manufacturing of transport equipment such as cars. The services sector had a calmer month \u2013 it grew by 0.1% in February, slower than the 0.3% growth in January. And it was a month to forget for builders, with construction output falling by 1.9% in February. The ONS cites \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that heavy rainfall delayed planned work and decreasing output in February. Here\u2019s ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown on the news that the UK economy grew by 0.1% in February: \u201cThe economy grew slightly in February with widespread growth across manufacturing, particularly in the car sector. Services also grew a little with public transport and haulage, and telecommunications having strong months. \u201cPartially offsetting this there were notable falls across construction as the wet weather hampered many building projects. \u201cLooking across the last three months as a whole, the economy grew for the first time since last summer.\u201d Newsflash: the UK continued to grow in February, boosting hopes that the economy is escaping recession. GDP expanded by 0.1% in February, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows, lifted by growth in the production and services sectors. And the ONS has lifted its forecast for January, to show 0.3% growth, up from 0.2% previously estimated. This suggests the economy may manage to grow in the first quarter of 2024. And that would mean the short, shallow recession that began at the end of 2023 will officially end. Even if the economy is growing again, households are still struggling. Half of consumers have cut back on their non-essential spending so far this year, with eating out the most likely thing to be cut from budgets, a survey this morning shows. Just 3% of consumers say that they have been able to spend more on non-essentials in the first quarter, with 52% cutting back, according to the KPMG Consumer Pulse survey. Eating out was the most common discretionary spending cut, listed by 72% of those who are scaling back, followed by clothing purchases (62%) and takeaways (58%). Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief UK economist, predicts wet weather and lower energy production will mean UK growth slower in February, to 0.1%. But he also believes the economy is at a \u2018turning point\u2019 after last year\u2019s shallow recession. Raja explains: After matching our estimates in January, we expect GDP growth to slow to 0.1% m-o-m in February 2024 (Jan-24: 0.2% m-o-m). What\u2019s driving the slowdown? Wetter weather and lower oil/energy production will, we think, keep GDP from budging very much. Overall, we see services activity and industrial production up 0.1% m-o-m, respectively, with construction output flat on the month. Looking ahead, we think the UK economy is at a turning point following on from its short and shallow recession last year. We see GDP picking up by 0.2% q-o-q in Q1-24, and pushing to 0.3% - 0.4% q-o-q for the remainder of the year. For 2024 as a whole, we see GDP up 0.5%, rising by 1.5% next year. Good morning. We\u2019re about to learn whether the UK is climbing out of the recession into which it slipped at the end of last year. At 7am, the Office for National Statistics will release its first estimate for UK GDP in February, and the City are hoping to see signs of growth. Economists predict that GDP rose by 0.1% in February; a weak expansion, following 0.2% growth in January. That would raise the chances that the economy grew in the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 which would end the recession. Reminder: The UK ended 2023 in a technical recession, after shrinking slightly in both the third and fourth quarters of last year. To escape recession, it needs to not shrink in January-March (and that data is due in a month\u2019s time). Bad weather may have weighed on UK growth this year, though. We already know that retail sales growth slowed during a wet February, when storms kept people at home. Any signs that the downturn is over would be welcomed by the government, with a general election close. But the financial markets are not being very kind to Rishi Sunak this week. The PM\u2019s hopes that the public might see lower taxes and cheaper mortgages soon have weakened, as traders scaled back expectations of interest rate cuts in 2024 yesterday. The City now expects just two quarter-point cuts to UK interest rates in 2024, which would lower rates by half a percentage point to 4.75% by December. Today\u2019s GDP report may not change the outlook for rate cuts, explains Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell: UK GDP figures are expected to be tepid, not too hot or too cold, and unlikely to do much to change thinking at the Bank of England. \u201cWhere just a few months ago markets were betting rates here in the UK could fall below 4% by Christmas now only two cuts are being priced in. The sands are shifting and investors are having to be fleet of foot.\u201d The agenda 7am BST: UK GDP report for February Noon BST: Bank of England to publish review of its forecasting models 1pm BST: India\u2019s inflation rate for March 3pm BST: University of Michigan\u2019s index of US consumer confidence"

For millennia different people and different groupings have wanted the same thing, which is regarded as desirable by each. Obviously they cannot both have it \u2013 unless what they both want is peace. The challenge has been and continues to be, both in Europe and elsewhere in the world, to construct a political order which enables competing sides to live in continuing peace, notwithstanding that they cannot each have all that they wish. For each side to insist that the other is overcome does not lead to lasting peace \u2013 as France and Germany and many other places have shown over centuries. The creation of the European Community after the second world war was a serious attempt to accustom opponents, by regularly working together, to try to find answers to what are often common problems, to realise that the other is also human. This attempt has largely been successful. Certainly much more successful than the quest by France after the first world war to secure what it saw as justice. Having served as a judge in this country and in the European court of justice, I of course think that justice is a laudable aim. But I also became acutely conscious of the limitations of what can be achieved, both in the context of criminal and civil law and in the context of international law, by an exclusive focus on what is seen as justice. Justice cannot be the only desideratum and will not always be the most important and exclusive one. As Eva Ladipo rightly insists, miracles can be, and have been, achieved by understanding the importance of considering all humans as equal \u2013 regardless of racial, ethnic or religious background.

            "content": "1989 27 March The South Yorkshire police chief constable, Peter Wright, replaces Ch Supt Brian Mole, the experienced commander of football matches at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough stadium. Wright promotes David Duckenfield in Mole\u2019s place. 15 April Nineteen days after Duckenfield is appointed, 54,000 people attend the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. In the lethal crush, 97 men, women and children are fatally injured. 1 August Lord Justice Taylor\u2019s official report into the disaster emphatically blames police mismanagement of the event and criticises South Yorkshire police for blaming Liverpool supporters instead of accepting responsibility. Wright states that he fully accepts the findings. 1990 30 August The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decides there is insufficient evidence to justify criminal proceedings against anybody from any organisation for any offence arising out of the deaths. October South Yorkshire police admit they were negligent and failed in their duty of care to the people attending the match, settling civil claims brought by bereaved families and injured people. 19 November First inquest opens in Sheffield, heard by the local coroner Dr Stefan Popper. South Yorkshire police renew their case that drunk supporters who arrived late and ticketless were to blame. 1991 28 March Inquest jury returns a majority verdict of accidental death. 29 October Duckenfield retires on medical grounds, diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. 1992 13 January Disciplinary action against Supt Bernard Murray, the police control box commander at Hillsborough, is dropped. 1993 5 November A judicial review application by six representative families to quash the inquest verdict is rejected by Lord Justice McCowan in the divisional court. McCowan rules that the inquest was properly conducted. Families continue to campaign for justice. 1996 5 December ITV broadcasts a drama documentary written by Jimmy McGovern, researched by the journalist Katy Jones, which powerfully highlights the families\u2019 allegations of injustice and a police cover-up. 1997 30 June The New Labour government orders a \u201cscrutiny\u201d of new evidence by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. It is found that South Yorkshire police changed 164 officers\u2019 accounts of the disaster before sending them to the Taylor inquiry. According to a civil service note that became public in 1997, the then home secretary, Jack Straw, did not believe there was sufficient evidence for a fresh inquiry but said such an assertion had to come from an independent source such as a judge to be \u201cacceptable\u201d. The then prime minister, Tony Blair, had written across the note about setting up a new inquiry: \u201cWhy? What is the point?\u201d 1998 13 February Stuart-Smith rejects any grounds for prosecutions or quashing the inquest verdict. Straw accepts that conclusion. 2009 12 April Twenty years after Hillsborough, the Guardian highlights the families\u2019 grievances and complaints of injustice. The then Labour ministers Andy Burnham and Maria Eagle resolve to call for all documents relating to the disaster to be published. 15 April Burnham\u2019s speech to the 20th anniversary memorial service at Anfield is interrupted with calls from the crowd for \u201cjustice for the 96\u201d. His call for disclosure is supported by Gordon Brown\u2019s government. 2012 12 September The Hillsborough independent panel, which has reviewed 450,000 documents disclosed to it, publishes its report. Its lead author is Prof Phil Scraton, who has worked since 1989 to document the disaster and miscarriage of justice. The police failings are highlighted, and their campaign to blame supporters further exposed. The Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, makes an apology in parliament to the families. The home secretary, Theresa May, accepts the report and orders a new criminal inquiry into the disaster, Operation Resolve. The Independent Police Complaints Commission launches an investigation into alleged malpractice by the police in the case presented afterwards. 19 December The verdict in the first inquest, of accidental death, is quashed by the lord chief justice, Igor Judge, and two other judges, who find that the inquest was not properly conducted. 2014 31 March New inquests begin in Birchwood, Warrington. Together they last more than two years, the longest case ever heard by a jury in British history. 2016 26 April The inquest jury delivers its verdict. It is asked to answer 14 questions, and concludes that the 96 people who died in the disaster were unlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by Duckenfield. The 97th victim, Andrew Devine, died in 2021. \u201cErrors and omissions\u201d by the entire police operation on the day contributed to the causes, the jury finds. Errors and omissions by the South Yorkshire metropolitan ambulance service were also found to have contributed to the disaster. No behaviour on the part of Liverpool supporters contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, as alleged by the police. This, at last, comprehensively exonerates the supporters whom the police had blamed for causing the disaster. Defects in the construction and layout of the stadium contributed to the disaster, the inquest finds, and the stadium\u2019s lack of a valid safety certificate also contributed, as did Sheffield Wednesday FC\u2019s preparation for the match. On the question of whether the club\u2019s actions on the day of the game were a contributory factor, the jury could not say for sure but said they may have been. 2017 29 June After Operation Resolve, the CPS charges Duckenfield, the police officer in command of the match, with manslaughter by gross negligence. The charge relates to 95 of the people who died at Hillsborough. No charge could be brought in relation to the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, due to the passage of time before he died, in 1993. Graham Mackrell, the Sheffield Wednesday club secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster, is charged with two counts of breaching his duties under safety legislation. 1 November Bishop James Jones publishes a report commissioned by the home secretary, May, aimed at learning lessons from the Hillsborough families\u2019 ordeal and preventing future cover-ups and miscarriages of justice after public tragedies. It makes recommendations for widespread reforms in 25 \u201cpoints of learning\u201d including a charter establishing a \u201cduty of candour\u201d for the police and public authorities, to openly and transparently assist with investigations and inquiries after a major incident. 2019 14 January Duckenfield\u2019s trial begins at Preston crown court. The 75-year-old stands trial alongside Mackrell, with both men pleading not guilty to the charges. Opening the prosecution\u2019s case, Richard Matthews QC says: \u201cDuckenfield\u2019s criminal responsibility for the deaths \u2026 flows from his gross failure to discharge his personal responsibility as match commander.\u201d Ben Myers QC, setting out Duckenfield\u2019s defence, said he was being \u201csingled out unfairly\u201d. 3 April The jury fails to return a verdict on Duckenfield\u2019s charge, after deliberating for eight days. Mackrell is found guilty, by a majority of 10-2, of breaching his legal duty to take reasonable care at work for people\u2019s safety, in relation to the allocation of turnstiles for the match. Matthews tells the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, that the CPS will seek a retrial for Duckenfield on the same charge. Mackrell is later fined \u00a36,500 after his conviction. 25 June Just over a month after the 30th anniversary of the disaster, Openshaw rules that Duckenfield will face a retrial, to begin at Preston crown court in October. 7 October Duckenfield\u2019s retrial begins. Proceedings are relayed live to the Cunard building in Liverpool to allow survivors and families of the victims to attend more easily. 28 November Duckenfield is found not guilty of gross negligence manslaughter, after the jury spends three days considering its verdict. Openshaw had earlier told the 10-person jury he would accept a majority verdict, on which at least nine of the 10 jurors agreed. 2021 25 May The trial of two former South Yorkshire police officers and the force\u2019s solicitor at the time of the disaster, on charges of perverting the course of public justice, relating to amending officers\u2019 statements after the disaster, is stopped by the judge and the three men are acquitted. 4 June South Yorkshire and West Midlands police agree a settlement with more than 600 people to compensate them for the false police campaign aimed at avoiding responsibility for the disaster and blaming the victims instead, which bereaved families have always said was a cover-up. The forces will pay compensation to families whose relatives were among the men, women and children unlawfully killed at Hillsborough, and to survivors of the disaster, for trauma and psychiatric damage. 21 July A coroner rules that Andrew Devine, 55, died due to the severe brain damage he suffered in the crush at Hillsborough, and that therefore he is, 32 years later, the 97th person to have been unlawfully killed. 2023 6 December The government responds to Bishop James Jones\u2019s report, with apologies from ministers for having taken six years to do so. It signs and adopts the charter as recommended by Jones, and a duty of candour is to be introduced into police officers\u2019 codes of conduct. However the government rejects the families\u2019 proposals for a \u201cHillsborough law\u201d, that would enforce a duty of candour as a legal responsibility, and provide bereaved families with equal funding to public authorities for legal representation at inquests."

            "content": "With their self-titled 2007 debut, French production duo Justice \u2013 Gaspard Aug\u00e9 and Xavier de Rosnay \u2013 established themselves as promising Daft Punk successors. Combining arena-sized drum tracks with squealing guitars and a thundering dancefloor pulse, they delivered gargantuan melodic hooks with gut-thumping force. Yet subsequent releases have struggled to elicit the same sense of vitality. Audio, Video, Disco, from 2011, veered into the complicated world of prog, while 2016\u2019s Woman attempted a disco-pop crossover; neither was fully convincing. On their latest album, Justice attempt a return to their club-oriented roots. Across 13 tracks, the pair find their strengths in the heavier end of the musical spectrum. Generator shudders through raw synths and techno kick-drums, providing an apt soundtrack for a postapocalyptic dancefloor, while the tonal switches on Incognito are delightfully unpredictable, shifting from disco bass to cavernous melody. On softer moments, though, they\u2019re on less steady ground. One Night/All Night drowns out guest vocalist Kevin Parker\u2019s falsetto with a plodding backing, while Saturnine grates in its interplay of chopped guitar lines and high-pitch vocals. Justice are still capable of raw-edged excitement, but on Hyperdrama they find themselves too polished and bright."

            "date": "2024-04-17T15:00:09Z",
            "content": "In determining that Bruce Lehrmann raped Brittany Higgins, the federal court justice Michael Lee took a giant knot of allegations, with all its loops and loose ends, and meticulously and painstakingly unpicked it. That he did it with such acerbic clarity makes an already unusual judgment only more so. Lee emerges from the legal wreckage of the Higgins-Lehrmann allegations as the only one to dispassionately pull on every thread. Partly this is due to the specific task he was set, neither advocating towards an outcome nor restricted to a particular aspect of what he has dubbed this \u201comnishambles\u201d of a case. But partly it is the process he chose in seeking to fulfil it. To decide if Higgins\u2019 allegations were true \u2013 and whether respondents Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson did enough to check \u2013 the judge had to apply a lesser test than if they were criminal proceedings. He only had to be satisfied \u201con the balance of probabilities\u201d, not find them proven \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d \u2013 the higher bar that criminal prosecutors must clear. But to reach his conclusion, the judge also broke the issues down into component parts and separated out the allegations in a manner that criminal prosecutors in the Australian Capital Territory\u2019s supreme court did not, before Lehrmann\u2019s criminal trial for rape collapsed due to juror misconduct and was discontinued out of concern for Higgins\u2019s mental health. The fact that Lehrmann has had no criminal findings against him on Higgins\u2019s rape allegation yet chose to launch defamation proceedings that risked the kind of civil ruling now delivered is why Lee remarked that \u201chaving escaped the lion\u2019s den, Mr Lehrmann made the mistake of coming back for his hat\u201d. Lee started his task by examining what was originally alleged on Network Ten\u2019s The Project in 2021. He determined from the outset that the program contained not one allegation but two. Those were that then ministerial staffer Brittany Higgins had been raped on a couch in her boss\u2019s office in March 2019, by a colleague not named \u2013 but, he argued, easily identifiable \u2013 as Bruce Lehrmann, and that attempts had been made to cover it up for political reasons. Lee adopted this process because Ten and Wilkinson relied primarily on a truth defence: that Higgins had been raped. Their secondary qualified privilege defence involved arguing that they had acted reasonably in putting Higgins\u2019 allegations to air and that broadcasting them was in the public interest. To determine the truth question, Lee assessed the rape and cover-up allegations separately. He found the first proven, the second not. In separating the two allegations, he also focused on two distinct periods of time. The first covered the original event in March 2019 and its aftermath. The second covered The Project\u2019s broadcast in February 2021 and what flowed from it. Lee then assessed the credibility of witnesses, including Lehrmann and Higgins, Wilkinson and her producers and advisers, and those with whom these key people relevantly engaged during those two periods. He found that both Lehrmann and Higgins were unsatisfactory witnesses. But he said Higgins\u2019 testimony was most unreliable in relation to the second time period and the cover-up allegation. He found her evidence from the first time period and her later evidence surrounding the rape allegation was believable, likewise the corroborating evidence of witnesses who engaged with her at the time. Potentially crucially for future sexual assault cases, Lee found that some of her subsequent recollections were wrong and behaviour contradictory but that the testimony had \u201ca general thread\u201d consistent with the actions and attempted memory corrections of a person traumatised by sexual assault. In contrast, Lee branded Lehrmann a liar, not compulsive but persistent. Other than when Lehrmann was admitting to something, Lee found that most of what he said could not be believed. He examined all of Lehrmann\u2019s contradictory explanations for his actions on the night in question through the lens of ordinary-person behaviour and pronounced them \u201cfanciful\u201d and defying logic. So the judge decided the truth of the rape allegation had been established as per the civil-court test. He found differently on the \u201ccover-up\u201d. He also found that the respondents\u2019 secondary defence of qualified privilege had failed. Lee strongly criticised Higgins\u2019s evidence on the alleged cover-up, along with the actions of Ten, and Wilkinson and her producers, both before The Project broadcast and since. He found The Project team did not do as much as they could and should have to establish if Higgins\u2019s allegations were true, including not trying hard enough to get Lehrmann\u2019s side of the story. Lee also examined Wilkinson\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2022 Logies awards, which mentioned Higgins and caused a delay in Lehrmann\u2019s criminal trial and which Lehrmann argued was highly prejudicial. Lee found the speech was \u201cgrossly improper and unjustifiable\u201d because it implied Higgins\u2019s allegations were true. Lee said Ten had let Wilkinson down with its pre-Logies speech advice but that, as an experienced journalist, she should also have known better. Despite these significant criticisms and the failure of the back-up defence, the success of the first was enough. Given that defamation cases turn on whether an otherwise good reputation has been damaged, finding the applicant was a rapist rendered the respondents\u2019 failings on other matters moot. Lee\u2019s judgment may yet be subject to appeal. But his forensic breakdown of the tangle of original allegations, tweezering the strands apart with law and common sense, delivers valuable insights for future defamation and sexual assault prosecutions and for media practice. It may also serve as a handy guide for judges in how to break down and assess a very complicated and controversial case with a cool eye, painstaking legal dissection and the application of everyday discernment. It\u2019s also a fairly good example of how to communicate in a way that makes people listen and understand. Faced with such a tangled web, that is quite a public service."

            "date": "2024-04-24T02:24:23Z",
            "content": "The Rev Cecil Williams, the longtime head of a church that grew to international fame for being a safe haven for San Francisco\u2019s most marginalized citizens, has died. He was 94 years old. He, alongside his wife and poet Janice Mirikitani, transformed Glide Memorial church into an institution built on love and support for the city\u2019s queer community and those struggling with homelessness and drug addiction. Mirikitani died in 2021 at 80. Williams died on Monday at his home in San Francisco surrounded by friends and family, Glide said in a statement. A cause of death was not given. An advocate for civil rights and social justice, Williams drew the attention of celebrities, politicians and businessmen, including Warren Buffet, who for years helped Williams raise money for the church through an auction for a private lunch with the hedge fund manager. Maya Angelou, Isabel Allende, Bono, Oprah Winfrey and Bill Clinton were among the celebrities who once attended services at Glide. Williams and Mirikitani appeared in Will Smith\u2019s film The Pursuit of Happyness, which was based on the life of a homeless father and son who once found help at Glide. Williams\u2019s focus always remained on helping the poor. \u201cI would have to be with people I understand, and it\u2019s the poor,\u201d Williams told the San Francisco Chronicle in a 2013 interview. \u201cI\u2019m with them wherever they are.\u201d The announcement of Williams\u2019s death was met with a deluge of mournful social media posts from local and national officials including Nancy Pelosi, who described Williams as \u201ca spiritual giant, whose saintly good works have transformed countless lives in the Bay Area and beyond\u201d. San Francisco\u2019s mayor, London Breed, described Williams as a towering and aspirational figure of the Black community. \u201cGrowing up, there were members of the African American community that inspired us to dream, and to serve, and Cecil Williams was at the top of that list,\u201d Breed wrote on X. \u201cCecil mentored generations of San Francisco leaders, many of us emerging from the most difficult circumstances \u2026 We would not be who we are as a city and a people without the legendary Cecil Williams.\u201d Born and raised in the segregated west Texas town of San Angelo, Williams moved to San Francisco in 1963 to become the pastor at what was then called Glide Memorial United Methodist church, a house of worship with a dwindling number of parishioners in the heart of the city\u2019s largely impoverished Tenderloin district. Williams and Mirikitani transformed the church with Sunday services that included a jazz band and a gospel choir. The church eventually amassed 10,000 members, becoming the largest Methodist church in northern California and one of the largest in the nation. They also put the church\u2019s sermons into action and through the Glide Foundation started several community outreach programs that have served thousands of San Franciscans for more than six decades. \u201cHe led re-entry programs for those leaving prison, provided clothing and housing for people in need, and helped thousands of people access healthcare,\u201d Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, said in a statement, adding that Williams was \u201ca dear friend\u201d and \u201da beacon of light and love\u201d. Williams never shied from political and social issues, ranging from gay rights to homelessness to drug addiction. He retired as the church\u2019s pastor in 2000 but remained the minister of liberation and CEO of the Glide Foundation until last year, when he stepped down. \u201cThe essence of Glide begins and ends with love \u2026 It is time for me to evolve, it is time for Glide to continue to evolve. We have gone through so much and come out strong, ready to keep building,\u201d Williams wrote in a letter to parishioners. Associated Press contributed to this report"

            "date": "2024-04-14T23:01:05Z",
            "content": "In a report, the Fawcett Society has drawn a conclusion that young parents are already familiar with: childcare in England is not working. Compared with systems in Ireland, Estonia, France, Canada and Australia \u2013 all countries that have recently carried out or initiated major reforms \u2013 the English system is expensive, underfunded and unambitious. Parents join lengthy waiting lists for nurseries. They have to fork out astronomical sums for basic childcare so they can return to work. Faced with this choice, many young mothers decide to drop out of the workforce to look after their children and avoid paying two-thirds of their salary for someone else to do so. Labour and the Conservatives have cottoned on to the fact that childcare reform promises to boost the economy and the political fortunes of the party that achieves it. That has made childcare a key political battleground at the next election. Since being appointed shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson has made this issue her number one priority. In a landmark speech in March last year, she promised to rip up the system in England, which she said was failing parents. Labour has asked David Bell, a former Ofsted chief and permanent secretary of the Department for Education, to carry out an in-depth review of the early years system. Weeks after Phillipson\u2019s speech, the government stole a march by announcing billions to extend childcare entitlements in its March 2023 budget. Starting this month, working parents of two-year-olds can claim 15 hours a week of free childcare during term time. This will apply to parents of nine-month-olds from September 2024 and increase to 30 hours a week from September 2025. Experts have said this is a sticking-plaster solution, pumping money into a system that is struggling to cope with existing demand. Nurseries say they do not have the capacity to deliver the extra spaces needed. Nonetheless, Labour is in a political bind. The party is awaiting the results of Bell\u2019s review before deciding on childcare plan \u2013 but the Conservatives have already set out their policy. As a result, shadow ministers in broadcast studios are pelted with questions about whether they would keep the entitlements offered to parents by this government. After some resistance, Labour has promised to honour the promised entitlements. Phillipson\u2019s team insists the party is still is committed to root-and-branch reform of the system and will set out its plan after Bell\u2019s review concludes. But in the absence of any detail or even a timeline for the review\u2019s conclusions, experts are concerned that reform will be kicked into the long grass. The fact that overhauling childcare would be expensive and Labour is keen to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal restraint makes it all the more difficult. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, promised last month that a Labour government would aim to borrow only to invest, echoing the fiscal rules of the former Labour chancellor Gordon Brown. She may well prove reluctant to commit Labour to spending any large sum on childcare reform in the run-up to the election. \u201cWomen\u2019s votes are essential to winning the next election, so we\u2019re not surprised to see Labour commit to the entitlements that the government has set out, but alongside this we simply can\u2019t afford for them not to undertake the wider reforms that are so badly needed,\u201d said Alesha De-Freitas, the head of policy for the Fawcett Society. \u201cWe need to hear the party commit to reform as we approach an election.\u201d"

Mark Butcher, who is standing for the party in next week\u2019s election, posted a Facebook message this month which said that the campaign would be starting at the kitchen, Amazing Graze. He was later pictured shaking hands with the Reform leader, Richard Tice, at the premises and appeared there in a Channel 4 News report, in which Reform UK election material could be seen. Charities cannot support a political candidate or party under regulations. The Charity Commission has not opened a statutory inquiry into the charity, which also provides food parcels for people in need. Butcher had previously run as an independent and has a strong local profile on the back of his charity work. A Charity Commission spokesperson said: \u201cWe have an active compliance case into Amazing Graze to assess concerns raised about support for a political candidate, and are engaging with the trustees.\u201d Butcher blamed political opponents for making complaints that triggered the probe \u2013 first reported by the Lead \u2013 and told the Guardian he was sure it would find that no rules were breached. He said: \u201cThe room was rented to Reform, so it\u2019s a non-starter. The room is rented out all the time. If any one else or any other political party wanted to rent it then I\u2019m sure the board would be interested. \u201cThe charity never endorsed me once, and you can see that evidence quite clearly on the Facebook page.\u201d Butcher, a former businessman, said he was \u201c100% sure\u201d that the complaint to the Charity Commission had come from political opponents. The byelection on 2 May has been triggered by the resignation of the former Conservative MP Scott Benton. \u201cThey are worried and concerned about me and so they are coming out with all the dirty tricks. They are frightened of us and it is because we are capturing the attention of our town,\u201d Butcher said."

            "content": "Reform UK\u2019s best hope of making headlines this week is Blackpool South\u2019s byelection, but polling also shows the insurgent rightwing party is ahead of the Conservatives in two mayoral races. While Labour are the frontrunners to regain Blackpool South \u2013 which fell to the Conservatives as the \u201cred wall\u201d crumbled in 2019 \u2013 the battle for second place there could be crucial to Rishi Sunak\u2019s future. However, damage to the Tories could also be inflicted in mayoral contests in Brexit heartlands such as the north east, where polling by More in Common has Reform ahead of the Tories but behind Labour and the mayor of North Tyne, former Labour member Jamie Driscoll. The pollsters also have Reform UK slightly ahead of the Tories in the Greater Manchester mayoral race. Dan Barker, who was selected only months ago as the Tory candidate, defected last month to Reform. More in Common polling from recent days put him at 12% \u2013 distantly behind Labour\u2019s Andy Burnham on 63%, but still ahead of the Conservatives. \u201cThere are two contests where Reform do seem to be doing quite well although it\u2019s less a story of Reform doing very well and more the Conservatives doing badly,\u201d said Jim Blagden, an associate director at More in Common. The party is also involved in council battles in which it is attempting to prepare the ground for the general election with a slate of between 300 and 400 local election candidates. \u201cThe locals will be another good test as to how credible they are compared to their predecessors, Ukip and the Brexit party,\u201d said Blagden. \u201cAt the same time, our focus groups have had limited mentions of Reform. It could because they are a fairly new party and their ground operation is not what it could be. From polling it looks like Reform could beat the Conservatives in some mayoral races, although the former had quite a low salience in focus groups for Manchester.\u201d The relatively small size of Reform\u2019s local elections slate pales in comparison to the bigger campaigns once mounted by Ukip \u2013 which was able to establish a local government footprint and controlled Thanet at one point \u2013 reflecting its current weakness. Many in the party still hope a return by its honorary president, Nigel Farage, to frontline politics would boost both the party\u2019s war chest and the number of volunteers. For now, places to watch in terms of Reform\u2019s local elections campaign include Hartlepool, where the party leader, Richard Tice, is to run again after coming third there in 2019, just over 1,000 votes behind the Tories. Reform is also running a full slate of candidates for elections to the city council in Sunderland \u2013 totemic for its Leave vote in the 2016 referendum \u2013 and Bolton. In the latter it is in alliance with Bolton for Change, a registered political party set up by two former candidates of the Brexit party. One of them, Trevor Jones, told the Guardian: \u201cFor the now the issue is getting quality candidates nationally and there is also only a certain amount of cash. We were ahead of the country in some ways \u2013 it\u2019s a slow process \u2013 so that\u2019s why we have a full slate.\u201d In the general election Bolton for Change would probably back a Reform UK candidate. Lincoln and Plymouth \u2013 both locations that had been targeted by Ukip during its political peak \u2013 are also places where Reform is running close to a full slate of local election candidates."

Ben Habib made the comments in an interview on TalkTV when asked how he proposed to prevent people setting off from France in small boats from reaching the UK. Reform, which is polling 12-13% and has overtaken the Lib Dems, has an official policy to \u201cpick up migrants out of boats and take them back to France\u201d. More than 400 people arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats on Tuesday, on the same day that five people, including a child, died while attempting the crossing. Rishi Sunak said the \u201ctragic\u201d deaths showed why it was necessary to have passed his legislation on Monday night, aimed at sending asylum seekers who cross the Channel to Rwanda. However, Habib told TalkTV that the navy or Border Force should not rescue people who threw themselves into the sea if they had refused alternative vessels. The Reform politician said the UK should \u201cuse force\u201d to repel migrants in boats and could provide them with another dinghy if they jumped into the water. \u201cIf they choose to scupper that dinghy, then yes, they have to suffer the consequences of their actions,\u201d he said. Asked by the interviewer, Julia Hartley-Brewer, whether that meant he would leave them to drown, he said: \u201cAbsolutely. They cannot be infantilised to the point that we become a hostage to fortune.\u201d Habib questioned why that was \u201cuncivilised\u201d as Hartley-Brewer expressed incredulity and said it was not a policy that a civilised country should endorse, saying there was no one in the \u201cBorder Force or the Royal Navy would do that\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Border Force means using force at the border,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are not prepared to use force at the border then we will have open borders \u2026 Border control is a physical process, it\u2019s not a legal one. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hijacked \u2026 You could have five dinghies or give them a boat which they can\u2019t slash again, or you give them lifesavers and tell them to swim back. You could have any number of options to deal with the problem. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t do is give in to the blackmail effectively of: we are here and we\u2019re going to self-harm ourselves unless you take us to British shores. You don\u2019t give in to that.\u201d Asked whether the Reform UK party leader, Richard Tice, shared Habib\u2019s views as expressed on TalkTV about not rescuing migrants in some circumstances, a spokesperson for the party said: \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Our policy is clear and simple: pick up and safely take back to France. \u201cBen was having a conceptual debate about the theory of defending our borders. Our policy will stop the boats and save lives.\u201d"

The full reform of PSR rules is continuing, with officials hoping it will be completed by the time of the Premier League AGM in June, but cost control ratios will now in principle form the centre of any plans. Under the proposed controls clubs in European competition would be limited to spending 70% of their revenues on player-related costs, which include transfer fees, agents fees and wages. The other clubs would be able to spend 85%, part of the league\u2019s desire not to limit ambition among challenger teams. If the league\u2019s timings go to plan, new rules will be tried out in shadow form next season before being implemented in 2025-26. A full set of rules based around the cost control ratio will be drafted over the next two months. The 70% rule is in line with Uefa\u2019s cost control mechanisms, which will be fully in place by 2025-26. The 85% figure was previously mooted as part of discussions with the English Football League over financial redistribution. In March, the Premier League walked away from those negotiations in favour of reforming PSR first. It is understood that minor breaches of the new rules could result in financial penalties, but points deductions will remain the chosen sanction for any serious breach. This season, for the first time, Premier League clubs have been the subject of sporting sanctions after being found in breach of PSR rules. Everton have been handed deductions of six and two points for breaches in separate time periods, and could face a third ruling next season. Nottingham Forest have been deducted four points while Leicester, Chelsea and Manchester City are in the process of having alleged breaches assessed."

An area of persistent poverty, south LA is also a banking desert where payday lenders fill the gap. Long lines form inside the stores on the first of the month, when rent is due. Guillermina Molina, a 60-year-old retired housekeeper, visits the same Speedy Cash each month. During the summer months \u2013 which are becoming increasingly hot \u2013 she runs her air conditioner but frets about her utility bills. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard because the [power bill] is coming up too high because you gotta have the air conditioner on,\u201d Molina said.

A study released earlier this year found that extreme temperature shocks \u2013 like heatwaves and cold snaps \u2013 are leading to surges in demand for payday loans in the US. The paper, published in January by the Bank of Canada, suggests extreme heat and cold may increase demand for payday loans in several ways: increased energy costs as people turn on heating or cooling devices, lost income for people who are unable to work in extreme heat, and health problems leading to medical costs for underinsured or uninsured people. \u201cWe are quite surprised with the fact that there is actually a strong effect stimulating increasing demand during extreme heat and cold days,\u201d said lead author Shihan Xie, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Illinois. Xie\u2019s study looked at satellite temperature data, a dataset of payday loan applications and zip codes to see how temperature affected loans. (The paper has not yet been peer reviewed, but Xie said it will be.) Researchers found that counties with higher populations of Hispanic people, who are overrepresented in outdoor jobs, see larger increases in demand for payday loans with extreme heat days. They also found that loan delinquency and default rates increased with more extreme heat days. Xie said the findings highlight the vulnerability of lower-income households to climate shocks and underscore the need for targeted policies, such as utility assistance programs that could help a consumer like Molina. \u201cWe hope we can provide more evidence on how the program could be better designed to help low-income households,\u201d Xie said. Payday loans are short-term, high-interest loans that are typically $500 or less. The lender typically gives the borrower cash in return for a postdated check timed to coincide with their next paycheck two to four weeks later. Fees are about $15 to $20 per $100 loan, which works out to a 400% to 600% annual percentage rate (APR), according to Xie\u2019s analysis. The interest rates at Speedy Cash, where Molina borrows money, can reach 460%. (Speedy Cash did not reply to requests for comment.) \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at how much they charge over a week or two weeks, it\u2019s not that much. But if you think about it in the annual sense, then the interest rates are extremely high,\u201d Xie said. The loans are widely seen as predatory, with the average customer earning about $30,000 a year and remaining in debt for an average of five months a year, according to a 2012 Pew Charitable Trusts study. One 2021 study found that lenders disproportionately target Black and Latino communities. Payday loans are restricted or outlawed in 18 states and Washington DC, but many lenders find ways around the laws by offering high-interest loans online or operating on sovereign tribal land. Utility bills are among the most common reasons that people take out payday loans. The 2012 study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that seven in 10 borrowers use payday loans for recurring expenses like rent and utilities. Another study in 2012 by the Center for Financial Services Innovation found the most common use for short-term loans like payday loans was to cover utility bills. Extreme heat does not affect all communities equally. People who live in urban \u201cheat islands\u201d with fewer trees and parks are at greater risk from heat, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Due to systemic discrimination, like historic redlining, people of color and lower-income residents are more likely to live in heat islands. Molina lives in a heat island. South LA has little tree cover, and bus stops carry ads warning of heatstroke. The largely lower-income area experiences higher rates of heat-related emergency room visits compared to wealthier areas of the city, according to a University of California, Los Angeles, data analysis. Erika Toriz, founder and CEO of Haven Neighborhood Services, a community group in south Los Angeles, said her clients struggle with an impossible choice: endure heat stress and illness, which can be deadly, or take out payday loans to pay for cooling, which can lead to a cycle of debt. Many of her clients put foil on their windows to reflect sunlight or use wet towels to stay cool. Those with air conditioning avoid running it for too long. \u201cFamilies are worried that their electric bill is going to go up, because they can\u2019t afford that. Even going up $25 is a huge difference,\u201d she explained. \u201cFor our clients, it\u2019s like putting a meal for one or two days on their table.\u201d For some workers, heat can affect their ability to earn a living. A 2021 study found that outdoor workers \u2013 who earn a median annual income of $31,000 a year \u2013 risk losing as much as $1,700 in annual income by mid-century as a result of extreme heat. Kristina Dahl, co-author of the study and principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \u201cOne implication of that lost income from extreme heat could be seeking out payday loans, which have huge interest rates and can really catalyse a cycle of debt.\u201d Black and Hispanic workers are disproportionately affected by extreme heat, facing productivity losses 18% greater than non-Hispanic white workers, according to a 2021 report by the Atlantic Council. \u201cClimate change is just pushing them even further toward this financial brink,\u201d Dahl said. Xie noted that hurricanes and wildfires trigger government aid and insurance that can help households handle financial stress, but heatwaves and cold snaps do not. \u201cThose smaller events still have strong effects on household wellbeing,\u201d she said. Utility assistance programs like the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap) can provide some relief, she said, but many households are either unaware that they exist or do not know how to file claims for assistance. \u201cMaking [this] program more widely available and accessible to low-income households could also be one of the strategies\u201d to help people cope with extreme temperatures, Xie said. Vargas said she wasn\u2019t sure whether her mother qualified for California\u2019s Liheap program because she already receives other forms of government assistance. \u201cA lot of these programs, there\u2019s a lot of red tape,\u201d Vargas said. Karen Lusson, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Centre, said many states don\u2019t spend enough on low-income energy programs. \u201cThe allocations just don\u2019t cover the need,\u201d she said. Lusson said Xie\u2019s study highlighted the \u201cheat-or-eat conundrum\u201d in which families face difficult choices between paying utility bills or buying groceries and medicine. \u201cWhen you throw in climate change, and the fact that 2023 was the hottest year in the recorded history of the planet, the unaffordability problem can be expected to grow more dire,\u201d she said. Molina is not thinking about the long term \u2013 she\u2019s more focused on her mounting expenses. \u201cIt\u2019s too high: the lights, the gas, even the food,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat can I do? I just thank God I\u2019m living every day.\u201d"

A shieldbug, coaxed from hibernation among last autumn\u2019s fallen leaves and sunbathing on a dandelion, seems to be revelling in it too. It\u2019s a hairy shieldbug, Dolycoris baccarum, about the size of my smallest fingernail, clad in heraldic shield-shaped chitinous body armour, emblazoned in purple and bronze, with black and white banded antennae. A recent arrival from southern counties, it is currently expanding its range northwards, probably in response to climate change. Hairy shieldbugs are well \u2013 perhaps too well \u2013 established in my garden here in the Pennine foothills. In 2019, I noticed the first solitary individual; by last summer there were scores of them, congregating to mate on mullein leaf rosettes, using their syringe-like mouthparts to suck sap from ripe raspberries. I shook the dandelion, and the bug dropped into my collecting tube, waggling its legs in the air like an unhorsed knight in armour. Regaining composure, it produced two drops of greenish cloudy liquid, a last-resort chemical defence against predators. This pungent fluid gives shieldbugs another name: stink bugs. I unscrewed the tube cap and took a sniff, detecting a bouquet reminiscent of boiled cabbage with a whiff of stagnant water from a vase of decaying chrysanthemums. Unpleasant to a human nose, probably repulsive to enemies in the olfactory landscape inhabited by insects. This little shieldbug is the latest invertebrate coloniser in a garden I\u2019ve cultivated for almost four decades, during which it has become home to native speckled wood and holly blue butterflies that are extending their range northwards, and to exotic aliens that include Moroccan and Italian harvestman spiders, Asian harlequin ladybirds and European tree bumblebees. We are all witnesses to climate change now: stay in one place for long enough, watch and get to know it well, and a succession of wildlife climate change refugees and opportunists will surely turn up. Someday, when I\u2019m long gone, someone else will cultivate my little patch of ground, find their raspberries infested with hairy shieldbugs, and maybe assume that they\u2019ve always been here. I\u2019m penning this note so they\u2019ll know when and how they arrived. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

            "date": "2024-04-07T14:00:06Z",
            "content": "Shortly after Charles Darwin published his magnum opus, The Origin of Species, in 1859 he started reading a little-known 100-year-old work by a wealthy French aristocrat. Its contents were quite a surprise. \u201cWhole pages [of his book] are laughably like mine,\u201d Darwin wrote to a friend. \u201cIt is surprising how candid it makes one to see one\u2019s view in another man\u2019s words.\u201d In later editions of The Origin of Species, Darwin acknowledged Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, as one of the \u201cfew\u201d people who had understood that species change and evolve, before Darwin himself. Now a new book will attempt to shine a light on the French naturalist\u2019s extraordinary achievements and groundbreaking ideas, which date back to the 1740s. \u201cBuffon was one of the very first people to postulate the change of species over time,\u201d said Jason Roberts, author of a new book, Every Living Thing, which will be published next week, on 11 April. \u201cHe did not call it evolution \u2013 that word was coined later \u2013 but he was one of the first people to talk about it and suggest there was some kind of system.\u201d In Histoire Naturelle, a 36-volume book Buffon worked on for 50 years, he also put forward the idea that animals were becoming extinct at a time when most natural historians believed that \u201cGod would never allow any species to ever disappear or arise over time\u201d, according to Roberts. \u201cThe concept of species change and extinction was very controversial.\u201d Similarly, Buffon\u2019s observations about reproduction anticipated the discovery of DNA: \u201cHe suggested there had to be some kind of internal shaping mechanism \u2013 that life exists on an organic cellular level and there has to be some kind of recipe or \u2018internal mould\u2019 that reproduction follows, to assemble the building blocks of cells into a particular kind of organism.\u201d After inheriting a fortune from a distant relative, equivalent to about \u00a328m today, Buffon used some of his wealth to turn a 100-acre park he owned in Burgundy into an \u201cenvironmental laboratory\u201d, where he \u201clet things go wild and then observed what happened\u201d, Roberts said. \u201cHe has actually been described as the world\u2019s first ecologist, because he was the first person to really study a species in its own environment, and not just a specimen of a dead organism.\u201d Buffon observed everything that happened in his park, from the breeding habits of the foxes to the patterns of the birds and the trees they chose to nest in. \u201cHe was the first scientist to study life in its context and make live contextual observations,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cHe would pay huge amounts of money for specimens of live animals so he could see them and interact with them.\u201d Instead of evolution, Buffon used the term \u201cdegeneration\u201d to refer to a natural process \u201coutside the regular reproductive process\u201d that brought about change to a species. The term did not have negative connotations at the time. But Buffon never figured out how this species change actually took place: it took Darwin, and his theory of natural selection, co-developed with Alfred Russel Wallace, to shed light on the process. Even without this key insight, Buffon postulated that new species must have come into existence and changed over time, while some species must have gone extinct. \u201cThat was a very, very radical idea at the time, and Buffon was censured for it by the Sorbonne: he had to write a statement publicly renouncing everything he had written,\u201d said Roberts. Buffon was later formally accused of heresy for implying that Earth was older than the biblical record. \u201cBuffon suspected it was a matter of millions, if not billions, of years,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cHe pioneered the idea of time on a geological scale.\u201d Unlike his contemporary Carl Linnaeus, who believed that nature was static and every species had stayed exactly as God created them, Buffon believed nature was too complex and changeable to be easily categorised. He was even concerned about the impact of human-caused climate change. \u201cBuffon had enemies, because his message \u2013 that nature cannot be conquered, that humans were, in fact, part of nature \u2013 was essentially disconcerting to other people.\u201d Roberts said he quickly realised that the world wasn\u2019t receptive to his ideas. \u201cHe would make a statement like: \u2018For species to change, one must imagine that the earth is millions of years old\u2019, hoping that one day people would be ready to hear that. But then he would have to add a sentence: \u2018But of course, that\u2019s ridiculous speculation. The Bible tells us otherwise.\u2019\u201d Since Buffon had to keep undermining his own observations, it was easy for Victorian naturalists to brush aside his contributions, suggesting \u2013 as Darwin did \u2013 that Buffon\u2019s opinions \u201cfluctuated greatly\u201d. Roberts hopes his book will help to reassert Buffon\u2019s rightful place in history: \u201cThe outrage that greeted Darwin in 1859 is well known,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if those ideas had been asserted in 1759.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 April 2024 to include a reference to Charles Darwin\u2019s fellow naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace."

            "content": "Climate change is causing apparently healthy trees to die after periods of heat and drought. Many may not die immediately but repeated periods of hot weather seem to increase the vulnerability of some species more than others. Researchers studied 20 species of conifers planted 100 years ago in the same place in the Netherlands, taking tree ring samples to see how they did in droughts between 1970 and 2013. From the distance between the rings it is possible to tell how much each species\u2019 growth was affected. After the hot, dry summers from 2018 to 2020 the scientists returned and found that some of the plantation had not just lost growth but been unable to survive at all. Some species had all come through but in others seven out of 10 trees had died. Rather surprisingly it was not the different ability of trees to find water in the soil that caused the deaths but leaf damage. Some pine species renew their needles each year while others keep them for a decade or even longer, something that would normally save the tree energy and effort. But in this case the species that had heat-damaged needles but could replace them quickly survived, while those that did not have that ability gradually died."

            "date": "2024-04-22T11:39:42Z",
            "content": "Julian Medina comes from a long line of fishers in the north of Colombia\u2019s Gulf of Morrosquillo who use small-scale and often traditional methods to catch species such as mackerel, tuna and cojin\u00faa. Medina went into business as a young man but was drawn back to his roots, and ended up leading a fishing organisation. For years he has campaigned against the encroachment of fossil fuel companies, pollution and overfishing, which are destroying the gulf\u2019s delicate ecosystem and people\u2019s livelihoods. He says there have been huge declines in the amount of fish he and others can catch \u2013 70% in the past decade \u2013 leading to widespread hunger in an already poor region. \u201cWe are now getting fish below the minimum size, which are the ones that could have provided us with security in the future.\u201d Medina is angry at the fossil fuel companies that are taking over part of the coast and have caused oil spills, and angry at the authorities that license them and undermine community attempts to restore mangrove forests. He is also deeply concerned about how warming water is bleaching the coral reefs through which his prey swims. \u201cWe see how industrial activity is affecting our entire ecosystem,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we also know that climate change is affecting our environment. It is a struggle and we are trying to make it visible in order to be heard.\u201d Medina will be telling his story this week to a panel of judges in Barbados during the first part of a historic hearing on climate change by the inter-American court of human rights. The inquiry was instigated by Colombia and Chile, which together asked the court to set out what legal responsibilities states have to tackle climate change and to stop it breaching people\u2019s human rights. The detailed request seeks clarity on many issues, including children\u2019s and women\u2019s rights, environmental defenders, and common but differentiated responsibilities \u2013 the idea that all countries have a role to play in tackling climate change but some should bear a bigger burden. As well as mitigating and adapting to climate change, it asks how states should tackle the inevitable loss and damage. Although climate change affects the whole world, the two countries told the court that its effects are not experienced uniformly or fairly. Their request letter warns that people in Chile and Colombia already deal with the daily consequences of the climate emergency, including droughts, floods, landslides and fires. \u201cThese phenomena highlight the need to respond urgently and based on the principles of equity, justice, cooperation and sustainability, with a focus on human rights,\u201d they said. Courts around the world are increasingly making the link between climate justice and human rights. This month, the European court of human rights ruled for the first time that weak government climate policies violated fundamental human rights. But the global south is leading the way. The Costa Rica-based court was set up in 1979 to interpret and apply the American convention on human rights, a treaty ratified by members of the Organization of American States. Twenty states have accepted its jurisdiction, including most Latin American countries and several Caribbean islands. Neither the US nor Canada have done so. It is the third international court tasked with providing an advisory opinion on climate change, alongside the international court of justice and the international tribunal for the law of the aea. Such opinions are highly influential and set the framework for future legal action. However, the inter-American court is the only one focusing on human rights. In a previous opinion it recognised the right to a healthy environment and affirmed that states must protect human rights affected by environmental harm, even if it happens outside their borders. That recognition was enforced in March, when it ruled that Peru had violated the right to a healthy environment of people living in the country\u2019s \u201cmost contaminated town\u201d. \u201cThe inter-American court is generally known and sees itself as a court that is much more willing to innovate with the law and to draw on sources from around the world,\u201d said Sophie Marjanac, the accountable corporations lead at environmental law charity ClientEarth who will be speaking at the Barbados hearing. Unlike the other courts, the inter-American court accepts written submissions from organisations and individuals, and has invited many of these to its oral hearings. The hearing will begin with statements from the governments of Chile, Colombia and Barbados, followed by Mexico and Vanuatu. The court will then hear from UN bodies, legal experts from the Americas and further afield, local and national campaign groups, trade unions and refugee organisations. The eclectic mix of speakers includes Grupo Energ\u00eda Bogot\u00e1, a large regional gas company. One key part of the opinion tackles intergenerational equity, and the court will hear directly from youth people. Jovana Hoschtialek, 18, a teacher and Grenadian climate campaigner, has seen significant changes in her home island. \u201cThe sea is rising, quite a few of our plants are dying and water is becoming more scarce,\u201d she said. \u201cSooner or later the things that I have grown up with, my younger sisters aren\u2019t going to be able to experience.\u201d Hoschitalek is preparing to tell the court about her experiences. \u201cI want to try to tell them how important it is that the future generations can be seen because \u2026 children won\u2019t be able to survive the harsh climate that will come if things don\u2019t take a drastic change.\u201d Trina Chiemi, the founder of youth network Fast Action on Climate to Ensure Intergenerational Justice, hopes the hearing will be an empowering process. \u201cWith the inter-American court we\u2019re able to share our voices directly, and they\u2019re able to look and see the faces of the people that are affected.\u201d The court\u2019s subsequent hearings in the Brazilian cities of Bras\u00edlia and Manaus in May will include many more frontline stories from the climate crisis including people living in \u201csacrifice zones\u201d in Chile, Bolivian women fighting to protect their local water supplies and Indigenous communities. Medina and others are speaking at the hearing with the support of Asociaci\u00f3n Interamericana para la Defensa del Ambiente (Aida), an environmental law organisation that works in Latin America. \u201cA lot of issues that are going to be raised may seem disconnected,\u201d said Marcella Ribeiro, a senior human rights and environment attorney for Aida. \u201cBut what I think is really beautiful [about] hearing from environmental defenders and communities directly is that they can pinpoint where or how these environmental issues connect with climate change. For example, environmental degradation and their ability to adapt.\u201d Once the opinion is published, it will have direct influence on the countries that accept the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Legal experts say it will be an authoritative source on the obligations of states to respond to climate change, potentially boosting action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, supporting adaptation measures and helping establish mechanisms to address loss and damage. Campaigners also hope it will invigorate existing climate lawsuits and petitions, such as those currently stalled at the inter-American commission on human rights (the court\u2019s sister organisation), and say it could form the basis for future domestic or regional climate litigation. It could even be used by countries during arbitration claims in investor-state dispute settlements, many of which are brought by companies in extractive industries. The opinion is expected to have an impact outside the Americas too, including on the ICJ\u2019s pending advisory opinion. \u201cWe in the territories know something about our environment, we know what is happening,\u201d said Medina. \u201cMany scientists come and study what is happening and they can give context. But we who have experienced the changes \u2026 it is very important that our voices are heard.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 April 2024 to refer to the American convention on human rights, not the \u201cUS convention on human rights\u201d, and to correct the spelling of Jovana Hoschtialek\u2019s surname."

            "date": "2024-04-18T15:59:41Z",
            "content": "Climate campaigners have accused Scottish ministers of being \u201cinept\u201d and \u201cshort-termist\u201d after they scrapped Scotland\u2019s target to cut carbon emissions by 75% by 2030. M\u00e0iri McAllan, the Scottish net zero secretary, confirmed her government had abandoned that target and would also drop legally binding annual targets on reducing carbon emissions, after damning criticism from a UK advisory committee. In what opposition politicians labelled a \u201chumiliating\u201d climbdown, McAllan said Scotland would instead follow the lead of the UK and Welsh governments by adopting five-yearly \u201ccarbon budgets\u201d aimed at meeting its zero emissions target date of 2045. McAllan told MSPs this decision had been heavily influenced by the UK Climate Change Committee, which said last month the 2030 target was \u201cno longer credible\u201d because of inadequate action on home heating, transport, farming and nature restoration by Scottish ministers. She said the 2030 target had always been stretching, and claimed the new approach was simply a pragmatic response, acknowledging the huge scale of the task that involved \u201cminor legislative amendments\u201d. But Prof Piers Forster, the CCC\u2019s interim chair, said scrapping the 2030 target was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d as it undermined effective climate action. He urged McAllan to set out the new commitments as soon as possible. \u201cInterim targets and plans to deliver against them are what makes any net zero commitment credible,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are essential for enabling a stable transition. Long-term planning is vital for businesses, citizens and future parliaments. Today that has been undermined.\u201d Friends of the Earth Scotland, previously a supporter of Scotland\u2019s efforts to be a \u201cworld leader\u201d on climate action, said this reversal was \u201cthe worst environmental decision in the history of the Scottish parliament\u201d. Imogen Dow, its head of campaigns, said: \u201cInstead of using the past decade to deliver warm homes, reliable public transport and a fair transition away from fossil fuels, inept, short-termist politicians have kept millions of people trapped in the broken status quo that only benefits big polluters.\u201d Jamie Livingstone, the head of Oxfam Scotland, said the decision was a \u201creprehensible retreat caused by [the Scottish government\u2019s] recklessly inadequate level of action to date. With scientists linking deadly heatwaves in west Africa to climate change and Dubai drowning in a deluge of rain, the urgency of climate action couldn\u2019t be clearer.\u201d The rollback is doubly difficult for Scottish ministers because Nicola Sturgeon, the previous first minister, had made the climate crisis one of her government\u2019s top priorities. She was the first UK leader to acknowledge the planet faced a climate emergency. Sturgeon signed a power-sharing deal with the Scottish Green party in 2021 which prioritised climate action, and then posed with Greta Thunberg at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow later that year. Graham Simpson, a Scottish Conservative MSP, said it was a surprise that Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, the Scottish Green co-leaders who signed that agreement, had not resigned their ministerial posts in embarrassment. Harvie said the Greens were still driving change. The Scottish government now has to table urgent legislation to scrap Holyrood\u2019s current climate act, which sets annual targets, and instead use carbon budgets. Those five-yearly budgets set a ceiling for how much CO2 can be emitted in those time periods. McAllan said the Scottish government would quadruple the number of electric vehicle chargers, \u201cexplore\u201d a new integrated public transport ticket system, pilot emissions reduction schemes on livestock farms, consult on a new carbon tax for large rural estates, and use rates relief to subsidise green energy for businesses. Livingstone said these \u201clargely recycled measures represent baby steps forward rather than the giant leaps needed and are a thinly veiled distraction from ministers\u2019 failure to deliver their existing climate commitments\u201d."

            "date": "2024-04-18T12:00:47Z",
            "content": "By the middle of the century, global emissions from plastic production could triple to account for one-fifth of the Earth\u2019s remaining carbon budget, an analysis has found. The stunning new estimates from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, published on Wednesday, provide yet more evidence that the plastic industry is \u201cundermining the world\u2019s efforts to address climate change\u201d, said Heather McTeer Toney, executive director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Beyond Petrochemicals campaign, which helped fund the new report. The production of plastic, which is made from fossil fuels, is greenhouse gas-intensive. Coal, oil or gas must first be mined or extracted, and then those materials must be refined and processed in another emissions-heavy procedure. In some cases, other chemical compounds such as formaldehyde must also be produced, creating more pollution. Petrochemicals are then \u201ccracked\u201d into plastic building blocks such as ethylene \u2013 the aspect of plastic production with the largest emissions toll. Additional emissions come from the process of polymerization \u2013 combining those building blocks to form larger molecules \u2013 and then shaping them into products, the report says. To estimate the total emissions associated with plastic production, the authors examined the greenhouse gas impact of nine of the most common types of plastics, which are used to create plastic packaging, water bottles, hot beverage containers and other materials. Plastic creation generated 2.24 gigatonnes of planet-heating pollution in 2019, or as much as 600 coal-fired power plants. That year, it accounted for 5% of all global carbon emissions, 12% of the world\u2019s oil demand and 8.5% of gas demand, the report found. Those numbers are expected to increase dramatically, the report says, because the plastic industry is on an exponential growth trajectory, with production expected to double or even triple by 2050. If production increases by 4% every year, doubling within a quarter of a century, planet-warming emissions could hit 6.78 gigatonnes by 2050 \u2013 equal to the emissions of more than 1,700 coal plants. Fully decarbonizing the power grid \u2013 a key focus of global climate plans \u2013 could limit this climate impact, yet would still leave the world on a perilous path. As much as 70% of the fossil fuel used in plastic creation comes from the raw materials used in production \u2013 not the electricity used in processing \u2013 the authors write. As a result, even if the world achieves fully carbon-free electricity by 2050, plastic production would produce 5.13 gigatonnes of pollution in 2050 under a 4% annual growth scenario. Preventing this explosive growth could slash this impact. But even if production remains steady, by 2050 it would account for 15 to 19% of the remaining global carbon budget to keep global average temperatures at 1.5C, the report found. Even with a fully decarbonized grid, that percentage could still be up to 16%. The report was released before the 4th Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC4) meeting for a global plastics treaty set to start next week in Ottawa, Canada. Neil Tangri, science and policy director at the environmental justice group Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, who reviewed the report, said the findings made it clear that plastic production was a \u201cwrecking ball for our climate\u201d and that he hoped it would influence the forthcoming negotiations. \u201cThis report provides negotiators with the strongest scientific evidence to date on the need to stop and reverse the expansion of plastic production,\u201d he said. In a brief forthcoming analysis, Tangri\u2019s organization found that the estimates suggest plastic production could completely consume the world\u2019s carbon budget before the century\u2019s end. But they also suggest that curbing plastic production could yield enormous climate benefits, Tangri said. \u201cIf this treaty forces companies to significantly cut plastic production \u2013 by at least 12% per year by our calculations \u2013 we can still keep the world\u2019s 1.5 degree goal alive and stem the climate impacts of plastic,\u201d he said. Curbing plastic production could have other positive knock-on effects, the authors wrote, including on public health. \u201cPetrochemicals, the building block of plastic, are already poisoning communities that neighbor production facilities with cancer-causing pollution,\u201d Toney said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe consequences of this industry\u2019s unfettered carbon emissions will reach everyone on the planet.\u201d Plastic also generates toxic and planet-heating emissions at the end of its life if it is burned in an incinerator or sent to a landfill. Despite this huge climate toll, current proposals to slash plastic pollution under the treaty, which has been described as the most important environmental deal since the 2015 Paris Climate Accord, \u201cdo not yet include any explicit consideration of climate impacts\u201d, the authors wrote."

            "title": "UN livestock emissions report seriously distorted our work, say experts",
            "date": "2024-04-19T11:00:48Z",
            "content": "A flagship UN report on livestock emissions is facing calls for retraction from two key experts it cited who say that the paper \u201cseriously distorted\u201d their work. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) misused their research to underestimate the potential of reduced meat intake to cut agricultural emissions, according to a letter sent to the FAO by the two academics, which the Guardian has seen. Paul Behrens, an associate professor at Leiden University and Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor at New York University, both accuse the FAO study of systematic errors, poor framing, and highly inappropriate use of source data. Hayek told the Guardian: \u201cThe FAO\u2019s errors were multiple, egregious, conceptual and all had the consequence of reducing the emissions mitigation possibilities from dietary change far below what they should be. None of the mistakes had the opposite effect.\u201d Agriculture accounts for 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions, most of which are attributable to livestock in the form of methane from burps and manure, and deforestation for grazing and feed crops. As global meat production leapt by 39% in the first two decades of this century, agricultural emissions also rose by 14%. At the Cop28 climate summit in December, the FAO published the third in a series of studies of the livestock emissions problem. As well as reducing the FAO\u2019s estimate of livestock\u2019s contribution to overall global heating for a third consecutive time, it used a paper written by Behrens and others in 2017 to argue that shifts away from meat eating could only reduce global agri-food emissions by between 2 and 5%. Behrens\u2019s paper from 2017 assessed the environmental impacts of government-backed nationally recommended diets (NRDs) of the time, which have since become outdated. Many countries, such as China and Denmark, have drastically reduced their recommended meat intake since then, while Germany now proposes a 75% plant-based diet in its NRD. Behrens says \u201cvoluminous evidence\u201d from larger environmental reports which recommended reductions in meat content, such as the Eat-Lancet Planetary Health Diet, were ignored, according to the letter. \u201cThe scientific consensus at the moment is that dietary shifts are the biggest leverage we have to reduce emissions and other damage caused by our food system,\u201d Behrens told the Guardian. \u201cBut the FAO chose the roughest and most inappropriate approach to their estimates and framed it in a way that was very useful for interest groups seeking to show that plant-based diets have a small mitigation potential compared to alternatives.\u201d Of more than 200 climate scientists surveyed by Behrens and Hayek for a recent paper, 78% said it was important for livestock herd sizes to peak by 2025 if the world was to stand a chance of preventing dangerous global heating. As well as using obsolete NRDs, the scientists say the FAO report \u201csystematically underestimates\u201d the emissions-cutting potential of dietary shifts through what the letter calls a \u201cseries of methodological errors\u201d. The authors say these include: double-counting meat emissions until 2050, mixing different baseline years in analyses, and channelling data inputs that inappropriately favour diets allowing increased global meat consumption. The FAO paper also skips over the opportunity cost of carbon sequestration on non-farmed land. Hayek said the FAO inappropriately cited a report he co-authored that measured all agri-food emissions, and applied it to livestock emissions alone. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just like comparing apples to oranges,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like comparing really small apples to really big oranges.\u201d Correspondingly, the mitigation potential from farming less livestock was underestimated by a factor of between 6 and 40, he said. The FAO is the world\u2019s primary source for agricultural data, and its reports are routinely used by authoritative bodies such as the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But the FAO is also mandated to increase livestock productivity so as to bolster nutrition and food security, arguably creating a conflict of interests. Former officials have accused the FAO of censoring and sabotaging their work when it challenged livestock industry positions. A recent FAO roadmap to making the sector sustainable also omitted the option of reducing meat intake from a list of 120 policy interventions. That paper received praise from meat industry lobbyists, one of whom called it \u201cmusic to our ears\u201d when it was released at Cop28. An FAO spokesperson said: \u201cAs a knowledge-based organisation, FAO is fully committed to ensuring accuracy and integrity in scientific publications, especially given the significant implications for policymaking and public understanding. \u201cWe would like to assure you that the report in question has undergone a rigorous review process with both an internal and external double-blind peer review to ensure that the research meets the highest standards of quality and accuracy, and that potential biases are minimised. FAO will look into the issues raised by the academics and undertake a technical exchange of views with them.\u201d"

            "content": "Australians are really getting on board with electric cars but the number of electric bikes has also exploded \u2013 and data suggests the smaller EVs are having a bigger impact on oil demand. Electric vehicles as a whole displaced about 1.5m barrels of oil a day globally in 2022, according to Bloomberg. Two-thirds of that \u2013 almost 1m barrels a day \u2013 was just from electric bikes and mopeds, which are known as electric micromobility. Electric cars were responsible for a little over a sixth, with the remainder accounted for by vans, trucks and buses. In 2021, Australia consumed about 1m barrels of oil a day across all sectors of the economy. The International Energy Agency IEA estimates that electric vehicles could displace 5m barrels of oil a day by 2030. A huge part of electric micromobility\u2019s impact is due to its scale \u2013 there were almost 300m two- and three-wheeled electric vehicles globally in 2022, compared with around 26m electric cars. More than 95% of the two-wheelers are located in China, according to the IEA. Australian electric car sales in the year to March were 98,436 \u2013 double that of the year before \u2013 and the number of charging stations also grew by more than 75%. Meanwhile, Australians bought more than 193,000 ebikes last year, according to Bicycle Industries Australia. Ebikes won\u2019t replace a car for a lot of people, but they are often well-suited for shorter trips and the \u201clast kilometre\u201d \u2013 the distance between home and the nearest public transport.

            "date": "2024-04-11T13:11:10Z",
            "content": "Staff at one of the world\u2019s leading climate-certification organisations have called for the CEO and board members to resign after they announced plans to allow companies to meet their climate targets with carbon offsets. They fear that companies will use the offsets for greenwashing, while avoiding making the necessary cuts in greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 without which the world faces climate catastrophe. The UN-backed Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which certifies whether a company is on track to help limit global heating to under 1.5C, has validated hundreds of net zero plans from companies including J Sainsbury plc, John Lewis and Maersk. Until now, the SBTi has ruled out the use of carbon offsets, instead emphasising the importance of deep greenhouse gas emissions cuts. But on Tuesday, the SBTi board of trustees released plans to allow carbon credits in their net zero standard by permitting companies to use them to offset emissions from their supply chains, known as scope 3 emissions. The board said there was \u201congoing healthy debate on the subject\u201d, but that \u201cwhen properly supported by policies, standards and procedures based on scientific evidence\u201d, the use of offsets in supply chains could be \u201can additional tool to tackle climate change\u201d, and so it had decided to extend their use. They said a draft of the new rules would be published by July. The announcement was met with fury by many SBTi staff and advisers, who say they were not consulted on the decision and that the move is not based on science. In a letter to management seen by the Guardian, they called for the statement to be withdrawn, and for the resignation of CEO Luiz Fernando do Amaral and any board members who supported the decision. The statement read: \u201cWe stand ready to support any efforts aimed at ensuring that the SBTi does not become a greenwashing platform where decisions are unduly influenced by lobbyists, driven by potential conflicts of interest and poor adherence to existing governance procedures. In the event that our concerns are not addressed, SBTi staff will have no choice but to take further action.\u201d The SBTi did not respond to request for comment. The announcement from SBTi\u2019s board of trustees was widely celebrated by carbon market proponents, who say the move could increase demand for offsets. Advocates for carbon markets say that a scaled-up system could help generate much-needed finance for the global south to fund climate-change mitigation and adaptation. But scientific studies into popular offsetting schemes have found that, in practice, many do almost nothing to limit global heating. It is often unclear how much money from the sale of offsets makes it to communities on the ground. Ben Rattenbury, a policy analyst at data provider Sylvera, said the move was \u201ca very big deal\u201d for the carbon markets. \u201cThe world can\u2019t afford this transition without carbon credits, so it\u2019s very encouraging to see SBTi open the door for companies to be able to use them for a proportion of their scope 3 emissions reductions targets \u2013 while respecting the mitigation hierarchy,\u201d he said. Reacting to the move, Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told the Guardian that while there was little to no room for offsetting, he did not think that the SBTi decision was so dramatic. \u201cI do appreciate the SBTi challenge of how to incentivise companies to take responsibility for scope 3 emissions. In a transition phase, I can see that allowing for offsetting may be the only options as long as scope 1 and 2 emissions follow the carbon law of fossil-fuel phaseout and if the offsets are truly robust \u2013 preferably focused on \u2018like for like\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSBTi companies are generally engaged in trying to be carbon neutral as fast as possible, and they are leading their sectors when they quantify scope 3 emissions, so giving some opening for how to deal with this in the short run \u2013 say, the next five years \u2013 is acceptable,\u201d he added.

            "date": "2024-04-26T12:28:50Z",
            "content": "The Cambridge-based cybersecurity and artificial intelligence company Darktrace is likely to become the latest British technology champion to be swallowed up by a US suitor, after it agreed a $5.3bn (\u00a34.2bn) sale to US private equity business Thoma Bravo. Darktrace, whose co-founding investor Mike Lynch is now on trial for fraud and conspiracy in the US, agreed to an offer 44% higher than its average share price over the past three months. Announcing the deal, the company fired a Parthian shot at the under-pressure London stock market, saying its technology, described as \u201ccutting edge\u201d by Thoma Bravo, had been undervalued. In a statement to investors, the Darktrace board said that its \u201coperating and financial achievements have not been reflected commensurately in its valuation, with shares trading at a significant discount to its global peer group\u201d. The comment will fuel fears that the FTSE is haemorrhaging prestigious company listings to the US, in search of greater fundraising potential. Recent departures include the chipmaker Arm Holdings, the gambling company Flutter and the building materials business CRH. Shell has hinted it could leave the London stock market, while the miner Anglo American on Friday rejected an offer from the Australia-listed rival BHP but could yet succumb to a higher offer. Darktrace said the offer from Thoma Bravo would give its shareholders certainty about the value of their shares and enable the company to grow in a \u201cstable and private\u201d setting. Thoma Bravo, which walked away from previous takeover talks in 2022, made a cash offer that values Darktrace at $7.75 a share, or about 620p, compared with its valuation of 250p when it floated in London in 2021. Despite its widely admired cybersecurity technology, which uses AI to detect and kill threats within IT networks, analysts have said that Darktrace\u2019s valuation has lagged behind its peers. The company has struggled to shake off lingering concerns linked to its founding co-investor, the British tech entrepreneur Lynch, who has no formal role within the company but owns 6.8% with his wife, Angela Bacares. Between them, the couple will make just under \u00a3300m from the sale of their shares. That could help fund Lynch\u2019s legal bills, as he fights allegations that he was the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind a massive fraud that led the US tech firm Hewlett-Packard to overpay significantly, when it bought Lynch\u2019s business, Autonomy, for $11.1bn in 2011. HP wrote down the value of its acquisition by $8.8bn less than a year later, alleging serious accounting irregularities on the part of Lynch and several senior colleagues. Lynch has pleaded not guilty, having always denied allegations of wrongdoing. Darktrace\u2019s chief executive, Poppy Gustafsson, was seen as a protege of Lynch but has stressed the company\u2019s distance from its co-founding investor during his fight against extradition and the ongoing trial. In a statement on Friday, she said: \u201cFrom our base in Cambridge, we are building a world-leading company using a unique form of artificial intelligence to address the societal challenge of cybersecurity. \u201cThis proposed offer represents the next stage in our growth journey and I am excited by the many opportunities we have ahead of us. Our technology has never been more relevant in a world increasingly threatened by AI-powered cyber-attacks. \u201cIn the face of this, we are expanding our product portfolio, entering new markets, and focused on delivering for our customers, partners and colleagues.\u201d Thoma Bravo, based in Chicago, is one of the world\u2019s largest software and cybersecurity investors, with more than $138bn of assets under management as of the end of 2023. The Thoma Bravo partner Andrew Almeida said: \u201cDarktrace is at the very cutting edge of cybersecurity technology, and we have long been admirers of its platform and capability in artificial intelligence. The pace of innovation in cybersecurity is accelerating in response to cyber threats that are simultaneously complex, global and sophisticated.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-03T17:56:52Z",
            "content": "More than a dozen politicians, advisers and journalists have been targeted in a phishing attack, in what cybersecurity experts believe is an attempt to compromise them. Twelve men working in Westminster, including a serving government minister, told Politico they had received unsolicited WhatsApp messages from two suspicious mobile numbers in the past six months. The Guardian spoke to a 13th man who has not previously shared his experience and who was targeted in the exact same way by a WhatsApp user calling themselves \u201cAbigail\u201d or \u201cAbi\u201d. The former government special adviser received the first message on 23 January 2023, demonstrating that the phishing operation has been under way for at least 18 months. He received a message from an unknown number in the evening that said: \u201cLong time no speak (eyes emoji), how\u2019re you?\u201d The WhatsApp user, who used a young woman\u2019s photo as the profile picture, introduced themselves as Abigail and said that they \u201cused to have some late-night chats\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s been a while, you may not still be single\u201d. When the man responded that the sender probably had the wrong number, she claimed they had met at a conference and offered to \u201cjog your memory\u201d. They kept sending messages into the night, saying, \u201cDefinitely don\u2019t recognise me?\u201d and \u201cI feel a bit awkward! I\u2019m sure I had the right guy.\u201d They then said: \u201cI\u2019m about to do something reckless. Anyone with you right now?\u201d and sent an explicit picture. Abigail claimed to have met the man at the Midland bar, a popular hangout for Conservative party conference attenders when the gatherings are held in Manchester. The man suspected that it was a scam, but continued exchanging messages with \u201cAbigail\u201d for a few months, without sharing any explicit or compromising information. The most recent message was received on 17 March this year. The messages he received bear a striking similarity to the group of cases collected by Politico, which reported that one Tory MP had referred the messages to the police. The story has sparked fears about attempts to persuade MPs, advisers, officials and others working in Westminster to share compromising information and use it to threaten or blackmail them. Politico reported that the user sending the messages claimed to have met each target at various settings relating to their work. Two people were sent references to their work on the Mid Bedfordshire byelection of October 2023. One received a message relating to their involvement in \u201cthe Nandy campaign\u201d (a reference to Lisa Nandy\u2019s bid for the Labour party leadership in 2020). Another was told they had previously met the sender in the \u201cSports\u201d \u2013 shorthand for the Woolsack bar in parliament, formerly the Sports and Social Club, a place frequented by parliamentary staffers. It comes at a time of heightened concerns about cyber-attacks by hostile states such as Russia and China. Cybersecurity experts said the phishing campaign was not highly sophisticated because the messages came from the same two numbers, which were not registered with a mainstream UK phone network. There have been calls in recent weeks for parliament to introduce training on digital and operational security for MPs, peers and their staff. Parliamentary employees who are concerned have been urged to contact the parliamentary security team. A Commons spokesperson said: \u201cParliament takes cybersecurity extremely seriously. We provide members and staff with tailored advice, making them aware of cyber risks and how to manage their digital safety \u2013 including on any personal devices and accounts.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-05T15:57:44Z",
            "content": "British MPs have received explicit images and flirtatious messages from anonymous WhatsApp accounts in an apparent \u201choneytrap\u201d after an MP was coerced into sharing their numbers. What\u2019s not known is who is behind these messages and what their motive is. On Thursday, Tory MP William Wragg admitted to giving the personal phone numbers of fellow MPs to a person on the Grindr dating app. He said he had sent them photographs of himself and feared what they would do with them if he didn\u2019t comply. Senior political figures including Alicia Kearns, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, and Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, have suggested that a foreign state may be responsible. Yet government sources told the Guardian there is no evidence that the messages are the work of a foreign power and that the pattern of behaviour does not fit with what is known about Russian or Chinese operations. The incident is not being treated as a cybersecurity incident either, given there is no evidence of technology being compromised or passwords being handed over. Alan Woodward, professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey, said working out who is behind such incidents is difficult but that nation states are more interested in obtaining confidential material through ongoing business-style relationships: \u201cI think the Chinese already have MPs\u2019 telephone numbers, they don\u2019t need someone on Grindr.\u201d He suggested a nation state would be more likely to approach an MP through LinkedIn: \u201cYou can use kompromat once. But if you have a professional relationship with someone and are exchanging ideas and information you can elicit valuable intellectual property.\u201d Rather than gaining access to parliament\u2019s internal systems, the individual (or individuals) who sent the messages relied on a combination of old-fashioned social engineering, Westminster\u2019s party culture, and a growing willingness to send naked pictures to strangers. Wragg\u2019s confession that he had handed over his colleagues\u2019 phone numbers came after a report by Politico that at least a dozen men working in Westminster politics \u2013 including a serving minister and other MPs \u2013 have been targeted in a similar fashion. The messages showed a deep understanding of the Houses of Parliament and the places where people might bump into each other while working in Westminster, according to individuals who received them. This included references to specific bars at political party conferences or roles on long-defunct leadership campaigns. Often the targets would be told they had met the unknown number at an event some time ago, taking advantage of memories that were blurry after long nights of drinking and meeting new people. The same WhatsApp numbers were also used to target multiple victims over several months, in another sign that this may not be a hi-tech operation. This has led to speculation that it could be a rogue political insider who enjoyed gathering compromising material on their colleagues. Catfishing \u2013 where someone is convinced they are talking to a potential love interest under false pretences \u2013 is not illegal in the UK. Nor is convincing someone to willingly share naked photos under false pretences. But an individual who publishes those pictures at a later date could be convicted of breaking \u201crevenge porn\u201d laws, while police are assessing potential for blackmail offences. Although Wragg is the only politician to have gone public, some of those targeted as part of the apparent honeytrap have told the Guardian they do not believe the MP would have had their number in his phone contacts. This suggests there was a wider campaign that did not just rely on a single MP opening up their phone book. Woodward said the incident had more in common with old-fashioned blackmail. He said the only solution for the victims is to confess and own up to mistakes at an early stage: \u201cKompromat these days is so ineffective as people are not so easily shamed. And if you\u2019re willing to send these images to a stranger on Grindr, are you even so ashamed?\u201d"

He was using a software tool called SSH for securely logging into remote computers on the internet, but the interactions with the distant machines were significantly slower than usual. So he did some digging and found malicious code embedded in a software package called XZ Utils that was running on his machine. This is a critical utility for compressing (and decompressing) data running on the Linux operating system, the OS that powers the vast majority of publicly accessible internet servers across the world. Which means that every such machine is running XZ Utils. Freund\u2019s digging revealed that the malicious code had arrived in his machine via two recent updates to XZ Utils, and he alerted the Open Source Security list to reveal that those updates were the result of someone intentionally planting a backdoor in the compression software. It was what is called a \u201csupply-chain attack\u201d (like the catastrophic SolarWinds one of 2020) \u2013 where malicious software is not directly injected into targeted machines, but distributed by infecting the regular software updates to which all computer users are wearily accustomed.

Basically to break the authentication process that makes SSH secure and thereby create a backdoor that would enable an intruder remotely to gain unauthorised access to the entire system. Since SSH is a vital tool for the safe operation of a networked world, anything that undermines it is really bad news \u2013 which is why the cybersecurity world has been on high alert in the past week. Those running the different flavours of Linux that are in use across the world have been alerted to the dangers posed by the two rogue updates. So stable door bolted, and hopefully no horses missing. None of this would have been true, though, if Freund hadn\u2019t been so hawk-eyed and inquisitive. \u201cThe world owes Andres unlimited free beer,\u201d observed one security expert. \u201cHe just saved everybody\u2019s arse in his spare time.\u201d In some ways, the story of how the malware got into the updates is even more instructive. XZ Utils is open-source software, ie software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify and enhance. Much open source is written and maintained by small teams of programmers, and in many case by a single individual. In XZ Utils, that individual for years has been Lasse Collin, who has been with the project since its inception. Until recently he was the person who had been assembling and distributing the updates of the software. But it seems that in recent years the grind of maintaining such a key piece of software had become more onerous, and he is also reported to have had health problems. (We don\u2019t know for sure because he decided a while back to take a sabbatical from the online world.) But according to security expert Micha\u0142 Zalewski, about two years ago a developer \u201cwith no prior online footprint\u201d and calling himself Jia Tan appeared out of the blue and started making helpful contributions to the XZ Utils library. \u201cShortly after the arrival of \u2018Jia\u2019,\u201d Zalewski continues, \u201cseveral apparent sock puppet accounts showed up and started pressuring Lasse to pass the baton; it seems that he relented at some point in 2023.\u201d And it seems that the two malware-infected updates were released by this Jia character. So now the plot thickens. Cybersecurity experts are clearly taking the attack seriously. \u201cThe backdoor is very peculiar in how it is implemented, but it is really clever stuff and very stealthy,\u201d a well-known South African security guru told the Economist. Even more interesting is the existence of a concerted online campaign to persuade Lasse Collin to pass control of XZ Utils to \u201cJia Tan\u201d. This particular guru suspects that the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service behind the SolarWinds penetration of US government networks, might even have played a role in the attack. Who knows? But two clear lessons can be drawn from what we know so far. The first is that we have constructed a whole new world on top of a technology that is intrinsically and fundamentally insecure. The second is that we are critically dependent on open-source software that is often maintained by volunteers who do it for love rather than money \u2013 and generally without support from either industry or government. We can\u2019t go on like this, but we will. Those whom the Gods wish to destroy, they first make complacent.

            "content": "Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen has praised the US Congress for passing a sweeping foreign aid package this week which included arms support for the island, and has drawn the ire of China. After months of delays and contentious debate, the bill was signed into law by Joe Biden on Wednesday. Described as $95bn in aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, the legislation actually contains provisions that broadly affect many parts of the Asia-Pacific, while also spending billions of dollars at home in America. House Republicans billed the $8.1bn for the Indo-Pacific as an effort to \u201ccounter communist China and ensure a strong deterrence in the region,\u201d however the largest provision of funding is for projects in the US itself. In the face of delayed shipbuilding projects, $3.3bn of the bill will go towards the US domestic submarine-building industry. $1.9bn is designated for a Columbia-class submarine \u2013 America\u2019s newest class of nuclear-powered submarine \u2013 the first of which is due to be delivered in 2027. Another $200m is designated for a Virginia-class submarine. The vast majority of this money will be spent in the United States, with more than 16,000 suppliers across all 50 states set to benefit, according to Connor Fiddler at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \u201cNearly half of the Indo-Pacific appropriations directly reinforce the submarine industrial base,\u201d Fiddler wrote in his analysis of the package. \u201cWhile this investment will enhance deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, the immediate impact will be supporting the American economy.\u201d The submarine funding was a condition of congressional endorsement of the Aukus deal between the US, UK and Australia, and is aimed at ensuring the US can produce Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines for Australia without undermining its own capability requirements. Another $2bn of funding in the aid package will go towards the foreign military financing program for Taiwan and other security partners in the Indo-Pacific, who the US says are \u201cconfronting Chinese aggression.\u201d According to US officials, the foreign financing program allows eligible partner nations to \u201cpurchase US defense articles, services, and training\u201d. A further $1.9bn will go towards defence related expenses provided to Taiwan and other regional partners, while $542m will specifically strengthen US military capabilities in the region. On Wednesday, China criticised the package, saying that such funding was pushing Taiwan into a \u201cdangerous situation.\u201d Beijing\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office said the aid \u201cseriously violates\u201d US commitments to China and \u201csends a wrong signal to the Taiwan independence separatist forces.\u201d Separately, Taiwan has signed billions in contracts with the US for latest-generation F-16V fighter jets, M1 Abrams main battle tanks and the HIMARS rocket system, which the US has also supplied to Ukraine. The United States is Taiwan\u2019s most important international backer and arms supplier even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly demanded arms sales stop. The Associated Press contributed to this report"

            "title": "Rising unemployment points to worrying signs for UK economy",
            "date": "2024-04-16T11:02:12Z",
            "content": "The government has patted itself on the back in recent years for presiding over a period of low unemployment, but underneath the latest headline figures there are concerning trends. First among the worrying signs is an increase in the number of working age people leaving the labour market because of ill-health, who need to take on caring responsibilities or retire early. In February, the UK economic inactivity rate for those aged 16 to 64 years was 22.2%, which means about 275,000 more people than a year ago. In 2022, there was optimism that a sharp rise in the inactivity rate during the three Covid-19 lockdowns was coming down quickly and normality was being restored to the jobs market. Those who were ill from Covid and its longer-term effects were finding their way back to the workforce and early retirement, which had proved exceptionally popular among the over-55s, was losing its allure. That trend reversed last year, leaving ministers to scratch their heads about the causes. Experts in the employment field were in no doubt that the government\u2019s battle with NHS unions and delays to bringing down waiting lists played a big part. Benefit cuts that have reduced payments to disabled people and a mental health service in crisis have also been factors. Then there is the rise of childcare costs and the increasing price of residential care for older and disabled people that has forced many families to step into the breach, accepting they will work fewer paid hours themselves. Tony Wilson, the director of the Institute for Employment Studies, was one of many to blame the government\u2019s lacklustre efforts to improve mental health support, and slow response to the rise of school leavers not in education, training or work. The number of apprenticeship places for young people is low even as childcare businesses struggle to recruit staff. Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said rising redundancies and falling job levels were signs of a stagnant economy, \u201cwhile rising inactivity and long-term sickness suggest there are wider issues with the health of our workforce\u201d. He said: \u201cTackling rising inactivity \u2013 and its impact on the public finances, the benefits system, and people\u2019s wider health and wellbeing \u2013 is one of the biggest economic challenges facing both this government, and whoever wins the next election.\u201d Ministers can comfort themselves that the immediate bill from a weak labour market is low. The claimant count for March increased by 10,900 on the month and is up by 57,400 on the year to 1.583 million. By this measure, unemployment was considered to be resilient. After all, the number of people signing on for unemployment benefits was relatively small when set against a long period of economic stagnation that culminated in recession in the second half of 2023. However, a fall of 156,000 in the number of people in employment in the last quarter to the end of February on the previous one, gives a clearer sign that all is not well. Add the wider cost to society from lost economic growth, careers forgone by people needing to care for loved ones and growing ill-health, and the situation is worse than it looks at first glance."

            "content": "Matteo Garrone\u2019s new film is part adventure story, part slavery drama; the slavery which did not in fact vanish with the end of the American civil war, but thrives in the globalised present day without needing to shapeshift too much, driven by the age-old forces of geopolitics and the market. Seydou and Moussa, played by nonprofessional acting newcomers Seydou Sarr and Moustapha Fall, are 16-year-old cousins in Dakar, Senegal, dreaming of escape to the fabled land of the EU as refugees, where they expect to go viral and make a fortune as music stars like the people they\u2019re watching on TikTok. For years they have been writing songs and secretly working on building sites while pretending to go to football practice, amassing cash savings which in the succeeding months they will hand over to various gangmasters, fixers and corrupt gun-wielding soldiers. The boys get into Niger on fake Malian passports whose obvious inauthenticity generates a handsome bribe-income for crooked border guards. They pay handsomely to join a group crossing the Sahara to Libya in an unsafe van; they then have to go on foot in the burning sand, their hatchet-faced drivers and guides ignoring the people who fall out of the vehicle or collapse with exhaustion on the way. In Libya the boys are separated, one taken to what passes for official custody, the other to a prison used as a torture factory and cash slave-farm by Libyan warlords. Here, terrified migrants are told to get their parents to wire their entire life savings over if they don\u2019t want their children to be brutalised and killed; this is a truly terrifying sequence. The official and unofficial jails are brought by Garrone into ironic parallel. The boys are ultimately able to offer the tiny residue of their savings to join a crowded boat heading across the Med to Italy. The gangsters chillingly agree on condition that the teenage torture survivor, Seydou, will be the boat\u2019s notional captain \u2013 hence the movie\u2019s title. The gangmaster pretends to \u201ctrain\u201d him on how to navigate and use the GPS and he is then put in charge of all the trusting, terrified adults as they put to sea. This is a movie with passion and sweep, although I was less sure about the fantasy-reverie sequences. Reality is stronger ground. Apart from everything else, Io Capitano delivers some home-truths about the boats used; they are notionally \u201ccaptained\u201d by one of the passengers, a wretched soul who, due to a nauseating twist of fate, may well be even less qualified and less able than everyone else. And the film shows a gruesome irony at work: refugees are part of a toxic hoax economy. The fixers know well that these people will almost certainly die en masse in the desert or the ocean, and will be in no position to ask for refunds or warn anyone else. Garrone shows Seydou battling heroically against this bad faith while growing miraculously into his captain status, despite the existential irony at work. Seydou and the others are not exactly masters of their fate, or captains of their souls, to quote WE Henley\u2019s Invictus. They are swept along by power and inequality, but Garrone shows that their humanity and compassion are still buoyant. \u2022 Io Capitano is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 April."

Not content with inspiring her own branch of economics \u2013 Swiftonomics, FYI \u2013 the singer is also responsible for causing geopolitical tension in south-east Asia, with her record-busting Eras tour. The financial value of a Swift gig is of such national importance that Singapore reportedly paid her up to $3m (\u00a32.4m) a show to ensure it was the only place to host Swift on her jaunt to the region this spring, prompting complaints from Thailand and the Philippines. In the words of one Filipino politician: \u201c[It] isn\u2019t what good neighbours do.\u201d If $3m sounds like an awful lot to secure a concert exclusive, that\u2019s small change when you consider the benefits \u2013 it\u2019s estimated that her six shows have boosted the Singapore economy by $370m.

The real question is where all these stolen phones are going.

Unfortunately, it seems almost impossible for theft victims like myself to see any kind of justice \u2013 within 24 hours of the police looking up the CCTV (or rather, the lack thereof), my case was closed.

            "date": "2024-04-30T11:00:58Z",
            "content": "The eurozone has bounced back from its shallow technical recession after a stronger than expected performance by its \u201cbig four\u201d economies in the first three months of 2024. After two successive quarters of 0.1% contraction in the second half of 2023, the 20 nations that use the single currency posted growth of 0.3% between January and March. Figures from the European Commission\u2019s statistical agency \u2013 Eurostat \u2013 showed the eurozone had put in its best growth performance since the third quarter of 2022. Financial markets had been expecting 0.2% growth. Lower energy prices, falling inflation, rising real wages and the prospect of cuts in interest rates helped to boost activity after a downbeat 2023 in which the eurozone only grew in one quarter. Europe\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 grew by 0.2%, while Italy and Spain posted growth of 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. Germany\u2019s performance in the final three months of 2023 was worse than originally thought: the economy contracted by 0.5% rather than 0.3%. Of the smaller EU economies, the best performing were Ireland, which grew by 1.1% in the first three months of 2024, and Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary, which expanded by 0.8%. Separate Eurostat data showed headline eurozone inflation remained unchanged in April at 2.4%, while core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy and food \u2013 came down from 2.9% to 2.7%. Although the eurozone\u2019s growth performance in the first quarter was stronger than the European Central Bank had been forecasting, analysts said lower inflation paved the way for interest rate cuts in the months ahead. Sam Miley, the managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \u201cThis morning\u2019s confirmation of quarterly growth in the first quarter has put an end to a short-lived recession in the eurozone, with the economy having turned a corner since the beginning of 2024. \u201cProspects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by the expectation of interest rate cuts.\u201d Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWhile the eurozone\u2019s mild recession appears to be over, we think the economy will expand at only a moderate pace over the rest of the year.\u201d Some of the improvement in the first three months of 2024 was due to temporary factors, such as a rebound in construction, while business surveys also pointed to sluggish growth, Kenningham said. UK first quarter growth figures are due out next week, with the financial markets anticipating 0.3% growth and an end to the mild recession recorded in the second half of 2023. Figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals for house purchases rose from 60,500 in February to 61,300 in March, taking them to the highest level since September 2022. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will make its latest decision on interest rates next week, but is expected to leave official borrowing costs unchanged at 5.25%. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2024. An earlier version said that Hungary was in the eurozone instead of in the EU."

            "content": "At the 1985 presidential inauguration ball, a made-for-TV black-tie affair that was something in between a concert and a roast, an expectant Ronald Reagan looked on from the dais for Jimmy Stewart to bring up the next act. \u201cAnd now,\u201d a grizzled George Bailey intoned, \u201cto present the excitement of youth, the sights and the sounds of a big city, here are [the] New York City Breakers.\u201d More than validation for an emerging medium, it was the moment Reagan assumed his final form as America\u2019s god emcee, the cult figure who not only inspired a political movement but also its muscular, musical adversary. \u201cThat\u2019s really where it all began,\u201d says Jesse Washington, the writer-director behind the documentary Hip-Hop and the White House. \u201cDaddy-O said it very plainly: \u2018Reagan gave us something to rap about.\u2019\u201d Hip-Hop and the White House examines how the most pervasive American cultural movement of the past 50 years came to be so closely intertwined with the most powerful office in the land, working from the 70s-era policy decisions that put hip-hop\u2019s Black and brown pioneers on the back foot all the way to plutocrat emcees like Kanye and Jay-Z playing kingmaker in the present day. Through archival footage, much of it long forgotten, Washington\u2019s doc recalls how hip-hop wasn\u2019t really respected as more than rebel entertainment, personified by acts like the New York City Breakers. Before Bill Clinton played the sax on Arsenio, Eazy-E popped up at a $1,250-a-plate members\u2019 only luncheon for George HW Bush after condemning law and order on NWA\u2019s Fuck Tha Police and grabbed headlines. Soon thereafter the political ruling class realized that hip-hop was a useful tool, one that could be used to scare up white votes, through formal protest and policies targeting explicit artists and lyrics and firebrand activists like Sister Soulja, and stir up the scores of young voters who connected with the music. There was more in the doc about hip-hop rallying the youth voter via P Diddy\u2019s popular Vote or Die mass-registration campaign, but recent events would force the production team to reduce the hip-hop impresario to a passing figure in this history. That\u2019s not all that makes this hourlong project such an interesting choice for Disney, which produced the documentary via Andscape \u2013 ESPN\u2019s race and culture platform. For years, the network made a great show of keeping politics out of its journalism, cracking down on select personalities who crossed the line off air. But with changing times has come new management that appears to be perfectly fine giving itself over to political fodder, and no view would appear to be too extreme. In a world where top personality Stephen A Smith goes on Hannity to say Black Americans could relate to Donald Trump \u201cbeing discriminated against\u201d, a straight political documentary from the self-styled worldwide leader in sports isn\u2019t as far-fetched an idea as it would\u2019ve been even four years ago. Hip-Hop in the White House doesn\u2019t push one particular party as much as it shows the ongoing effort to turn partying into policy and the obstacles that inevitably arise. Young Jeezy, the legendary Atlanta rapper who is an executive producer and narrator on the film, had such belief in Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential run that he made a song about him and added it to an album that shipped out some five months before the election. After Obama won and My President became a victory anthem, Jeezy assumed Obama would invite him to the White House to personally thank him for galvanizing support. But Jeezy \u2013 who, like Eazy, was a former narcotics dealer \u2014 failed the drug test that would\u2019ve given him an audience with the first Black president. Instead, Jay-Z became Obama\u2019s top emcee, even though his past is about as checkered. \u201cI think there\u2019s definitely some selective prosecutions here,\u201d Washington says. \u201cJay-Z was the bigger star.\u201d Obama didn\u2019t officially acknowledge Jeezy until the end of his second term, shouting him out at the 2012 correspondents dinner. The two men wouldn\u2019t meet face-to-face for another 10 years. \u201cObama was very strategic about saying, \u2018I can\u2019t be out here just reppin for Black people, and it caused a lot of angst among Black folks,\u201d says Washington, the national writer for race and ethnicity at the Associated Press before helping to launch Andscape (n\u00e9e The Undefeated) in 2016. \u201cI really commend Jeezy though. That\u2019s a hard thing for a superstar to take. For him not only to go through that but to be willing to be vulnerable about it, that\u2019s not something a lot of rappers would do. A lot of rappers would play it off. I think it really sets a powerful example for us as hip-hop, for us as Black men, for how to be honest with ourselves and move forward.\u201d The many experts Washington parades through his film \u2013 the Newark mayor Ras Baraka, rap legend KRS-One (who slams Reagan as \u201cthe father of crack cocaine\u201d), the aforementioned Daddy-O, a sampling pioneer \u2013 appreciate that hip-hop has reached the executive branch, and that it could also do a lot more to effect change in their audiences\u2019 daily lives. No talking head is more cynical than Wocka Flocka Flame, an Atlanta rapper who not only came out for Trump in 2020, but said he was better than Obama. The enraged reaction that greeted his announcement has since given way to young Black men shifting support to Trump because they feel like Obama \u2013 ostensibly, the hip-hop president \u2013 let them down. \u201cHis interview represents the exit polls that showed 20% of Black men had voted for Trump,\u201d Washington says. (In fact, Trump won 12% of the Black male vote in 2020, down from 14% in 2016.) Pivoting to Obama\u2019s underappreciated accomplishments, Washington adds: \u201cHe did a lot with drug sentencing. He granted a lot of people clemency and pardons for a lot of misguided drug prosecutions, some of which were brought about by Clinton. The analogy I like to make is Michael Jordan couldn\u2019t be out here reppin for Black people super hard because the world wasn\u2019t ready for that yet. They had to take that step in order for the next generation to go hard body.\u201d As for where this political influence goes from here, Congresswoman Maxine Waters makes clear that hip-hop has yet to draw on its full power. And with the music industry being more decentralized than ever, artists have unprecedented latitude to make demands and make certain they don\u2019t just trickle down. \u201cHip-hop doesn\u2019t depend on this corporate white power structure any more,\u201d Washington says. \u201cIt can do what it wants to do. What it\u2019s been challenged to do is to effectively organize and partner with people who are experienced in politics and understand how the levers of power work. If you couple that expertise with the vision and the voice of a Jeezy or a Jay-Z or a Roxanne Shant\u00e9, then that is the opportunity that hip-hop has.\u201d Hip-Hop and the White House is now available on Hulu in the US with a UK date to be announced"

If you are in the minority that pauses long enough to realise that the ball costs 5p and the bat \u00a31.05, congratulations, smartypants. If you recognised the question as an exercise in misdirection to expose the foibles of human intuition, you are probably familiar with the work of Daniel Kahneman, psychologist and Nobel laureate, who died last week. Kahneman didn\u2019t invent the bat-and-ball test but he introduced it to a wide audience, along with many other mental tools for illuminating the difference between conclusions reached in sudden leaps and those found by rumination: two modes of cognition that provided the title to his bestselling book Thinking, Fast and Slow.

But our brains have also evolved more sophisticated processes: rational evaluation of probability, abstract reasoning, the self-awareness required to identify unconscious biases and moderate behaviour accordingly. The two modes of thought are not always in conflict, but the slower process takes more effort and is harder to sustain. That makes it vulnerable to being sidelined by urgent instinct. Gut bullies cerebral cortex into bad choices. Those insights form the core of behavioural economics, a field where Kahneman is credited as an intellectual godfather. His legacy might yet be more profound in application to politics. The rivalry between fast and slow thinking in the individual mind is analogous to a tension inherent in democracy. A government\u2019s interest in gratifying short-term electoral demands can trump the strategic judgment required to make policy for the longer term. The loudest call for action is not a reliable guide to what might actually work. But punchy rhetoric that speaks to the gut beats turgid argument, meandering its way to the truth. Recent British politics is not short of case studies. It takes less than a second to grasp the appeal of diverting \u00a3350m from Brussels to the NHS, which is why Vote Leave put that pledge on the side of its referendum campaign bus. It takes a lot longer to explain why the number is false and enumerate benefits of EU membership that are not all quantifiable in cash terms, which is why the remain campaign failed. There is an intuitive click to warnings that immigration drives unsustainable competition for jobs, housing and hospital appointments. Counter-arguments based on the economic stimulus from infusions of imported workers and the health service\u2019s reliance on foreign-born doctors are less snappy. Winning by prodding base human instinct is a method as old as politics. What makes the 21st-century iteration unusual and frightening is the combination with communication technology that accelerates cognition down the fast track of fallacy and bias. It is harder to deploy Kahneman\u2019s slow-thinking corrective when your attention is captured by devices and applications engineered to keep you swiping, clicking and refreshing every few seconds. A platform that profits by selling you balls at 10p has no incentive to let you stop and calculate their real value at half that amount. The impetus for encoding atavistic mindlessness in social media was commercial. But digital infrastructure designed to maximise impulsive consumer behaviour also boosts political messages that satisfy a craving for instant gratification. Online campaigns favour Candy Crush candidates. That would be less of a problem if analogue politics wasn\u2019t so clunky. It isn\u2019t simply a question of archaic procedure (although Westminster hullaballoos when Mr Speaker reinterprets the standing orders hardly woo a mass audience). The deeper challenge relates to the necessity of patience with representative democracy. There are good reasons elections are spaced several years apart: governing is complex; legislation needs scrutiny; policies sometimes hurt before they work. There has to be a buffer between politicians making hard choices and their records being judged. They need the slack to take unpopular decisions that may come good. The ugly, debt-financed trench across green fields needs time to become a railway line serving affordable homes. The system relies on voters accepting frustration as part of the process. A healthy democracy understands attendance at a polling station as an exercise wholly unlike a click-and-collect digital transaction. There is a quantum of reward from participation even if your chosen party is defeated. When that culture gets degraded, politics becomes a rolling clamorous plebiscite. Weak leaders seek favour by dancing to an incoherent mix of tunes amplified by whichever channels they think represent available voters. Strong leaders thrive by manipulating the information space to make narrow ideological agendas look like the expression of popular will. Neither is conducive to government in the collective national interest. British politics feels exceptionally detached from that ethos. A decrepit ruling party palpably craves release from the onerous responsibilities of office. A prime minister appointed for his demeanour of professional sobriety has made himself hostage to a fanatical populist fringe. The opposition, set to win handsomely by default, has no motive to advertise the disappointments it will inflict after gaining power. It all points to an election conducted in a frenzy of fast thinking \u2013 a cacophony of claims and counter-claims to simulate the form of democratic debate while skimming frictionlessly over the substance. Maybe we should just be grateful to live in a country where power can still change hands by operation of a fair and peaceful ballot. But it is not unreasonable to wish the process would sometimes favour arguments that demand pause for thought. It should not be greedy to crave politics that speaks to the head as well as the gut.

            "date": "2024-04-24T06:00:20Z",
            "content": "Good morning. When the story first emerged last Friday, it looked like an uncomplicated example of antisemitism: a man wearing a kippah going for his usual walk in London after synagogue and happening to bump into a pro-Palestine march, being told by a police officer that because he was \u201cquite openly Jewish\u201d, he could not cross the road. Gideon Falter, the man in the video, was threatened with arrest. He called for the resignation of the Met chief, Mark Rowley \u2013 and drew support from former home secretary Suella Braverman, among others. The incident seemed to prove that whenever the marches are happening, Jewish people who feel intimidated can\u2019t even trust the police to be on their side. A video of the incident made front page news \u2013 and it has been viewed more than 3m times. But since then, more information has emerged \u2013 information that does not erase the reality of what the officer said, but does raise complicated questions about other parts of the story, and how it came about. Today\u2019s newsletter, with Alan Finlayson, UEA professor of political theory and expert in protest and political digital culture, is about how the story has evolved \u2013 and what it tells us about how protest and counterprotest operate in a digital era. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Defence | Britain will boost its military spending to 2.5% of national output by the end of the decade, Rishi Sunak said yesterday, as he pledged to put the UK\u2019s arms industry on a \u201cwar footing\u201d in response to global threats. The plan, which will cost an additional \u00a375bn over six years, could mean spending cuts in other areas. Immigration and asylum | Humanitarian groups have called for new safe routes to Britain after five people died trying to cross the Channel within hours of ministers passing the controversial Rwanda bill. A child and four adults drowned on Tuesday after leaving France on a vessel said to be carrying 110 people. Ukraine | The US Senate voted resoundingly on Tuesday to approve $95bn in aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as a bipartisan super-majority united to send the long-stalled package to Joe Biden\u2019s desk for signature. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer called it \u201cone of the greatest achievements the Senate has faced in years\u201d. Middle East | The UN human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, says he is \u201chorrified\u201d by reports of mass graves containing hundreds of bodies at two of Gaza\u2019s largest hospitals. Palestinian civil defence teams began exhuming bodies from a mass grave outside the Nasser hospital complex in Khan Younis last week after Israeli troops withdrew. Wales | Hundreds of Welsh roads where a 20mph speed limit was introduced under a controversial law could be returned to 30mph, as the Labour-led government admitted mistakes had been made over the policy. Transport secretary Ken Skates said the 20mph limit would remain in built-up areas and outside schools but change in rural and semi-urban areas. In depth: \u2018You\u2019re not trying to convert \u2013 you\u2019re trying to intensify the views of those already with you\u2019 When the video was first published, the police put out a statement apologising, but also saying that some counter-protesters coming to the marches were deliberately provocative. Then it retracted that claim of provocation, and issued another apology. The coverage largely focused on the Met\u2019s dithering, and Falter\u2019s warning that the force was \u201cmaking no-go areas for Jews\u201d by its approach to policing the marches. As the picture has become more complicated, nobody has disputed that the officer\u2019s suggestion that being \u201copenly Jewish\u201d was a problem was offensive. But a fuller account has emerged since, prompting reasonable questions over whether Falter told the whole story. *** How the story developed Gideon Falter is chief executive of the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), the organisation that published the initial video \u2013 and while he said that he had merely \u201cmet up with some people to just go on a walkabout\u201d and was \u201cnot there to counter-protest\u201d, some have been sceptical about that account. Falter has made other statements that the protests are creating no-go areas, and had a previous run-in with police over a CAA van displaying images of children kidnapped by Hamas. That recent history might suggest that it is unlikely he came across the march by mistake. A fuller video of the encounter with the police officer, published by Sky News on Monday, gives more context. The initial clip was 55 seconds; the new material runs to 13 minutes. In this analysis, Harriet Sherwood notes that it appears to show one of a group with Falter filming the encounter, with others scanning the crowd. And while Falter claims to simply want to cross the road, he declines when offered an alternative route that would avoid a potential flashpoint. The officer called his purported intention to be merely passing through \u201cdisingenuous\u201d. All of that helps explain why, after the Met initially stayed on the defensive, Commissioner Mark Rowley gave the Guardian\u2019s Vikram Dodd an interview on Monday. Rowley praised the sergeant involved in the incident as \u201cprofessional\u201d, and gave a more general warning about officers at other protests being \u201cset up\u201d. If Falter was there deliberately seeking to highlight his alarm about the marches, \u201cthat is not necessarily an illegitimate political move,\u201d said Alan Finlayson. \u201cThere is a part of our politics which is about looking for ways to dramatise meaningful concerns. So it might feel like it embodies a deeper truth about the situation they are confronting.\u201d But others can also reasonably ask if the story being told gives them enough information to make their own judgement. There have previously been allegations that the CAA has a more directly political approach than its stated mission would suggest. Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who was an honorary patron of the organisation when it took on Jeremy Corbyn over claims of antisemitism in the party, said after Keir Starmer became leader that it had become \u201cmore concerned with undermining Labour than rooting out antisemitism\u201d. In 2015, a report published (PDF) by the the all-party parliamentary group on antisemitism said that the CAA had on some occasions \u201cconflated concerns about activity legitimately protesting Israel\u2019s actions with antisemitism\u201d and did not always act in accordance with the leading advisory body the Community Security Trust\u2019s approach of \u201cseeking to avoid undue panic and alarm\u201d. On Sunday, the CST said that the officer involved in the incident had \u201ctried to do the right thing but ended up making things worse\u201d. It reiterated its own concerns about the protests, but said that in this case, \u201cthe context and detail [had been] lost in the heat of controversy\u201d. *** How tactics like these have evolved In one sense, Finlayson said, \u201cthis kind of political activity is nothing new. But whereas things like that might once have existed to get in a newspaper, now they exist to be filmed. The key thing is to understand that there is no point distinguishing between online and offline activity \u2013 what is useful is producing content that will circulate online. And that\u2019s certainly increased.\u201d Finlayson distinguished various types of protest: \u201cA demonstration can be an embodiment of your argument \u2013 if a climate protest stops traffic, that isn\u2019t going to end the use of cars, but it dramatises the problem. That\u2019s a bit different from throwing soup at a painting, which just seems like a way to get publicity. And then there\u2019s engendering a situation which you can say is evidence for your argument, and that\u2019s different again. Equally, you might say that if you can get a racist person to say something racist, you\u2019ve genuinely proven a point. The line won\u2019t always be clear.\u201d From there, he said, \u201cit\u2019s only a short step to going to something with a camera and hoping for trouble. You see it all the time.\u201d He pointed to far-right protests over library readings by drag queens in the last few years, which typically draw 20 or 30 people but are put out as evidence of a larger public mood. Similarly, adherents to the \u201csovereign citizen\u201d conspiracy theory, which rejects any legal or governmental authority over the individual, seek out disputes with the police by refusing to display number plates or attempting to arrest them. Rowley mentioned his frustration at an incident in which a Met officer unknowingly had a \u201cBoycott Israel Apartheid\u201d sticker put on him at a Gaza rally, prompting one critic to say that he \u201cshould have been aware of the sticker being placed on him and acted immediately\u201d. There\u2019s an important distinction to be drawn between these kind of misleading accounts of real events, and fake videos that frequently circulate claiming that old footage is part of a recent flashpoint. But the media is much better at taking a critical view of the second category than the first. \u201cThe media doesn\u2019t necessarily understand that the material is not produced with them in mind, and it doesn\u2019t adapt to that reality very well,\u201d Finlayson said. \u201cDisinformation travels fast, and the response is slower. This stuff is produced with TikTok or Telegram in mind \u2013 unlike a news story, it doesn\u2019t have to be converted to work there. And in this case, I wouldn\u2019t say it was confirmation bias \u2013 but I would say that it fitted into one of the stories that is currently being told, so it is intelligible to the audience.\u201d *** The rise of the \u2018ideological entrepreneur\u2019 In an essay published last year (PDF), Finlayson explained the idea of \u201cideological entrepreneurs\u201d: those who \u201cdo not need \u2013 and make a virtue of lacking \u2013 the imprimatur of the academic, journalistic or political professions \u2026 [who] are not constrained by institutional or ethical rules or interests. Instead, they are governed by the economic and celebrity logics that drive social media.\u201d While that is a more obvious phenomenon on the right at the moment \u2013 Tommy Robinson, Laurence Fox and Katie Hopkins are just a few examples \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s largely because they\u2019re more effective at it than the left and liberals, although they\u2019re catching up\u201d, Finlayson said. \u201cThey are promoting a political position, and it\u2019s making them an income, but it\u2019s not just a grift \u2013 it\u2019s a way of promoting yourself and therefore your movement and cause.\u201d Crucially, this kind of approach has very little to say to those who disagree \u2013 and that suggests that even when the story changes, opinions may not. \u201cThe way this kind of communication works is to cultivate an existing audience,\u201d Finlayson said. \u201cYou\u2019re not trying to produce material that makes an argument to the unconverted \u2013 you\u2019re trying to intensify the views of those who are already with you.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Imprisonment for public protection sentences condemned those who received them to a potentially unlimited period in jail for relatively minor offences. They were abolished in 2012 \u2013 but there are still 2,852 people serving them, and 90 have taken their own lives. One of those was Tommy Nicol (above). Simon Hattenstone\u2019s piece about Nicol, whose crime was to steal a car, is a devastating indictment of a grotesque injustice. Archie E Alex Jung\u2019s New York magazine interview with the ultimate \u201cDebate Me Bro\u201d Mehdi Hasan provides an insight into how the Guardian columnist approached his combative MSNBC interviews \u2013 and how his show was cancelled. Nimo Sandra Laville spoke with Trudi Warner, a 69-year-old climate activist, about her battle with against the UK government which tried prosecute her for contempt of court for her lone, silent protest. Nimo I hate fish, and the thought of Tim Dowling\u2019s duty in recreating six classic beef dishes with seafood (health reasons, apparently) makes me want to retch. Luckily, the piece is entertaining enough to make up for it. Trout lasagne!

Nimo Sport Premier League | Arsenal hammered a dire Chelsea side 5-0, with a goal from Leandro Trossard and two each for Ben White and Kai Havertz (above), to go three points clear at the top of the table. The result is Arsenal\u2019s biggest ever victory over their London rivals. Premier League | Liverpool are interested in appointing Feyenoord\u2019s Arne Slot as their new manager this summer. Liverpool could face competition from Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Milan for Slot, who has enjoyed consistent success with Feyenoord since replacing Dick Advocaat in 2021. Tennis | Novak Djokovic has suggested that he may not replace former coach Goran Ivanisevic, and instead choose to navigate this late stage of his career himself. Djokovic split with Ivanisevic late last month and has been undergoing a trial period with Serbia\u2019s former Davis Cup captain Nenad Zimonji\u0107.

Putting aside how accurate this story is, it highlights how much of a central pillar coffee is to life in Ethiopia. In Kafa, brewing coffee has become embedded in the rhythm of the day. One local resident, Hagre Bekele, starts by roasting the raw green beans over an open fire., before grinding and brewing them in a clay pot. The whole process takes about an hour, so Bekele shares brewing duties with her neighbours so they can all get their caffeine fix throughout the day. It is a system they have had in place for decades and that is mirrored in millions of homes across the country. Drinking coffee has become ingrained in the social fabric of Ethiopia: it is where people come together, discuss news, plans for the working day and share gossip: \u201cIt is impossible for us to live without coffee,\u201d says Hagre. \u201cIt is as important as food for us.

            "date": "2024-04-17T11:37:24Z",
            "content": "One of my favourite jokes in The Simpsons concerns the unhinged nature of US political advertising. \u201cMayor Quimby supports revolving-door prisons,\u201d a growly voice narrates over footage of exactly what you imagine. \u201cMayor Quimby even released Sideshow Bob, a man twice convicted of attempted murder.\u201d And then, a final disclosure at a noticeably faster pace: \u201cVote Sideshow Bob for Mayor.\u201d This was a great joke \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t entirely a joke. The real revolving door ad, which featured similar imagery, had been used by the George HW Bush campaign to tar his 1988 opponent, Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, as soft on crime. That in turn was a sort of sequel to the \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad, in which other Republican operatives had tried to pin the violent crimes of the eponymous African American on Dukakis, governor when Horton was released on furlough. The entire campaign was widely condemned as one long racist dog-whistle intended to terrify white people into voting Republican. It also, upsettingly, worked. If we ever believed British politics was above such tactics, then the past few years, of Brexit and everything that\u2019s followed, has surely dissuaded us of the notion. The real thing that\u2019s protected us from attack ads when we\u2019re trying to watch Corrie is, instead, the Television Act 1954 (\u201cno advertisement shall be permitted which is directed towards any religious or political end\u201d), leavened with just a pinch of our much tougher libel laws. It isn\u2019t culture or moral fibre that\u2019s historically given British political campaigns a different tone to American ones. It\u2019s regulation. Now, though, a number of factors are conspiring to bring this halcyon age to an end. One is that the ad-free subscription model used by the streamers has started to wobble: on certain platforms, the ads are creeping back in. The 1954 act was also designed for a world of broadcast TV, not one where you\u2019re just as likely to encounter ads on streaming or social media: the latter were not included in the ban, on the not unreasonable grounds that, in 1954, they didn\u2019t exist. Even the last law to amend the rules in this area, the Communications Act 2003, dates, hilariously, from seven months before the birth of Facebook. Another issue is the government\u2019s decision to raise the amount political parties can spend nationally during a general election campaign, from \u00a319.5m in 2019 to \u00a335m next time. Much of this increase is inflationary \u2013 the cap has not been raised in some time \u2013 but it nonetheless means the two biggest parties, at least, will likely have huge war chests. They\u2019ll probably spend much of those on video ads, which are cheaper and easier to make than ever and also, thanks to the internet, much easier to distribute. Put all that together, and the result is a world in which the parties are poised to invest unusually heavily in video ads, and streamers and social media platforms are poised to take their money. This newspaper reported that even ITV was considering running political ads on its streaming platform, ITVX. If it didn\u2019t, someone else probably would. The prospect of an AI-powered Rishi Sunak popping up to address billpayers by name in the middle of Love Island surely can\u2019t be far away. In retrospect, the parties have been limbering up for this for some time. In 2019, the Tories used YouTube to publish a baffling 72-minute animation of Boris Johnson apparently reading some notes on a train, all set to chill out music (\u201clo fi boriswave beats to relax/get brexit done to\u201d). More recently, the party has used X to publish ads claiming to highlight the state of Labour-run hellholes such as London and Birmingham, and which, complete with growly American voiceover, owe a direct debt to the 1988 Bush campaign. On Tuesday, Labour published horror-film style footage of Liz Truss telling the British electorate that she had \u201cunfinished business\u201d. And the only thing standing between us and footage of Ed Davey doing something embarrassing in front of a giant, misleading bar chart is the fact the Lib Dems are unlikely to have the budget. Politicians should be careful what they pump into our homes, however. Those recent Tory ads may have done more damage to the party that produced them than Labour. And one factor in the almost complete destruction of the Canadian Tories in the now infamous election of 1993 was their own attack ad, which showed a picture of the partially facially paralysed Liberal leader Jean Chr\u00e9tien and posed the question, \u201cIs this a prime minister?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true that I speak on one side of my mouth,\u201d Chr\u00e9tien responded. \u201cI\u2019m not a Tory: I don\u2019t speak on both sides of my mouth.\u201d Before embracing attack ads, the parties should remember that they don\u2019t always hit their target.

            "date": "2024-04-10T02:41:23Z",
            "content": "The US is considering military projects across the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) as it pushes ahead with plans for a $400m airport upgrade in the country to boost defence capabilities in the Pacific, President Wesley Simina said. The region is of growing strategic importance to the US amid a battle for influence with China. FSM has been identified as a key part of the US Indo-Pacific strategy aimed at countering Beijing in the region. An agreement between the US and FSM, known as the Compact of Free Association (Cofa), gives FSM funding and support, while the US gains exclusive defence rights to the Pacific nation. \u201cThe Federated States of Micronesia is open for US consideration for any kind of defense-related activities, including use of our lands and oceans,\u201d Simina said. The airport upgrade is on the island of Yap, one of four states that form the FSM. Washington\u2019s plans were made public in budget proposals released last month. Speaking to the Guardian as part of a series of interviews with Pacific leaders, Simina said the US was also looking at the states of Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae for \u201cother kinds of projects\u201d. \u201cBut so far, those are yet to be disclosed,\u201d he said. Simina said the US was \u201cwell advanced into its planning in the use of [the] airport area\u201d on Yap and would also conduct more military exercises from the island. \u201cWe know they want to expand it. They want to install different infrastructure there to help support their military activities in Japan,\u201d he said. Katherine Koenig, spokesperson for the Joint Region Marianas mission, which manages US military operations in parts of the Pacific, said the proposed budget for the 2025 fiscal year includes $400m for the development of Yap\u2019s airport and seaport. \u201cThe project will include an extension of the runway to accommodate larger aircraft to land and take off in support of training operation and humanitarian mission at the Yap airport,\u201d Koenig said. If approved by Congress, an initial amount of $96m is proposed to be invested in 2025, she said. Other US military sites in the Pacific include naval, air force and marine bases in Guam, as well as an army base in the Marshall Islands. In its budget proposal, the US air force said FSM and Yap were \u201cstrategically located\u201d in the western Pacific. \u201cDevelopment of Yap Airport is essential because there are very few divert or contingency airfields available as potential United States defense sites in the region,\u201d the US air force said. Michael Walsh, affiliate researcher at the Center for Australian, New Zealand and Pacific Studies, said the US was seeking to expand airbases in the region to add \u201ccomplexity\u201d to its operations. \u201cIt is hoped that this increased complexity will make it far more difficult for adversaries to be able to accurately predict the ways the United States military will respond in the event of [any military challenges],\u201d he said, using examples of an attack on the US or in the defence of Taiwan. Yap, which is about 24km long, will also be part of increased US military exercises in the Pacific region. Training opportunities were discussed during a meeting between Simina and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin in Washington in March. Austin said they discussed \u201cnew opportunities for defence posture cooperation between our two countries\u201d. Simina said he was working with the US defence and air force departments on the details of the exercises. \u201cAs of now, we\u2019re not aware of any specific number of exercises to be done in Yap each year or each month,\u201d Simina said. In August 2023, the Micronesian government disclosed US air force plans to deploy \u201cair defence assets\u201d to Yap. However, details have not been made public. \u201cThe US will have to notify us [about any defence assets],\u201d Simina said. The economic provisions of the Cofa agreements were recently renewed, and the FSM is set to receive $140m each year for the next 20 years from the US. The residents of Yap \u201chave been very receptive and supportive\u201d of the defence developments, Simina said. \u201cObviously, there might be some concerns here and there, especially on the environmental side. But the US department of Defense is very much aware of that.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-04-08T21:53:59Z",
            "content": "Ecuador\u2019s former vice-president Jorge Glas has reportedly been taken to hospital from the maximum security jail where he was being held \u2013 three days after the politician was captured inside Mexico\u2019s embassy in Quito during a police raid that drew outrage across Latin America. Glas, 54, was sent to the Alcatraz-inspired prison La Roca (the Rock) in Guayaquil on Saturday, one day after being detained by Ecuadorian security forces inside the Mexican mission where he had sought asylum. Ecuador\u2019s highly controversial decision to arrest Glas, which was condemned from Bras\u00edlia to Brussels, was widely seen as a flagrant violation of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations under which embassy premises are considered \u201cinviolable\u201d. In another dramatic development, reports in the Ecuadorian media on Monday afternoon said Glas had been taken from La Roca to a nearby naval hospital in an ambulance. It was not immediately clear why the former vice-president \u2013 who had been twice convicted of corruption and was considered a fugitive by Ecuadorian authorities \u2013 had been taken to hospital. Several local newspapers reported that the politician had suffered drug intoxication, although it was not immediately possible to verify the claims. In a statement, Glas\u2019s lawyer, Andr\u00e9s Villegas Pico, said he had been told by the prison warden that his client had been found \u201cunawakened\u201d in his cell at 8.30am. \u201cSecurity personnel claimed Glas had not wanted to eat food for the whole of Sunday \u2026 it is assumed he took an overdose of medication in order to sleep,\u201d Villegas added. His lawyer said he had \u201cno further details of what happened, of his medical progress, or a clear diagnosis\u201d, adding: \u201cHis life is in danger.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s prison authority claimed that, after refusing prison food for 24 hours, Glas had suffered a \u201cpossible imbalance\u201d and been taken to hospital by paramedics. His condition was stable and he would remain under observation, it said on Monday afternoon. As news of his admission to hospital spread, the exiled former leftist president Rafael Correa, under whom Glas served from 2013 to 2017, tweeted: \u201cThis was what I feared. The scoundrels will jump for joy. Hang in there, Jorge!\u201d The decision by Ecuador\u2019s incumbent conservative president, Daniel Noboa, to order the Friday night raid on Mexico\u2019s embassy, which was painted as part of his nascent \u201cwar on crime\u201d, prompted a torrent of criticism from across the political spectrum in Latin America. \u201cIt was an authoritarian act \u2026 not even the fearful [Chilean dictator Augusto] Pinochet and others had been so bold,\u201d the Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, told reporters on Monday. European governments also condemned Ecuador\u2019s move. \u201cAll governments must respect the inviolability of diplomatic missions,\u201d the UK\u2019s Foreign Office said on Sunday. \u201cThe safety and security of diplomatic premises and staff is a fundamental principle guiding diplomatic relations.\u201d Noboa issued a statement on Monday afternoon in which he sought to justify his actions to the international community. The 36-year-old politician claimed he had \u201ctaken exceptional decisions in order to protect national security, the rule of law and the dignity of a people who will not tolerate any kind of impunity for criminals, crooks, corrupt people or narco-terrorists\u201d. \u201cEcuador is a country of peace and justice, which respects all nations and international law,\u201d the president said."

            "title": "Columbia president assailed at highly charged antisemitism Congress hearing",
            "date": "2024-04-17T19:45:22Z",
            "content": "The head of a prestigious US university clashed with members of Congress on Wednesday in highly charged hearings over a reported upsurge in antisemitism on campus in the wake of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Minouche Shafik, the president of Columbia University, appeared beleaguered and uncertain as one Congress member after another assailed her over her institution\u2019s supposed inaction to stop it becoming what one called \u201ca hotbed of antisemitism and hatred\u201d. Wednesday\u2019s hearing follows months of rising tensions between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrators on the Columbia campus, amid disputes over what constitutes antisemitism and controversy about whether it should encompass anti-Zionism and opposition to Israel as a Jewish state. The hearing of the House of Representatives\u2019 education and workforce committee is being staged under the emotive title of \u201cColumbia in Crisis: Columbia University\u2019s Response to Anti-Semitism\u201d. A group of Jewish academics at the university denounced the hearing in advance as heralding \u201ca new McCarthyism\u201d. At the hearing Shafik was repeatedly asked to explain the continued presence of one faculty member, Joseph Massad, after he had reportedly praised Hamas\u2019s attack last October that left nearly 1,200 Israelis dead. In one particularly aggressive line of questioning, Elise Stefanik, a Republican representative from New York, pushed Shafik to commit to removing Massad as chair of an academic review committee. Stefanik also pressed a harried Shafik, who became Columbia\u2019s president last July, into changing her testimony after she earlier told the Democratic representative Ilhan Omar that she was not aware of any anti-Jewish demonstrations at the university. Pressing relentlessly, Stefanik effectively drove a wedge between Shafik and her three fellow senior Columbia colleagues, David Schizer, Claire Shipman and David Greenwald \u2013 all members of the university\u2019s antisemitism taskforce \u2013 by leading them to testify that there had in fact been aggressive and threatening antisemitic statements in campus demonstrations. Earlier, Shafik \u2013 trying to straddle between condemning antisemitism and permitting statements that some defined as free speech \u2013 struggled when confronted by Lisa McClain, the Republican representative from Michigan over the slogan \u201cfrom the river to the sea\u201d and support for a Palestinian intifada (uprising). \u201cAre mobs shouting from the River to the Sea Palestine will be free or long live the infitada [sic] \u2026antisemitic comments?\u201d McClain asked. \u201cWhen I hear those terms, I find them very upsetting,\u201d Shafik responded. \u201cThat\u2019s a great answer to a question I didn\u2019t ask, so let me repeat the question,\u201d McClain persisted. Shafik answered: \u201cI hear them as such. Some people don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWhy is it so tough?\u201d McClain pressed. In answer, Shafik said: \u201cBecause it\u2019s a difficult issue because some hear it as antisemitic, others do not.\u201d She eventually appeared to fold under pressure, answering \u201cyes\u201d and laughing nervously after McClain posed the same question to the president\u2019s fellow Columbia staff, all of whom agreed that it was antisemitic. The hearing was something of a reprise of the committee\u2019s previous cross-examination of the heads of three other elite universities, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, last December. That hearing led to the resignation of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s president, Elizabeth Magill, after she gave what were deemed to be over-legalistic answers to pointed questions from Stefanik over whether her institution\u2019s rules on free speech permitted slogans that supporters of Israel interpret as calling for genocide. It also intensified the pressure on Harvard\u2019s then president, Claudine Gay, whose responses to Stefanik were similarly criticised. Gay survived the immediate outcry over the hearing but stepped down weeks later over plagiarism allegations. Columbia has set up a taskforce on antisemitism but its members have declined to establish a firm definition. Rightwingers have painted the university as a hotbed of antisemitism, while opponents have accused the institution\u2019s authorities of disproportionately punishing pro-Palestinian students who criticise Israel. The university last year suspended two groups, Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, over their protest activities. Shafik \u2013 an Egyptian-born, British-American economist and former deputy governor of the Bank of England \u2013 had reportedly prepared assiduously for Wednesday\u2019s event in an effort to avoid the pitfalls of her fellow university heads. Writing in the Wall Street Journal on the eve of the hearing, Shafik said legitimate expression should occur \u201cwithin specific parameters\u201d. \u201cMost of the people protesting do so from a place of genuine political disagreement, not from personal hatred or bias or support for terrorism,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTheir passion, as long as it doesn\u2019t cross the line into threats, discrimination or harassment, should be protected speech on our campus. \u201cCalling for the genocide of a people \u2013 whether they are Israelis or Palestinians, Jews, Muslims or anyone else \u2013 has no place in a university community. Such words are outside the bounds of legitimate debate and unimaginably harmful,\u201d the op-ed continued. Her remarks appeared aimed at avoiding the criticism drawn by Magill and Gay over their appearance before the committee, when both responded to Stefanik\u2019s questions about theoretical calls for genocide by referring to context. In an effort to bolster Shafik, 23 Jewish faculty members wrote an open letter published in the campus newspaper, the Columbia Spectator, criticising the premise of the hearing. \u201cBased on the committee\u2019s previous hearings, we are gravely concerned about the false narratives that frame these proceedings to entrap witnesses,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe urge you, as the university president, to defend our shared commitment to universities as sites of learning, critical thinking, and knowledge production against this new McCarthyism.\u201d The academics also questioned the credentials of Stefanik \u2013 an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump \u2013 on antisemitism, saying she had a history of \u201cespousing white nationalist policies\u201d. As Shafik and her colleagues testified, the unrest that has characterized university life over the past six months was on display on Columbia\u2019s campus, where students set up approximately 60 tents on the campus\u2019s south lawn in the early hours of Wednesday. The tents, many of which were covered in signs that read \u201cLiberated Zone\u201d and \u201cIsrael bombs, Columbia pays\u201d, were set up to urge the university to divest its ties from Israel. The university perimeters were lined with metal barricades and a heavy police presence, and the campus, which is usually accessible to the public, was restricted to Columbia ID holders. Members of the media were prohibited from entering the university, instead restricted to a barricaded pen near a bus stop outside the campus as student chants could be heard from inside the grounds. \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, we don\u2019t want no Zionists here,\u201d some students chanted, according to the Columbia Spectator. A handful of protesters also crowded around the university\u2019s main gates, with many shouting: \u201cWe say no to genocide!\u201d At least 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s latest war against Hamas following its 7 October attack. This article was amended on 17 April 2024 to correctly identify the school where Elizabeth Magill resigned as president last year. The school was the University of Pennsylvania, not Pennsylvania University."

            "date": "2024-04-02T18:12:31Z",
            "content": "Peru\u2019s first female president, Dina Boluarte, is embroiled in a scandal over her alleged possession of a collection of Rolex watches and luxury jewellery that has put her at the centre of a corruption investigation. The unpopular leader shook up her cabinet on Monday, swearing in six new ministers, after a rash of resignations following reports that she owned jewellery worth \u00a3400,000 ($502,700) despite earning a monthly presidential salary of around \u00a33,320. The \u201cRolexgate\u201d scandal continues to engulf Boluarte\u2019s government days after police rammed open the front door of her residence in Lima on Friday in search of the watches \u2013 the first time in Peru\u2019s history that the police have forcibly entered the home of a sitting president. After launching an investigation last month, prosecutors ordered the raid after Boluarte said she was too busy to attend a hearing last week. She had failed to declare the origin of three watches from the high-end brand, including one worth \u00a311,150, as well as other items such as a \u00a343,000 Cartier bracelet. Boluarte claimed on Saturday she was the victim of a plot and, in a televised address flanked by ministers, denied she was \u201ccorrupt or a thief\u201d. The scandal began when La Encerrona, a popular Peruvian news podcast, analysed 10,000 images from the presidential Flickr account, revealing Boluarte\u2019s undisclosed collection of luxury watches and jewellery. Boluarte is far from being the first Peruvian president to be accused of corruption but the allegations have done nothing to improve the reputation of a leader accused of presiding over the killings of nearly 50 people by security forces during widespread protests over the ousting of her predecessor Pedro Castillo in 2022. When she took office, the former vice-president vowed to fight corruption and stand up for the rural poor, but \u2013 largely due to after what Amnesty International called \u201cexcessive and lethal use of force\u201d against anti-government protesters \u2013 her approval rating barely reaches double figures. Boluarte, 61, a mid-level civil servant before she became Castillo\u2019s running mate, claimed that the watches and other jewellery were the fruit of a lifetime of work. But such claims were upended during the raid on her home when police discovered a guarantee for one of the luxury watches dated July 2023. \u201cThis is not a surprise for Peruvians,\u201d said Alvaro Henzler, president of Transparencia Per\u00fa, an anti-corruption NGO. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if she is corrupt, or not. But we know she is not telling the truth.\u201d \u201cToday, we are at the lowest point of approval for the president and congress in the last 30 years,\u201d he said, which he called a sign of the \u201cslow death of democracy\u201d. Only 14% of Peruvians believe their country is on the right track with 86% saying it is headed in the wrong direction, the highest level of disapproval in a poll of 29 countries by Ipsos. On Monday, lawmakers from Boluarte\u2019s former party signed a petition to remove her from office for \u201cpermanent moral incapacity\u201d, a constitutional technicality that has been used to force the resignation of one president and remove two other presidents in the past six years as Peru remains trapped a prolonged political crisis. But analysts believe Boluarte\u2019s pact with rightwing political blocs means she will likely see out her term until 2026. The balance of power is skewed, said Natalia Sobrevilla, a historian and political analyst. \u201cCongress can get rid of the president at will, once they have the votes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want to impeach her because they don\u2019t want to lose their posts.\u201d Henzler said this latest scandal has implications that go beyond Boluarte\u2019s political fortunes, increasing the risk that \u201cin the next election, Peruvians elect a candidate who is more populist, more extremist and more authoritarian\u201d."

            "title": "For the future of US abortion rights under a second Trump presidency, look to Arizona | Margaret Sullivan",
            "date": "2024-04-11T10:01:28Z",
            "content": "Sometimes, in 2024 America, you have to pinch yourself to make sure you\u2019re not in a long-running dystopian nightmare. Then again, maybe we all are. And no amount of pinching will help. Two scenes from this week stand out. One, thoroughly bizarre, was on the floor of the Arizona senate, where \u2013 led by a Republican state senator, Anthony Kern - a fundamentalist Christian prayer group \u201cspoke in tongues\u201d as they knelt together over the state seal, praying for a civil war-era abortion ban to become law again. Kern and the group got their wish; a day later, the Arizona supreme court ruled to allow the law to go into effect. Kern, naturally, is one of those under investigation for falsely claiming to be an Arizona elector as Donald Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election. He also got an Arizona bill passed allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted and read out loud in the state\u2019s public school classrooms. If you had any lofty notions about the separation of church and state, consider them laid to rest. The other memorable scene was on the Larry Kudlow Show on the Fox Business channel, as three middle-aged white guys kicked around the aforementioned ruling by the Arizona supreme court. That 4-2 decision reinvigorates a 160-year-old law that says virtually all abortions are felonies. On the broadcast, radio host Mark Simone was blithe. \u201cBuying a bus ticket to go somewhere to get it is not the worst thing in the world,\u201d Simone \u2013 someone who will never be in that situation and apparently lacks the empathy to imagine it \u2013 opined. The bus-ticket solution might not even be an option. If Donald Trump is elected again, a national abortion ban is far from unlikely. Just a day before the Arizona ruling, the former US president came out with his long-promised, supposedly new stance on abortion rights, trying to spin up a moderate position. Declining to address whether he would support a national ban, he merely bragged about his role in the demise of Roe v Wade and suggested that abortion rights would now be up to the states, skipping over the obvious reality that they already are. He also blatantly lied about various things, like how Democrats think it\u2019s fine to execute babies and how the entire spectrum of legal experts agreed that Roe should be overturned. Too many in the mainstream media swallowed this whole, at least in all-important headlines, presenting Trump\u2019s position not only as news but as a politically savvy move toward the center. But something more like the truth was available if you turned your gaze from Washington to Arizona, where, in a matter of days, abortion providers can be sentenced to multiple years in prison for providing medical care. Some saw the meaning clearly. \u201cThis decision should serve as a warning for the rest of the country,\u201d wrote lawyers Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern on Slate. \u201cIn the hands of a far-right court, a dead, openly misogynistic, wildly unpopular abortion ban can spring back to life with a vengeance.\u201d How it all will play out is unclear. Since Roe was overturned, voters have expressed their displeasure. Pro-choice measures have carried the day in state after state, including some bright-red ones like Kentucky and Kansas. Next up is Florida, where voters will decide in November whether to override a six-week abortion ban with one that allows access until 24 weeks. Americans in the rightwing media bubble may not hear much about the Arizona ruling. Fox News gave it a mere 12 minutes on Tuesday (as opposed to two hours across eight shows on CNN), according to Media Matters research, and none of Fox\u2019s big-name opinion hosts addressed it on their evening shows. Apparently, the highest priority is getting the cult leader elected again. The draconian decision in Arizona has the potential to deliver at least one swing state \u2013 maybe more \u2013 to Joe Biden. As my colleague at Columbia Journalism School, professor Bill Grueskin, quipped Tuesday: \u201cIt\u2019s not too early for the Fox News decision desk to call Arizona for Biden.\u201d (Fox famously made that controversial \u2013 though accurate \u2013 call on election night 2020, much to team Trump\u2019s angry displeasure.) Contradictions abound. Trump, having unleashed the dogs on longstanding abortion rights with his supreme court appointments, is simultaneously taking credit for that, and denying that it could go any further. The rightwing media protects him; the mainstream media lets him portray his position as moderate and somehow consistent with the public\u2019s preferences. As for non-politicians, particularly women of child-bearing age, the reality could get much, much worse. It\u2019s a mess. But that\u2019s life in our national nightmare. Let\u2019s hope enough Americans wake up by November to reverse some of the damage. Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture"
