            "content": "The US supreme court, in a 5-4 decision, used the ruse that it was too close to an election \u2013 three months away \u2013 to scrap a racially discriminatory, Republican-drawn legislative map in Alabama. A lower court had previously ruled against the state because its gerrymandered congressional districts diluted the voting strength of African Americans by ensuring that 27% of Alabama\u2019s population would garner only 14% of the state\u2019s congressional representation. But that reality didn\u2019t faze five justices; the US supreme court was just fine with letting a policy designed to disfranchise Black voters unfurl and do its damage in an oncoming federal election. The echoes of a brutal past are resonating in this decision. After the civil war, Congress passed the 1867 Reconstruction Act, which provided that Black men had the right to vote, and then Congress followed that with the 15th amendment, which banned states from using race, color or previous conditions of servitude to undermine the right to vote. In a series of decisions in the late 19th and early to mid-20th centuries, however, the supreme court systematically dismantled those protections, as well as others crafted to support African Americans\u2019 citizenship rights and defend against white domestic terrorism waged by the Ku Klux Klan and similar organizations. Focusing on voting rights gives some indication of how pernicious the decisions were. The 1874 Minor v Happersett ruling asserted that the right to vote was not part and parcel of American citizenship. In 1876, United States v Reese et al dealt with a Black man who was trapped in a malicious catch-22 that prevented him from voting. He tried to pay his poll tax, which was required to vote, but the tax collector refused to accept the payment and the registrars would not allow him to cast a ballot without payment. The court ruled, despite this crude and brazen denial of his right to vote, that the 15th amendment \u201cdoes not confer the right of suffrage upon any one\u201d. As states then began fully implementing Jim Crow legislation to disfranchise African Americans, the court, in the Williams v Mississippi (1898) decision, looked at the poll tax and the literacy test and ruled that those chokepoints to the ballot box \u2013 which had already removed 90% of registered Black voters in Mississippi from the rolls \u2013 did not violate the 15th amendment. In a 1903 case out of Alabama, Giles v Harris, the supreme court determined that it was powerless to stop a state from disfranchising Black voters even if the methods were unconstitutional. This assault on African Americans\u2019 right to vote was an assault on American democracy aided and abetted by the highest court in the land. The results were devastating. By 1960, there were counties in Alabama that had no Black voters registered, while simultaneously having more than 100% of white age-eligible voters on the rolls. In Mississippi a mere 6.7% of eligible Black adults were registered to vote. It took the blood, the courage and the martyrdom of civil rights workers combined with the political spine of a president and congressional leaders to break this stranglehold on the right to vote. The legislature passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act (VRA), which would save America from its worst self. And, this time, in the late 1960s, the US supreme court came down on the side of democracy and the 15th amendment. Two crucial decisions buttressed the VRA, noting that it was not only constitutional but also created to deal with \u201cthe subtle, as well as the obvious, state regulations which have the effect of denying citizens their right to vote because of race\u201d. The Roberts court, however, bears no resemblance to the one in the 1960s and has all the anti-voting rights earmarks of the court after the civil war. The Roberts court\u2019s assault on the VRA and the 15th amendment has been relentless and brutal to American democracy. The Shelby County v Holder (2013) decision ended the most powerful tool in the VRA\u2019s wheelhouse, pre-clearance, and allowed states and jurisdictions with a demonstrated history of racial discrimination to implement laws and election policies without the prior approval of the US Department of Justice or the federal court in Washington DC. Within two hours of that decision, Texas implemented a voter ID law that led district court Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos to rule that the new measure not only had a discriminatory effect, it also had a discriminatory intent. The state appealed to the fifth circuit, pleading with the judges to not dismantle the voter ID law because it would be too disruptive to the looming midterm election in 2014. When the case reached the US supreme court, Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s majority ruled in favor of Texas without comment. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s dissent, however, tore away at the state\u2019s ruse that it was too close to the midterms to stop a racially discriminatory law in its tracks. The greatest threat to confidence in elections, she wrote, was to allow a \u201cpurposefully discriminatory law, one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters\u201d to be used in a federal election. But the majority on the US supreme court was fine with letting discrimination run wild in the election system. That has been abundantly clear in a number of voting rights cases that have come before the Roberts court since the Shelby County v Holder decision. Each one, whether massive voter roll purges in violation of the National Voter Registration Act, extreme partisan gerrymandered districts, or election laws that have a disparate impact on minorities, has been approved, either by acts of commission or omission, by the US supreme court. There are consequences. The very legitimacy of the court is at stake. Right now it\u2019s as precariously perched as the right to vote and American democracy. Unfortunately, the Roberts court has played a major, horrific role in this preventable disaster.

            "title": "Boris Johnson appoints combative election strategist David Canzini ",
            "date": "2022-02-27T14:09:53Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson has appointed the combative election strategist David Canzini as part of his attempts to restore his battered reputation amid new claims that Downing Street lockdown parties regularly descended into \u201ccarnage\u201d. Canzini, a key ally of the political strategist Lynton Crosby, is due to start work in Downing Street on Monday. The pair worked for the former prime minister Theresa May before turning on her in 2018 His new role as deputy chief of staff is expected to involve winning over disgruntled backbenchers and coming up with an election-winning strategy. Tory MPs have been encouraged by Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the Ukraine crisis, but more are expected to submit letters of no confidence in the prime minister if he is served with a penalty notice as part of the police investigation into lockdown parties. The Sunday Times reports that one party on 18 December 2020 became so raucous that red wine was sprayed on the walls of rooms in Downing Street. Staffers were also reported to have been photographed sitting on each others laps, at the event. The paper said one source alleged that drinks events often ended in \u201ccarnage\u201d. Canzini has been linked for weeks with a formal role in Johnson\u2019s revamped team, but it was reported last month that he was insisting on a clearout of Downing Street in the wake of the \u201cpartygate\u201d scandal before taking up any new job. Canzini will be deputy to the new chief of staff, Steve Barclay, who replaced Dan Rosenfield after his resignation over partygate. He will work alongside two other deputy chiefs of staff: Simone Finn and Ben Gascoigne. Canzini\u2019s appointment comes after the confirmation that two more senior Downing Street advisers, Henry Newman and Henry Cook, will be leaving No 10. Until Friday Canzini, a former Tory party campaign director, was a director at Crosby\u2019s CT Group. His profile page on the company\u2019s website is no longer available. Canzini worked on the \u201cchuck Chequers\u201d campaign \u2013 a series of Facebook adds overseen by Crosby that helped undermine Theresa May\u2019s approach to Brexit in 2018. It came just after Johnson\u2019s resignation from May\u2019s government. Canzini is admired by rightwing Tories in the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group and the Brexit-backing European Research Group (ERG). David Jones, the deputy chair of the ERG, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cDavid Canzini is one of the shrewdest political operators in the UK. We had all been pressing for a root-and-branch review of No 10. To be fair to the PM, he did exactly that. \u201cHe got rid of some people who were not serving him well and is replacing them with people such as Steve Barclay, and particularly David Canzini, who people have got a lot of confidence in. I think that is going to change the narrative completely.\u201d Canzini cultivates a \u201chardman\u201d reputation. On Twitter he goes by the name @DCGrumpy and uses a profile picture of Darth Vader. He has used the network recently to spar with Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff Gavin Barwell and the Labour-supporting football pundit Gary Neville. Last month Johnson attempted to reassure MPs of his plans to reset his administration by saying he had rehired Crosby. But it later emerged that Crosby, who is known as the \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d for his successful 2015 election strategy, will not be taking an official job but will instead occasionally advise Johnson from his base in Australia."

            "title": "The US state that fought back after Republicans tried to rig its elections",
            "date": "2022-02-01T10:30:16Z",
            "content": "In recent months, Michigan should have been a hotbed for attempts to rig elections, like it was in 2011. That year, the Republican-led legislature distorted the voting maps so that the GOP was able to win nine of Michigan\u2019s 14 congressional seats despite never earning more than 50.5% of the vote statewide. A decade later, as the redistricting cycle has come around again, the dynamics are just as toxic. The battleground state broke for Joe Biden by fewer than 155,000 votes, and the Republican-controlled legislature has fought endlessly with the Democratic governor about election \u201caudits\u201d, voter IDs and absentee ballots. But this cycle, the state\u2019s redistricting commission has pulled off something remarkable. Despite a flurry of legal action and very public disputes between members, it has produced some of the fairest maps in the US. How did it manage it \u2013 and will the maps survive? Neither party was involved in drawing new maps, a process that is open to abuse if politicians are allowed to allocate particular voters to particular districts in order to guarantee a win there. Instead, the responsibility fell to 13 Michiganders \u2013 four Democrats, four Republicans and five independents \u2013 who were randomly selected by the state. The Michigan Independent Citizens\u2019 Redistricting Commission (MICRC) includes a foster care worker, a retired banker, an aspiring orthopedic surgeon, a mother of six, a college student and a real estate broker. MICRC, and the approach it epitomizes, came about thanks to Katie Fahey, a Michigan resident and political novice who posted a message on Facebook two days after the 2016 presidential election. She said she wanted to take on gerrymandering and eventually recruited more than 14,000 volunteers to campaign for an amendment to the state\u2019s constitution. It passed with 61% of the vote and created the commission, one of the most successful ways to unrig the redistricting process so far and a potential model for other states. Combatting gerrymandering is no small feat. In 35 states, partisan politicians in the legislatures are mostly or fully in charge of redistricting, and of the maps that have been released and evaluated by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project so far, the average grade is a \u201cD\u201d. States led by both Republicans and Democrats \u2013 including Maryland, Texas, North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio, Wisconsin and Illinois \u2013 earned the lowest possible grade. While Republicans haven\u2019t gerrymandered as much as Democrats originally feared \u2013 in fact, the number of Democratic-leaning seats could increase by a few this year \u2013 both parties have nearly eliminated their competition. Of the 287 completed congressional districts, only 42 (14.6%) are competitive, and 13 states have passed maps with zero competitive districts, according to an analysis from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project and RepresentUs. Part of MICRC\u2019s success is that it\u2019s almost entirely insulated from the legislature. In December of 2019, applications to MICRC were randomly sent to 250,000 citizens. The pool of respondents was then trimmed (at random) to 200, though 60 of the applicants had to self identify as Republicans, 60 as Democrats, and 80 affiliated with neither party. At this point, Democrats and Republicans in the legislature were allowed to strike up to 10 commissioners each, after which the final 13 were then chosen, again at random. The results were nearly revolutionary. During perhaps one of the most contentious political processes of the decade, MICRC was able to find cross-partisan agreement. Their final congressional map was approved by eight of the commission\u2019s 13 members \u2013 two Republicans, two Democrats, and four independents \u2013 and will go into effect before the primaries this year. The congressional map was graded \u201cA\u201d by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. However, the process still has its critics. Republicans filed a lawsuit claiming that the map arbitrarily \u201cfragments counties, townships, and municipalities\u201d and that it allows too much population deviation between congressional districts. Meanwhile, good government groups were upset about the committee\u2019s first closed-door meeting, and several media outlets sued to have records from the event released to the public. In late December, MICRC turned over documents showing that it was preparing for litigation about how it split Black voters across different districts, while previously they were geographically more concentrated. On 5 January, members of the Michigan house of representatives representing Detroit and others challenged the commission\u2019s maps, arguing that they dilute the voting strength of Black voters, particularly in and around Detroit. However, proving that point in court will be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, says Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center\u2019s Democracy Program. Federal law dictates that minority voters have the opportunity to elect their candidate of choice, but it doesn\u2019t set a specific threshold for what percentage of voters in a district need to be of that minority group. Li suggested that even if the challenge succeeds, it will probably lead to relatively minor changes around Detroit, as opposed to the commission having to start from scratch. Still, the pressure of drawing \u2013 and then having to defend \u2013 the map seems to be wearing on the commissioners. One accused the group\u2019s chair of bullying her and introduced a motion to censure her, and members have even disagreed over whether to produce a \u201clessons learned\u201d documentary about the process, with two refusing to participate at all. Since at least early December, commissioners have also voiced skepticism of their general counsel, who resigned abruptly last week. The episode underscores a potential lesson for states looking to adopt a similar style of commission: non-politicians may be better able to work across party lines but might must be prepared for the rancor, criticism and partisan lawsuits that follow. If the goal is fairer maps, though, the trade-off may be worth it. \u201cOn the whole, these maps are really good maps,\u201d says Li, \u201cand markedly different than what we\u2019re seeing around the country.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-15T07:18:15Z",
            "content": "The attorney general, Michaelia Cash, has confirmed the commonwealth integrity commission is off the agenda until at least after the election, as the government can\u2019t pass it without Labor support. The government is \u201cnot progressing with it at this stage\u201d, the attorney general told Senate estimates on Tuesday, also confirming that despite two years of consultation no changes had been made to the Coalition model. Earlier in February the prime minister, Scott Morrison, suggested there may still be a chance to legislate the anti-corruption body before the May election, a possible reference to a final attempt to get cabinet to agree to a beefed-up version of the integrity commission to boost the chances of passing the religious discrimination bill. Labor and the crossbench have all called for a tougher national integrity commission, with a Greens bill already having passed the Senate, and a crossbench bill supported by MP Helen Haines and Senator Rex Patrick also a viable model to pass parliament. But despite Liberal MP Bridget Archer crossing the floor to progress the national integrity commission, the government refuses to introduce its own bill to parliament to set the body up. Under questioning from Labor senators on Tuesday, Cash said: \u201cIn the terms of the model of the integrity commission in the legislation that is drafted, you don\u2019t support our bill, you have not put forward an alternative to that bill. \u201cAnd on that basis, at this point in time, we won\u2019t be proceeding with it, because you do not support it. And we\u2019ve always said we would require bipartisan support.\u201d The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, described the admission as \u201canother broken promise\u201d from the Morrison government. \u201cTo this day, Mr Morrison has still not even brought a bill before the Parliament,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cInstead, all we\u2019ve seen is scandal after scandal go unchecked, endless excuses and a weak, pathetic, desultory \u2018exposure draft\u2019 which was so bad, the Centre for Public Integrity denounced it is \u2018a sham designed to cover up corruption\u2019.\u201d The Morrison government promised a national integrity commission in December 2018, ahead of the 2019 election, after months of dismissing it as a \u201cfringe issue\u201d. After missing its self-imposed 2019 deadline for draft legislation, the Coalition unveiled its proposed body in November 2020 for a commission that will not conduct public hearings or release reports into alleged corruption by public servants and politicians. The model was also panned by experts for the narrow definition of corruption and high bar to start investigations. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Officials from the attorney general\u2019s department at the hearing confirmed no changes were made to the draft legislation after consultation. Cash said: \u201cThe government believes that the model it has is the appropriate model.\u201d Greens senator Larissa Waters, said the model was unchanged despite \u201cexperts [saying] it is a protection racket for MPs\u201d. Cash said the government could \u201cwork cooperatively with you to pass that as quickly as we can\u201d if Labor or the Greens reversed their opposition, although there are just two Senate sitting days left in late March before the 2022 election."

            "date": "2022-02-11T06:00:43Z",
            "content": "Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is hoping Donald Trump will travel to Budapest in the coming weeks to boost his reelection campaign. A thinktank linked to the Orb\u00e1n government, the Centre for Fundamental Rights, has issued an invitation to Trump, a government source told The Guardian. The invitation comes as Orb\u00e1n moves into campaigning mode ahead of a closely fought election due on 3 April, when his Fidesz party will face a united opposition coalition, in what is seen as the biggest challenge to his rule since he became prime minister 12 years ago. \u201cPeople in Fidesz would really like Trump to visit Budapest in March,\u201d said the source, who added that Trump has not yet replied to the invite. If it happens, the visit would be Trump\u2019s first known trip outside the US since he lost the elections in 2020. Orb\u00e1n was an early Trump supporter, endorsing him as early as summer 2016, and he also publicly backed him in the 2020 vote. The pair spoke by telephone in January, and Trump returned the favour, publicly endorsing Orb\u00e1n for the April election. An in-person visit by the former US president would be seen as a major campaign boost. \u201cThese visits have a huge influence in the Hungarian conservative community, because they see [Trump] as an icon, as someone who spent his presidency in a strong headwind,\u201d said a source close to Fidesz. One former Republican staffer said Trump is known to fear contracting Covid while travelling abroad and may prefer not to travel. Liz Harrington, chief spokesperson for Trump, did not respond to a request for comment. Asked to comment on various aspects of the invite, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs responded with one word: \u201cNope.\u201d It is likely that Trump has been invited to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), due to be held from 25-26 March in Budapest. It will be the first time a European country hosts the flagship conservative event. Miklos Szanth\u00f3, the director of the Center for Fundamental Rights, told the Hungarian news agency MTI that a number of US senators would attend the conference, as well as Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain\u2019s Vox party and Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s son Eduardo. Fidesz is hoping that Trump will join Orb\u00e1n as the event\u2019s keynote speaker, the Hungarian government source said. \u201cAccording to our plans a number of high profile Americans will attend CPAC Hungary, including politicians, as well as prominent thinkers and opinion leaders on the right. We are certain that any fresh information regarding guests and speakers will reach you in due course of time,\u201d said Szanth\u00f3. The thinktank\u2019s mission statement says it acts as a \u201ccounter against today\u2019s overgrown human rights fundamentalism and political correctness\u201d. It is known for echoing the government\u2019s communications and creating propaganda videos. According to research by the investigative Hungarian news outlet, \u00c1tl\u00e1tsz\u00f3, almost all of their budget is provided by grants financed from public funds. Trump and Orb\u00e1n met during a 2019 White House visit, when Trump said the two men were similar: \u201cYou\u2019re respected all over Europe. Probably a bit like me, a little bit controversial, but that\u2019s OK\u201d. David Cornstein, a long-time friend who Trump appointed ambassador to Hungary, said Trump admired Orb\u00e1n for his strongman image and his control of the Hungarian political scene: \u201cHe would love to have the situation that Viktor Orb\u00e1n has,\u201d Cornstein said in 2019. After Trump left office, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s relations with Washington soured, and Hungary was the only EU nation not invited to Joe Biden\u2019s recent Democracy Summit. Relations with the Trump camp have remained strong. In September, former vice-president Mike Pence spoke to a conference on conservative social values hosted by Orb\u00e1n. Former attorney general Jeff Sessions was also a recent visitor. Fox News host Tucker Carlson also spent time in Hungary earlier this year, broadcasting several shows from Budapest and making a \u201cdocumentary\u201d that painted Hungary as a conservative paradise, under constant attack by the Hungarian-born billionaire, George Soros. It was Carlson\u2019s second trip to Hungary in less than a year. Last August he travelled to Budapest to interview Orb\u00e1n. A few weeks after the Hungarian PM\u2019s appearance on Fox, Trump sent him a letter of congratulations: \u201cGreat job on Tucker, proud of you!\u201d"

            "content": "Michelle Obama would put Republicans \u201cin a very difficult position\u201d if she ran for president in 2024, a former Trump aide said, because the former first lady is both popular and \u201cimmune to criticism\u201d. Monica Crowley, a former treasury spokeswoman, was speaking on Saturday at CPAC, the conservative conference in Orlando, Florida, at which Donald Trump strongly suggested he will run again in two years\u2019 time. \u201cIf [Democrats] were to run Michelle Obama,\u201d Crowley said, during a panel session, \u201cthat would put us in a very difficult position because they\u2019d reach for a candidate who is completely plausible, very popular, and immune to criticism. \u201cAlso, when you think about her positioning, she [was a Democratic convention] keynote speaker in 2020, she wrote her autobiography [Becoming, a bestseller] and did a 50-city tour, she has massive Netflix and Spotify deals, and she\u2019s got a voting rights group alongside [the Georgia politician and campaigner] Stacey Abrams.\u201d Crowley, a sometime Fox News contributor, is well-connected in Trumpworld. In 2016, Trump sought to appoint her as a deputy national security adviser. She withdrew, amid allegations of plagiarism in a book about the Obama administration and in her PhD dissertation. Crowley called the allegations a \u201cstraight-up political hit job\u201d but the book was withdrawn and updated. Columbia University concluded that Crowley\u2019s PhD contained \u201clocalised instances of plagiarism\u201d which did not constitute research misconduct. She became treasury spokeswoman in 2019 and, according to the New York Times, was \u201cseen as a positive presence\u201d. Obama is beloved among Democrats and polls highly in surveys of notional fields should Joe Biden go against all indications and decide not to run for a second term, and should Kamala Harris, the vice-president, not then secure the nomination. The former first lady has spoken up on key Democratic policies, including the need to protect voting rights. A candidacy is feared by Republicans all the way up to Trump, who according to the Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender was convinced Democrats would parachute Obama in to replace Biden at the 2020 convention. But she has repeatedly said she has no wish to enter politics as a candidate. In 2018, she told a conference in Boston: \u201cThe reason why I don\u2019t want to run for president \u2026 is that, first of all, you have to want the job. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t just say, \u2018Well, you\u2019re a woman, run.\u2019 We just can\u2019t find the women we like and ask them to do it, because there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics. \u201cI\u2019ve never had the passion for politics. I just happened to be married to somebody who has the passion for politics, and he drug me kicking and screaming into the arena.\u201d Obama has also said she would like to retire \u2013 or spend more time \u201cchasing summer\u201d. Her husband has said: \u201cMichelle will not run for president. I can guarantee it.\u201d Still, some Republicans still appear to fear Obama could somehow be dragged into a race against Trump. Crowley said: \u201cFor all of these people who say, \u2018Michelle Obama isn\u2019t political \u2026 they\u2019re making too much money now,\u2019 keep a very close eye on her because her trajectory is exactly what Barack Obama did before he ran for president and what Bill and Hillary Clinton both did. \u201cI think if she were to run, that would be a very difficult situation for us.\u201d Crowley also said she thought Democrats would need to appeal to Black women, particularly if Harris could not secure a post-Biden nomination. Contrary to Crowley\u2019s claim, Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201ctrajectory\u201d does not seem similar to that of her husband or either Clinton. A successful lawyer and popular first lady, she has never run for national office, let alone been a senator (Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton), governor (Bill Clinton) or secretary of state (Hillary Clinton again). She has however given well-received speeches at Democratic conventions \u2013 including a heartfelt expression of support for Biden, her husband\u2019s vice-president, and criticism of Trump, in 2020. \u201cLet me be as honest and clear as I possibly can,\u201d she said then. \u201cDonald Trump is the wrong president for our country. \u201cHe has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.\u201d"

DeSantis, who is both an ally and possible rival to Donald Trump, delivered the attack at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the biggest annual gathering of grassroots conservatives in the US. The governor was speaking in Orlando in his home state, but the broad and national sweep of his address, which did not mention Trump by name, was consistent with eyeing a potential White House run in 2024 or 2028. \u201cI can tell you there\u2019s one fellow that just hates Florida: his name is Joe Biden,\u201d said DeSantis, setting himself up as the voice of opposition to the incumbent US president, whose name elicited boos in the cavernous ballroom. \u201cAlways trying to take pot shots at Florida and he does things like take our medication. He stiffs storm victims of relief just because he doesn\u2019t like the governor. He doesn\u2019t like Florida. He doesn\u2019t like me because we stand up to him.\u201d The crowd cheered and applauded DeSantis, 43, who went on to rail against Biden over border security, crime and the economy. \u201cThe inflation is because of his policies and we\u2019re not going to let anyone forget that. So all told, he\u2019s had the worst first year of any president since the 1800s. \u201cAnd as Biden flounders, Florida is leading on issue after issue ... We are in the process of getting money from the legislature so that if Biden is dumping illegal aliens into Florida from the southern border, I\u2019m rerouting them to Delaware. We\u2019ll do some in DC and Hollywood as well.\u201d The reference to Biden\u2019s home state was a populist crowd pleaser \u2013 it produced a resounding roar of approval \u2013 that Trump himself would have envied. Indeed, DeSantis\u2019s speech was a model of Fox News talking points that mocked \u201clockdown\u201d politicians for holidaying in Florida, which he declared the least restrictive state in the nation during the coronavirus pandemic. In an attack on Biden\u2019s chief medical adviser, infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci, DeSantis declared: \u201cFrom the very beginning, we refused to let this state descend into some type of Faucian dystopia where people\u2019s freedoms are curtailed and their livelihoods are destroyed ... Florida has defeated Faucism. Freedom has prevailed in the sunshine state.\u201d He added: \u201cI really believe had Florida not led the way, this country could look like Canada or Australia.\u201d Florida is such a bastion of freedom, he claimed, that people are settling there as they flee from \u201cleftist governments\u201d in America and around the world. The slogan at this year\u2019s CPAC, where Trump is due to speak on Saturday, is \u201cAwake not woke\u201d. DeSantis tapped into the resentments of the audience \u2013 some of whom wore \u201cDeSantisLand\u201d caps and flags \u2013 by launching a broadside at so-called \u201cwoke culture\u201d. He boasted about banning critical race theory (CRT), an academic discipline that studies how racism is embedded in US law and institutions that, despite not taught in America\u2019s public schools, has been caricatured and demonized by the right. \u201cThey want us to be powerless, they want us to be voiceless, they want us to be second-class citizens,\u201d said DeSantis, who is running for reelection as governor this year, \u201cAnd what are these ideological aims? The woke is the new religion of the left, and this is what they have in mind.\u201d Many major institutions \u2013 including big tech companies \u2013 have become \u201cinfected with this woke virus\u201d, the former Republican congressman added. \u201cYou look at the corrupt and dishonest legacy media in this country and what they\u2019re doing to divide us and what they\u2019re doing to prop up the regime\u201d."

            "content": "The far-right French presidential candidate Eric Zemmour has said of all world leaders he is compared to he feels most like the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. The former journalist, who is often compared to Donald Trump, was speaking on France Inter\u2019s morning news programme when asked about \u201cpopulist\u201d foreign leaders. The interviewer mentioned Trump, the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, and Italy\u2019s former deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini and asked if they were models for Zemmour. \u201cYou have not mentioned Boris Johnson and I am astonished because he is without doubt the leader I feel I am closest to, culturally, intellectually \u2026 and he\u2019s obviously a European like me but English,\u201d Zemmour said. It is not the first time Zemmour has rejected comparisons to Trump and likened himself to the British PM. He has pointed out that both he and Johnson are former journalists, both have written history books \u2013 Zemmour on the history of France, De Gaulle and Napoleon, Johnson on Winston Churchill. He said in November: \u201cWe do have a lot in common and above all he pulled off an electoral strategy that I propose to implement: an alliance of the working class and that part of the patriotic bourgeoisie who wish to restore French sovereignty and defend an identity tragically under threat.\u201d Zemmour did not meet Johnson when he visited London last year, ostensibly to publicise his new book La France n\u2019a pas dit son dernier mot (France hasn\u2019t had its last word) but also to drum up support among expatriate French voters. His team said \u201cthere were phone calls\u201d between his advisers and members of the British cabinet. On returning to France, Zemmour told journalists: \u201cI met a lord and I revisited the historical English parliament, the mother of all parliaments.\u201d Zemmour is running on an ultra-nationalist, French first programme calling for \u201czero immigration\u201d and warning of a clash of civilisations \u201cnot just between east and west, but between Islam and the Christian world in Europe\u201d. Zemmour told France Inter: \u201cI am not part of an international populist (movement). For a long time my definition of populism has been it\u2019s the cry of people who don\u2019t want to die and I am the candidate of the French people who don\u2019t want to die.\u201d The latest opinion poll by Ipsos suggest Zemmour and the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) candidate, Marine Le Pen, could both reach 14% of the vote in the first round of the April presidential election behind Emmanuel Macron and the centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains candidate, Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse. A second Ifop poll suggests P\u00e9cresse, Le Pen and Zemmour are all hovering around the same level. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 February 2022. Matteo Salvini is a former deputy prime minister, not a former prime minister as stated in an earlier version."

            "date": "2022-02-27T04:28:32Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump, the former US president, has defended his description of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin as \u201csmart\u201d while seeking to blunt accusations that he admires the invasion of Ukraine. Trump reiterated his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen by voter fraud as he argued that the invasion of Ukraine would never have happened if he was still in the White House. \u201cThe Russian attack on Ukraine is appalling,\u201d he told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday night. \u201cIt\u2019s an outrage and an atrocity that should never have been allowed to occur. \u201cWe are praying for the proud people of Ukraine. God bless them all. As everyone understands, this horrific disaster would never have happened if our election was not rigged and if I was the president.\u201d Election officials, numerous judges and Trump\u2019s own attorney general found no evidence that the election was rigged. Having retold \u201cthe big lie\u201d, he went on to compare himself favourably with other presidents\u2019 handling of Putin. \u201cUnder Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under Biden, Russia invaded Ukraine. I stand as the only president of the 21st century on whose watch Russia did not invade another country.\u201d Democrats dismissed the speech and condemned Trump for still cosying up to Putin. Adonna Biel, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cAfter spending four years selling out Ukraine, the defeated former president took the stage at CPAC to double down on his shameless praise for Putin as innocent Ukrainians shelter from bombs and missiles at the hands of Russia. \u201cThis has been the theme of the Republican party all week, making clear that their party is beholden to a defeated former president who lost them the White House, House, and Senate.\u201d An audience of about 5,000 people at CPAC, the biggest annual gathering of grassroots conservatives, roared and whistled their approval. Some chanted: \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d Trump, whose \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach rattled Nato allies, claimed that Russia and other countries respected the US when he was president and blamed Joe Biden for displaying weakness on the global stage. \u201cI have no doubt that President Putin made his decision to ruthlessly attack Ukraine only after watching the pathetic withdrawal from Afghanistan, where the military was taken out first, our soldiers were killed and American hostages, plus $85bn worth of the finest equipment anywhere in the world were left behind,\u201d he said. Trump, who notoriously deferred to autocrats, also responded to criticism over his description this week of Putin\u2019s invasion of separatist areas of Ukraine as \u201cgenius\u201d, \u201csavvy\u201d and \u201csmart\u201d. He asserted that Putin has suffered no repercussions beyond sanctions, which he has shrugged off for 25 years. \u201cThe problem is not that Putin is smart \u2013 which of course, he\u2019s smart \u2013 but the real problem is that our leaders are dumb. They\u2019ve so far allowed him to get away with this travesty and an assault on humanity.\u201d He added: \u201cSo sad. Putin is playing Biden like a drum and it\u2019s not a pretty thing as somebody that loves our country to watch.\u201d Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign had more than 100 contacts with Russia, prompting a special counsel investigation that stopped short of alleging direct collusion. As president, Trump was notoriously reluctant to condemn Putin and, at a summit in Helsinki, took the Russian leader\u2019s word over that of his own intelligence agencies. His administration did impose some sanctions on Moscow, however. Trump recalled on Saturday: \u201cI was with Putin a lot. I spent a lot of time with him. I got along with him \u2026 I did a lot of things that were very tough on Russia. No president was ever as tough on Russia as I was. \u201cBut with respect to what\u2019s going on now, it would have been so easy for me to stop this travesty from happening. He understood me and he understood that I didn\u2019t play games. This would not have happened. Someday, I\u2019ll tell you exactly what we talked about. And he did have an affinity, there\u2019s no question about it, for Ukraine. I said, never let it happen, better not let it happen.\u201d He added: \u201cI also warned Nato about the danger of Russia and look at the consequences. On foreign policy, the world rightly had a healthy fear that as president I would stand strong for Americans\u2019 priorities.\u201d During an 85-minute speech to a packed ballroom at CPAC, Trump, who contested the 2016 and 2020 elections, also gave his strongest hint yet that he will run for president in 2024. \u201cWe did it twice, and we\u2019ll do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing it again a third time.\u201d There were loud cheers from the crowd, many of whom wore \u201cMake America great again\u201d caps and \u201cTrump 2024\u201d regalia. There were shouts of \u201cFour more years!\u201d and \u201cWe want Trump!\u201d The former president went on to rail against \u201cleftwing tyranny\u201d and \u201ccrackdowns, censorship and cancel culture\u201d, praise protesting Canadian truckers and brand Biden\u2019s supreme court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, \u201ca radical left zealot\u201d. He claimed that the court\u2019s existing justices, including conservative Brett Kavanaugh, are \u201cterrified of the radical left\u201d and \u201cafraid to do the right thing\u201d. Trump pushed the baseless conspiracy theory that his 2016 election rival, \u201cCrooked\u201d Hillary Clinton, spied on him, prompting chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d And he accused Democrats of caring more about Ukraine\u2019s borders than America\u2019s own. He declared: \u201cYou could take the five worst presidents in American history and put them together and they would not do the damage that Joe Biden\u2019s administration has done in just a very short period.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-17T06:00:27Z",
            "content": "A reporter who infiltrated \u00c9ric Zemmour\u2019s presidential election team has claimed he witnessed a culture of casual racism and a covert online campaign involving a \u201cshadow Facebook army\u201d and repeated rewrites of the far-right polemicist\u2019s Wikipedia page, the most viewed in France. Vincent Bresson, 27, says he spent more than three months as an increasingly trusted member of \u201cG\u00e9n\u00e9ration Z\u201d, as Zemmour\u2019s young supporters\u2019 group is known. He said he witnessed multiple racist remarks from both volunteers and senior staff. \u201cOfficially, if you\u2019re black or of Arab origin, Zemmour believes in \u2018assimilation\u2019: work hard, adapt to \u2018French culture\u2019, and you can be French \u2018like the rest\u2019,\u201d said Bresson, a freelance journalist who has written for publications including Le Monde. \u201cIn reality, it seems some Zemmourists will always see you as \u2018less French\u2019. And these are supposedly the more moderate, publicly acceptable faces of the campaign. I think it poses serious questions about promises of equal treatment for all under a Zemmour presidency.\u201d Zemmour, a media pundit who promotes the far-right \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory that Muslim immigrants are supplanting the populations of European countries, denies he is racist but has two convictions for racist hate speech and is appealing against a third. Less than two months before the first round of voting, he is vying for third place in the polls with the rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains candidate Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, behind the far-right National Rally leader, Marine Le Pen, and the incumbent president, Emmanuel Macron. Bresson said in an interview he decided to infiltrate Zemmour\u2019s campaign because \u201cthere was at least a chance he could be president\u201d. On his first evening with a group of young activists putting up posters last October, Bresson recounts in his book, Au Coeur de Z (At the Heart of Z), published on Thursday, \u201cone of them used the word \u2018negroes\u2019, and nobody batted an eyelid\u201d. On another occasion, a volunteer joked of a black driver delivering campaign leaflets: \u201cIf he only knew what he was carrying\u201d. A rare Zemmour supporter of Arab origin was told by another activist he could never sell him his flat, \u201cnot with your face\u201d. He says he also witnessed a conversation between two senior team members who referred to black parking attendants at the Villepinte exhibition centre outside Paris, where Zemmour held his first campaign rally last December, as \u201cMamadou\u201d, a Francophone African first name sometimes used in France to describe a black labourer and recognised as a racist insult. Bresson said he had targeted G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Z as the easiest way into Zemmour\u2019s campaign because as a \u201cyoung, white, university-educated man called Vincent \u2013 a name in the Christian calendar \u2013 and brought up a Catholic, I looked like a plausible recruit\u201d. Zemmour has claimed that if he were elected president he would ban families from giving children non-French first names, meaning people could no longer call their sons Mohammed \u201cbut would be allowed to use it as a middle name\u201d. Bresson said he was astonished at how quickly he had been integrated into the group, progressing from late-night or early-morning flyposting expeditions to joining teams of activists trawling social media for potentially serious threats to Zemmour\u2019s safety. He was also promoted to an \u201celite\u201d list of trusted individuals tasked with sleeping at Zemmour\u2019s campaign headquarters in rue Jean Goujon in the capital\u2019s 8th arrondissement, acting as security guards in exchange for a signed book, photo or lunch with \u201cZ\u201d. \u201cI was astonished at the lack of security,\u201d Bresson said. \u201cI changed my surname and invented a job in PR, but never once was my ID checked. Often, I could have searched Zemmour\u2019s desk, for example \u2013 though I never did. I\u2019m a journalist, not a spy.\u201d Bresson also joined Zemmour\u2019s highly sophisticated covert online campaign, run through Telegram chat groups by the candidate\u2019s director of digital strategy, Samuel Lafont. \u201cThis isn\u2019t public at all, it\u2019s covert,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not transparent political campaigning.\u201d The book describes how a \u201cshadow army\u201d of hundreds of Zemmour volunteers are instructed to join a huge array of diverse Facebook groups, ranging from fans of the late French rocker Johnny Hallyday through supporters of Lens or Lyon football clubs to pizza lovers, anti-vaxxers and radical protest movements. \u201cThey\u2019re asked to pile in, as many as possible, posting pro-Zemmour content \u2013 articles, videos, links to his supporters\u2019 website \u2013 and asking what people think of him. Flooding Facebook, commenting and reacting as much and as often as they can, constantly raising their candidate\u2019s profile,\u201d Bresson said. \u201cThey can copy-paste material from a central campaign site; they can post exactly the same content across 20 different groups. It\u2019s about creating an impression of huge numbers of people, of a massive online movement.\u201d The book also relates how volunteers are called on for mass campaigns, orchestrated by Lafont, aimed at ensuring pro-Zemmour hashtags \u2013 such as #STOPcensure (#STOPcensorship), when the candidate\u2019s Instagram account was briefly suspended last August \u2013 trend on Twitter, attracting media coverage. Another unit, known as \u201cWikiZ\u00e9dia\u201d, is charged with editing Wikipedia entries relating to Zemmour, particularly the polemicist\u2019s individual page, which was viewed 5.2m times in 2021, making it the online encyclopaedia\u2019s most consulted page in France. In an online strategy document seen by Bressson, WikiZ\u00e9dia members are expected to make Zemmour \u201cas visible as possible on Wikipedia\u201d by linking to his entry and citing his views on as many subjects as possible, as well as listing his TV appearances. One activist was also engaged in online revisionism in support of Zemmour\u2019s assertion, disproved by historians, that during the second world war France\u2019s collaborationist Vichy r\u00e9gime tried to help French Jews rather than send them to death camps, Bresson writes. The activist, a respected Wikipedia contributor, inserted photos of Vichy\u2019s leader, Philippe P\u00e9tain, and prime minister, Pierre Laval, on Zemmour\u2019s Wikipedia page, adding that their \u201cresponsibility for the Shoah in France is debated\u201d. Bresson cites a senior French Wikipedia administrator, Jules, as saying WikiZ\u00e9dia\u2019s activities were \u201cunprecedented\u201d for a political party in France and contravene the website\u2019s fundamental principles of objectivity and neutrality. Lafont on Thursday confirmed efforts to \u201cimprove\u201d Zemmour\u2019s pages, which he said were \u201cskewed \u2026 by changes made by the left\u201d, insisting this was \u201cthe Wikipedia game. It\u2019s a participatory encyclopedia. It\u2019s normal for everyone to chip in.\u201d He did not comment on allegations a senior Wikipedia contributor was a Zemmour activist. Au Coeur du Z took six months from idea to publication and is published by \u00c9ditions Goutte d\u2019Or, whose other undercover reports have also made headlines. Its manuscript was, until late last week, in the hands of one of France\u2019s top media lawyers. One of the book\u2019s publishers, Geoffrey Le Guilcher, said legal action against the book by Zemmour was a possibility but the company was confident there was \u201cabsolutely nothing untrue or unverified\u201d in Bresson\u2019s 300-page account. \u201cThis is about infiltrating for more transparency,\u201d he said. \u201c\u00c9ric Zemmour is the only presidential candidate convicted of racist hate speech. His campaign\u2019s online activity is at the very least amoral. There is a very clear public interest.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 February 2022 to remove a reference to Telegram chat groups as being \u201cencrypted\u201d."

            "date": "2022-02-11T08:00:44Z",
            "content": "QAnon, the extremist conspiracy movement whose followers believe Donald Trump is waging war against the \u201cdeep state\u201d, appears to have instigated a nationwide effort to take control of the US election process in critical battleground states ahead of America\u2019s 2024 presidential election. In recent months concern has risen over the coordinated efforts of at least 15 candidates \u2013 committed to Trump\u2019s \u201cbig lie\u201d that the 2020 election was stolen from him \u2013 who are now running to serve as chief election officials in key swing states. At least eight of the candidates standing for secretary of state positions have formed an alliance in which they share tactics and tips for success, details of which the Guardian revealed last month. Should any of the candidates be elected, they would be in prime position to distort or even overturn election results in favor of Trump or another preferred presidential candidate in ways that could have a profound impact on or even determine the national outcome. All the big lie candidates vying to gain control of election counts at state level present themselves as Republicans. It is now emerging that QAnon played a critical role in steering far-right candidates towards the secretary of state races as part of what appears to be a calculated nationwide assault on American democracy. \u201cThis is the way that QAnon could trigger a constitutional crisis,\u201d said Alex Kaplan, senior researcher at the watchdog Media Matters for America who is a close observer of the conspiracy theory. \u201cQAnon is linked to an effort to recruit and elect candidates to positions directly controlling election administrations, and given their ties to harming democracy, that is very concerning.\u201d QAnon emerged in 2017 when an unknown figure, \u201cQ\u201d, began to post on the 4chan message board that Trump, then in the White House, was secretly preparing to destroy a cabal of Satan-worshipping child traffickers. The conspiracy has become more overtly political in recent months, helping to spread baseless claims that the 2020 election was rigged for Joe Biden. It was also implicated in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The FBI has arrested more than 20 QAnon followers for violent acts on that day. Last June the agency released a threat assessment that warned that other adherents of the conspiracy could begin \u201caccepting the legitimacy of violent action\u201d. The links between QAnon and the coordinated push to control election counts was revealed by one of the big lie candidates himself. Jim Marchant, a former Republican lawmaker who is running to become chief election official in Nevada, disclosed the connection at \u201cPatriot Double Down\u201d, a QAnon-linked convention held in Las Vegas in October. Marchant told the convention that the idea that he should run for secretary of state was not his own. It was given to him by a prominent QAnon-influencer who goes by the alias Juan O Savin. The name is a phonetic play on the number 1-0-7. Q is the 17th letter of the alphabet. Marchant told the audience of QAnon advocates that he was approached by Savin the day after the presidential election on 3 November. Savin came to him in a suite he had rented in the Las Vegas Venetian hotel accompanied by \u201cother President Trump allies\u201d and told him that instead of running for Congress, which he was considering, Marchant should stand for the post of top election administrator in Nevada. \u201cI said, \u2018Absolutely\u2019,\u201d Marchant said in a recorded video of his speech to the convention. \u201cI knew right then that they had figured out that we need to take back the secretary of state offices around the country. Not only did they ask me to run, they asked me to put together a coalition of other like-minded secretary of state candidates. I got to work, Juan O Savin helped, and we formed a coalition.\u201d In an interview with the Guardian last month, Marchant confirmed that he had set up an alliance of at least eight far-right secretary of state candidates in states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. They include Arizona, Georgia and Michigan \u2013 states which were critical in the 2020 presidential election and which all now have big lie candidates running for secretary of state posts who have been endorsed by Trump. The Guardian contacted Marchant about the QAnon connection, but he did not respond. Marchant\u2019s disclosure of the formative role played by Juan O Savin in the secretary of state candidates alliance, which was first reported by the Daily Beast and by Kaplan for Media Matters, has in turn been corroborated by Savin himself. Kaplan has monitored several recent instances where the QAnon-influencer has spoken about having backed the alliance. In January he told a QAnon show that \u201cwe have a project that we are doing helping candidates across the country that we started here in Nevada that has prospered pretty well, with a number of Trump endorsements\u201d. In May he said in a video conversation that he had recently organized a meeting of about 50 people to look at \u201chow we are going to get to a lawful election this time around and get to the right result. How we are going to coordinate between the different states to get to the right outcome.\u201d In the most recent comment, on Sunday, he talked about \u201cthe secretary of state stuff\u201d, boasting that \u201cacross the country we are gaining strength rapidly to get back into this game in an effective way. A lot of those offices that they thought they held and weren\u2019t going to matter, we are going to flip those.\u201d QAnon watchers say that Savin has been rising rapidly within the conspiracy theory in recent months. \u201cHe used to be a fringe figure, but has become a lot more prominent,\u201d said Al Jones, founder of the Q Origins Project, a group of analysts who track the QAnon movement. Savin made a rare open public appearance at the Patriot Double Down convention. Normally, though, he hides his identity. He is often interviewed by QAnon followers as he is driving, showing only his hands on the steering wheel or his cowboy boots. He brags about having high-up contacts in the US intelligence services, though in fact he is believed to be a private insurance investigator living in the Seattle area. He claims to be friends with the actor Roseanne Barr, and in one of the wilder aspects of his influence, is believed by many QAnon followers to be John F Kennedy Jr. Savin\u2019s recent efforts have been focused on spreading falsehoods about mass fraud in the 2020 election. He has also amplified apocalyptic conspiracy theories including that President Biden\u2019s public appearances are broadcast with the use of a green screen to disguise his disabilities. Travis View, a leading QAnon watcher and host of the QAnon Anonymous podcast, told the Guardian that it would be \u201cruinous for democracy if people involved with QAnon got into positions of power where they have actual influence in determining the results or legitimacy of elections. QAnon is such an anti-reality way of thinking that it is entirely incompatible with the conventions that sustain democracy.\u201d Several people close to Trump are known to have deep ties with the QAnon movement. Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to Trump, spoke at a previous QAnon conference in Dallas and is thought to also have pushed a strategy of standing for local election among QAnon followers. Sidney Powell, who advocated for overturning the 2020 election result and who Trump at one point verbally agreed to appoint as special counsel on election fraud, also has ties to QAnon. Before Trump was removed from Twitter, he frequently disseminated comments from QAnon followers."

            "title": "\u2018Like sardines\u2019: experts question the results of ventilation audits at NSW schools",
            "date": "2022-02-02T16:30:29Z",
            "content": "Ventilation audits in schools across New South Wales have come under fresh scrutiny after two reviews of the same Blue Mountains school weeks apart resulted in the student capacity of one classroom rising by 500%. The government announced last year it would conduct ventilation audits at the 2,200 public schools across NSW to ensure there was enough fresh air inside classrooms, libraries and halls to prevent the spread of Covid-19. But as schools return for 2022 amid high community transmission of the Omicron variant in the state, new questions are being asked about the audits. The Guardian obtained copies of two audits conducted for the same school, which came to dramatically different conclusions about student capacity. In one example, a 55.4 sq metre \u201cteaching space\u201d was originally classified as having capacity for 25 students. But a second audit conducted less than three weeks later found that 154 students could safely occupy the room. In another case, a slightly larger room went from a capacity of 26 students to 77. In a third, the school\u2019s bay was changed from a capacity of six to 19. In another, the result went the other direction; a classroom designated as being safe for 77 students was downgraded to 39. The department did not respond to questions about specific schools, but said they \u201cworked with schools and provided guidance on how spaces should be used relative to the availability of natural ventilation\u201d. \u201cIn many cases, this resulted in updated information on reports which were reissued to schools.\u201d The Guardian understands the second audit was based on an in-person inspection of the school and the individual characteristics of the teaching spaces, while the first was an indicative measurement based on the room\u2019s size in square metres. But experts have questioned how the audits could have come to such dramatically different conclusions. Lidia Morawska, director of the International Laboratory of Air Quality and Health at the Queensland University of Technology, said the audit for the school was based on calculations that resulted in classroom capacity below 1 sq metre per person. \u201cIf the space per person is less than 1 sq metre people would be touching each other like sardines so at this close distance ventilation does not help much,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a very big concern if people could be at such a close proximity to each other \u2013 then they are at a very high risk of inhaling high concentration of particles emitted, and if the particles contain the virus then getting infected.\u201d Morawska also questioned the widespread use of air conditioning in schools with windows that do not open. Dubbed \u201csealed schools\u201d, there are 48 of them across the state. The department has said that air conditioning has been installed in all \u201csealed schools\u201d, and the Guardian has seen correspondence from one principal that states the units will be kept running at all times. But with no carbon dioxide monitoring, Morawska said the plan for classroom ventilation remained unclear regardless of the use of air conditioners. \u201cI\u2019m amazed that they pretend they are doing something,\u201d she said. Despite NSW and Victoria working closely together to develop a return to school plan, the two jurisdictions had different approaches for school ventilation audits. Geoff Hanmer, a professor of architecture at the University of Adelaide and the chair of OzSage\u2019s ventilation group, said Victoria\u2019s approach was \u201cnot perfect\u201d but \u201cdriven by more science\u201d compared with NSW\u2019s because it involved CO2 monitoring. \u201cIf you want classrooms to be safe then you need to check ventilation, which means measuring using a CO2 monitor,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people get this wrong the consequences are quite serious. There\u2019s been a tendency to want to believe that schools are not a place where Covid spreads despite all the evidence to the contrary.\u201d NSW is currently conducting a pilot program using CO2 monitors in some public schools across metropolitan, regional and NSW but the approach is not widespread. In Victoria, the state government gathered data from a range of ventilation assessments across 100 schools that comprised a representative sample of different building types, including the use of CO2 monitors, to determine ventilation. After the audit, the state government delivered 51,000 air purifiers to schools on a needs basis. NSW Labor\u2019s shadow education minister, Pru Carr, said the government had \u201cprovided no proof that they actually know whether ventilation in schools is sufficient\u201d. \u201cEducation Minister Sarah Mitchell and School Infrastructure NSW gave school communities assurances that the ventilation audit undertaken was comprehensive. It\u2019s unclear then why significant changes to some room capacities were made and reports altered,\u201d she said. \u201cFor schools without openable windows, there are also concerns that air-conditioning systems now being used are not filtered to prevent COVID-19 from spreading.\u201d A department spokesperson said its ventilation and \u201casset use\u201d was informed by NSW Health advice, research from the Doherty Institute, guidelines from the World Health Organisation and independent, peer-reviewed advice from building services consultants Steensen Varming. \u201cThe ventilation guidelines from the World Health Organisation for Delta are appropriate for the Omicron variant,\u201d the spokesperson said."

            "date": "2022-02-27T14:09:53Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson has appointed the combative election strategist David Canzini as part of his attempts to restore his battered reputation amid new claims that Downing Street lockdown parties regularly descended into \u201ccarnage\u201d. Canzini, a key ally of the political strategist Lynton Crosby, is due to start work in Downing Street on Monday. The pair worked for the former prime minister Theresa May before turning on her in 2018 His new role as deputy chief of staff is expected to involve winning over disgruntled backbenchers and coming up with an election-winning strategy. Tory MPs have been encouraged by Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the Ukraine crisis, but more are expected to submit letters of no confidence in the prime minister if he is served with a penalty notice as part of the police investigation into lockdown parties. The Sunday Times reports that one party on 18 December 2020 became so raucous that red wine was sprayed on the walls of rooms in Downing Street. Staffers were also reported to have been photographed sitting on each others laps, at the event. The paper said one source alleged that drinks events often ended in \u201ccarnage\u201d. Canzini has been linked for weeks with a formal role in Johnson\u2019s revamped team, but it was reported last month that he was insisting on a clearout of Downing Street in the wake of the \u201cpartygate\u201d scandal before taking up any new job. Canzini will be deputy to the new chief of staff, Steve Barclay, who replaced Dan Rosenfield after his resignation over partygate. He will work alongside two other deputy chiefs of staff: Simone Finn and Ben Gascoigne. Canzini\u2019s appointment comes after the confirmation that two more senior Downing Street advisers, Henry Newman and Henry Cook, will be leaving No 10. Until Friday Canzini, a former Tory party campaign director, was a director at Crosby\u2019s CT Group. His profile page on the company\u2019s website is no longer available. Canzini worked on the \u201cchuck Chequers\u201d campaign \u2013 a series of Facebook adds overseen by Crosby that helped undermine Theresa May\u2019s approach to Brexit in 2018. It came just after Johnson\u2019s resignation from May\u2019s government. Canzini is admired by rightwing Tories in the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group and the Brexit-backing European Research Group (ERG). David Jones, the deputy chair of the ERG, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cDavid Canzini is one of the shrewdest political operators in the UK. We had all been pressing for a root-and-branch review of No 10. To be fair to the PM, he did exactly that. \u201cHe got rid of some people who were not serving him well and is replacing them with people such as Steve Barclay, and particularly David Canzini, who people have got a lot of confidence in. I think that is going to change the narrative completely.\u201d Canzini cultivates a \u201chardman\u201d reputation. On Twitter he goes by the name @DCGrumpy and uses a profile picture of Darth Vader. He has used the network recently to spar with Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff Gavin Barwell and the Labour-supporting football pundit Gary Neville. Last month Johnson attempted to reassure MPs of his plans to reset his administration by saying he had rehired Crosby. But it later emerged that Crosby, who is known as the \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d for his successful 2015 election strategy, will not be taking an official job but will instead occasionally advise Johnson from his base in Australia."

            "date": "2022-02-18T12:48:11Z",
            "content": "Storm Eunice is battering parts of the UK, felling trees and scattering roof tiles as forecasters warn of a \u201csignificant threat to life\u201d. But is it caused by climate breakdown, and can we expect an increase in such disruptive storms? Where has the storm come from? Eunice brewed in the central Atlantic and was spun up from the Azores towards Europe by the jet stream. Is it a particularly bad storm? Yes, gusts of up to 110mph have been recorded at the Needles lighthouse on the Isle of Wight. This has exceeded the prediction of 90mph winds, and is just under the record 120mph winds that hit during the devastating storm of 1987, during which 18 people died in one day. The Met Office says Eunice has the potential to be the worst storm since then. A rare red alert has been issued by the Met Office, with people asked to stay at home if they can. The government has convened Cobra to discuss response to the likely devastation ahead. Prof Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said: \u201cThe Met Office red and amber warnings for high winds should not be taken lightly. Red means you need to act now because there is an imminent danger to life. Everyone who lives or works in those areas should be battening down the hatches, literally in some cases, to prevent people from being killed and injured and to protect your homes and businesses. \u201cLet us be clear what this means. Winds of 70mph will uproot trees, which can block roads and crush cars or buildings. They can pick up roof tiles and hurl them around. If you are hit by one of those you will be seriously hurt or killed. Wind that strong will sweep people and vehicles off streets, and topple electricity lines. Do not take any chances. Stay inside.\u201d There is talk of a deadly \u2018sting jet\u2019 coming with the storm, but what is that? Met Office scientists have said one of these can form. Matt Priestley, a research scientist at the University of Exeter, looking at storm tracks and extratropical cyclones, said they were small areas of very intense winds within a storm\u2019s cyclone that were hard to predict. \u201cThey are generally about 10-20km wide and are generated by specific instabilities within the flight lines of storms and cause very high wind speeds. \u201cThey\u2019re not a feature of all storms. They\u2019re often just a feature of the most intense ones like Storm Eunice. The fact that they are such small scale but can have such high wind speeds makes forecasting them very, very difficult.\u201d Is Eunice linked to climate breakdown? Michael Dukes, a forecaster at MetDesk, said it could be. He explained: \u201cAlthough it is hard to pinpoint climate change as a reason for individual severe weather events, climate models do indicate an increase in these type of storms as the earth continues to slowly warm. So this is very much in line with what climate scientists have been warning us about for a number of years now.\u201d While there is dispute between scientists over whether the storms themselves are likely to increase and become stronger, most agree that the climate crisis will make their impacts worse. The German climatologist Friederike Otto, who leads the pioneering World Weather Attribution service on whether droughts, big storms or heatwaves were made more likely by the climate emergency, said there was \u201cvery little evidence that winds in these winter storms have gotten stronger with climate change\u201d. She said: \u201cNevertheless the damages of winter storms have gotten worse because of human-caused climate change for two reasons: one, the rainfall associated with these winter storms has become more intense, and many studies link this clearly to climate change; and two, because of sea-level rise, storm surges are higher and thus more damaging than they would otherwise be.\u201d Richard Allan, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading, said: \u201cOnce-in-a-decade storms like Eunice are certain to batter the British Isles in the future but there is no compelling evidence that they will become more frequent or potent in terms of wind speeds. \u201cYet with more intense rainfall and higher sea levels as human-caused climate change continues to heat the planet, flooding from coastal storm surges and prolonged deluges will worsen still further when these rare, explosive storms hit us in a warmer world.\u201d"

            "content": "A clear majority of Americans think Vladimir Putin would not have ordered the Russian invasion of Ukraine had Donald Trump still been in the White House, according to a new poll. The poll, by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies (Caps)-Harris, found that 62% of those surveyed believed Putin would not have sent troops into Ukraine with Trump in the White House. In partisan terms, the survey found that 85% of Republicans and 38% of Democrats held the view. The poll, conducted on Wednesday and Thursday this week among 2,026 registered voters, found that 59% said Putin only ordered the invasion because he saw weakness in Joe Biden. Forty-one percent said the US president was not a factor in Putin\u2019s decision. Republicans in Congress have attacked Biden for perceived weakness in the face of autocratic leaders abroad. Party figures have been less keen to discuss Trump\u2019s expressions of admiration for Putin during the Ukraine crisis. The Harvard study\u2019s findings broadly buttressed a Fox News poll, carried out before Russia invaded, that found more Republicans had a negative view of Biden than of Putin and more Democrats had a negative view of Trump than of the Russian leader. That study said 92% of Republicans had a negative view of Biden while 81% had a negative view of Putin. Among Democrats, 87% had a negative view of Trump and 85% a negative view of Putin. A third poll, released by NPR/PBS/Marist College, will add concern for a Biden administration battling low approval ratings generated by public dissatisfaction on fronts including handling of the pandemic, the Afghanistan withdrawal, a stalled legislative agenda and inflation. The NPR-Marist poll found that 56% of Americans said Biden\u2019s first year in office was a \u201cfailure\u201d. Just 39% called it a success. Two-thirds of independents said Biden\u2019s first year was a failure, while 91% of Republicans said so. Among Democrats, 80% called Biden\u2019s first year a success \u2013 but 15% said it had been a failure."

            "date": "2022-02-12T06:00:11Z",
            "content": "People in the Spanish region of Castilla y Le\u00f3n vote on Sunday in a snap election that represents a massive gamble for the ruling conservative People\u2019s party (PP). It could see a breakthrough by a new political platform campaigning on behalf of depopulated and underdeveloped parts of Spain. The vote was called in December after the regional president, the PP\u2019s Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco, kicked his partners in the centre-right Citizens party out of the coalition government, claiming that he could no longer rely on their loyalty. It follows a turbulent few weeks in Spanish politics that have included a row over the country\u2019s meat industry and rightwing fury after the socialist-led central government managed to get its flagship labour reforms approved by parliament thanks to a PP MP accidentally voting against his party. Buoyed by its performance in national polls \u2013 and by its strong result in the Madrid region last May \u2013 the PP had hoped to use the Castilla y Le\u00f3n poll to win a majority there and to score an emphatic victory before a looming election in Andaluc\u00eda and next year\u2019s general election. But its momentum appears to be waning. Recent polls suggest that the party, led by Pablo Casado, will have to rely on the support of the far-right Vox party if it wants to remain in office. The socialists are predicted to finish not far behind the PP, with Vox in third place and Citizens \u2013 already a party in its death throes across Spain \u2013 coming a distant fourth. While the PP has already relied on Vox to govern in regions such as Madrid and Andaluc\u00eda, relations between the two parties have been strained since October 2020, when Casado rounded on the far-right grouping, accusing it of practising a politics based on \u201cfear, anger, resentment and revenge\u201d. Since then, however, Casado has dragged his party rightwards and enthusiastically sought out culture wars and wedge issues. Both the PP and Vox have seized on comments that the consumer affairs minister, Alberto Garz\u00f3n, made in an interview with the Guardian last December. Although the minister had renewed his calls for Spaniards to reduce their meat consumption for the sake of their health and the planet \u2013 and contrasted meat from traditional farming with meat from intensive megafarms \u2013 his words were twisted and presented as an attack on Spain\u2019s meat industry. Standing in front of a field of cows on a traditional farm near the small town of Las Navas del Marqu\u00e9s in the \u00c1vila province of Castilla y Le\u00f3n last month, Casado said the government was \u201cinsulting livestock farmers, insulting the Mediterranean diet and threatening Spain\u2019s international image\u201d. He also said that megafarms were subject to strict legislation and that, as he saw it, \u201cthey don\u2019t cause pollution\u201d. Asked why some PP councils had campaigned to stop the construction of new megafarms, Casado said those were political decisions. In recent days, Casado has also accused the Spanish government of attacking the country\u2019s cheeses, beets, and of spending \u201ca million euros on tourism for other races\u201d. Last week, he suggested that the socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, presided over a \u201cDracula coalition\u201d, but went on to mix his metaphors by claiming that everyone S\u00e1nchez bit \u201cturns into a zombie, like him\u201d. With the PP\u2019s fortunes in the traditionally conservative region suddenly in doubt, the party drafted in Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, who is widely seen as a possible rival to Casado because of her electoral clout and ability to appeal to Vox voters. It did not take her long to stake her conservative credentials. Responding to questions about the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in Spain, Ayuso said, \u201cAll institutions make mistakes\u201d, adding that few people wanted to talk about the church\u2019s cultural legacy in Spain or about \u201cthe charity, solidarity, values and comfort it offered\u201d. Pablo Sim\u00f3n, a political scientist at Madrid\u2019s Carlos III University, said things in Castilla y Le\u00f3n were not going according to plan for Casado and his party. \u201cThe problem is that when they called the elections, they thought they\u2019d do so well that they\u2019d be able to govern alone, like in Madrid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all the polls point at things getting worse for them than they\u2019d thought.\u201d Anything the PP do now, added Sim\u00f3n, will come at a cost: \u201cThey\u2019ll either have to depend on Vox, with all that depending on a more radical parliamentary partner implies, or they could even lose the government. Either scenario is worse for the PP than how things were, or how they wanted them to be.\u201d Sim\u00f3n also noted that the so-called Espa\u00f1a vaciada, or hollowed-out Spain platform, could play a role in the shape of the new regional parliament as \u201cthere are nine provinces that are very different with local phenomena\u201d. Voters sick of 35 years of PP rule could decide to give their votes to these grassroots groups on Sunday. The people of Las Navas del Marqu\u00e9s, however, are not holding their breath for an imminent improvement in their daily lives. Javier, who owns a bar in the town, said locals were more worried about depopulation and basic services than the meat row. \u201cIt\u2019s about all kinds of infrastructure, from telecoms and internet to roads,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a shortage of doctors.\u201d Given that most of the meat in the area was raised on traditional farms, he added, few people would take issue with Garz\u00f3n\u2019s words. Miguel, who was born in a house on the main square in Las Navas del Marqu\u00e9s 74 years ago, didn\u2019t hesitate when asked what the most pressing electoral issue was. \u201cJobs, jobs and jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople go where the work is and that\u2019s how towns die. A lot of people here have always felt left behind and abandoned by the authorities. Castilla y Le\u00f3n needs to be thought about a bit more. It\u2019s not just about Catalonia and the Basque country and Andaluc\u00eda.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-16T17:18:35Z",
            "content": "Public confidence in the Metropolitan police has fallen sharply in the five years Cressida Dick was leading Britain\u2019s biggest force, figures published on Wednesday show. Only 51% of those in London said they believed the Met did a good job in their local area, down 17 points compared with the last survey before Dick became Met commissioner in April 2017. In the majority of London\u2019s 32 boroughs, 50% or less said they believed the force did a good job. In March 2017, not a single borough was below 50%. Figures for police reliability, fairness and listening to people\u2019s concerns are all down by 10 percentage points or more in the past five years. The polling is done on behalf of the mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime and was introduced when Boris Johnson was London mayor as a way of holding the Met to account. Falling public confidence was cited by the current London mayor, Sadiq Khan, in his showdown with Dick that led to her resignation last week. Conservatives blamed Khan, who is also the police and crime commissioner for London, for the \u201cshocking plummet in public confidence\u201d. The new figures follow polling in December 2021. Comparing them with the figures in March 2017, the month before Dick became commissioner, shows the shift in public confidence. The poll asked whether police could be relied on to be there when needed. In March 2017, 79% said yes, but by December 2021 that figure had fallen by 20 points, with 59% agreeing. Compared with five years ago, the proportion of people who believe police treat everyone fairly has fallen 15 points, from 79% to 64%. In March 2017, 76% of respondents thought police listened to local people\u2019s concerns, but that had fallen by 14 points in the latest figures. Some former senior Met insiders see the survey questions as a key test of the Met\u2019s legitimacy. In the March 2017 survey, 68% agreed their local policing was good, with every London borough above 50%, the lowest being Enfield in north London at 58%. In the latest survey, 51% said they believed local police did a good job in their area, with the majority of London boroughs at 50% or below. Croydon in south London came out worst, at 43%, and Richmond upon Thames the best, at 70%. Victor Olisa, a former head of diversity at Scotland Yard, said: \u201cIt shows a clear diminishing of confidence across a whole range of measures, and fall in trust that the Met can keep people safe and solve crimes. The Met has not delivered what the people of London want or explained to them why they can\u2019t have it.\u201d In the latest survey, only 27% of people said they knew how to contact their local ward officers, supposed to be the cornerstone of neighbourhood policing, down from 36% in March 2017. Olisa said big changes to local policing and how the Met is organised appeared to have left officers more distant from communities. While the survey does not offer reasons for the fall in confidence, there have been a series of scandals during Dick\u2019s term and claims that the Met leadership mishandled them, such as the murder by a serving officer of Sarah Everard. There has also been controversy over big increases in stop and search, and claims it disproportionately affects innocent black people, as well as renewed anxiety over violent crime, especially stabbings. The Met said it was committed to reforms, which were under way and would be boosted by the findings from its own inquiry chaired by Lady Casey: \u201cThere is need for real change in our organisation. More than ever before we have been looking at ourselves critically and asking hard questions to improve our culture and professional standards, and we do not underestimate the scale of the change required.\u201d The Conservatives in London blamed Khan, in office since May 2016. Their police spokesperson, Susan Hall, said: \u201cHe has overseen this shocking plummet in public confidence in the Met police. Sadiq Khan himself has said that without trust and confidence in the police, the force cannot function.\u201d A spokesperson for the mayor of London said: \u201cA series of events have shattered public trust and confidence in our police. When this trust is eroded, our model of policing, and therefore public safety, is put at risk.\u201d"

            "content": "The percentage of adults in the US who identify as LGBTQ+ has doubled over the past 10 years, a Gallup study has found. According to poll results released Thursday, a record 7.1% of American adults identify as LGBTQ+, jumping from 3.5% in 2012. \u201cThe increase in LGBT identification in recent years largely reflects the higher prevalence of such identities among the youngest US adults compared with the older generations they are replacing in the US adult population,\u201d Gallup noted of the poll, which was conducted in 2021 on 12,416 American adults. The poll also found that 21% of Generation-Z Americans \u2013 those born between 1997 and 2003 \u2013 who have reached adulthood identify as LGBTQ, more than double the proportion of millennial adults who do so. Among millennials \u2013 those born between 1981 and 1996 \u2013 10.5% identify as LGBTQ+. This marks a modest 4.7% increase from 2012, when some members of the generation had not yet turned 18. The percentages are even smaller among Generation X, baby boomers and \u201ctraditionalists\u201d \u2013 all below 10%. Only 4.2% of Generation X adults, who are between 42 and 57, identify as LGBTQ. 2.6% of baby boomers, who are between 58 and 76, identify as LGBTQ. Lastly, among traditionalist adults \u2013 those born before 1946 \u2013 only 0.8% identify as LGBTQ+. Those percentages have more or less remained unchanged since Gallup started measuring LGBTQ+ identification in 2012. In addition, the poll found that more than half of LGBTQ+ Americans, 57%, identify as bisexual, making up 4% of the total US adult population. Twenty-one per cent of LGBTQ+ Americans identify as gay, 14% lesbian, 10% transgender and 4% something else. Nearly one in six Gen Z adults, or 15%, identify as bisexual. Meanwhile, 6% of millennials and 2% of Gen Xers say they are bisexual. The percentages of those who identify as bisexual among Generation X, baby boomers and traditionalists fall below 2%. According to the study, women, 6%, are more likely than men, 2%, to indicate that they are bisexual. Men are more likely to identify as gay, 2.5%, than bisexual. Gallup predicts that with one in 10 millennials and one in five Gen-Z members identifying as LGBTQ+, the proportion of LGBTQ+ American adults should exceed 10% in the near future. \u201cThese young adults [Generation Z] are coming of age, including coming to terms with their sexuality or gender identity, at a time when Americans increasingly accept gays, lesbians and transgender people, and LGBT individuals enjoy increasing legal protection against discrimination,\u201d Gallup said. According to Gallup, 70% of Americans are currently in support of same-sex marriage, marking a steep increase from 1996, when only 27% of Americans supported it."

            "date": "2022-02-09T05:00:42Z",
            "content": "Majorities across Europe think Russia will invade Ukraine in 2022 and believe both Nato and the EU should stand by Kyiv, according to a study whose authors suggest the crisis could end up dramatically changing the way Europeans view their security. \u201cThe data suggests something of a geopolitical awakening in Europe,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), which carried out the polling in seven countries, accounting for two-thirds of the EU\u2019s population. \u201cEU states have been portrayed as divided, weak and absent on Ukraine, but European citizens are united: they agree Vladimir Putin may pursue military action, and that Europe, together with its Nato partners, should ride to Ukraine\u2019s aid.\u201d The study\u2019s authors said the survey showed there was \u201cno longer much truth in the cliche that Europeans believe war is unthinkable and take peace for granted. They perceive their world as being in a prewar rather than postwar state.\u201d The polling, carried out in late January, showed that majorities in six of the seven countries surveyed believed Russia would invade Ukraine during the course of 2022, with those nearest to Europe\u2019s eastern border generally most convinced. Finland (44%) was a slight outlier, but elsewhere 51% of respondents in France and Italy, 52% in Germany, 55% in Sweden, 64% Romania and 73% of those in Poland said they thought a Russian invasion was likely this year. Majorities in all seven countries saw Nato and its 30 individual member states as the main defenders of Ukrainian sovereignty, but also clearly felt the EU bore a strong responsibility to come to Ukraine\u2019s defence in the event of Russian aggression. In Finland, 56% of respondents felt the EU would be well positioned to come to Ukraine\u2019s aid and 59% thought Nato would. Elsewhere, the figures were: 53% and 55% for France; 47% and 50% for Germany; 64% and 67% for Italy; 80% and 79% for Poland; 57% and 63% for Romania; and 61% and 64% for Sweden. Asked who they most trusted to protect EU citizens\u2019 interests if Russia did invade Ukraine, at least half of those surveyed in each country \u2013 rising to more than 60% in Poland, Sweden, Italy, and Romania \u2013 said they trusted the EU. In two countries, Sweden and Finland, trust in the EU was even greater than in Nato. Trust in Washington as being equally committed to defending EU citizens\u2019 interests was markedly lower, with more respondents in all countries bar Poland and Romania saying they trusted Germany more than the US. Even in Poland, Nato (75%) and the EU (67%) were seen as more reliable than the US. \u201cWhile most Europeans still trust Nato to defend Europe, \u2018Nato\u2019 is no longer just another name for \u2018the US\u2019,\u201d the authors said. \u201cEuropeans trust Nato to protect their interests more than they trust the US to do so.\u201d The study also proves \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, they said: despite London\u2019s \u201cmuch-publicised show of solidarity with Kyiv\u201d, few saw a role for the UK. Only in Poland (66%) and Sweden (52%) did majorities feel Britain should come to Ukraine\u2019s aid. The study also showed Europeans were prepared to accept significant, potentially long-term threats as a result of defending Ukraine, including the possible arrival of large numbers of refugees, higher energy costs, economic coercion, cyber-attacks and the threat of Russian military action. Respondents in Poland, Romania and Sweden were more likely to say that coming to Ukraine\u2019s aid was \u201cworth the risk\u201d of all these possible consequences, with 53% of those surveyed in Poland in particular saying that supporting Ukraine was even worth the risk of possible military action aimed at their country. Perhaps critically, however, citizens in France and Germany were the least willing to bear any of these potential burdens \u2013 suggesting they believed the possible costs of doing so may outweigh the rewards, the report\u2019s authors said. Majorities in all countries apart from Sweden (47%) said energy dependency was the biggest single challenge from Russia\u2019s stance towards Ukraine, a view that was most pronounced in Poland (77%). Putin may be surprised to see that many Europeans \u201cwould see another Russian invasion of Ukraine as an attack on not just a neighbouring country, but on the European security order itself\u201d, the authors concluded. \u201cAnd it is striking that so many respondents \u2013 from north, south, east, and west \u2013 think this order should be protected.\u201d With some clearly less willing to bear the cost than others, \u201cthe way Europeans deal with the next few weeks will be pivotal to the future of European security\u201d, they said."

            "date": "2022-02-13T15:50:36Z",
            "content": "The unprecedented Russian military encirclement of Ukraine has not only brought closer the prospect of a devastating war in that country, it has also raised the risks of triggering an unintended wider conflict. The US and Nato have been adamant that their troops will not enter Ukraine no matter what happens, and the Pentagon has pulled out the 160 national guard soldiers who were acting as military advisers. Even during the cold war, Washington and Russia made sure their forces did not clash, and Joe Biden has made clear he would seek to keep it that way. \u201cThat\u2019s a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another,\u201d Biden said. However, the massing of Russian troops in Belarus and the deployment of a substantial Russian naval force in the Black Sea, matched on a smaller scale by Nato land, sea and air reinforcements on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank, means there is far more military hardware in close proximity than is normal. And with proximity comes the increased danger of accidents and unintended consequences. \u201cThe risk of something going down like a mid-air collision, or a trigger-happy Russian or American, can really escalate things quickly,\u201d said Danny Sjursen, a former army major and director of the Eisenhower Media Network. \u201cYou\u2019re setting yourself up for accidents and miscalculation, and that\u2019s when you can get out of control real quick, because there are domestic considerations both in Russia and in the United States. An American pilot dies \u2013 now what? I\u2019m not saying that necessarily means we go to cataclysmic nuclear war but it escalates things.\u201d The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CBS News on Sunday that the US had sought to be transparent about its troop deployments in eastern Europe in order \u201cto avoid mistake, miscalculation or escalation and also to send a very clear message to Russia we will defend every inch of Nato territory\u201d. There is a long history of close encounters over the Baltic and Black Seas. Earlier this month US jet fighters scrambled to intercept Russian warplanes operating close to Nato airspace while British and Norwegian planes took off to monitor Russian aircraft flying into the North Sea. While Russia has shut off large parts of the Black Sea to conduct its manoeuvres, Nato navies have stayed out of the immediate vicinity for now, while building up their presence in the Mediterranean. If they do decide to go through the Bosphorus in a show of strength, or to safeguard commercial shipping, the risk will rise again. Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said the danger was further heightened by Russia\u2019s suspected use of \u201cGPS spoofing\u201d, interference with the navigational equipment of other vessels. On several occasions recently, civilian ships traveling in the Black Sea have encountered mysterious GPS troubles that showed the vessels being in a different part of the Black Sea or even on land. It was widely though the incidents were caused by Russia testing its technology. \u201cIt raises the risk for naval vessels that are in the Black Sea, which we should remember is not that big, and it\u2019s crowded,\u201d Braw said. \u201cThere\u2019s enormous shipping activity in the Black Sea, and so all those crews face the risk of having no GPS.\u201d The transfer of combat troops from Russia\u2019s far east to Belarus has not only significantly increased the imminent threat to Ukraine, but also made eastern European Nato members increasingly nervous. \u201cThe closest training ranges in Belarus are 150 to 200km from Vilnius or Warsaw,\u201d said Kristjan M\u00e4e, the head of the Nato and EU department at Estonia\u2019s ministry of defence. \u201cThis is a Russian force posture that hasn\u2019t been there previously.\u201d A refugee crisis at the Polish-Belarus border last year led to a close encounter between the troops facing each other, with Warsaw complaining that Belarus forces opened fire in the direction of their soldiers. \u201cWe have to remember that the people who are actually out on the frontline are very young men and women and they face enormous responsibility,\u201d Braw said. \u201cYes there is a chain of command but if there is some sort of provocation or aggression, intentional or unintentional, that is directed against them, then they have to respond.\u201d The close encounters so far have occurred in peacetime. In the event of war, nerves will be far more on edge, communications could be hampered or flooded with disinformation. \u201cWe cannot be entirely confident that in the lead-up to or during a conflict that Nato and Russia will be able to communicate, especially as current civil and military communication systems between them are not as robust or technically resilient as they should be,\u201d Sahil Shah, a policy fellow at the European Leadership Network, said. \u201cThe world\u2019s two largest nuclear-armed states have returned to the brink of conflict exactly 60 years after the Cuban missile crisis. If diplomacy is not pursued to the fullest extent, the risks of miscalculation and miscommunication could potentially pull in wider Europe into a devastating war. Without dialogue on how to manage de-escalation, it will be as if our leaders are running into a monsoon with newspapers over their heads.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-25T08:32:09Z",
            "content": "Charities have urged the UK government to welcome refugees from the conflict in Ukraine on the same scale as the thousands of families from the Balkans resettled during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s. In a letter to the Times, the charities, which include Save the Children, Amnesty International and the Refugee Council, asked the UK to lead international cooperation to \u201chandle a sudden increase in the number of people forced to flee\u201d the conflict, which threatens to be the most significant in Europe since the collapse of Yugoslavia. The US has warned that 5 million people could be displaced by the conflict. The UK government said its priority was to support British nationals and their families in Ukraine, and the government position was that people fleeing persecution should seek safety in the first safe country they reach. An estimated 100,000 Ukrainians are already internally displaced after fleeing their homes to escape attack, while footage on social media shows lines of cars heading west into neighbouring Poland, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary. The UN has appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking safety. The letter from dozens of charities urged the government to implement a \u201cwell-resourced initiative working with councils across the country\u201d to support Ukrainians in search of sanctuary, similar to the evacuation and resettlement programme during the Balkan conflict. Visa applications from Ukraine for people who are not related to British nationals are currently suspended, meaning there is no legal route directly from Ukraine for them to enter the UK and claim asylum. A source told the BBC the government was \u201cscenario-planning\u201d for an increase in asylum seekers from Ukraine. The charities said the crisis \u201cilluminates the crucial flaw\u201d in the nationality and borders bill, which discriminates against refugees who reach UK shores by illegal means, such as by boat across the channel. The charities wrote: \u201cWe urge the government to rethink this harmful bill and uphold our proud record of helping those fleeing war and oppression.\u201d The prime minister has announced that the UK has 1,000 military troops on standby to support a humanitarian crisis in Europe, should they need to be called upon. On Thursday, the Home Office confirmed that work, study or visit visas would be temporarily extended for some Ukrainians in the UK, or they would be able to apply for family visas or points-based immigration without leaving the country. This would grant them additional time to potentially find a job and stay in the UK for longer. Those already on the point-based system will be able to stay longer and seasonal agricultural workers will have their visas automatically extended until the end of the year. A government spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority has been to support British nationals and their families in Ukraine. This has included temporarily waiving application fees for those eligible under the family migration route, allowing entry for 12 months for others who did not meet the requirements and fast-tracking visas. \u201cWe continue to work with our international partners on a range of issues as the situation develops, including migration. \u201cThe main Visa Application Centre in Kyiv has closed following the Russian Invasion but our centre in Lviv remains open for family members of British Nationals resident in Ukraine, and we have surged staff to the centres in nearby countries, including Poland, Moldova, Romania and Hungary. \u201cUkrainian nationals are able to apply for visas from these centres and we have announced concessions for Ukrainians currently in the UK, to extend or switch their visa.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 February 2022. An earlier version said that because visa applications from Ukraine for people who are not related to British nationals are currently suspended, there is no legal route for them to enter the UK and claim asylum. To clarify: there is no legal route directly from Ukraine for them to do this."

            "content": "The Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, is reportedly mediating over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, although his spokesperson has acknowledged he would have \u201climited\u201d influence. The move comes amid pressure from campaigners and MPs for Abramovich to be targeted by western sanctions. He made his first public comment since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, via his Chelsea spokesperson, to claim his help had been requested. \u201cI can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since,\u201d his spokesperson said. \u201cConsidering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement.\u201d The request for his intervention came from the Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky. No further details about his role, if any, have been given. Abramovich has passed the stewardship of Chelsea to the trustees of the club\u2019s charitable foundation, although he remains the owner. Provided he is not sanctioned, he can continue to fund the club. He has disputed reports of his alleged close relationship with Vladimir Putin and denied there is any merit to sanctions being imposed against him. Last week the Labour MP Chris Bryant used parliamentary privilege to say that Abramovich was identified by the Home Office in 2019 as having links to the Russian state as well as to \u201ccorrupt activity and practices\u201d. Quoting from a leaked Home Office document, Bryant said the UK should seize Abramovich\u2019s assets and bar him from owning Chelsea. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has claimed the UK has a \u201chit list\u201d of Russian oligarchs who will face sanctions over the coming weeks, and said there would be \u201ca rolling programme of sanctions\u201d once the cases against individuals were legally watertight. \u201cWe are targeting oligarchs\u2019 private jets, we\u2019ll be targeting their properties, we\u2019ll be targeting other possessions that they have,\u201d she told Sky\u2019s Trevor Phillips on Sunday. \u201cThere will be nowhere to hide.\u201d Truss also said the government would be bringing forward its long-awaited economic crime bill this week to make it easier for assets to be targeted, by enforcing more transparency about ownership. So far only eight Russian oligarchs have been identified as being subject to individual UK sanctions but officials are understood to be examining more than 100 individuals as potential targets, with more names expected to be released in the coming days."

            "content": "The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will announce $804m for strategic and scientific programs in Antarctica over the next decade as the government flags its intention to increase Australia\u2019s role in the increasingly contested region. Announcing the funding pledge in the key Tasmanian seat of Lyons on Tuesday, Morrison will talk up the commitment as a \u201cclear international signal of Australia\u2019s world-leading Antarctic leadership\u201d. The package \u2013 about half of which is committed over the next five years \u2013 will include $136m for charting activities, mobile stations and traverse capability, and $109m for a new drone fleet, autonomous vehicles and medium lift helicopters. This will allow the government to map \u201cinaccessible and fragile areas of east Antarctic\u201d, and set up a new \u201cAntarctic eye\u201d program that will monitor parts of the continent with integrated sensors and cameras that provide real-time information. The helicopters, which have a range of 550km, will allow researchers to travel to parts of the continent that have not previously been accessible using the government research vessel RSV Nuyina as a launchpad. \u201cThe money we are investing in drone fleets, helicopters and other vehicles will enable us to explore areas of east Antarctica\u2019s inland that no country has ever been able to reach before,\u201d Morrison said ahead of Tuesday\u2019s announcement. \u201cMy government will continue to back our world-class scientists and expeditioners with the necessary funding and resources, because their research on the frozen continent and in the Southern Ocean is critically important to Australia\u2019s future.\u201d A range of other projects under the package will focus on new scientific endeavours, including $7.4m for research focused on Antarctic ice sheet science to build global understanding of climate change impacts. The government said this will improve Australia\u2019s ability \u201cto support Pacific partners to monitor information about climate and oceans, including sea level rise\u201d. Last year, ice scientists warned that parts of the massive Thwaites glacier in west Antarctica \u2013 about the size of Great Britain \u2013 could fracture and collapse within five years, accelerating the rate of sea level rises. The package will also include $4.7m for RSV Nuyina to conduct extended science voyages, while $17.4m will be committed for marine science in the Southern Ocean and a new state-of-the-art krill aquarium in Hobart. Another $14.3m will be committed for environmental management, including a \u201cCleaner Antarctica Strategy\u201d to remove legacy waste. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, said that in the face of increasing pressures in the region, there was \u201cstrategic importance\u201d in Australia\u2019s pursuit of scientific leadership. \u201cWe need to ensure that the Antarctic remains a place of science and conservation, one that is free from conflict and which is protected from exploitation,\u201d Ley said. From 2026-27, the government will allocate an extra $92.2m a year for further support of Antarctic activities, which is also included in the $804m figure. The announcement comes amid a debate about how Australia should be protecting its interests in the Antarctic territories, where China has become increasingly assertive, particularly over fishery access. The issue came to a head after Ley scrapped plans to build a 2.7km concrete runway on Antarctica, prompting China hawks within the Coalition to blast the decision as \u201cretrograde\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A Lowy Institute paper published last year said that China \u201cwants to benefit economically, and potentially militarily, from Antarctica\u201d, and was pushing the terms of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), primarily over fisheries access, and was active on the ice. It said that prior to 2016, China\u2019s Antarctic stations and science \u201cseemed designed to position it for a territorial claim in the AAT if the Antarctic Treaty were overturned at some point in the future\u201d. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Marise Payne, said the investment was a clear marker of Australia\u2019s \u201cenduring commitment to the Antarctic Treaty system\u201d and Australia\u2019s leadership within it. The funding package allocates $3.4m to enhance Australia\u2019s international engagement \u201cto support the rules and norms of the Antarctic Treaty system and promote Australia\u2019s leadership in Antarctic affairs.\u201d Morrison said the investment in Antarctica would directly support jobs in Australia, and particularly in Tasmania, \u201cwith Australian businesses, contractors, medical suppliers and providers reaping the benefits of local procurement.\u201d The prime minister has begun the week campaigning in the Tasmanian marginal seats of Bass and Lyons, which are crucial to the Coalition\u2019s chances of remaining in government. On Monday, he visited a winery with the member for the seat of Bass, Bridget Archer, who has clashed with Morrison over his failure to deliver on an election commitment for an integrity commission and the government\u2019s proposed religious discrimination laws. Archer crossed the floor on both issues. Morrison said that Archer was a \u201cfiery\u201d member of his team, but said the Liberal party \u201cdon\u2019t throw someone out\u201d if they have disagreements. \u201cIt\u2019s called Liberal for a reason. The Labor party throw people out when they speak up on important issues to them,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cBridget, I know, is passionate. Bridget has come with life experience to our team that I greatly value and I greatly respect. You know, we love Bridge. We really do. And I\u2019m really pleased she\u2019s on my team, and she\u2019s on my team and she\u2019s a fiery member of my team and she\u2019s a fiery member for Bass.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 February 2022.

            "content": "Defense and cybersecurity stocks are seeing a sharp rise in values as investors take note of pledges by the EU to boost defense spending and governments warn of an increased threat of cyber intrusions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. US stock markets seesawed again on Monday as the war in Ukraine escalated. Most of the major US markets closed lower after regaining some of their losses, but defense contractors continued to gain as investors bet their businesses would benefit from the conflict. Raytheon Technologies, the US defense giant and maker of the Stinger ground-to-air missile that Germany has pledged to supply to Ukrainian forces, has seen its shares price increase more than 10% since the invasion began last Wednesday. Raytheon\u2019s stock rose over 4.6% on Monday and has risen more than 18% this year. Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-35 fighter jet, advanced more than 5.4% on Monday. The company, with Raytheon, is the manufacturer of the Patriot missile defense system set to be deployed with the Nato battlegroup in Slovakia. Northrop Grumman, leading manufacturer of attack and surveillance drones, saw its stock rise close to 7% on Monday, after rising 3% since the Ukrainian conflict began. Huntington Ingalls Industries, the largest US military shipbuilder, is up over 7%. By contrast, the US Dow Jones Industrials has risen 760 points since 23 February to close at 33,892 on Monday. Outside the US, Britain\u2019s BAE Systems, the largest defense contractor in Europe, Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall, France\u2019s Thales and Italy\u2019s Leonardo have all seen their share prices rise sharply. The jump in defense stocks comes after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that defense spending in Europe\u2019s biggest economy will be increased to 2% of gross domestic product, from an estimated 1.5% in 2021. While the US and its allies haven\u2019t intervened in the conflict on the ground, they have been supplying arms and financial backing. Over the weekend, Germany said it would supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles so it can defend itself against Russia, and it vowed to channel about $113bn into its military this year. \u201cIf Germany is feeling pressure to bolster its military and defense systems in this way, other countries are likely to follow suit,\u201d said Investor Place in a note. \u201cThis means that companies that produce military technology and weapons are likely to see a significant spike in demand throughout the coming months. Wall Street will be keeping a close watch on defense stocks as the industry prepares for a boom.\u201d But defense analysts have also raised concerns that some companies, including Raytheon, also supply Russian civil use aircraft makers. In a speech last week, Joe Biden said his administration\u2019s actions and those of allies aimed to \u201ccut off more than half of Russia\u2019s hi-tech imports, and we\u2019ll strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military\u201d. That comes as defense contractors watch for signs that the Pentagon will ask Congress for additional funding to pay for increased costs, including the deployment of 7,000 US troops to Europe and the cost of additional surveillance flights. \u201cRussia\u2019s actions in Ukraine have renewed the arguments for higher US defense spending and I think we\u2019re likely to see it grow more than previously expected,\u201d said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Congress is set to approve a Department of Defense (DoD) budget of $740bn for 2022-2023. The DoD has been in the process of shifting focus to the Asia-Pacific region. But Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine could alter that calculation, Harrison said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see more of split focus around counter-Russia in Europe in the short term and countering China in the Pacific in the long term.\u201d While the conflict stands to benefit companies that rely largely on defense work, shares of cybersecurity software companies have also risen on expectations of increased spending on security-related services. Among exchange-traded (ETF) funds that track the sector, the Global X Cybersecurity ETF rose 3.6% and is up more than 12% over the past three trading sessions. Morgan Stanley wrote that the heightened geopolitical tension \u201cwill continue to provide a strong tailwind for cybersecurity stocks\u201d. Among companies that stand to gain are the cloud storage security firm Zscaler, Crowdstrike Holdings, which markets anti-ransomware services, and Fortinet, a maker of network security systems. \u201cAnytime there is a new threat announced, or there\u2019s a hack or ransomware attack, that\u2019s effectively an advertisement for cybersecurity as something that companies and other organizations need to be investing in,\u201d Hilary Frisch, an analyst at ClearBridge Investments, told Bloomberg this month."

            "title": "UK reports first budget surplus in Covid crisis despite rising inflation",
            "date": "2022-02-22T08:10:50Z",
            "content": "The UK government has recorded the first monthly budget surplus since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, despite a weaker than expected January performance as rising inflation pushed up debt interest costs. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing was in surplus of \u00a32.9bn last month \u2013 the first month in which income outstripped expenditure since January 2020. January is typically a net positive month for the public finances because of the timing of self-assessed income tax payments. Borrowing last month was \u00a35.4bn less than in January 2021, when the third national lockdown affected the UK economy. Despite the return to the black, the surplus was still smaller than that recorded in January 2020 before the onset of Covid-19. City economists had also forecast a bigger boost for the public finances of \u00a33.5bn. The figures come as rising inflation pushes up the government\u2019s debt servicing costs, fuelled by a surge in the retail prices index to which index-linked gilts are pegged. The ONS said accrued interest payments on central government debt were \u00a36.1bn in January, the highest for that month since records began in April 1997. Alongside rising inflationary pressure, the record rise in government borrowing during the pandemic has pushed up the stock of national debt to levels unseen since the early 1960s. The ONS said the national debt \u2013 the total amount owed by the state accumulated over the years \u2013 was \u00a32.3tn, or about 94.9% of gross domestic product (GDP). Rishi Sunak said the rise in the national debt and higher rates of inflation were putting additional pressure on the public finances. \u201cKeeping the public finances on a sustainable path is crucial so we can continue helping the British people when needed, without burdening future generations with high debt repayments,\u201d he said. Economists said central government receipts were stronger than anticipated by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s tax and spending watchdog. Borrowing between April and January 2021 was \u00a3139bn, below the OBR\u2019s year-to-date forecast of \u00a3156bn. Michal Stelmach, a senior economist at KPMG UK, said he expected the OBR would revise down its borrowing projection for the 2021-22 financial year by about \u00a320bn, although much of that would be taken up by the government\u2019s \u00a39bn package of energy support measures. \u201cThe underlying picture for borrowing in January is better than today\u2019s data suggest. About 20% of taxpayers have not submitted their self-assessment tax return on time this year, taking advantage of the extended window set by HMRC.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-11T11:48:46Z",
            "content": "Cressida Dick was \u201cthe most defensive and dismissive\u201d leader of a British police force, with problems worsening under her tenure as Scotland Yard\u2019s commissioner, the leader of the National Black Police Association (NBPA) has said. Dick announced her departure on Thursday after a falling out with London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who lacked confidence that she could improve an allegedly misogynistic, racist and closed culture blighting Britain\u2019s biggest force. Insp Andy George, the president of the NBPA, praised Dick\u2019s decades of public service but said it was right she should stand down. George, a former firearms officer based in Northern Ireland, said Dick had been brought down by her \u201cachilles heel\u201d of wanting to protect the Met\u2019s reputation. He said the next commissioner needed to end a \u201cculture of fear\u201d and a \u201ctoxic culture\u201d in the Met. The ousting of Dick triggered criticism of Khan, praise for the outgoing commissioner, as well as relief that Dick\u2019s tumultuous commissionership was coming to an end. George said: \u201cThe news that Dame Cressida Dick has resigned from leading the Metropolitan police service has come with great sadness across policing. Her devotion to officers and staff was clear for all to see but this was ultimately her achilles heel and her desire to protect the reputation of the force has prevented the wholesale cultural reforms that are much needed. \u201cThe vast majority of police officers put on their uniform and do their best to protect the public but time and again we have seen a culture of fear within the [Met]. A fear of challenging inappropriate behaviour and even when that behaviour is challenged, it is rarely dealt with robustly. The officer reporting discrimination can often find themselves being targeted for speaking out. \u201cDefending the indefensible and failing to tackle the widespread issues of racism, misogyny and bullying allows bullies and poor behaviour to thrive and does a disservice to the many hardworking police officers across London and the UK. I have the privilege of speaking to many leaders in policing and I found Dame Cressida Dick to be the most defensive and dismissive leader I meet.\u201d However, critics of Khan said Londoners were less safe as a result of Dick\u2019s departure. Asked if Dick\u2019s departure meant Londoners were less safe, the chair of the London assembly\u2019s police and crime committee, Susan Hall, said it did, and pointed to the turmoil that would now follow. She said the mayor was wrong to have put Dick on notice. \u201cNinety-nine per cent of officers are really good, very good brave officers and they have been absolutely rocked by the latest IOPC [Independent Office for Police Conduct] report into misogyny. They need confidence. They need support and to have done this in this way is completely wrong,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIt will leave a void at the top as opposed to a properly managed handover, which is no way to run a service like this, no way to run the Metropolitan police.\u201d Last Wednesday Khan had put Dick on notice that she had to rapidly reform Scotland Yard or would lose his support. His confidence in her was shaken to breaking point by a scandal at Charing Cross police station where officers shared racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic messages. Two of the officers investigated were promoted, while nine were left to serve in the Met. Her resignation comes less than three weeks after the Met announced a criminal inquiry into lockdown parties in Downing Street. Dick, the first female leader in the Met\u2019s 193-year history, has led the force since 2017, with her five-year term as commissioner due to end in April this year. Her contract was extended by two years to 2024 only last September by the home secretary, Priti Patel, a decision endorsed by Khan. In a statement Dick made it clear she had been forced out: \u201cIt is with huge sadness that, following contact with the mayor of London today, it is clear that the mayor no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue. He has left me no choice but to step aside as commissioner of the Metropolitan police service.\u201d Khan in effect picked Dick as commissioner in 2017, thrilled by the historic legacy of the first woman commissioner in the history of the Met, which was founded in 1829."

            "content": "Some of the world\u2019s greatest directors launched their careers with an idea, a few thousand pounds and some friends with spare time on their hands. Those same friends would often go on to make up the bulk of the audience. But Netflix is giving Britain\u2019s next big thing a chance to show their debut feature to the single biggest viewership the world has ever amassed \u2013 and is giving them a seven-figure sum to make it. An unknown director, producer or writer will be given \u00a31.5m and a global launch on the streaming service, in an effort to discover a future generation of \u201cbold, distinctive\u201d UK storytellers. The scheme, to be announced on Wednesday, will allow the directors to make anything from crime thrillers and sci-fi to romance and comedy, driven by the principle that \u201cdaring\u201d film-making can \u201cdrive commercial as well as critical success and can emerge from all backgrounds\u201d. At least one project will be picked from six shortlisted film-makers, who will each have received \u00a330,000 to develop their projects over a year, with intensive training from industry mentors. Netflix will accept applications from across the creative spectrum \u2013 theatre, TV, video gaming, online content, commercials, graphic novels, music promos and short films. The programme, titled Breakout, will be open to film-makers who have not yet made a feature but whose work has already attracted industry or public attention. One of the biggest challenges for any film-maker, particularly a first-time one, is raising money for their film. Hannah Perks, Netflix\u2019s manager of UK films, said the \u00a31.5m budget would allow them to focus on the creative side. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to have to think about putting that financing together \u2013 and their film will be shown on Netflix globally. It\u2019s every film-maker\u2019s dream to have a global release.\u201d Breakout will proactively encourage submissions from underrepresented groups to reflect the full range of voices in modern Britain. Perks singled out for praise productions such as His House, an acclaimed horror film about the plight of Sudanese refugees in a spooky council house, a debut feature by the British writer-director Remi Weekes, who had previously made shorts and commercials. She said: \u201cAlthough it\u2019s about new talent, it\u2019s about people who are film creatives, but who might also have worked in advertising, music videos or photography, and who haven\u2019t had a chance to make a feature film but who have ideas. It\u2019s about giving them a really healthy budget to make something that can be on Netflix and hopefully kickstart their career as film-makers \u2013 especially British film-makers, making commercial films our audiences love. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got as many British films as we\u2019d like on the service. That\u2019s a key reason why we\u2019re doing this. We want to get more British film-makers, up-and-coming film-makers.\u201d The programme is a collaboration with Creative UK, which supports the creative industries. Paul Ashton, its head of film and television, said: \u201cTalent is everywhere but opportunity is not, and from our very first conversation it was clear that Netflix shared our desire to offer career-changing opportunities to film talent in the UK.\u201d Netflix, which is streaming in more than 30 languages and 190 countries, is the UK\u2019s the most popular streaming service, with an estimated 14 million subscribers at the end of last year. Last September it announced it would provide training opportunities on its UK-based productions, including Sex Education, The Witcher and Top Boy."

            "content": "Why did the chicken cross the road? To break into the Pentagon, apparently. Or is it now the Hentagon \u2013 and is America about to have a new peck-retary of defense? A wandering chicken was caught sneaking around a security area at the Pentagon this week, a local animal welfare organization said. The hen was found running loose early Monday morning near the US Department of Defense headquarters on the outskirts of Washington DC, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, Virginia wrote on social media. \u201cApparently, the answer to \u2018why did the chicken cross the road\u2019 is to get to the Pentagon,\u201d the group posted. The chicken was taken into custody by one of the league\u2019s employees. Chelsea Jones, a spokesperson for the organization, said in an email that she couldn\u2019t reveal the precise location where the bird was spotted. \u201cWe are not allowed to disclose exactly where she was found,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe can only say it was at a security checkpoint.\u201d It\u2019s also unclear where the chicken came from or how she got to the Pentagon. The hen \u2013 which has brown feathers and a red comb and wattles \u2013 is a Rhode Island red. Jones described the bird as \u201csweet\u201d and \u201cnervous\u201d but said the animal has permitted some people to pet her. The Animal Welfare League asked people online for name suggestions, prompting various creative responses. \u201cI mean, chicken found on the military installation \u2026 I suggest Colonel Sanderson,\u201d one user wrote. Another said, \u201cChick Cheney, after the former Defense Secretary and VP.\u201d \u201cHentagon!\u201d someone else wrote. Similarly, another user said, \u201cHenrietta Kissinger?\u201d in reference to Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not a joke that this chicken will prompt Congress to increase Department of Defense spending by $12 billion,\u201d tweeted Martin Austermuhle, a web and radio producer for WAMU 88.5. The Animal Welfare League eventually chose Henny Penny for the chicken, one of the names given to the chicken that thinks \u201cthe sky is falling\u201d in the folktale. This one has gained notoriety of her own: Jimmy Fallon performed a song about her on The Tonight Show. \u201cAre you a normal clucker or an undercover spy,\u201d Fallon sang on his Tuesday episode. Jones said Henny Penny is being adopted by a staff member who has a small farm in western Virginia."

            "date": "2022-02-03T09:35:06Z",
            "content": "The US decision to deploy more than 3,000 US troops in Germany, Poland and Romania is a \u201cdestructive step\u201d that makes it harder to reach a compromise over Ukraine, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister has said, as Moscow continues to build up its forces. Alexander Grushko said the move by Joe Biden would \u201cincrease military tension and reduce scope for political decision\u201d, and would \u201cdelight\u201d Ukrainian authorities, who would continue sabotaging the Minsk agreements \u201cwith impunity\u201d. The Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015 were designed to reach a political settlement in the east of Ukraine, including greater autonomy. The US said on Wednesday it was sending 1,700 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division to Poland, while a headquarters unit of about 300 from the 18th Airborne Corps will move to Germany and a 1,000-strong armoured unit was being transferred from Germany to Romania. The move is in response to Russia\u2019s deployment of an estimated more than 125,000 troops within striking distance of the Ukrainian border, including nearly half of its available battalion tactical groups and support units. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesperson, said the US movements were \u201cdesigned to deter aggression and enhance our defensive capabilities in frontline allied states. We expect them to move in coming days.\u201d Vladimir Putin \u201ccontinues to add forces, combined arms, offensive capabilities; even over just the last 24 hours he continues to add in western Russia and Belarus, and in the Mediterranean and the north Atlantic\u201d, Kirby added. \u201cHe has shown no signs of being interested or willing to de-escalate the tensions.\u201d Meanwhile, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday that Russia had been moving 30,000 combat troops and modern weapons to Belarus in recent days, Moscow\u2019s biggest military deployment to the country since the end of the cold war. The deployment included Spetsnaz special operations forces, Su-35 fighter jets, dual capable Iskander missiles and S-400 air defence systems, Stoltenberg said. \u201cAll this will be combined with Russia\u2019s annual nuclear forces exercise,\u201d he added. The term \u201cdual capable\u201d, which Stoltenberg used for the Iskander missiles, is used to describe weapons meant for conventional and nuclear warfare. The moves come ahead of a fresh flurry of diplomacy. On Wednesday Boris Johnson warned Putin in a phone call that any further incursion into Ukraine would be \u201ca tragic miscalculation\u201d, according to Downing Street. The Kremlin account of the call said Putin had complained that his demand for security guarantees had not been met and accused the Kyiv government of \u201cthe chronic sabotage\u201d of the Minsk agreements. On Thursday the Turkish president and wildcard of Nato diplomacy, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, will fly to Kyiv to offer himself again in the role of mediator between Ukraine and Russia. The Erdo\u011fan mediation proposal has not yet been picked up by Russia but Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, and \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n, the chief adviser to Erdo\u011fan, spoke on Tuesday about their commitment to \u201cdeter further Russian aggression against Ukraine\u201d, according to a White House statement. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, was also due to speak to Putin on Wednesday evening, their third conversation in less than a week. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Wednesday night that he would meet Putin in Moscow \u201csoon\u201d, without providing a precise date. Scholz, who faces criticism at home and abroad for acting too passively over the Ukraine crisis, said \u201cendangering the territorial sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine would come at a very high price\u201d and that Russia was aware of this. While the former German chancellor turned Russian gas lobbyist Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has accused Ukraine of \u201csabre rattling\u201d, Scholz said he was not taking advice from his centre-left predecessor. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him for advice, and he didn\u2019t give me any,\u201d Scholz told the broadcaster ZDF. Biden and Macron pledged to coordinate their response to the crisis in a phone call on Wednesday, while the French leader\u2019s office said he would be talking to Putin again on Thursday evening. The decision to deploy US troops follows diplomatic efforts that have so far failed to deliver any progress in defusing the crisis. The Kremlin claims it has China\u2019s support in the standoff \u2013 backing that would be demonstrated when Putin meets Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was the latest Nato leader to visit Kyiv on Wednesday in a show of support, meeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. After the talks, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was focused \u201conly on peace\u201d, but that it had the right to defend itself. Rutte said it was \u201cessential for dialogue to continue\u201d between Russia and the other players. There has also been exchange of documents over the past few weeks between the US, Nato and Russia setting out their respective positions on European security, and a series of phone calls between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The US has suggested a number of areas for negotiation and possible confidence-building measures but has insisted there can be no compromise over Ukraine\u2019s right to join Nato. The alliance has also stated that is non-negotiable. Russia\u2019s central demand is for guarantees that Nato will not expand farther eastward."

            "date": "2022-02-09T06:00:44Z",
            "content": "One in five applicants to the white supremacist group Patriot Front claimed to hold current or former ties to the US military, according to leaked documents published and reviewed by the Southern Poverty Law Center and alternative media collective Unicorn Riot. Some 18 out of the 87 applicants, or 21%, said they were currently or previously affiliated with the military. One applicant, who claimed to be a former Marine, also said he currently worked for the Department of Homeland Security, according to the SPLC\u2019s Hatewatch, a blog that tracks and exposes activities of American rightwing extremists. A white supremacist and neo-fascist hate group, Patriot Front emerged as a rebrand of the neo-Nazi organization Vanguard America in the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. According to the SPLC, the Patriot Front \u201crepresents one of the most prominent white supremacist groups in the country\u201d and is led by Thomas Rousseau, a 23-year old man based in Dallas, Texas. \u201cA nation within a nation is our goal. Our people face complete annihilation as our culture and heritage are attacked from all sides,\u201d Rousseau once said. In January, Unicorn Riot published over 400 gigabytes of data that included \u201costensibly private, unedited videos and direct messages [that] reveal a campaign to organize acts of hatred while indoctrinating teenagers into national socialism (Nazism),\u201d the journalist collective said. Group members and applicants expressed an open admiration for Nazi ideologies, with the latter expressing various motivations for joining the group. One applicant, who said he lived in San Diego, claimed to be a current DHS employee and told Patriot Front he was inspired to join after he \u201cfound out about the Jews while in the marines\u201d. Another applicant used derogatory language about LGBTQ+ people and said he \u201cfirst saw\u201d them during his time in the military. Someone else from Salt Lake City said he \u201cshifted focus and questioned things\u201d after his second deployment and went from being a Republican to joining the far right. Applicants also touted their various skill sets, including \u201cgreat land-navigation, great physical fitness, able to clear rooms\u201d and \u201cbasic medical training\u201d. Others said they had been \u201ctrained in firearms\u201d. One claimed to train people in \u201cmarine corps martial arts\u201d and said he was the leader of the Kansas Active Club, an affiliate of the Rise Above Movement, a Southern California-based SPLC-designated hate group. In addition to alleged military affiliations, the leak also revealed that the group targets minors. According to Unicorn Riot, Patriot Front recruits \u201cmembers through the internet who are still legally minors, indoctrinating them with white supremacist ideology and even encouraging them to lie to their parents so the group can transport them across state lines for fascist events\u201d. Patriot Front\u2019s official policies require members to be at least 17 and a half years old, but it \u201cgoes by a case by case basis\u201d with certain members being below that age. In the past year, there has been growing concern surrounding the far-right radicalization of current and former military members. More than 80 defendants charged for their affiliation with the deadly January 6 riots have been found to have ties to the military, with most being veterans. Last March, the Pentagon released a report that cited domestic extremist groups posing an increasing threat to the military by attempting to recruit service members and in certain situations join the military to gain combat experience. \u201cMilitary members are highly prized by these groups as they bring legitimacy to their causes and enhance their ability to carry out attacks,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn addition to potential violence, white supremacy and white nationalism pose a threat to the good order and discipline within the military,\u201d it added. In October, a House panel convened to discuss ways to address veterans being increasingly targeted for recruitment by extremist groups. \u201cThey provide them with a tribe, a simplistic view of the world and its problems, actionable solutions and a sense of purpose, and then they feed these vulnerable individuals a concoction of lies and an unrelenting narrative of political and social grievance,\u201d retired Marine Lt Col Joe Plenzler said at the panel. A study last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that in 2020, 6.4% of all domestic terror attacks and plots were committed by active-duty or reserve personnel, up from 1.5% in 2019 and none in 2018."

            "title": "Ukraine crisis: Russia has in place 70% of military needed for full invasion \u2013 US officials",
            "date": "2022-02-06T05:08:30Z",
            "content": "Russia has assembled at least 70% of the military firepower it intends to have in place by the middle of February to give President Vladimir Putin the option of launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, US officials have said. On Saturday, officials warned that a full Russian invasion could lead to the quick capture of Kyiv and potentially result in as many as 50,000 civilians killed or wounded, according to the New York Times and Washington Post. A US official confirmed that estimate to the Associated Press but it is not clear how US agencies determined those numbers. The grim assessment comes after British prime minister Boris Johnson agreed with French president Emmanuel Macron that the UK and its Nato allies would be united in their fight against Russian aggression \u201cwherever and however it might occur\u201d. European leaders are due to travel to both Moscow and Kyiv in a bid to calm tensions. Macron is expected to visit Moscow on Monday and Kyiv on Tuesday, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will travel to Kyiv on 14 February and to Moscow the next day. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss had been due to travel to Ukraine with the prime minister on Tuesday but had to drop out of the trip after testing positive for coronavirus. Truss will reportedly travel to Moscow soon. US officials said that, as of Friday, the Russian army had put in place near Ukraine a total of 83 \u201cbattalion tactical groups\u201d, each of which is roughly equivalent in size to an American battalion of between 750 and 1,000 soldiers. That is an increase from 60 battalion tactical groups in position just two weeks ago, they said. Another 14 battalion tactical groups are on their way to the border area from other parts of Russia, the officials said. Two officials said the US assesses that Russia would want a total of between 110 and 130 battalion tactical groups for use in a full-scale invasion, but Putin could decide on a more limited incursion. Including support units, Russia might be aiming to have 150,000 troops in place for a full-scale invasion, one official said, adding that the ongoing buildup could reach that level in the next couple of weeks. On Thursday, US officials claimed to have evidence of an elaborate plot by the Kremlin to make a \u201cvery graphic\u201d fake video of a Ukrainian attack as a pretext for a military invasion. Downing Street said on Friday it has \u201chigh confidence\u201d Russia is planning to fabricate a reason for attacking Ukraine. The US officials, who discussed internal assessments of the Russian buildup on condition they not be identified, sketched out a series of indicators suggesting Putin intends an invasion in coming weeks, although the size and scale are unclear. They stressed that a diplomatic solution appears to remain possible. Among those military indicators: an exercise of Russia\u2019s strategic nuclear forces that usually is held in autumn was rescheduled for mid-February to March. That coincides with what US officials see as the most likely window for invasion. The officials made no suggestion that a prospective conflict would involve the use of nuclear weapons, but the Russian exercise \u2013 likely involving the test-launching of unarmed long-range missiles on Russian territory \u2013 could be used as a message aimed at deterring the west from intervening in Ukraine. US officials have said in recent weeks that a Russian invasion could overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s military relatively quickly, although Moscow might find it difficult to sustain an occupation and cope with a potential insurgency. The ongoing Russian buildup comes as the Biden administration has been disclosing intelligence in hopes of pre-emptively countering Russian disinformation and blocking Putin\u2019s plans to create a pretext for an invasion. But it has come under criticism for not providing evidence to back up many of its claims. Army officials on Saturday announced that Major General Christopher Donahue, the commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division, arrived in Poland. About other 1,700 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne are deploying to Poland from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and 300 soldiers are deploying from Bragg to Germany. In addition, 1,000 Germany-based soldiers are shifting to Romania. Captain Matt Visser, spokesman for the 18th Airborne Corps, which includes the 82nd division, said: \u201cOur corps\u2019 presence serves to bolster existing US forces in Europe and demonstrates our commitment to our Nato allies and partners.\u201d The corps was made up of \u201ccombat capable forces who stand ready to enhance the alliance\u2019s ability to deter and defeat Russian aggression\u201d, the US statement added. Washington said last week it would send about 3,000 additional troops to eastern Europe to defend Nato members against any \u201caggression\u201d. With growing nervousness in Eastern Europe over Russia\u2019s buildup, much attention is focused on its placement of thousands of troops in Belarus, which shares a border not only with Ukraine but also with three Nato nations: Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. The Biden administration may soon shift some more troops within Europe to allied nations on Nato\u2019s eastern flank, a US official said on Saturday without specifying which nations. Defence secretary Lloyd Austin said last week that Putin could use any portion of the force he has assembled along Ukraine\u2019s borders to seize Ukrainian cities and \u201csignificant territories\u201d or to carry out \u201ccoercive acts or provocative political acts\u201d such as the recognition of breakaway territories inside Ukraine. Depending on Putin\u2019s ultimate objective, the Russian forces could attack Kyiv directly by moving south from current positions in southern Belarus. He might also send forces across the Russian border into eastern and southern Ukraine if his intent is to fracture and destroy a large portion of the Ukrainian army, the officials said. On the lower end of the scale of military action, Putin might order sabotage, cyberattacks and other destabilising actions inside Ukraine with the goal of removing the current government in Kyiv, officials have said.

            "title": "France announces military withdrawal from Mali after nine years",
            "date": "2022-02-17T11:44:48Z",
            "content": "France and its European partners are to begin a military withdrawal from Mali after more than nine years fighting a jihadist insurgency, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed on Thursday. Asked at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e if the withdrawal marked a failure for France and its policy of fighting terrorism in west Africa, Macron said: \u201cI completely reject that term.\u201d France first deployed troops against jihadists in Mali in 2013 under the Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. The intervention successfully stemmed the insurgents\u2019 advance and returned key cities such as Timbuktu to government control, but extremists swiftly regrouped. In recent years, jihadists have taken over swaths of territory in the former French colony, exploiting political turmoil, poverty and the weakness of local authorities. Macron said French forces would remain in the region but would be based in neighbouring Niger, from where they could help other countries suffering from jihadist activity. \u201cThe heart of this military operation will no longer be in Mali but in Niger \u2026 and perhaps in a more balanced way across all the countries of the region which want this [help],\u201d he said. Niger has its own significant problem with Islamic extremism, as does Burkina Faso, where thousands of people have died and more than a million been displaced in recent years. Despite Macron\u2019s statement, observers will nonetheless see the withdrawal as a humiliating end to a flagship overseas mission. The daily paper Le Monde wrote: \u201cIt is an inglorious end to an armed intervention that began in euphoria and which ends, nine years later, against a backdrop of crisis between Mali and France.\u201d Critics of French strategy in Mali have long accused policymakers in Paris of focusing on military force at the expense of politics. Relations between France and Mali have deteriorated after two coup d\u2019\u00e9tats and the new military regime\u2019s reluctance to agree to an immediate transition to civilian rule. The French ambassador to the former colony was expelled earlier this month, prompting celebrations in Bamako. The presence of Russian mercenary forces from the private military Wagner group has increased tension, with the EU accusing Mali\u2019s military regime of using them to shore up their own power. \u201cMultiple obstructions\u201d by the ruling junta meant conditions were no longer in place to operate in Mali, France and its African and European allies said in a statement. The withdrawal applies to 2,400 French troops in Mali and a smaller European force of several hundred, which was created in 2020 to reduce the burden on French forces. Mali\u2019s armed forces spokesperson Souleymane Dembele shrugged off France\u2019s announcement, saying European troops had failed. \u201cI think that there has been no military solution, because terrorism has engulfed the entire territory of Mali,\u201d he said. Macron said al-Qaida and Islamic State had made the Sahel region of west Africa and the Gulf of Guinea nations \u201ca priority for their strategy of expansion\u201d. Most experts say the dozens of factions and coalitions in the Sahel, a wide band of scrub and bush along the southern fringe of the Sahara, are only loosely associated with al-Qaida or IS and are primarily driven by local motives. However, there is no doubt that French and other European officials see Islamic militant activities in the Sahel as a significant long-term threat. Speaking alongside Macron, the Senegalese president, Macky Sall, said fighting terrorism in the Sahel \u201ccannot be the business of African countries alone\u201d. The Mali deployment has been fraught with problems for France. Of the 53 soldiers killed serving in its Barkhane mission in west Africa, 48 of them died in Mali. Macron\u2019s withdrawal statement comes before his expected announcement that he will be standing for re-election in April\u2019s presidential race. His opponents on the right have said France has been \u201chumiliated\u201d in Mali. Macron denied that France\u2019s intervention had been in vain. \u201cWhat would have happened in 2013 if France had not chosen to intervene? You would for sure have had the collapse of the Malian state,\u201d he said, hailing his predecessor\u2019s decision to order troops in. About 18,000 United Nations peacekeepers will remain in Mali, one of the biggest and most expensive such deployments in the world. The UN forces and hundreds of personnel in the European Union\u2019s EUTM and EUCAP training missions have relied on French troops for medical, aerial and emergency support. About 300 British troops have also been sent to Mali. France\u2019s army spokesperson Pascal Ianni said Paris would for now continue that support as long as local authorities allowed it."

            "content": "Police in Ottawa warned they may have to call in the military to disband \u201cunlawful\u201d protests in the nation\u2019s capital and a town near the US border, amid mounting tensions between protesters opposing Covid restrictions and local residents. The Ottawa police chief, Peter Sloly, warned on Wednesday that the officers did not have the resources to remove a fleet of trucks parked by the protesters in the national capital, adding the city was considering requesting help from Canadian armed forces. But he warned bringing in the military carried a \u201cmassive risk\u201d, adding that protesters are believed to have weapons. \u201cWe do not want riots, but all options remain on the table,\u201d he said. The police chief said that a \u201csignificant element\u201d in the United States was involved in organizing and funding the protests. A GoFundMe campaign to support the demonstration has raised more than C$10m (US$7.9m) in recent days for what began as a protest against a vaccine mandate for truck drivers but has increasingly become an avenue for far-right groups. Tamara Lich, the crowdfunding organizer, is part of the separatist Maverick party, and Patrick King has previously claimed the coronavirus vaccine is being used to \u201cdepopulate the white race\u201d. Officials expect more protesters to arrive in the city over the weekend, and described the situation \u201cvolatile\u201d. Residents have become increasingly frustrated with the blaring truck horns and a number of local businesses have shuttered. The Rideau Centre, a popular mall downtown, announced it would remain closed until 6 February. \u201cResidents have been abandoned during a national crisis \u2013 an occupation of our city,\u201d said city councillor Catherine McKenney, calling on police to ask the RCMP for help. Protesters released a statement on Wednesday, saying they sympathized with residents over the disruption to daily life, but added trucks would only leave once the federal government repealed its public health restrictions, many of which are under provincial and municipal jurisdiction. Many senior conservative lawmakers have embraced the movement, prompting accusations of hypocrisy, after those same parliamentarians called for police to disband Indigenous-led blockades in 2020. The standoff near the Alberta border town of Coutts has entered its fifth day, with dozens of trucks blocking access to a key highway used to enter the United States. The town is an important border crossing for Alberta\u2019s meat exports and imports of livestock feed. Police issued an ultimatum to protesters on Tuesday, threatening them with arrest if they remained on the road. A small group left, but many trucks remained. Others breached a police barricade to join the blockade. The Alberta premier, Jason Kenney, condemned the \u201cunlawful\u201d blockades, calling on protesters to disband and return home. He told reporters people sympathetic with the protests had assaulted police and someone tried to ram RCMP members. \u201cWithout hesitation, I condemn those actions and I call for calm amongst anybody who feels sympathetic to those engaged in this blockade,\u201d said Kenney. After a series of Indigenous-led blockades paralyzed rail traffic in 2020, Kenney\u2019s government passed a law that allows for additional penalties against protesters blockading highways and other infrastructure."

            "title": "Would Vladimir Putin actually use nuclear weapons?",
            "date": "2022-02-28T14:50:11Z",
            "content": "What did Vladimir Putin say about Russian nuclear weapons? Russia\u2019s president summoned the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and military chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, to a public meeting on Sunday and ordered them to \u201ctransfer the deterrence forces\u201d \u2013 a reference to nuclear weapons \u2013 \u201cof the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty\u201d. Do Putin\u2019s words have any specific military meaning? Although the diplomatic threat was clear enough, the exact phrasing confused nuclear experts and defence ministries, who did not recognise what a \u201cspecial mode of combat duty\u201d might specifically entail. But there was agreement that the threat, though it had gone up a notch, remained at a low level. Pavel Podvig, widely considered a leading expert on Russian nuclear forces, tweeted that that Putin\u2019s order \u201cmost likely\u201d meant \u201cthe nuclear command and control system received what is known as a preliminary command\u201d. This would turn the system on, in effect, allowing \u201ca launch order\u201d to \u201cgo through if issued\u201d. It would also allow, he wrote, for the nuclear weapons to be launched \u201cif the president is taken out or can not be reached\u201d, but he added, only in the case \u201cit detects actual nuclear detonations on the Russian territory\u201d. David Cullen, of the Nuclear Information Service, said this was, in a way, \u201canalogous to the British system\u201d, where the commanders of Trident nuclear submarines are given letters of last resort, signed by the prime minister, of instructions on how to act if it is believed that the UK has been destroyed by an all-out nuclear attack. Both Podvig and other experts, such as James Acton, a nuclear expert with the Carnegie Endowment, said Putin\u2019s order could also entail further operational changes. That could include sending further nuclear armed submarines to sea or dispersing long range nuclear missiles around Russian territory, from where they could theoretically be used. But that may not necessarily be the case, Podvig added, given Putin\u2019s phrasing was deliberately ambiguous. What is the thinking of western governments? Ben Wallace, Britain\u2019s defence secretary, said the UK did not recognise the terms Putin used. \u201cThat is not a term that is in their doctrine,\u201d the minister told the BBC on Monday morning. The move was, he said, designed to scare the west and \u201cremind the world he\u2019s got a deterrent\u201d and that it was a distraction designed to ensure that the west was \u201ctalking about it rather than the lack of success they are having in Ukraine\u201d. The defence secretary also warned Russia could, in theory, use so-called tactical nuclear weapons in the fight against Ukraine. But this would amount to a massive \u2013 and still unlikely \u2013 escalation against what Putin has described as \u201cone people\u201d with Russians. \u201cThey could be every bit as powerful as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs; most people say there is no such thing as a non-strategic nuclear weapon,\u201d said Sebastian Brixey-Williams, a co-director of the Basic thinktank. Has Russia said anything more since Sunday to explain itself? There was a signal, from the Kremlin itself, on Monday that its statement was primarily a form of high stakes diplomacy. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the decision came in response to various western warnings there could be \u201ccollisions and clashes between Nato and Russia\u201d. He added: \u201cI would not call the authors of these statements by name, although it was the British foreign minister.\u201d Matthew Harries, a nuclear specialist with the Rusi thinktank, said the statements were a warning of a different sort. It was, in the first instance, simple intimidation \u2013 \u201cwe can hurt you, and fighting us is dangerous\u201d \u2013 and a reminder to the west, which is increasingly arming the Ukrainians, not to go too far. \u201cIt could be Russia is planning a brutal escalation in Ukraine and this is a \u2018keep out\u2019 warning to the west,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-02-01T13:17:03Z",
            "content": "Food and drink makers have cautiously welcomed a deal that will secure UK production of carbon dioxide, which is used in making meat, beer, baked goods and fizzy drinks, for at least three months. Meat processors, brewers, bakers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. It is also required for the humane slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens, and is used by hospitals and nuclear power plants. A short government statement said the new industry-led deal would enable CF Fertiliser plant in Billingham, County Durham, to continue to operate. The plant was scheduled for potential shutdown this week after a three-month emergency deal brokered by the government came to an end on Monday. That deal was prompted by a crisis in CO2 supplies in late September as high energy prices combined with annual maintenance shutdowns to bring UK production to a near halt. The government was forced to use taxpayer money to fund a three-week bailout for CF Industries, which accounts for 60% of the UK\u2019s CO2 supplies, to stave off supply chain chaos before the first three-month deal was agreed. It said it would not put up further funds. Kate Halliwell, the chief scientific officer at the Food and Drink Federation trade body, which represents hundreds of UK food and drink businesses, said: \u201cUK food and drink manufacturers welcome the deal that will ensure continuity of CO2 supply, keeping our shops, pubs and restaurants stocked with our favourite food and drink.\u201d But industry insiders said there were concerns about what the new industry deal would mean for the cost of CO2, which has risen sharply in the light of soaring energy prices. Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: \u201cWe are encouraged by the agreement made between suppliers and CF industries, however we urgently need further details on the nature of the arrangement in order to understand the impact on our sector and the longer term sustainability of CO2 supply for the UK drinks sector. \u201cOur sector is still reeling from the impact of a devastating winter and face rising cost pressures from all angles. A swift resolution to the CO2 supply issue is crucial in ensuring a strong and sustainable recovery for the beer and pub sector.\u201d The business department said in a statement: \u201cThe government welcomes the industry\u2019s agreement which is in the best interest of businesses.\u201d It added that in the longer term the government would \u201clike to see the market take measures to improve resilience, and we are engaging on ways this could happen\u201d."

But threats can be both more subtle and a slower burn. Last week, the elections bill cleared its first hurdle in the House of Lords (UK elections watchdog warns bill threatens its independence, 21 February). During the debate, peers queued up to set out their concerns about the impact on the independence of the Electoral Commission \u2013 the elections watchdog \u2013 once Michael Gove is setting its strategy and policy. It is a dangerous power to put into political hands. Lord Grocott deployed a footballing analogy to make his point and hit the spot: \u201cTo allow the winning party to give instructions to the Electoral Commission is comparable to a game between Arsenal and Manchester United in which, prior to kick-off, the Arsenal manager gives instructions to the referee.\u201d This move goes expressly against the recommendations of the committee on standards in public life. It was also criticised by the Conservative-led public administration and constitutional affairs committee, which concluded that it \u201crisks undermining public confidence in the effective and independent regulation of the electoral system\u201d, and by the chair of the Electoral Commission, John Pullinger, and the majority of electoral commissioners in an open letter to ministers. Peers are the last line of defence against plans to take control of the body that manages elections and fines political parties for rule breaches.

            "date": "2022-02-23T20:00:39Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson is in his happy place. The Russian invasion of Ukraine couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. At a stroke, people have stopped asking him awkward questions about the cost of living and the price of fuel. Better still, both Labour and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 Tory MPs have also suspended hostilities on Partygate. At a time of imminent war in eastern Europe, a united front must be maintained at home. Just in case Vladimir Putin happens to be watching and starts taking our threats seriously. Not that there\u2019s much sign of that so far. But we can live in hope. So, for The Suspect, the heat is off temporarily. He can swan around doing his Churchill tribute act \u2013 \u201cWe shall fight them on the tennis courts. We shall fight them in the Tory party fundraising auctions. We shall never give up\u201d \u2013 safe in the knowledge that right now it\u2019s hard for him to screw things up too badly. No one is coming after him and there is no vote of no confidence imminent. Because however many lies he happens to tell, they are nothing to those being told by Vladimir Putin. And his corruption is amateur hour when compared with the delusional venality of the Russian president. Though it\u2019s obviously something to which he can aspire. All of which made prime minister\u2019s questions a curiously subdued affair with both The Suspect and Keir Starmer on their best behaviour. Something that came far easier to the Labour leader as he is by far the more serious politician. Even in an international crisis, Johnson can\u2019t totally conceal his inherent levitas. At heart he still thinks the whole thing is a bit of a game. Starmer began by making it clear he was going to go easy on Boris. For the good of the country. The last thing people wanted to see at such a time was politicians squabbling and point-scoring. So he was thoroughly behind the efforts of the UK and other Nato countries to deter Putin. He was \u2013 as he had said the day before \u2013 just disappointed that the sanctions had been so feeble. The Russian president must have been delighted. That\u2019s if he had even noticed. Steady on old chap, The Suspect replied. While he was very grateful to have the support of the Labour party in principle, he did want to point out that sanctioning five small banks and three individuals who had already been sanctioned by the US since 2018 was actually a massive deal. Not only had it caused Putin to rethink his invasion plans but it had given other oligarchs time to liquidate their assets and get their cash out of the country. Which was a good thing, no? Johnson didn\u2019t really seem to have much of a grasp how sanctions were supposed to work. In any case, it was important to remember that this was just the first phase of an internationally coordinated response. So our next sanctions would be marginally less pathetic. The UK\u2019s role was to always look a soft touch compared with other countries. The Labour leader then moved on to RT television. Surely it was time to have it banned? As it happened, Nadine Dorries had already written to Ofcom about this, The Suspect said. Though there had to be a place in the UK media for outlets that tolerated lies and made-up stories. Otherwise Johnson would never have had a career at the Telegraph. As for donations from Russian oligarchs, he wasn\u2019t going to pay them back because he was sure the Tory party had never taken them. And just to be on the safe side, he definitely wasn\u2019t going to investigate because who knew what you might find once you started. Sensing that they might be on the verge of kicking lumps out of each other in their usual adversarial style, Starmer and The Suspect backed off. The Labour party offers its full support etc. The government appreciates the opposition\u2019s full support etc. Only the Labour leader managed to sound halfway sincere. In keeping with the mood, most Tory backbenchers went out of their way to avoid asking Johnson anything difficult about Ukraine, parties or the cost of living and in return he congratulated them on doing whatever it was they did. He still gives the impression of having no idea who any of them are. Others weren\u2019t so docile. Caroline Lucas tried to ask about Russian involvement in UK elections. Her question went on a bit and she got drowned out by Tory MPs shouting her down as they tried to protect their leader from all too believable truths. Lindsay Hoyle did himself no favours in his failure to allow Lucas to be heard. The most telling intervention came from Margaret Hodge who wanted to know if it was possible to sanction members of the Duma. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a thing to sanction parliamentarians,\u201d said The Suspect. Inadvertently giving away far more than intended. Because few parliamentarians have more experience of getting away with things than Johnson. He knows he\u2019s lied to the police. To parliament. To everyone. And he still reckons he\u2019ll get away unscathed. People in power are untouchable. At heart, Boris is just another oligarch manque. Only without the billions. Rejoicing in his freedom, The Suspect went on to tell some lies. He\u2019d forgotten how naturally it came to him. The UK was the first to appreciate the seriousness of Ukraine. Alex Salmond was a member of the SNP. He was on the point of telling the Labour party Jeremy Corbyn was still its leader when Hoyle called time. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant made a point of order. For the first time ever, Johnson had apologised for lying to the house. About Roman Abramovich facing sanctions. It had taken the fear of reprisals from a Russian oligarch to get him to do the decent thing. The sanctions were working. Just in the opposite way to what had been intended."

The west\u2019s economic war against Vladimir Putin has gone into full swing today with punitive sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine prompting the rouble to crash 40% and raising the prospect of severe turmoil inside Russia. As its military struggles to gain the upper hand against Ukraine\u2019s fierce defence, the Russian currency was in freefall and the country\u2019s authorities kept financial markets closed to head off the prospect of a run on banks as people queued to withdraw money from cash points. The UK government has just announced a slew of measures \u201cto prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the Russian central bank, the Russian national wealth fund, and the country\u2019s ministry of finance\u201d. Boris Johnson pledged more weapons for Ukraine after he spoke to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by phone. Amid reports of a huge column of Russian tanks heading for Kyiv this morning, the prime minister was told by Zelenskiy that the next 24 hours was a \u201ccrucial period for Ukraine\u201d, according to No 10. The call is yet another illustration of Zelenskiy\u2019s remarkable mobile-phone diplomacy which has seen him rally worldwide support from his Kyiv bunker. You can follow all the latest at our live blog, along with what we know so far here. Johnson\u2019s message comes after Vladimir Putin responded to his increasing pariah status by announcing that he had placed Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert. Concerns about his intentions were compounded this morning by reports from Russian news agencies that Belarus, one of the Kremlin\u2019s staunchest allies, has approved a new constitution renouncing the country\u2019s non-nuclear status. Such a move could pave the way for nuclear missiles to be stationed in the country, which borders Nato members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.

            "title": "US healthcare giant\u2019s takeover of GP practices lands in high court ",
            "date": "2022-02-02T07:49:23Z",
            "content": "A dispute about the takeover of one of the UK\u2019s biggest GP practice operators by the US healthcare giant Centene Corporation has reached the high court, in a case that could overturn approval for a deal condemned by campaigners as \u201cprivatisation by stealth\u201d of the NHS. The request for a judicial review, which will be heard in the high court in London on Tuesday and Wednesday, was crowdfunded by a coalition of NHS campaign groups and the Unite union. It is being brought by Anjna Khurana, an NHS patient and Islington councillor. She claims she is one of 375,000 patients across London who were only informed of the takeover of their GP surgeries after the event. Health campaign groups Keep Our NHS Public, 999 Call for the NHS and We Own It have joined Unite in bringing the case. Two crowdfunding campaigns by Khurana have raised more than \u00a377,000. A year ago, Operose Health, a UK subsidiary of Centene, acquired the privately owned AT Medics, which was set up in 2004 by six NHS GPs and ran 37 GP practices across 49 sites in London. The merger created the largest private supplier of GP services in the UK. The group now serves 570,000 patients across 67 practices, and employs 1,500 healthcare professionals, including 350 GPs. Alongside GP practices, Centene\u2019s UK interests include Circle Health Group, one of Britain\u2019s biggest private hospital operators. A coalition of doctors, campaigners and academics has voiced concerns in a letter sent last year to the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, describing the takeover as \u201can example of the privatisation of the NHS by stealth\u201d, and asking him to order an investigation by the Care Quality Commission. They claimed at the time the change of control was approved for eight practices in the London boroughs of Camden, Islington and Haringey in a virtual meeting on 17 December that lasted less than nine minutes, during which no mention was made of Centene and not a single question was asked. Approval was granted by the North Central London clinical commissioning group (NCL CCG), a local NHS body that purchases health services from GPs, hospitals and others using taxpayer funds. The judicial review will focus on the lack of consultation of patients, and will ask the court to quash the decision by NCL CCG. Since the news broke, hundreds of patients, councillors and members of the public have written letters and protested outside surgeries. Khurana said: \u201cLike everyone else, I want to feel I can rely on my GP to be on my side. That is what we get with the NHS. But without my knowledge, my surgery has been sold to a giant American healthcare company, one with a very poor reputation. How can that be right? I needed to stand up and make my voice heard. So many people have been in touch to let me know they support me that I know I am not alone. We cannot allow this stealth privatisation of the NHS to carry on.\u201d The court will rule whether, in making their decision, the NHS commissioners acted unlawfully in three respects: misdirection \u2013 they failed to consider all the implications of the takeover because they assumed they had no choice but to accept and approve the proposal; lack of due diligence \u2013 they failed to give due consideration to the risk to patients, if the GP contracts they agreed to transfer to Operose Health turned out not to meet its parent company Centene\u2019s profitability targets; and lack of consultation/involvement of patients. An NCL CCG spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to offering residents high-quality, safe and accessible care. Our commissioning practices in relation to AT Medics have followed the same rules and guidance we apply to all our GP contracts, with decisions informed by legal and national guidance. \u201cThe CCG is defending its decision and the process and will not comment further while a judicial review is under way.\u201d Dr Louise Irvine, a London GP and member of Keep Our NHS Public, said: \u201cOf course patients are worried. When a large American corporation like Centene takes over this many GP practices we have to question their motive. It\u2019s a deeply worrying situation and I am delighted that the high court has seen the important public interest in this case.\u201d Doctors in Unite supported a protest outside the high court at the Royal Courts of Justice, with more protests planned on Wednesday. The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: \u201cThis is a landmark case in the fight against the accelerating pace of privatisation of the NHS in England. Unite, with 100,000 members in the health service, fully supports the judicial review. We will not allow our GP services to be hived off to profit-hungry American private healthcare companies.\u201d An Operose Health spokesperson said: \u201cIt is not appropriate for us to comment as the judicial review is between an individual and the North Central London Clinical Commissioning Group over issues of process.\u201d"

            "title": "As Omicron peaks, the US healthcare system is left \u2018broken beyond repair\u2019",
            "date": "2022-02-04T07:00:20Z",
            "content": "Dr Brian Resler, an emergency physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, recently polled a group of doctors on an overnight shift about their jobs. \u201cEveryone of us said if we could go back, we would choose a different career,\u201d said Resler, who spoke on the condition that the Guardian does not identify his hospital. Resler and his fellow doctors feel that way although California has recently seen a sharp decrease in the number of Covid-19 cases after the spike due to the highly contagious Omicron variant. That slump in cases has largely been mirrored across the US as the Omicron wave has peaked and many parts of the US are firmly on its downslope. But, while some health experts have predicted that the worst of the pandemic is behind us, the ripple effects of the virus, such as its impact on patients needing care for other issues, continue to test the limits of the US healthcare system and its providers. \u201cMost people got into healthcare because they wanted to help people and make a difference, and I think at this point, it\u2019s just broken beyond repair,\u201d said Resler, 36, who has worked in emergency medicine for seven years. Across the country, the daily average of Covid-19 cases and daily average of hospitalizations due to the virus has decreased by 49% and 16% respectively over the past two weeks, according to New York Times data. Despite those positive trends, 80% of US hospitals in the last week of January were under \u201chigh or extreme stress\u201d, meaning that more than 10% of their hospitalizations were due to Covid-19, according to data compiled by National Public Radio using a framework from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. California was the tenth worst in the country with 69% of hospitals under extreme stress, meaning that more than 20% of those facilities\u2019 hospitalizations were due to Covid-19. \u201cEven though the odds of getting very sick with Omicron and the odds of getting sick once you are vaccinated and boosted are lower, the sheer number of infections means that there are still going to be a lot of sick people,\u201d said Resler, who explained that most of the Covid-19 patients who were hospitalized were unvaccinated. Also, because of the threat of the virus, many people earlier in the pandemic were afraid or unable to seek care for their health issues. Now that delay is catching up with patients, Resler said. \u201cThat leads to a lot of overwhelming of the system and a lot of angry patients. A lot of patients hear that things are overwhelmed, but when faced with long wait times and an overwhelmed emergency department, it\u2019s a lot different to see it for yourself when you are sick and seeking care than hearing about it,\u201d he said. In Missouri, 79% of the hospitals are under extreme stress, which is the second highest percentage in the country. At Mercy hospital in Springfield, in the south-western part of the state, about 28% of their hospitalizations are Covid-19 patients, according to Erik Frederick, the hospital\u2019s chief administrative office. Even if patients were admitted for other reasons but happened to test positive for Covid-19, \u201cthose patients require the same amount of resources, as far as isolation and all the personal protective equipment and human resources,\u201d said Frederick. The high transmissibility of the Omicron variant means that the hospitals also have a significant number of staff who test positive for the virus and must then quarantine. This creates an increased patient load for the providers that are left, and hospitals must offer incentives to encourage staff to pick up additional shifts and hire nurses from outside agencies, Frederick said. \u201cIt creates a lot of stress on the healthcare system,\u201d Frederick said. Children\u2019s hospitals have also not been immune from the strain caused by the Omicron variant. Over two weeks in January, there was a 20% increase in the cumulative number of child Covid-19 cases, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Every few hours at University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, the house supervisor, who coordinates care for patients, sends out alerts about the numbers of available beds in particular units. \u201cWhen those numbers get small, it means that we have to make some hard decisions,\u201d said Dr Rachel Pearson, assistant professor of pediatrics and the medical humanities at UT Health San Antonio. \u201cSometimes that means kids who I would prefer to be upstairs with my hospital pediatrics team are stranded in the [emergency department].\u201d Sometimes the hospital has to stop accepting transfer patients from smaller hospitals or clinics or had to have those patients wait in the emergency department. \u201cWe are stretched. It seems like we have been able to find creative solutions to safely care for kids for the most part, but I really feel for those rural doctors out there because I know sometimes they are on the phone and making call, after call, after call, trying to find a hospital with a higher level of care that can accept their sick patient,\u201d said Pearson. Still, Pearson is encouraged that the Food and Drug Administration could soon authorize the Pfizer vaccine against Covid-19 for children under five. And Frederick, who also sees patients from rural areas with low vaccination rates, said he is optimistic about the future of the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about the numbers, but most of my optimism comes from my team and how they have responded and continue to respond,\u201d he said. Resler isn\u2019t so optmistic. His early interest in emergency medicine came from the rewarding nature of providing care to patients, some of whom don\u2019t initially have a heartbeat. Now he and colleagues talk about the \u201cthank you\u201d to \u201c[expletive] you,\u201d ratio, and the former is consistently outweighed by the latter, he said. \u201cI spend most of my day apologizing and being yelled at,\u201d said Resler. \u201cWe had similar issues years ago, but it\u2019s just gotten much worse, to the point where anytime I go see a new patient, it\u2019s a pleasant surprise when they are not angry at me.\u201d This article was updated on 4 February 2022 to clarify that Missouri has the second highest percentage of hospitals under \u2018extreme stress\u2019, according to NPR data."

            "date": "2022-02-15T17:36:51Z",
            "content": "The shameful racial inequalities documented by the NHS Race and Health Observatory report (Radical action needed to tackle racial health inequality in NHS, says damning report, 14 February) have rightly led to calls for action. But what has been missed is that even in the last decade alone, there have been a myriad of NHS-led plans, strategies and initiatives to tackle inequality. Some, such as the workforce race equality standard, had investment of millions of pounds. Yet the comparatively poorer experiences of black, Asian and minority ethnic patients and workers persist. In understanding why, we must look at where accountability has gone. Almost every equality plan or initiative has had some form of oversight group. Almost always, these are led and dominated by the NHS, with race equality organisations such as ours often in a minority of one. With critical voices often ignored and regulators, such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission or Care Quality Commission, rarely acting when failures to progress racial equality are found, we are left with NHS leaders able to jump from one initiative to the next without any real change. Unless we have accountability that is not led by the usual suspects and have regulators that are willing to act, the actions that follow this damning report will go the same way as in the past. Jabeer Butt Chief executive, Race Equality Foundation \u2022 Your article highlights that the pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on minority ethnic groups. This certainly echoes our experience as ethnic minority health and social care professionals. It is imperative that this matter is not just included in the terms of reference in the Covid-19 inquiry this spring, but forms a central part of Lady Hallett\u2019s investigations. We make this call with a clear-eyed view of the pressures on the 73-year-old NHS and with hope for what an inquiry could do. Our members, who include clinicians, researchers and ancillary workers, are facing these challenges daily \u2013 from the lack of appropriate PPE during the pandemic to the heavy losses among our ranks and our loved ones. The inquiry must make space to hear our unique perspectives on how health inequality is experienced in terms of race and ethnic origin as a matter of national importance. Ade Adeyemi Secretary, Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations \u2022 The NHS Race and Health Observatory report is incredibly important and action needs to be taken now at all levels. C3 Collaborating for Health has been working for a decade to highlight the burden of ill health and premature mortality from the main chronic diseases (cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke) that occur disproportionately in minority populations \u2013 the same issues led to the high rates of death and serious illness from Covid-19. With the support of the Burdett Trust for Nursing, we will be working with nurses of black or Asian heritage who can engage with their local communities and improve health outcomes among minority ethnic patients. The \u201cradical action\u201d called for in the report needs to be addressed by better support for disadvantaged patients and for the key staff who can play a major part in the changes that are needed. Christine Hancock Founder, C3 Collaborating for Health; former general secretary, Royal College of Nursing \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "date": "2022-02-28T14:53:25Z",
            "content": "GlaxoSmithKline boss Emma Walmsley said she was \u201cextremely confident\u201d that it would complete the giant spin-off of its consumer healthcare unit in July, despite the market volatility caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The FTSE 100 company is demerging the unit, named Haleon last week, in what is expected to be the largest London listing for a decade and the biggest demerger in 20 years. GSK on Monday pledged to investors that the new company, which will run brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste, Panadol painkillers and Centrum vitamin supplements, would offer strong growth opportunities. The financial market turmoil caused by the invasion of Ukraine has already delayed the initial public offerings of some companies in Europe and the US. However, demergers are somewhat less dependent on market conditions as they do not usually involve the same need to persuade new investors to back them. GSK employs 400 people in Ukraine, and lists two businesses in Kyiv in its annual report, although it does not own any factories in the country. \u201cWe utterly condemn this invasion and the harm that it is causing the people of Ukraine,\u201d Walmsley said. \u201cWe strongly support the actions being taken by the UK and other governments, including sanctions.\u201d She added that the safety of employees was GSK\u2019s priority, and that she had personally spoken to the country managers. The company was helping with efforts to relocate workers where possible, and is in talks with Direct Relief, a charity, about donations of medicines. The Haleon demerger has come with Walmsley under pressure from activist investors including Elliott Management and Bluebell Capital Partners, and after the rejection of a \u00a350bn bid for the company from Unilever, another FTSE 100 consumer goods company. Walmsley said Haleon had \u201cvery compelling prospects\u201d. Brian McNamara, chosen to lead Haleon when it is listed, said there was an \u201cincredible opportunity in front of us\u201d, pointing to the company\u2019s large market share in countries such as Brazil, India and South Africa. Some analysts believe that consumers in those middle-income countries will spend more on healthcare products as they grow richer. \u201cWe believe the global focus on health and wellness is only set to increase,\u201d he said. Haleon will aim to grow sales by between 4% and 6% over the next few years, with growth its priority followed by reducing the debt on its new balance sheet. McNamara said some of that growth would come through higher prices in recognition of increased costs during recent months. Haleon will also seek to grow by expanding its range of products, including by bringing out over-the-counter versions of treatments previously confined to prescriptions, and pushing further into \u201cnatural\u201d supplements. The company will also seek to increase the proportion of products sold online from 8% of the business to the \u201cmid-teens\u201d by 2025, he said. GSK is in line to receive a \u00a37bn dividend from the demerger, while minority owner Pfizer, the US drug company, will receive a \u00a33bn dividend. Both will hold on to stakes in the new company."

            "date": "2022-02-15T18:48:03Z",
            "content": "Those who save the lives of others need protection themselves. At least 415 attacks against health workers and facilities have been carried out since last year\u2019s coup in Myanmar, according to a report published recently. It has become one of the most dangerous places on Earth for medics, with half of all such global attacks in the first six months of last year. The war in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region has seen the large-scale destruction of facilities. With the crisis deepening in Sudan, last month the UN reported 15 healthcare attacks since November. It is over a century and a half since the agreement of the first Geneva convention, an international prohibition on attacking the sick and wounded, assaulting or punishing those who offer them healthcare, and inflicting violence on hospitals and ambulances. Those protections have since been broadened and strengthened repeatedly. Yet attacks on healthcare facilities and workers, often deliberately targeting them, have come to seem like a new normal, from the former Yugoslavia to Syria to Central African Republic. In 2019, at least 1,200 of these acts took place across 20 countries. Hatred, dehumanisation and genocidal thinking as well as the military demand for rapid victory have contributed. Sickeningly, measures meant to protect hospitals and clinics \u2013 such as giving their locations to combatants \u2013 have in the worst cases facilitated attacks on them. Accountability is vanishingly rare. When Human Rights Watch examined 25 major cases, it found that 16 involved potential war crimes. Just five cases saw a full investigation with published findings. In only one were soldiers disciplined. The Assads of this world are the most obvious culprits, but the US, UK and others are hardly without taint. In October 2015, a US attack on a hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, killed 42 civilians. Countries also bear responsibility when their partners and allies carry out attacks with the weapons they supply. They almost always seek to duck it: \u201cThe support by the US and UK for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, and the rationalisations offered for it, is the quintessential example of this conduct,\u201d writes Leonard Rubenstein, a human rights lawyer who has investigated many such atrocities, in his recent book Perilous Medicine. It would be easy to despair. Yet Mr Rubenstein argues that such attacks are now more likely to be reported and that global indifference shifted to attention in the last decade, though action remained limited. Campaigning by civil society and the medical community has had a measurable impact at times. Some governments have made improvements. In 2018, the World Health Organization introduced a system for monitoring and reporting attacks, though it has not proved as effective as anticipated. The International Committee of the Red Cross has brought together military representatives, armed groups, experts and healthcare workers to discuss pragmatic measures such as running checkpoints in a way that does not unduly interfere with medical care. We know what needs to be done. In 2016, the then UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, sent a detailed and lengthy set of recommendations for tackling the issue to the security council. Members took the opportunity to trade recriminations, but no action resulted. Even countries that pledged support failed to follow through, for example, by ensuring that domestic laws incorporate the Geneva conventions. Protecting healthcare is not an utterly hopeless task \u2013 but the ongoing attacks it faces show how desperately sustained effort is needed."

The trendline is based on the boosters administered, then taking the most recent interval between second and booster doses, and adding this to the date of the second dose. This is obviously a very simple estimate of the time it might take, and will change as the vaccination rate increases or decrease. It also shows the current \u201clag time\u201d for boosters, that is the time interval between when the equivalent number of second and booster doses were administered \u2013 this essentially tracks the delay between second and third doses, which ideally would be as close to four months as possible if the majority of people were getting their shots as soon as they\u2019re eligible. Here are the current vaccination rates for each state and territory by various age ranges, as well as the booster vaccination rate: Vaccine rollout: maps of vaccination rate by area The federal government releases weekly data for vaccination rates by statistical area 3 (SA3) regions. This map shows the current first and second-dose vaccination rates for each region, as well as the weekly increase in the percentage of fully vaccinated people. The data for first and second doses is capped at 95%. You can use the dropdown menu to switch between showing the vaccination rate for each area, and the percentage change in vaccination rate for each area: Here, you can see the same information in a table, which can be sorted by region name, state or the change in vaccination percentage: Vaccine rollout: Indigenous vaccination statistics Guardian Australia has been tracking the vaccination statistics for Indigenous Australians since August 2021. While Indigenous Covid vaccination rates have risen rapidly, there remains a large gap between First Nations people and overall vaccination rates in almost every state and territory. These charts have switched to using Indigenous population data sourced from the Australian Immunisation Register instead of ABS population estimates. This means the percentages for some states have changed significantly, such as in Victoria. Here, you can see national figures for the Indigenous vaccination rate over time compared with the overall vaccination rate, and the difference between the two: This chart shows the latest rollout gap for each state and territory, with data updated weekly: Vaccine rollout: international comparison In the following two charts you can see how Australia\u2019s vaccine rollout compares with other countries, in terms of doses administered per 100 people. This first chart adjusts for the fact that countries started administering vaccines on different dates. It shows how Australia compares to select countries at equivalent points in their vaccine rollouts. Here you can see how those same countries are doing across their entire vaccine rollout, on a doses administered per 100 people basis. Some are already more than halfway to vaccinating their populations. Not all countries publish data on fully vaccinated people - those who have received two doses. Here you can see how Australia compares to OECD countries on the percentage of the population that are fully vaccinated. Where can I get vaccinated? The majority of Australians aged 18 and over are now eligible for a Covid vaccination if they are willing to consider the AstraZeneca vaccine, and provided they do not have a history of some specific health conditions. In addition to the government\u2019s official eligibility checker, which lists some clinics near your location which might have vaccination appointments available, there are a number of other helpful resources that can help you to find somewhere that has appointments open. You can find our page listing these resources here. Latest Australia Covid numbers and statistics Due to the issues with testing accessibility and the change in testing criteria, case numbers from mid-December onwards should be considered an underestimate at best. For the moment, it may be better to track the progress of the outbreak via hospitalisation statistics rather than case numbers. Here, you can see the number of patients in hospital nationwide, along with occupancy thresholds based on the federal government\u2019s \u2018common operating picture\u2019 document. Here, you can see the number of new deaths reported per day by the states and territories: Updates 3o May 2021: Fixed an issue with the booster tracker Removed state vaccination trend small multiple chart Updates 21 April 2021: Removed 80 and 90% booster projection Removed vaccine distributions and utilisations by jurisdiction Booster doses added to vaccination sa3 map and table Fixed an issue with state vaccination trend small multiple chart Updates 19 January 2021: Changed vaccine stats table to new metrics Temporarily removed the national cases chart Removed cumulative cases chart Updated text Added hospitalisation chart Updates 29 November 2021 Updated maps to use SA3 areas Added 90% 16+ targets to bubble chart Updates 15 October 2021 Updated main rollout target chart to use the first dose + lag time projection method Fixed an issue with scrolling in the Guardian app Removed the doses per 100 people by jurisdiction line chart as it\u2019s less useful with so many doses being administered via GP and other clinics Updates 17 September 2021 Updates to how Indigenous vaccination statistics are presented, now using the 12+ population for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous We have changed the way we\u2019re projecting second-dose targets, as outlined in the text above.

            "date": "2022-02-16T16:30:11Z",
            "content": "The Omicron variant has caused an avalanche of Covid-19 cases in Australia in the past months. While most people who catch the disease experience mild symptoms, many report feeling short of breath and sluggish for weeks afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to feel tired after a viral infection, and everyone\u2019s recovery is different,\u201d says Janet Bondarenko, a senior respiratory physiotherapist at Alfred hospital in Melbourne. \u201cBut the severity of your Covid illness doesn\u2019t necessarily predict whether you will have those lingering symptoms.\u201d The coronavirus can damage various organs, causing ongoing fatigue, says Dr Robert Newton, professor of exercise medicine at Edith Cowan University. \u201cThe cardiorespiratory system can\u2019t deliver oxygen to the working muscles efficiently. So what was a light to moderate intensity activity previously feels quite vigorous now.\u201d Sleep and rest help your immune system to fight the disease but it is critical to start moving again to avoid further weakening of your body about seven days after the major symptoms have disappeared, Newton says. Exercise increases capacity of muscles, heart and lungs, as well as the numbers of mitochondria \u2013 the energy factories within the muscle cells \u2013 which counteract the debilitating effects of the infection. Here is a simple guide that can help you get moving again, but specialist advice from your GP or an exercise physiologist is recommended before you begin an exercise program. The class: yoga There is some evidence that the practice of yoga and meditation may help improve lung health, reduce viral susceptibility and speed the recovery from acute respiratory infections thanks to their relaxing effects. \u201cControlling stress and anxiety is critical for recovery,\u201d says Newton. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to look at strategies such as meditation, mindfulness and yoga to help the body to recover from the coronavirus infection.\u201d In a paper published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, researchers stated that \u201ccertain meditation, yoga asana (postures), and pranayama (breathing) practices may possibly be effective adjunctive means of [\u2026] helping to reduce severity of Covid-19 disease, including its collateral effects and sequelae\u201d. The move: bodyweight exercise Newton says incorporating resistance training is crucial to reactivate muscles. He says that bodyweight exercises, such as squats and push-ups on your knees, are a good starting point. As you gradually regain your strength, you can begin to add light weights to your routine, using milk cartons or a weighted backpack. Light resistance training triggers the production of hormones and cell-signalling molecules such as cytokines that work with the immune system to help the body repair. The activity: walking According to Bondarenko, the most accessible physical activity to do after a Covid-19 infection is walking. Especially if you can do it outdoors, Newton agrees. Anyone can easily control the intensity of their walking, they say. Beginning with easy, short strolls is ideal, says Bondarenko. Gradually, you can increase the length and the pace of your walks as long as that does not cause you extreme fatigue or leave you feeling breathless. The hard pass: don\u2019t push yourself Pushing through when you are still feeling sluggish after Covid-19 will not speed your recovery, says Bondarenko. \u201cIt pushes you back a few steps rather than helping.\u201d She says it is essential to gradually allow yourself extra time to return to your pre-Covid shape. \u201cEveryone\u2019s recovery is different, but over time, everyone gets back to where they want to be.\u201d \u201cUse your body as a barometer,\u201d says Newton. \u201cTest your perceived exertion to make sure you don\u2019t push the system into overtraining, because that will compromise your recovery.\u201d"

            "content": "The French and British drugmakers Sanofi and GSK are ready to seek approval from regulators for their Covid-19 vaccine after reporting positive results from late-stage clinical trials. The firms are hoping to catch up with rivals after falling far behind in the race to develop Covid-19 shots. Their product was delayed by an early dosing error during trials, initially disappointing results in older people and other issues. It will be available as a two-dose vaccine and as a booster. The companies will now file for approval from regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, while a rolling review with the UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, is already under way. Sanofi developed the jab, while GSK, the world\u2019s biggest vaccine maker by sales, is supplying its adjuvant technology, to boost the body\u2019s immune response. It relies on a conventional protein-based approach, compared with the newer mRNA technology used by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which makes it easier to store and transport. The companies said the phase 3 efficacy trials showed that two doses of the jab provided 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease and hospitalisations; 75% efficacy against moderate or severe Covid-19 disease; and 57.9% efficacy against any symptomatic Covid-19 disease. They said the latter is in line with expected vaccine effectiveness given the emergence of several variants of concern, such as Omicron, and similar to other vaccines. A separate trial showed that the jab boosted antibody levels against the virus 18 to 30 times across all age groups, when used in people who had been given two doses of other vaccines such as the Pfizer/BioNTech, Modern and Oxford/AstraZeneca shots. Thomas Triomphe, the executive vice-president of Sanofi Vaccines, said: \u201cThe Sanofi-GSK vaccine demonstrates a universal ability to boost all platforms and across all ages. \u201cWe also observed robust efficacy of the vaccine as a primary series in today\u2019s challenging epidemiological environment. No other global phase 3 efficacy study has been undertaken during this period with so many variants of concern, including Omicron, and these efficacy data are similar to the recent clinical data from authorised vaccines.\u201d Roger Connor, the president of GSK\u2019s vaccines arm, said: \u201cWe are confident that this vaccine can play an important role as we continue to address this pandemic and prepare for the post-pandemic period.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-23T22:53:17Z",
            "content": "Live-in domestic workers in Hong Kong have been left homeless after they were diagnosed with Covid-19 and their employers fired them or refused their return to the residence, support groups have said. Many of the workers, who are mostly women from Indonesia and the Philippines, were also left without insurance to cover their medical bills. Hong Kong is in the midst of its worst ever outbreak with the Omicron variant infecting thousands of people a day, overwhelming hospitals and government isolation facilities. The problem is exacerbated by strict policies of mandatory isolation for patients and close contacts, with tens of thousands of people unable to find accommodation. They have instead been told to isolate at home, but in the cases of dozen of domestic workers, their employers have refused to let them. There are an estimated 390,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong, working six days a week, for a minimum HK$4630 (US$593) a month plus food and board. They are legally required to live with their employers and isolating anywhere else, other than government facilities or hospital, is illegal. Maria*, a domestic worker from the Philippines, tested positive on a rapid antigen test. She said her employer gave her three options \u2013 pay for her own stay in a quarantine hotel for two weeks, go to hospital and \u201ctell them I am very sick\u201d, or have her contract terminated. \u201cI went to hospital in the morning but there were so many patients I finished at 6 o\u2019clock in the evening,\u201d she said. \u201cMy employer told me I can\u2019t come back to their house, because I was dangerous and I was afraid that I would transfer the virus.\u201d Stranded at midnight, Maria\u2019s friends reached out to an NGO, HELP For Domestic Workers, who found her a place in a shelter. Other workers have been forced to sleep in parks, at overpasses, or outside hospitals. HELP said they were assisting more than 100 workers left homeless, including at least a dozen who were fired or ordered not to return to the home. On Tuesday the Philippines consul to the city accused the Hong Kong residents who were firing and evicting their workers of illegal and \u201cimmoral\u201d acts. \u201cIf it can be proven that they were asked to leave because of their sickness, this can be considered an illegal dismissal under the employment ordinance in Hong Kong,\u201d said Raly Tejada, adding the mission was helping more than 60 people. \u201cWe are proactively engaging also the employers to explain to them that terminating their employees in these difficult times especially when they are positive is not only illegal. It is immoral.\u201d Manisha Wijesinghe, the executive director of HELP, said many employers were scared they and their families could get sick or be sent to quarantine facilities as close contacts of the ill worker. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a malicious intent there. It\u2019s really the fear that\u2019s driving everybody at the moment,\u201d she said. But leaving the women homeless, some for up to three or four nights in Hong Kong\u2019s winter, was \u201cuntenable\u201d. Wijesinghe called on Hong Kong residents to provide support for their domestic workers who fell ill. \u201cWe understand that it is a scary time and everyone is worried for their own safety, for their children and family\u2019s safety, but the thing is the domestic worker is also part of the family. They are the ones that take care of you on a day to day basis,\u201d she said. According to HELP and other NGOs most cases of stranded workers are people who had tested positive before a flight home and were denied boarding. Mai* said she slept in a tent after she tested positive before her flight to the Philippines, and was refused reentry to the boarding house where she\u2019d been staying. \u201cThey gave me a tent and a thick blanket so I wouldn\u2019t feel cold. I slept the whole night outside the boarding house,\u201d she said. Mai has since moved to a shelter, but the NGOs say the facilities, which usually house people in between jobs or waiting for flights home, are ill equipped to also isolate Covid patients. The government has said it is coordinating with consulates to provide assistance to workers who lost jobs, and looking for alternative accommodation sites. Maria said she hopes to return to her job because she has three children to support, but will look for new employers. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I get sick again if it will happen again. If they do this again to me, I think I shouldn\u2019t go back to them,\u201d she said"

            "date": "2022-02-13T09:00:07Z",
            "content": "Fraudsters who engage in romance scams are becoming increasingly brazen about how they operate and are willing to spend five months building up a relationship with their victims, according to a security expert. In some cases, criminals will even have video calls with victims, luring them into a false sense of security that they are involved with someone who is genuinely interested in them. The number of romance scams, where people hand over money to someone they believe they are in a relationship with, doubled during the pandemic with the average victim losing \u00a36,100, according to figures from TSB. Women are twice as likely to be victims as men. Jake Moore, a cyber-security adviser at internet security firm ESET, says fraudsters can spend four to five months in establishing a fake relationship before carrying out the crime. During this time, they will often be working on several victims. \u201cThey\u2019re very good at remembering all the stories that lead along that journey [ending in] an elaborate scam as to why they want the money,\u201d he says. These scams can be as simple as a person claiming their car has broken down on the way to visit and that they need money to repair it, he explains. In another instance reported by TSB, a \u201csoldier\u201d claimed he needed funds to get home from a foreign posting. Victims, who TSB says are an average age of 47, have been increasingly targeted through social media and dating apps. There have been warnings to consumers to beware of scams before Valentine\u2019s Day . Many scammers used restrictions on movement during the pandemic as an excuse not to meet up with victims. Refusing to meet in real-life, or face to face for a video call, are both things that should ring alarm bells. However, Moore says that criminals are now taking more risks and making face-to-face video calls where they are fully visible. \u201cThere are male and female fraudsters who put in video calls every night, really creating this perfect story as to how this relationship unfolds.\u201d He advises daters to change the times of the calls and to be spontaneous about when they happen, as this could upset a fraudster\u2019s timetable. \u201cIf they are controlling and saying \u2018it\u2019s got to be this time\u2019 then that could be a red flag,\u201d he says. Katherine Hart from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, which represents trading standards officers, says the pandemic increased people\u2019s reliance on indirect communications through phones. \u201cThere\u2019s the thinking that they\u2019re protected by a computer screen to a certain extent, and will easily, and quite readily, pass on a lot of personal information via text or emails,\u201d she says. \u201cUnfortunately, quite often we only find out about these things when somebody has actually intervened, whether that be a bank or a family member, or the victim has caused themselves such mental anguish there is a referral from social services.\u201d In some instances, criminals will scan the death announcements and target lonely widowers in the following months with the promise of companionship, she says. Action Fraud reported instances of romance fraud were up 40% in the year to April last year with almost \u00a374m being lost."

            "date": "2022-02-08T17:26:34Z",
            "content": "Pfizer made nearly $37bn (\u00a327bn) in sales from its Covid-19 vaccine last year \u2013 making it one of the most lucrative products in history \u2013 and has forecast another bumper year in 2022, with a big boost coming from its Covid-19 pill Paxlovid. The US drugmaker\u2019s overall revenues in 2021 doubled to $81.3bn, and it expects to make record revenues of $98bn to $102bn this year. The bumper sales prompted accusations from campaigners of \u201cpandemic profiteering\u201d. The group Global Justice Now said the annual revenue of $81bn was more than the GDP of most countries and accused Pfizer of \u201cripping off public health systems\u201d. The Covid jab Comirnaty, which the New-York based pharma firm developed with the much smaller German company BioNTech, brought in $12.5bn in revenues in the final quarter of 2021, taking the total for the year to $36.8bn. Pfizer said it had exceeded its target of manufacturing 3bn doses of the vaccine last year. The drugmaker made a net profit of nearly $22bn last year, up from $9.1bn in 2020. It increased its 2022 estimate for Comirnaty sales to $32bn and expects Paxlovid to contribute $22bn in revenues. The pill, which boasts nearly 90% success in preventing severe illness among vulnerable adults if taken soon after becoming infected with Covid-19, was approved for emergency use by the US regulator in late December. A few days later, Paxlovid received the green light in the UK, where the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency described it as a \u201clife-saving\u201d treatment. It has now received emergency approval in 40 countries. Albert Bourla, Pfizer\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said that at the start of the pandemic it had \u201ccommitted to use all of the resources and expertise we had at our disposal to help protect populations globally against this deadly virus\u201d. \u201cNow, less than two years since we made that commitment, we are proud to say that we have delivered both the first FDA-authorised vaccine against Covid-19 (with our partner, BioNTech) and the first FDA-authorised oral treatment for Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThese successes have not only made a positive difference in the world, but I believe they have fundamentally changed Pfizer and its culture for ever.\u201d The Covid vaccine, together with that produced by US rival Moderna and the much cheaper jab made by Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca, has saved millions of lives worldwide. However, pharmaceutical companies have been accused of not sharing the recipe for their vaccines, which would enable drugmakers in poorer countries to produce cheaper versions of them. Global Justice Now pointed out that Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 jab was invented by BioNTech, supported by \u20ac100m (\u00a384m) in debt financing from the publicly owned European Investment Bank and a \u20ac375m grant from the German government. Tim Bierley, a pharma campaigner at the group, said: \u201cThe development of mRNA vaccines should have revolutionised the global Covid response. \u201cBut we\u2019ve let Pfizer withhold this essential medical innovation from much of the world, all while ripping off public health systems with an eye-watering mark-up.\u201d Moderna has said it would not enforce patent protection on its Covid vaccine, and last week scientists in South Africa said they had developed a copy of the jab. They hope it will boost vaccination rates across the continent, which are among the lowest in the world. Bierley said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing short of pandemic profiteering for Pfizer to make a killing while its vaccines have been withheld from so many. Pfizer is now richer than most countries; it has made more than enough money from this crisis. It\u2019s time to suspend intellectual property and break vaccine monopolies.\u201d Pfizer has charged the UK\u2019s NHS an estimated \u00a32.8bn above production cost for the 189m doses of Covid-19 vaccines the UK government has bought, Global Justice has calculated. According to Reuters, Pfizer has sold the vaccine to African countries at $3 to $10 a shot. It has indicated that a non-profit dose costs just $6.75, or \u00a34.98, to produce, but it has reportedly charged the NHS \u00a318 a dose for the first 100m jabs bought and \u00a322 a dose for the next 89m, totalling \u00a33.76bn, Global Justice Now said \u2013 amounting to an eye-watering 299% mark-up. Responding to Global Justice Now\u2019s claims, a Pfizer spokesperson said it was \u201cfirmly committed to equitable and affordable access\u201d to the Comirnaty jab. They said: \u201cHigh- and middle-income countries pay more than low-income countries, but at a value that is significantly discounted from our normal benchmarks, during the pandemic. Low- and lower-middle-income countries pay a not-for-profit price. \u201cHowever, we would highlight that the true costs of bringing this novel mRNA vaccine to patients include ongoing large-scale clinical studies and pharmacovigilance, continued and increased manufacturing efforts including process improvements, and global distribution and supply. \u201cCovid vaccines are complex biologic products, and their manufacturing requires specialised experience, expertise and equipment. \u201cIt is not as simple as sharing the \u2018recipe\u2019. Manufacturing of the Pfizer and BioNTech Covid vaccine involves the use of over 280 materials. There is enormous collaboration already taking place.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-22T11:00:06Z",
            "content": "Almost 15,000 \u201cghost flights\u201d have departed from the UK, according to newly revealed official figures. The ghost flights, defined as those with no passengers or less than 10% of passenger capacity, operated from all 32 airports listed in the data. Heathrow was top, with 4,910 ghost flights between March 2020 and September 2021. Manchester and Gatwick were the next highest. There were an average of 760 ghost flights a month over the period, although the data covered only international departure and not domestic flights. Flying is one of the most carbon-intensive activities people can undertake and ghost flights have angered those campaigning for action on the climate crisis. The German airline Lufthansa recently warned it would have to fly 18,000 \u201cunnecessary\u201d flights by March in order to keep its landing slots at airports. Under current rules, airlines lose their valuable slots if they are not sufficiently used. However, during the pandemic-hit period covered by the new UK data, the rules that had required 80% of slots to be used were completely suspended. Airlines did not have to operate flights to retain the slots, but nonetheless flew 14,472 ghost flights. \u201cFlights may operate with a low number of passengers for a range of reasons,\u201d said the aviation minister Robert Courts, who produced the data in response to a parliamentary question. \u201cSince the onset of the pandemic, the government has provided alleviation from the normal slot regulations. This means that airlines have not been required to operate empty or almost empty flights solely to retain their historic slots rights.\u201d The Labour MP Alex Sobel, who asked the question and is chair of the net zero all-party parliamentary group, said: \u201cTo really tackle the climate emergency we need to ensure that our aviation sector is as efficient as it can be with its carbon output.\u201d Anna Hughes, at Flight Free UK and whose parliamentary petition on the issue now has 11,000 signatories, said: \u201cAt a time of climate emergency we need to be drastically reducing our use of fossil fuel, not burning it in empty planes.\u201d Slot rules were partially restored in October 2021, requiring 50% usage, and this will rise to 70% at the end of March. \u201cIf more than 14,000 empty flights took off from UK airports when there was no requirement to retain landing slots, how many more will have taken off since?\u201d said Hughes. \u201cOf course, all flights harm the climate, which is why we also campaign for a reduction in demand, a tax on aviation fuel and more affordable trains. But preventing planes from flying empty should be an easy win for policymakers and the climate.\u201d Tim Johnson at the Aviation Environment Federation said: \u201cInformation [on ghost flights] is hidden from public view, with airlines avoiding scrutiny by claiming the data is proprietary. No doubt airlines fear reputational damage, but the public and consumers should be informed. It shouldn\u2019t take a parliamentary question to expose the scale of this wasteful practice.\u201d \u201cThe number of flights may be small in comparison to the overall total, but the effects on our climate add up when you consider the average short-haul flight emits between 13 and 20 tonnes of CO2,\u201d he said. The Guardian asked the Department for Transport for data on ghost flights in January, but was told the DfT did not hold this data. The Civil Aviation Authority, which provided the new data to the government, refused a freedom of information request from the Guardian, saying it did not have the consent of the airlines to release it. Slot rules are monitored and enforced by a company called Airport Coordination Limited, but it told the Guardian passenger numbers on flights could come only from the airlines themselves. British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and easyJet told the Guardian they did not operate ghost flights to retain slots, but declined to provide data on the occupancy of their flights. A spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic said: \u201cCovid-19 had an unprecedented impact on customer demand, with wide-ranging global restrictions that limited international travel. For three months during 2020, Virgin Atlantic did not operate any passenger flights. Any lower-occupancy flights that operated outside of this window were not \u2018ghost flights\u2019 \u2013 they supported the global movement of people including returning foreign citizens and repatriated UK citizens.\u201d Both airlines said the increase in the required slot usage to 70%, the highest in the world, would lead to low-occupancy flights. Luis Gallego, the chief executive at IAG, BA\u2019s parent company, said: \u201cThis decision would force airlines to operate flights with low load factors, which will generate unnecessary CO2 emissions. This is bad for the environment and detrimental to aviation\u2019s efforts to tackle climate change.\u201d Ryanair did not respond to requests for comment. Tim Johnson said the slot system was unsustainable and outdated and that reform was needed, adding \u201cSlots at congested airports can exchange hands for millions of pounds each so there are very strong incentives for airlines to keep using them, even when passenger demand is very low. The government should rule out airport expansion and instead focus on slot reform and other efficiency improvements.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 February 2022 to include reference to easyJet among the airlines that told the Guardian they did not operate ghost flights to retain landing slots."

            "date": "2022-02-21T06:00:25Z",
            "content": "Millions of patients in England face dangerously long waits for mental health care unless ministers urgently draw up a recovery plan to tackle a \u201csecond pandemic\u201d of depression, anxiety, psychosis and eating disorders, NHS leaders and doctors have warned. The Covid crisis has sparked a dramatic rise in the numbers of people experiencing mental health problems, with 1.6 million waiting for specialised treatment and another 8 million who cannot get on the waiting list but would benefit from support, the heads of the NHS Confederation and the Royal College of Psychiatrists have told the Guardian. In some parts of the country, specialist mental health services are so overwhelmed they are \u201cbouncing back\u201d even the most serious cases of patients at risk of suicide, self-harm and starvation to the GPs that referred them, prompting warnings from doctors that some patients will likely die as a result. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, who has acknowledged that national levels of depression have almost doubled since the start of the pandemic, is facing pressure to rapidly develop a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to respond to the soaring demand for mental health care in England. The call follows the publication of the long-awaited NHS elective recovery plan this month, which finally set out how the backlog of people needing planned surgical procedures is to be addressed. \u201cWe are moving towards a new phase of needing to \u2018live with\u2019 coronavirus but for a worrying number of people, the virus is leaving a growing legacy of poor mental health that services are not equipped to deal with adequately at present,\u201d said Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the whole of the healthcare system in England. \u201cWith projections showing that 10 million people in England, including 1.5 million children and teenagers, will need new or additional support for their mental health over the next three to five years it is no wonder that health leaders have dubbed this the second pandemic. A national crisis of this scale deserves targeted and sustained attention from the government in the same way we have seen with the elective care backlog.\u201d The NHS Confederation is calling for an expansion of NHS estates for specialist mental health care, and a major recruitment drive, as part of a recovery plan. One in 10 consultant psychiatrist posts are unfilled. Dr Adrian James, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \u201cWe urgently need a fully funded mental health recovery plan, backed by a long-term workforce plan, to ensure everyone with a mental illness can get the help they need when they need it. \u201cMillions of children, young people and adults are seeking help from mental health services that are overstretched and under-resourced. The situation is critical. The government cannot afford to neglect mental health recovery any longer.\u201d Health leaders also believe a key element of a recovery plan should include a focus on providing early support for children and young people with mental health problems. There has been a 72% increase in children and teenagers referred for urgent support for eating disorders in one year, and a 52% rise in emergency referrals for under-18s to crisis care since the start of the pandemic. \u201cThe impact of the pandemic on young people\u2019s mental health cannot be overstated,\u201d said Olly Parker, the head of external affairs at the charity YoungMinds. One family doctor in Hertfordshire, Dr David Turner, said he was so concerned about the situation that he had chosen to speak out publicly for the first time in his 25-year career. \u201cI and many other GPs feel the issue has become critical and it is only a matter of time before a child dies,\u201d he told the Guardian. Turner said access to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) was \u201cnever great pre-Covid\u201d but was now \u201cappalling\u201d. The double whammy of a spike in demand and underinvestment in CAMHS was putting patients at risk, he added. One particularly \u201cdangerous\u201d new trend, Turner said, was CAMHS \u201cbouncing back\u201d patients with serious mental health disorders to GPs who had referred them for specialist treatment. It means GPs are being relied upon to carry out weekly weight checks and blood tests, and monitor vital organs of patients with anorexia nervosa, some of whom are at risk of self-harm, suicide or starvation. \u201cWe have no specific training in this specialised area,\u201d he said. Dr Phil Moore, a GP and chair of the NHS Confederation\u2019s mental health, learning disability and autism system group, said he was concerned that the mounting backlog of care could see patients \u201cdeteriorating to the point of crisis\u201d. \u201cNo clinician wants to see this happen,\u201d he added. \u201cThis was a problem before Covid but things are a lot worse now.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

            "date": "2022-02-12T11:00:05Z",
            "content": "Britain has always been a nation of pet lovers. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 3.2m households in the UK are thought to have acquired a pet. As demand for puppies, in particular, increased during lockdown, prices soared to an all-time high, with some dogs going for as much as \u00a310,000, more than five times their usual price tag. The prices of kittens also rose by as much as 40%. Many new pet owners have struggled to cope with their new housemates. Animal rescue charities report a 20% jump in the number of pets being abandoned, while demand for \u201cpet behaviour counsellors\u201d has doubled. Rabbits have proved the biggest source of \u201clockdown pet regret\u201d, with two-fifths (42%) of owners regretting their purchase during the pandemic. \u201cTaking on a pet, at any time, is a huge responsibility and before bringing one home it\u2019s vital people consider whether they have the time and the finances to properly care for that animal for the rest of their life,\u201d says RSPCA pet welfare expert Dr Samantha Gaines. \u201cAcross the sector we are seeing an increase in the number of animals abandoned as well as being surrendered. We fear this could worsen as people return to the office, or struggle with the increasing costs of living. \u201cWe believe that one of the main reasons people fail to care for their pets properly, or end up abandoning them, is a lack of research before they get their pet and a misunderstanding about the cost of pet ownership.\u201d A survey of RSPCA frontline rescuers found that 95% listed the cost of care, including vet and grooming costs, as the number one reason for pet neglect. As well as food, vet care, insurance, toys and specialist equipment, pets may also need behaviour support and training. We spoke to people who bought a pet in the pandemic to find out how the rewards of ownership stack up against the costs. \u2018I bought a maltipoo to make us feel happy again\u2019 Pet\u2019s name: Darcie. Breed: maltipoo dog (a Maltese crossed with a poodle). Upfront cost in Oct 2020: \u00a33,000. Food and treats: \u00a335 a month. Grooming: \u00a325 every six to seven weeks. Insurance: \u00a317 a month. Flea and worming treatments: \u00a317 a month. Total monthly cost: \u00a387. Nicole, 46, is an assistant manager for adult care services in Hatfield. In July 2020 her husband, Garry, was unexpectedly taken ill with a suspected heart attack. \u201cBecause of Covid I wasn\u2019t allowed to go with him in the ambulance, or visit him in hospital. Our children were in bed, and in the morning I told them daddy was unwell but he would be out soon,\u201d she says. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the case, and in two days I had the dreaded phone call to tell me he had died \u2013 there was nothing they could do.\u201d Nicole had to break the news to their three children, who were nine, 10 and 16 at the time. \u201cOur whole world collapsed,\u201d she says. Watching TV alone one evening, she was engulfed with feelings of grief and loneliness. There was a big gaping hole, not only in her life but in the heart of her home. \u201cI felt like we were a bit empty,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew we were missing something \u2013 something to love, cuddle and give us a focus in life.\u201d She surprised her children with Darcie, a maltipoo puppy, the following weekend. Prices for these dogs soared over lockdown and she had to pay \u00a33,000. \u201cI haven\u2019t told some of my family what she cost. I\u2019m too embarrassed. But I had some money that Garry left me and I thought, \u2018I know what I\u2019m going to do with that. I\u2019m going to buy something that will make us feel happy again\u2019,\u201d she says. Words cannot describe how much joy and comfort the dog has brought to her grieving children \u2013 \u201cand most of all, to me\u201d. In total, Darcie costs about \u00a3107 a month to feed and look after, and is \u201cworth every penny\u201d, Nicole says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if she knew what she was there for. It sounds dumb but she really did heal us.\u201d The dog seems to know when the children, and especially Nicole, need love and affection. \u201cShe became my rock, my strength.\u201d Maltipoos shed little to no fur, so Nicole pays \u00a325 to a groomer every six to seven weeks to ensure the dog does not get matted and dirty. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to, with a breed like hers. I brush her regularly, as well.\u201d To avoid being hit with large unexpected bills, Nicole also pays \u00a317 a month for insurance and a further \u00a317 a month for a healthcare plan her vet offers. \u201cAll the flea and worming treatments and annual vaccination boosters can end up being really costly. But when you pay monthly, it\u2019s done, it\u2019s paid for. You don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d Small mixed breeds are notoriously fussy about food, so, to save money, Nicole buys Darcie\u2019s online in bulk rather than at the supermarket, after discovering the only brand she likes (Lily\u2019s Kitchen) is cheaper that way. It is affordable, but she sometimes wonders what Garry would say if he knew she had spent \u00a33,000 on a dog. As she had owned one before, she knew before about how much Darcie would cost each month. \u201cI knew that it was a cost I could manage,\u201d she says. And for her, the rewards of dog ownership far outweigh those costs. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you how much love and happiness she has brought into our lives.\u201d Nicole is a member of the charity WAY Widowed and Young \u2018I had no human touch but I had a cat to cuddle\u2019 Pet\u2019s name: Mademoiselle Chai. Breed: domestic short-haired cat. Upfront cost in April 2020: free. First vet bill: \u00a3350. Food and treats: \u00a315 a month. Insurance: \u00a313 a month. Flea and worming treatments: \u00a312 a month. Cat sitting: \u00a3250 for a week. Total monthly cost: \u00a340 Alicia, 52, is a ghostwriter who lives in Westcliff-on-Sea. As the UK locked down in March 2020, she noticed a young female cat hanging around her house. \u201cShe darted in my front door and continued to visit me \u2013 after a few times, she didn\u2019t want to leave,\u201d she says. \u201cI would open the door to give her the opportunity \u2026 but she wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d The cat wasn\u2019t microchipped but had been neutered. News was circulating that cats could get the virus (although there is no evidence they can transmit Covid to humans) and Alicia wondered if perhaps the cat, who looked approximately four months old, had been thrown out by her owners as a result. She worked with Pet Search South East, a local group for lost and found pets, put up signs locally and asked neighbours \u2013 but no one claimed her. \u201cSo in August, I did,\u201d she says. She called her Mademoiselle Chai, after her favourite drink and the Hebrew word for life. \u201cI really feel like we saved each other, as I am a single woman living alone with no family in the UK,\u201d she says. \u201cI literally had no human touch during the lockdowns but I did have a cat to cuddle.\u201d Although she did not have to pay for Mademoiselle Chai, it cost about \u00a3350 to get her vaccinated, chipped and checked by the vet. \u201cMoney was tight but I thought, \u2018This is a worthwhile investment,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI knew I would be able to find a way to afford her.\u201d She pays \u00a312 a month for flea and worming treatments and annual vaccinations via the Healthy Pet Club plan, which also means she gets a 10% discount off bills and services at her local vet, and spends \u00a315 a month on cat food (tins of Butcher\u2019s), which she buys in bulk from Ocado to cut costs. She decided to get \u201creally good insurance\u201d, initially paying \u00a3156 a year for a policy connected to the veterinary charity PDSA. Each policy taken out contributes to the charity\u2019s work treating animals whose owners are suffering economic hardship. So when her policy went up by \u00a314 to \u00a3170 at renewal, she was OK with that, even though she had not made a claim. \u201cIf it happens regularly, I will shop around to find another insurer,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I like the feeling that I\u2019m helping to support a charity and I think they are more likely to honour claims.\u201d One of the best purchases she made was a \u00a331 Morpilot backpack she can put the cat in when she goes for a walk. \u201cI can also use it to take her to the vets because I don\u2019t have a car,\u201d she says. One of the cat\u2019s favourite toys is a \u00a35 fishing rod but others, such as ribbons and string that she loves to chase around, were free. The biggest waste of money was spending \u00a345 on scratching posts, which the cat refuses to use. The biggest expense has been paying for a cat sitter to cover trips away. Recently, Alicia found a newly graduated veterinary nurse via the website Cat in a Flat and paid her \u00a3250 to stay in her house for a week while she was on a work trip. \u201cThat gave me peace of mind,\u201d she says. Despite all these costs, Alicia has no doubt that getting a lockdown pet \u2013 or, as she puts it, a \u201cnew best buddy\u201d \u2013 was a good financial decision. \u201cShe makes me laugh and kept my spirits high during the pandemic. She was an unexpected gift in my life. I think an angel sent her to me.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s hay everywhere in the house\u2019 Pets\u2019 names: Radish and Lettuce. Breed: mini rex rabbit. Upfront cost in March 2021: \u00a350 each. First vet bill: \u00a3100 each. Hutch, tunnel and playpen: \u00a3225. Hay: \u00a35 for two bales, every two to three weeks. Food and treats: \u00a315 a month. Chew toys: \u00a35 a month. Litter tray liners: \u00a36 a month. Nail clipping: \u00a35 a rabbit, every two to three months. Insurance: \u00a30. Rabbit sitting: \u00a311 a day. Total monthly cost: about \u00a318 a rabbit. Sophie, 50, works in Cambridge for a technology business. She decided to buy her three children a pair of rabbits in March 2021, during the third lockdown, because they had been begging for a pet and her eldest daughter, Alice, 13, had thoroughly researched getting one. \u201cFrom my perspective, spending even \u00a32 a week on them would be too much,\u201d Sophie says. \u201cBut I knew this before we got them. It was an entirely child-related endeavour.\u201d She opted for rabbits because she thought the children would be capable of looking after them by themselves, and it would be good for them to learn to do so. Alice has responsibility for feeding, ordering their food, cleaning out their litter trays and generally looking after the rabbits. When she came down with Covid last year and had to isolate from her parents, Lettuce and Radish were a great comfort. \u201cI could play with them when mum and dad were working,\u201d she says. She loves that they are excited to see her in the mornings and jump on to her lap to be stroked. \u201cI think it\u2019s really rewarding to have a pet.\u201d The rabbits stay indoors, so Sophie does not see any need to insure them for theft, and plans to pay any vet bills that arise. The biggest expense was their hutch, which cost \u00a3185. Prices for double rabbit hutches start at \u00a390 online but she decided to invest in an expensive one that would maximise the space available. She went for one from rabbit-hutches.co.uk that would fit neatly in to her kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s quite big, and because we keep them inside, we wanted it not to look too ugly,\u201d Sophie says. She was also surprised to find it costs \u00a311 a day in Cambridge to get an experienced sitter to feed the rabbits and change their litter tray (rabbits typically defecate up to 200 to 300 pellets a day) when the family go on holiday. Although the family spends \u00a35 a month on chew toys for the rabbits, they also try to save by giving them cardboard and homemade toys that are safe to chew on. Overall, Sophie is not a big fan of the rabbits \u2013 \u201cmostly because of the hay that is everywhere in the house, and the animal smell\u201d \u2013 but she loves seeing how much her children care for them, and does not resent the monthly costs. \u201cYou know that they are going to be outrageous when you decide to get a pet. Whether it\u2019s worth it or not entirely depends on how much you love the pet.\u201d"

            "content": "This page is no longer being actively maintained. See our current data on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, deaths and vaccinations in Australia here. Australia\u2019s coronavirus vaccine rollout began in late February 2021. Here we bring together the latest figures to track the progress of the rollout and Covid vaccination schedule. The data shows the total doses given in Australia, people vaccinated in Australian states and the percentage of the population who have received one dose or are double dose fully vaccinated, as well as graphs showing daily new Covid-19 cases in Australia, deaths per day and cumulative coronavirus cases by state and territory. Vaccine rollout: national and state progress One of the biggest logistical exercises in Australia\u2019s history, the delivery of coronavirus vaccines to more than 20 million people was slow to start due to supply issues and concerns around the AstraZeneca vaccine. The government was initially hoping to have 4 million people vaccinated by March 2021 and the entire country inoculated by October. Since then, goals, targets and \u201chorizons\u201d have come and gone. However, in December 2021 the country had vaccinated 90% of the population aged 16 and over, and begun the rollout of boosters. Here, you can see the how the booster rollout is progressing and when we might reach various thresholds. The trendline is based on the boosters administered, then taking the most recent interval between second and booster doses, and adding this to the date of the second dose. This is obviously a very simple estimate of the time it might take, and will change as the vaccination rate increases or decrease. It also shows the current \u201clag time\u201d for boosters, that is the time interval between when the equivalent number of second and booster doses were administered \u2013 this essentially tracks the delay between second and third doses, which ideally would be as close to four months as possible if the majority of people were getting their shots as soon as they\u2019re eligible. Here are the current vaccination rates for each state and territory by various age ranges, as well as the booster vaccination rate: Vaccine rollout: maps of vaccination rate by area The federal government releases weekly data for vaccination rates by statistical area 3 (SA3) regions. This map shows the current first and second-dose vaccination rates for each region, as well as the weekly increase in the percentage of fully vaccinated people. The data for first and second doses is capped at 95%. You can use the dropdown menu to switch between showing the vaccination rate for each area, and the percentage change in vaccination rate for each area: Here, you can see the same information in a table, which can be sorted by region name, state or the change in vaccination percentage: Vaccine rollout: Indigenous vaccination statistics Guardian Australia has been tracking the vaccination statistics for Indigenous Australians since August 2021. While Indigenous Covid vaccination rates have risen rapidly, there remains a large gap between First Nations people and overall vaccination rates in almost every state and territory. These charts have switched to using Indigenous population data sourced from the Australian Immunisation Register instead of ABS population estimates. This means the percentages for some states have changed significantly, such as in Victoria. Here, you can see national figures for the Indigenous vaccination rate over time compared with the overall vaccination rate, and the difference between the two: This chart shows the latest rollout gap for each state and territory, with data updated weekly: Vaccine rollout: international comparison In the following two charts you can see how Australia\u2019s vaccine rollout compares with other countries, in terms of doses administered per 100 people. This first chart adjusts for the fact that countries started administering vaccines on different dates. It shows how Australia compares to select countries at equivalent points in their vaccine rollouts. Here you can see how those same countries are doing across their entire vaccine rollout, on a doses administered per 100 people basis. Some are already more than halfway to vaccinating their populations. Not all countries publish data on fully vaccinated people - those who have received two doses. Here you can see how Australia compares to OECD countries on the percentage of the population that are fully vaccinated. Where can I get vaccinated? The majority of Australians aged 18 and over are now eligible for a Covid vaccination if they are willing to consider the AstraZeneca vaccine, and provided they do not have a history of some specific health conditions. In addition to the government\u2019s official eligibility checker, which lists some clinics near your location which might have vaccination appointments available, there are a number of other helpful resources that can help you to find somewhere that has appointments open. You can find our page listing these resources here. Latest Australia Covid numbers and statistics Due to the issues with testing accessibility and the change in testing criteria, case numbers from mid-December onwards should be considered an underestimate at best. For the moment, it may be better to track the progress of the outbreak via hospitalisation statistics rather than case numbers. Here, you can see the number of patients in hospital nationwide, along with occupancy thresholds based on the federal government\u2019s \u2018common operating picture\u2019 document.

            "date": "2022-02-23T17:26:15Z",
            "content": "The French and British drugmakers Sanofi and GSK are ready to seek approval from regulators for their Covid-19 vaccine after reporting positive results from late-stage clinical trials. The firms are hoping to catch up with rivals after falling far behind in the race to develop Covid-19 shots. Their product was delayed by an early dosing error during trials, initially disappointing results in older people and other issues. It will be available as a two-dose vaccine and as a booster. The companies will now file for approval from regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, while a rolling review with the UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, is already under way. Sanofi developed the jab, while GSK, the world\u2019s biggest vaccine maker by sales, is supplying its adjuvant technology, to boost the body\u2019s immune response. It relies on a conventional protein-based approach, compared with the newer mRNA technology used by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which makes it easier to store and transport. The companies said the phase 3 efficacy trials showed that two doses of the jab provided 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease and hospitalisations; 75% efficacy against moderate or severe Covid-19 disease; and 57.9% efficacy against any symptomatic Covid-19 disease. They said the latter is in line with expected vaccine effectiveness given the emergence of several variants of concern, such as Omicron, and similar to other vaccines. A separate trial showed that the jab boosted antibody levels against the virus 18 to 30 times across all age groups, when used in people who had been given two doses of other vaccines such as the Pfizer/BioNTech, Modern and Oxford/AstraZeneca shots. Thomas Triomphe, the executive vice-president of Sanofi Vaccines, said: \u201cThe Sanofi-GSK vaccine demonstrates a universal ability to boost all platforms and across all ages. \u201cWe also observed robust efficacy of the vaccine as a primary series in today\u2019s challenging epidemiological environment. No other global phase 3 efficacy study has been undertaken during this period with so many variants of concern, including Omicron, and these efficacy data are similar to the recent clinical data from authorised vaccines.\u201d Roger Connor, the president of GSK\u2019s vaccines arm, said: \u201cWe are confident that this vaccine can play an important role as we continue to address this pandemic and prepare for the post-pandemic period.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-21T11:56:31Z",
            "content": "Germany will offer its population a new protein-based Covid-19 vaccine comparable to conventional flu jabs this week, in the hope of swaying a sizeable minority that remains sceptical of the novel mRNA technology used in the most commonly used vaccines. About 1.4m doses of the Nuvaxovid vaccine developed by the US biotech company Novavax are to arrive in Germany this week, the country\u2019s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, confirmed last Friday. A further million doses are to arrive the week after, with the German government\u2019s total order for the year 2022 amounting to 34m doses. Novavax\u2019s product has until now been used only in Indonesia and the Philippines, but it was permitted for use in the EU last December. It is still awaiting authorisation in the US, as some concerns about the company\u2019s production capacity persist. Unlike the novel mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna or viral vector made by AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nuvaxovid is a protein subunit vaccine. It contains a non-infectious component on the surface of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which induces a protective immune response when the body\u2019s immune cells come into contact with it. Novavax announced in June last year that its vaccine had proven more than 90% effective against symptomatic infections with the Alpha variant, in trials including nearly 30,000 volunteers in the US and Mexico. The company says its product is similarly effective against the Delta and Omicron variants, especially after a booster shot administered six months after the second jab. Germany\u2019s Paul Ehrlich Institute notes that the data proving the vaccine\u2019s efficacy against more infectious variants remains limited. Surveys in Germany suggest a considerable interest in the Novavax jab among the 19.8 million people in the country who have so far declined to take a jab against Covid-19. Out of 4,000 unvaccinated hospital workers surveyed in Berlin, 1,800 expressed an interest in the protein-based vaccine. In the northern state of Lower Saxony, the health ministry said 6,000 people had put their name on a waiting list for Nuvaxovid by early February. Some scientists question whether the new vaccine will prove a gamechanger in a country whose overall vaccination rate has been flatlining at about 75% for months. Lars Korn, a co-author of a current survey of anti-vaccine attitudes conducted by the University of Erfurt, told the public broadcaster ZDF that two-thirds of respondents would continue to completely reject any form of vaccination."

            "date": "2022-02-02T02:00:11Z",
            "content": "Health workers on the frontline of India\u2019s Covid vaccination programme say people are being officially registered as double vaccinated without receiving both doses because of pressure to meet government targets. Workers described how easy it was to falsely register second vaccine doses for people who did not attend appointments, by using personal records from their first dose and opting to bypass a code sent to their mobile phone. \u201cThere is no technical glitch,\u201d said Aditya, a health worker from Uttar Pradesh who requested that only his first name was used owing to fear of reprisal. \u201cThe issue is the unprecedented pressure on us to increase the number of vaccinated people.\u201d The vaccine status of all citizens is recorded on a government-built platform called CoWIN. CoWIN vaccination certificates are globally recognised and make people eligible for inter-state and international travel, including to countries that are accepting only fully vaccinated passengers. The government had set a deadline of the end of 2021 to get everyone in India vaccinated, which was missed. According to official statistics, 75% of the adult population have now had two doses. Last week, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, tweeted that he was \u201cproud of all those who are making our vaccination drive a success\u201d. However, health workers who spoke to the Guardian alleged the figures were being manipulated, and estimated that in urban areas 20% to 35% of people had been fraudulently registered as double vaccinated. In rural areas they estimated that the figure could be as high as 40% to 60%. \u2018Shocking\u2019 Manish Kumar, a 21-year-old student from Patna, Bihar, described how he had been on the way to a vaccination centre in June last year when his sister, Puja Kumari, 28, received a text message on her phone saying she had successfully received her first vaccine. When the siblings reached the centre about an hour later they raised the problem with officials and threatened legal action. \u201cAfter that, they vaccinated all of us, including my sister, saying there was a technical glitch and apologised,\u201d said Kumar. But the same then happened to Kumar\u2019s father, Mukesh Prasad, a farmer, who was en route to the vaccination centre when he got a text saying his second vaccine had been administered. Another problem emerged when it came to Kumar\u2019s second dose. In October, after he had moved 170 miles away to attend Banaras Hindu University in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, he received a message saying he had just received his second dose at a health facility in Patna. \u201cI want some sort of protection from Covid-19, but how will my father and I get the second vaccine done?\u201d asked Kumar. Kaprela Hari, a 32-year-old IT professional from Rajampet in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, faced a similar problem for his father, a farmer, who had been too busy in the fields to make time for his second appointment. Out of the blue, he received a text message confirming his father\u2019s receipt of a second vaccine dose and a link to the CoWIN certificate of double vaccination status. \u201cThe nearby facility for vaccination would open at 11am and close at 1pm, and it had not been possible for me to get my father vaccinated in this two-hour gap,\u201d said Hari. \u201cSo I was surprised when I got the vaccination message.\u201d After taking up the issue with a health worker posted in his locality, Hari said he was told that the local facility was not responsible and that his father \u201cshould have turned up for vaccination on time\u201d. Hari concluded that data was being \u201cmanipulated\u201d. Deceased people also appear to be receiving vaccine certificates in an apparent attempt to boost numbers. In January, Uday Bir Singh was having lunch with relatives in a restaurant when he received a text: \u201cDear Manju Rani, you have successfully been vaccinated with your second dose.\u201d A click on the link attached to the message revealed the vaccine certificate of his wife, Rani, who had died of Covid eight months earlier. \u201cIt felt like a cruel joke,\u201d said Akanksha, Singh\u2019s daughter. \u201cHow can my mother be vaccinated in January 2022 when she died in May 2021? We felt devastated and didn\u2019t understand how it happened.\u201d In a statement, the government denied any vaccine fraud was taking place, stating that every vaccine team had a \u201cverifier\u201d whose sole job it was to confirm the identities of those being vaccinated. \u201c[The] CoWIN system is an inclusive platform and has been designed keeping the limitations and challenges of mobile and internet availability across the country,\u201d the government said. \u201cNecessary features and flexibility, to ensure that every eligible individual has the access to vaccination, regardless of any of physical, digital or socioeconomic barriers to access, have been incorporated in CoWIN. \u201cAt the same time, SOPs [standard operating procedures] and features have been incorporated to prevent fraudulent and/or wrong data entry at time of vaccination.\u201d India\u2019s healthcare system is woefully underfunded and underresourced, and the vaccination programme has put more pressure on frontline healthcare workers, who work long hours on little pay. Several workers said the practice of falsely registering people as fully vaccinated was a result of threats from senior officials to suspend workers or withhold salaries if vaccination targets were not met. \u201cI was slapped in a meeting by a district level official who was not happy with the number of vaccinations we have been doing,\u201d said a 45-year-old health worker in Bihar. \u201cLater, the official called me and apologised, saying that there is tremendous pressure from the minister of the state.\u201d Wahida, a healthcare worker from Jammu and Kashmir, said: \u201cThe easy way to get away with the situation is to register people, no matter what. It is less hectic and officials are also happy.\u201d"

The army\u2019s order applies to regular army soldiers, active-duty army reservists and cadets unless they have approved or pending exemptions, it said in a statement. The discharge order is the latest from a US military branch removing unvaccinated service members amid the pandemic after the Pentagon made the vaccine mandatory for all service members in August 2021. The vast majority of all active-duty troops have received at least one dose. Roughly 79 uniformed military personnel across the different services have died from Covid-19. \u201cArmy readiness depends on soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation\u2019s wars,\u201d the army secretary, Christine Wormuth, said. \u201cUnvaccinated soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness.\u201d \u201cWe will begin involuntary separation proceedings for soldiers who refuse the vaccine order and are not pending a final decision on an exemption,\u201d she added. Army commanders have been asked to \u201cprocess these separation actions as expeditiously as possible\u201d, the statement added. Soldiers who refuse the vaccine and are discharged will be \u201cissued either an Honorable or General (under honorable conditions) characterization of service unless additional misconduct warrants separation with an Other than Honorable characterization of service\u201d. Unvaccinated soldiers who have submitted requests for medical exemptions or religious accommodations are currently temporarily exempt from the vaccine as their requests remain under review. The army said out of the 709 permanent medical exemption requests submitted, only six have been approved while 656 have been rejected. Additionally, 2,910 claims of permanent religious exemptions have been submitted, with 266 being rejected and none being approved as of 26 January. As of 26 January, army commanders had issued over 3,000 written reprimands to soldiers who refused the vaccination order, as well as relieved six regular army leaders, including two battalion commanders. Other branches of the US military, including the US air force, have already begun to remove those who have chosen not to receive a Covid vaccine, which were first authorized for emergency use in December 2020.

What has been lacking has been a clear strategy for addressing these overwhelming problems. One difficulty may be that the services required are not biomedical but psychological and involve social services. Neither senior nor NHS local management have begun properly to integrate these services into their planning. As the December 2021 update to the NHS psychological professions workforce plan for England commented, it \u201cshone a spotlight on the psychological professions specifically because of the massive growth required in those occupations and because the unique contribution of these diverse roles is not widely understood\u201d. Training additional staff will take years. Four steps could be taken that will make a rapid difference. First, appoint a chief psychological professions officer at national level. Second, require service commissioners to identify a consultant clinical psychologist to provide them with advice concerning psychological disorders, therapies and service organisation. Third, require NHS trusts to maximise the effectiveness of their psychological services by ensuring that they are led by a consultant clinical psychologist and all providers of psychological therapies are adequately supervised by clinical psychologists. And last, minimise the loss of qualified psychological therapists from the NHS by providing funded career pathways.

            "date": "2022-02-23T16:00:02Z",
            "content": "Hot summer temperatures drive up the number of people suffering mental health emergencies, the most comprehensive study to date has found. The analysis of medical records from millions of US citizens showed an average 8% rise in the rate of emergency hospital visits on days when the temperature was in the top 5% of those recorded across the decade-long study. The effect was seen for almost all mental health conditions, including stress, mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, self-harm, and substance use disorders. The frequency of extreme temperatures is being driven up by the climate crisis, and the researchers said their work could help mental health services predict and prepare for times of greater need. \u201cPeople are familiar with the risks of extreme heat in terms of dehydration, heatstroke, etc,\u201d said Prof Gregory Wellenius, at the Boston University school of public health in the US and senior author of the research. \u201cWhat\u2019s really novel is that this study establishes at an unprecedented scale that days of extreme heat can also impact people\u2019s mental health in a substantial way. And this isn\u2019t just for a niche, vulnerable population. This is in every age bracket we looked at, for both men and women, and in every region of the country. Everybody is at risk.\u201d The medical database used for the analysis did not include people without health insurance. \u201cWe expect [the 8% rise in risk] is an underestimate of the true burden of disease associated with extreme heat, because the most vulnerable individuals are less likely to be in this database and, frankly, less likely to be treated in the same way for mental health,\u201d Wellenius said. Emergency visits to hospitals are the most severe presentations of mental health disorders, said Prof Amruta Nori-Sarma, also at Boston University and first author of the study: \u201cEven small increases in the number of emergency department visits represent a huge burden to the individuals and to the system.\u201d The study showed the biggest increase in the rate of emergency visits was across the north of the US, rising to 12% in the north-west region. That might appear counterintuitive, said Nori-Sarma, as temperatures in the southern US are hotter: \u201cBut we see the opposite.\u201d The reason may be that those living in hotter places are already better adapted, with more access to air conditioners, for example. \u201cThis finding is important from a future vulnerability perspective, as we can expect that populations that don\u2019t have those adaptive capacities might be more stressed during times of extreme heat,\u201d she said. According to a report in May 2021, the climate crisis is inflicting huge hidden costs on the mental health of people around the world, such as heatwaves increasing rates of suicide, floods leaving victims traumatised, and loss of food security, homes and livelihoods causing stress and depression. The latest research, which was published in the journal Jama Psychiatry, examined anonymised data on 3.5m emergency hospital visits for mental health disorders made by 2.2 million people from 2010-2019. The study focused on the warmest months, May to September, and covered 2,775 counties, which account for 98% of US citizens. Seven of the warmest years on record for the US have occurred since 2014, the researchers noted. The increased risk was slightly higher for men than for women, the scientists found, potentially because men are less likely to seek early help and may therefore need emergency care more frequently. The only major mental health disorders that did not prompt a rise in emergency visits on hot days were personality and behavioural disorders, which are relatively rare and therefore had a smaller sample. The rise in emergency visit rates was similar for most disorders, the researchers said, indicating that the heat exacerbates existing conditions. This could be due to increasing daytime irritation or discomfort or by disruption of sleep during hot nights. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that a changing climate threatens our bodies and our minds,\u201d said Dr Emma Lawrance of Imperial College London, UK, and not part of the study. \u201cWhile the effect is relatively small, it has big implications for public health and healthcare systems as climate change increases the number of days of extreme heat; children born today will experience seven times as many heatwaves as their grandparents.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just people with more severe symptoms of mental ill-health who are affected by heat \u2013 many of us have more symptoms of anxiety, depression and lower mood at higher temperatures. The effects are unequal though, with poorer communities often more exposed to heat. \u201cWe need climate mitigation to help prevent worsening of these impacts, and climate adaptation to provide more tree cover and access to green space to prevent urban \u2018heat islands\u2019.\u201d The study used a \u201ccase-crossover\u201d design, where individuals are followed over a period of time and can therefore serve as their own experimental controls. A person\u2019s increased risk of an emergency visit on a hot day was calculated by comparing that day with the same day of the week in the week before and after. This cancels out other personal factors that might influence the results, such as age or occupation."

She was caring for her father, 90, who was deteriorating from Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia, and looking after him had become increasingly difficult. Social life in her community in Johnson Fold, Bolton, had been Powell\u2019s escape from the pressure at home, but when Covid restrictions were introduced \u201ceverything was just gone\u201d. She was depressed, anxious and having panic attacks \u201clike a washing machine on full spin\u201d. Doctors had prescribed Powell pills for a host of ailments, mental and physical \u2013 \u201cthat much medication I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t sound like a set of maracas when I walk\u201d, she said. \u201cBut \u2026 having suffered with mental illness for the past 30 years I knew that this had got beyond where medication could help. \u201cMedication can only do so much when you\u2019re stuck in four walls.\u201d That was when a nurse at her local surgery put Powell in touch with Trisha Goodwin, a social prescribing link worker at Bolton GP Federation. \u201cTrisha mentioned about going on walks, and I was like, well, I love walking and if it\u2019s a small group I don\u2019t mind,\u201d Powell said. She now credits Goodwin'\u2019s suggestion with having helped saved her life. In response to a dramatic increase in mental health referrals around the pandemic, Bolton GP Federation and the Woodland Trust worked together to create a programme of \u201ctranquility walks\u201d, focusing on woodland, water and relaxation as a space to deal with anxiety. The group met at Barrow Bridge, a short walk from Powell\u2019s home. Led by a Woodland Trust officer, they rambled through woodland on the Smithills estate, a site recently bought by the charity. It was a place Powell already knew and would visit to think. \u201cBut since doing the tranquility walks the thinking time has taken on a whole new meaning because I\u2019m taking notice of the sounds, the smells,\u201d she said. \u201cThe running water, because there\u2019s a stream \u2026 and the birds\u2019 song and the rustling of the leaves and the wind \u2026 it\u2019s just nice to take time out. It\u2019s lovely and it\u2019s on my doorstep.\u201d Vicky Entwistle, who works at the estate and led walks, said groups would stop to listen to branches and leaves swaying, or to watch dappled light through the canopy, an experience many found transformative. \u201cIt shows the importance of getting more nature to people\u2019s doorsteps to help boost our health everyday, and the clear benefits of social prescribing with nature,\u201d she said. Wildlife Trust is backing a petition to call on the government to enshrine in law a right to access to nature. The fortnightly Smithills tranquility walks have continued for a year now, and members of the group have formed strong bonds, Powell says. But she goes out more, when health permits it. She has become an advocate for open spaces, volunteering at Smithills \u2013 and sharing a newfound passion for mycology with her granddaughters. \u201cI just forget everything when I\u2019m out,\u201d she said. \u201cAll my worries and stresses of home, stresses of family, and just lose track of time.\u201d This article was amended on 21 February 2022, to correct the spelling of Trish Goodwin\u2019s name."

            "content": "The UK\u2019s biggest crisis text line for people needing urgent mental health support gave third-party researchers access to millions of messages from children and other vulnerable users despite a promise never to do so. Shout, a helpline launched with a \u00a33m investment from the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, says it offers a confidential service for people struggling to cope with issues such as suicidal thoughts, self-harm, abuse and bullying. An FAQ section on its website had said that while \u201canonymised and aggregated\u201d, \u201chigh-level data\u201d from messages was passed to trusted academic partners for research to improve the service, \u201cindividual conversations cannot and will not ever be shared\u201d. But that promise was deleted from the site last year, and access to millions of messages from people \u2013 including children under 13 \u2013 has since been given to third-party researchers, the Observer has found. Mental Health Innovations, the charity that runs the helpline, said all users agreed to terms of service that allowed data to be shared with researchers for studies that would \u201cultimately benefit those who use our service and the broader population\u201d. But the findings have led to a backlash among privacy experts, data ethicists and people who use the helpline, who said the data sharing raised ethical concerns. More than 10.8m messages from 271,445 conversations between February 2018 and April 2020 were used in a project with Imperial College London aimed at creating tools that use artificial intelligence to predict behaviour, including for instance, suicidal thoughts. Personal identifiers including names and phone numbers were removed before the messages were analysed, according to Shout, which says the messages had been \u201canonymised\u201d. But data used in the research included \u201cfull conversations\u201d about people\u2019s personal problems, according to the study. Part of the research was aimed at gleaning personal information about the texters from their messages, such as their age, gender and disability, to get a better understanding of who was using the service. Cori Crider, a lawyer and co-founder of Foxglove, an advocacy group for digital rights, said giving researchers access to the messages raised \u201cserious ethical questions\u201d. \u201cTrust is everything in health \u2013 and in mental health most of all. When you start by saying in your FAQs that \u2018individual conversations cannot and will not ever be shared\u2019; and suddenly move to training AI on hundreds of thousands of \u2018full conversations\u2019, you\u2019ve left behind the feelings and expectations of the vulnerable people you serve,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly sad because this can set back proper consented research by years. Lack of trust in these systems can discourage desperate people from coming forward.\u201d Others raised concerns that people using the service could not truly comprehend how their messages would be used when at crisis point \u2013 even if they were told it was going to be used in research \u2013 because of their vulnerable state. About 40% of people texting the helpline are suicidal, according to Shout, and many are under 18. Claire Maillet, 30, who used the service for support with anxiety and an eating disorder in 2019 and 2020, said she had no idea messages could be used for research. \u201cMy understanding was that the conversation would stay between me and the person I was messaging and wouldn\u2019t go any further,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had known that it would, then I can\u2019t say for certain that I still would have used the service.\u201d Maillet said she \u201cabsolutely understood\u201d the need to conduct research in order to \u201cmake services better\u201d in cases where people could give their informed consent. But she said using conversations from a crisis helpline raised ethical concerns, even when names were removed, due to the nature of what\u2019s being discussed. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at that crisis point, you\u2019re not thinking, \u2018Will this information be used for research?\u2019 You can spin it in a way that makes it sound good, but it feels like they are exploiting vulnerability in a way.\u201d Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, which campaigns for the privacy of health data, said it was \u201cunreasonable to expect a young person or any person in crisis to be able to understand\u201d that their conversations could be used for purposes other than providing them support. \u201cThere are clearly reasons why Shout might need to retain data: no one is denying that. It\u2019s these other uses: they are just not what people would expect.\u201d He added that it was \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cplainly wrong\u201d that the charity had told users that their individual conversations would not be shared. \u201cIf you make a promise like that you should stick to it,\u201d he said. Shout was set up in 2019 as a legacy of Heads Together, a campaign led by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry aimed at ending stigma around mental health. The goal of the service is to provide round-the-clock mental health support to people in the UK, many of whom struggle to access overstretched NHS services, who can text a number and receive a response from a trained volunteer. Mental Health Innovations states that a key goal is to use \u201canonymised, aggregated data to generate unique insights into the mental health of the UK population\u201d. \u201cWe use these insights to enhance our services, to inform the development of new resources and products, and to report on trends of interest for the broader mental health sector,\u201d it says. When service users first contact Shout, they are told: \u201cThis is confidential unless we\u2019re worried for your safety and must tell someone to keep you safe.\u201d They are also sent a link to a text with a link to the website and privacy policy with the message: \u201cIn using the service you confirm acceptance of our terms and consent to processing of your data.\u201d However, previous versions of the FAQs made a promise that has since been deleted, meaning people who texted the service in the past \u2013 including those whose messages were used in the research \u2013 are likely to have read information that was later changed. An archived version of the helpline\u2019s website from March 2020 shows that, in the FAQ section, users were told: \u201cWe anonymise and aggregate high-level data from conversations in order to study and improve our own performance. We share some of this data with carefully selected and screened academic partners, but the data is always anonymised, individual conversations cannot and will not ever be shared.\u201d In late spring 2021, the FAQ section was updated and the promise about individual conversations removed. The privacy policy was also updated to say that as well as sharing data, it could be used to \u201cenable a deeper understanding of the mental health landscape in the UK more generally\u201d, opening the door to a broader range of uses. The Imperial study, published in December 2021, involved analysis of \u201centire conversations\u201d manually and using artificial intelligence, according to the paper. To improve the service, it had three goals: predicting the conversation stages of messages, predicting behaviours from texters and volunteers and \u201cclassifying full conversations to extrapolate demographic information\u201d \u2013 for instance by scanning messages for things such as numbers or mentions of school life, which might indicate a user\u2019s age. \u201cLooking forward, we aim to train models to classify labels that could be considered directly actionable or provide a direct measure of conversation efficacy. For example, a key future aim is prediction of a texter\u2019s risk of suicide,\u201d wrote the researchers. Data was handled in a trusted research environment and the study received ethics approval from Imperial, which said the research \u201cfully complied\u201d with \u201cstringent ethical review policies\u201d and provided \u201ccrucial insights\u201d. But Dr Sandra Leaton Gray, associate professor of education at University College London, an expert on the effects of technology on children and young people, said that as a researcher she saw \u201ca lot of red flags\u201d with the secondary data use, including that parental consent was not sought. Dr Christopher Burr, an ethics fellow and expert in AI at the Alan Turing Institute, said responsible data analysis could bring huge benefits. But he said not being clear enough with users about how sensitive conversations would be used created a \u201cculture of distrust\u201d. \u201cThey ought to be doing more to ensure their users are meaningfully informed about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. The concerns about Shout follow an investigation in the US by the news site Politico that exposed a data-sharing partnership between an American mental health charity and a for-profit company. Shout is the UK counterpart of Crisis Text Line US, which faced intense scrutiny earlier this month over its dealings with Loris.AI, a company that promises to help companies \u201chandle their hard customer conversations with empathy\u201d. After details of the partnership with Loris came to light, Crisis Text Line cut ties with the organisation, and UK users were assured that their data had not been shared with Loris. As well as working with academic researchers, Mental Health Innovations has formed partnerships with private bodies including Hive Learning, a tech company. Hive, whose clients include Boots and Deloitte, worked with Shout to create an AI-powered mental health programme that the firm sells to companies to help them \u201csustain mass behaviour change at scale\u201d. It is owned by Blenheim Chalcot, \u201cthe UK\u2019s leading digital venture builder\u201d, which was founded by Shout trustee Charles Mindenhall. Mental Health Innovations said \u201cno data relating to any texter conversations\u201d had been shared with Hive and that its training programme was \u201cdeveloped with learnings from our volunteer training model\u201d. In a statement, the charitysaid that all data shared with academic researchers, including Imperial, had details including names, addresses, city names, postcodes, email addresses, URLs, phone numbers and social media handles removed, and claimed it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that it could be tied to individuals. It said seeking parental consent before using the data in research \u201cwould make the service inaccessible for many children and young people\u201d, adding that it understood that texters \u201cdesperate for immediate help \u2026 may not be able to read the terms and conditions that we send before they start their conversation with us\u201d, but that the privacy policy remained available for them to read at a later stage. If they later decided to withdraw consent, they could text \u201cLoofah\u201d to the helpline number and would have their information deleted, a spokeswoman said. Victoria Hornby, Mental Health Innovations\u2019 chief executive, added that the dataset built from Shout conversations was \u201cunique\u201d because it contained information about \u201cpeople in their own words\u201d, and could unlock huge benefits in mental health research. She said the promise about individual conversations never being shared was in the FAQs, rather than the actual privacy policy, and had been removed from the website because it could be \u201ceasily misunderstood\u201d due to there being \u201cdifferent interpretations\u201d of what \u201cindividual conversations\u201d meant. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to be misunderstood so we changed it,\u201d she said. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog, said it was assessing evidence relating to Shout and Mental Health Innovations\u2019 handling of user data. A spokeswoman said: \u201cWhen handling and sharing people\u2019s health data, especially children\u2019s data, organisations need to take extra care and put safeguards in place to ensure their data is not used or shared in ways they would not expect. We will assess the information and make enquiries on this matter.\u201d \u2022 Footnote added 9 January 2024: Mental Health Innovations (MHI) has made us aware that, in April 2023, the ICO issued the outcome of an investigation into the Shout service, which took place following publication of this article. It concluded that MHI had complied with UK data protection rules and that it was \u201ceffectively anonymising data shared with third parties for research purposes\u201d, by removing names and other identifying attributes. The ICO said the anonymised datasets were shared on a \u201climited and highly secure basis, with a small number of researchers via a secure server\u201d. At the time the above footnote was added, the article\u2019s headline was amended to further clarify that the piece addresses the sharing of users\u2019 conversations, notwithstanding that they were anonymised.

            "date": "2022-02-25T07:46:03Z",
            "content": "Australia has vowed to keep ratcheting up sanctions in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 but it has virtually zero economic leverage over Moscow. Trade figures make that clear: Australia was 94th on the list of Russia\u2019s main export destinations before the pandemic upended the world, which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade rounded down to 0.0% of Russia\u2019s exports. Australia was 47th on the list of Russia\u2019s import sources. In both directions, Russia\u2019s most significant trading partners are China, the United States and European countries. This tends to explain why the head of Treasury advised Scott Morrison\u2019s national security committee earlier this week that Australia could expand sanctions \u201cwith minimal impact on Australian businesses\u201d. \u201cAustralia\u2019s trade with Russia is essentially negligible from both countries\u2019 point of view in a big strategic sense,\u201d says Dr William Stoltz, from the Australian National University\u2019s national security college. \u201cSo our sanctions have to be part of a larger global effort really to close off Russia\u2019s economy from the world.\u201d Australia began by imposing travel bans and targeted financial sanctions on eight members of the Russian Federation\u2019s security council, on the basis that this group had backed the false pretext for sending troops into Ukraine. This body, chaired by Vladimir Putin, has 12 permanent members including the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. But Lavrov was not included in the sanctions that took effect early Friday morning (nor was Putin). The eight targeted members included Dmitry Medvedev, who is deputy chair of Russia\u2019s security council and was previously president and prime minister. The second round of sanctions \u2013 which also took effect on Friday morning \u2013 targeted another 25 officials including Anton Vaino, chief of staff of Putin\u2019s Presidential Executive Office, along with military commanders and deputy defence ministers. Four military contracting firms were also targeted. The government has also moved to curb business with a number of Russian banks and Morrison said on Friday the next targets will be more than 300 members of Russia\u2019s parliament that rubber-stamped the invasion, along with Russian oligarchs. The names of the oligarchs targeted have not yet been released. Experts don\u2019t believe there\u2019s much more Australia can do in the sanctions space. \u201cRussia has been hardening itself to economic sanctions over the past 20 years,\u201d Stoltz says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clearly evident from Putin\u2019s behaviour in the last couple of days that he does not care about the economic hit that his country will take,\u201d he says. While that might change as the US, Europe and the UK continue to raise the economic costs, he says \u201ceconomic sanctions alone are not enough\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia exported $723m in goods to Russia in 2019-20, including live animals, specialised machinery and meat, according to data compiled by Dfat. In that same year, Australia imported $250m in goods from Russia, such as fertilisers ($71m) and crude petroleum ($59m). Curbing imports such as crude petroleum may have to be \u201con the table\u201d for discussion, says Stoltz, but importers may also be weighing up those growing risks. \u201cIf you were a business in Australia doing business with Russia, I think on your own volition you\u2019d be looking for other opportunities. It\u2019s all just too uncertain.\u201d Australian superannuation funds are also weighing up the impact of the crisis. \u201cAt UniSuper we have no direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine,\u201d says its chief investment officer, John Pearce. \u201cHowever, like every other fund we are exposed to the impacts of higher energy prices. It\u2019s pretty clear that the invasion has contributed to a perfect storm [of higher inflation and interest rates] that had already engulfed markets.\u201d Morrison said on Friday that Australia was playing its part alongside countries that had bigger economic stakes in Russia to \u201cdemonstrate very forcefully that we are all working together to shut Russia out as a result of their violence and their unlawful actions\u201d. But Morrison and the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, both took aim at China after a report said it was fully opening up to Russian wheat exports, which had previously been subject to health-related restrictions. Australia is basically playing a supporting role, rather than a lead role, in the sanctions effort. \u201cAnd that\u2019s ultimately why China\u2019s refusal [to add to the pressure] is so problematic in terms of getting a unified international response,\u201d Stoltz says, \u201cbecause you have to have no safe haven, essentially, and at the moment there\u2019s a big one.\u201d Additional reporting by Paul Karp"

            "date": "2022-02-23T17:03:00Z",
            "content": "Be ready for a long haul. That was the subtext of Boris Johnson\u2019s message to MPs as he committed to toughening up sanctions against Russia. The warning to prepare for a \u201cprotracted struggle\u201d was both timely and appropriate. There will be no quick knockout blow because Vladimir Putin has had time to prepare and is well dug-in. On the face of it, it should be an unequal fight. Russia is the world\u2019s biggest landmass but has annual output smaller than Italy\u2019s. Income a head is about a quarter of that in the UK. Russia\u2019s economy has gone through distinct phases since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s: an initial shock treatment that resulted in a savage recession and culminated in a financial crisis in 1998; a strong recovery in the first decade of the 21st century on the back of booming oil and gas exports; and a recent period of stagnation as the failure to diversify the economy took its toll. After growing by 7% a year on average in the decade leading up to the global financial crash of 2008, the Russian economy was expanding by only about 2% annually in the three years leading up to the pandemic. The upshot is that \u2013 in some respects at least \u2013 the economy has not really moved on since the days of the Soviet Union. Russia is still rich in natural resources and human capital but performs sluggishly and has only limited ties with the west. Dr Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at the investment bank Berenberg, said Russia was a major military power and energy producer, but not a relevant market for most countries. Germany, for example, exports far more to Poland than it does to Russia. But, as those who have taken on Russia in the past have found to their cost, appearances can be deceptive and there are a number of reasons why a swift victory by the west looks unlikely. Firstly, Putin has been actively seeking to insulate Russia from the west ever since the invasion of the Crimea in 2014. Western imports of meat, fruit, vegetables and dairy were banned when sanctions were imposed. Secondly, self-sufficiency has been accompanied by an attempt at diversification, with a deliberate policy pivot towards China. An agreement with Beijing \u2013 again in 2014 \u2013 paved the way for the construction of the Power of Siberia \u2013 a gas pipeline linking the two countries that opened in 2019. China is the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and its heavy demand for energy has been one of the factor pushing up global energy prices over the past year. Putin has already given approval for Power of Siberia 2. Thirdly, Russia has used the money received from its oil and gas exports to build up substantial financial defences. Moscow is sitting on foreign currency reserves of about $500bn (\u00a3369bn) and, by international standards, has extremely low levels of national debt. Whereas the pandemic has sent the UK\u2019s national debt to GDP ratio spiralling above 100%, in Russia it is below 20%. That financial firepower may well blunt one of the weapons the west intends to deploy in response to the crisis in Ukraine: a ban on Russia issuing or trading its sovereign debt in London and New York. The amount of bonds Russia needs to sell is relatively small, and only 10% of the total was bought by non-residents last year. Finally, Putin has some weapons of his own that he may be tempted to use in retaliation against western sanctions. Russia provides 40% of the EU\u2019s oil and coal, and 20% of its gas. It is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of fertiliser and of palladium, a crucial component for the auto industry because it is needed to make catalytic converters. The Kiel Institute, a German thinktank, says stopping gas exports would knock 3% off Russian GDP while ending oil exports would result in a 1.2% hit. While western countries would be able to source their energy elsewhere, a reduction in supply would inevitably lead to rising oil and gas prices. Even during the tensest periods of the cold war, the Soviet Union continued to supply energy to the west. Cutting off oil and gas supplies would come at a heavy cost but be an example of a strategy deployed before in the country\u2019s history: scorched-earth policy."

            "date": "2022-02-13T00:05:07Z",
            "content": "It has taken 14 years but a minor miracle is about to happen, probably within months: the state\u2019s stake in NatWest will fall below 50%. We will no longer have to refer to the former Royal Bank of Scotland as \u201cmajority owned\u201d by the government. Hallelujah. NatWest\u2019s full-year figures for 2021, to be announced on Friday, won\u2019t in themselves trigger further disposals of government-owned shares, but they should confirm that the climate is ripe to continue a sell-down programme that has been buzzing along in the background for the past year. At the start of 2021, the state\u2019s ownership, managed by UK Government Investments, was 62%. Now it is roughly 52%, with the reduction coming via three means. First, sales back to NatWest itself. Second, sales to other investors via a \u201cbook-build\u201d placement process. Third, a \u201ctrading plan\u201d unveiled last July that drip-feeds shares into the market and avoids the inevitable small discount that has to be conceded in a lumpy placement. The only effective limitation on these bit-by-bit methods is the standard one about prices having to represent \u201cvalue for money for taxpayers\u201d. That is not currently an impediment because chancellors long ago accepted that the public purse was never going to recoup the full \u00a346bn pumped into RBS during the depths of the 2008-09 banking crisis. Some \u00a31.1bn was raised by selling a chunk of shares at 190.5p last March, and the same again in May at almost exactly the same price. Since then, NatWest\u2019s share price \u2013 in common with most banks\u2019 \u2013 has improved very nicely. The closing price at the end of last week was 253p. There is every reason for the government to keep dribbling shares into the market. The main interest for other shareholders in this Friday\u2019s report is whether the spectacular recovery in banks\u2019 valuations can be sustained. In NatWest\u2019s case, it\u2019s been quite a ride since the pre-vaccine low of 95p-ish in September 2020, a time when banks were piling up provisions as they prepared for a locked-down economy to impair their loan books on several fronts \u2013 notably business loans, personal loans and credit cards. Instead, furlough and Covid support schemes held down defaults and the surge in unemployment didn\u2019t materialise. Last July, in its half-year report, NatWest was able to write back about \u00a3600m of impairments \u201cas a result of the improved economic outlook\u201d. Another \u00a3242m was released at the nine-month stage. Will more reversals happen at the full-year stage? Actually, analysts say no \u2013 probably because the whoosh of recovery (the UK economy grew 7.5% in 2021, we learned last week) is in the rear-view mirror and we\u2019re now looking at rising interest rates, higher taxes and a cost-of-living squeeze. Therein lies the real interest in NatWest\u2019s numbers: management\u2019s view of the medium-term future. On one hand, banks will be enjoying the rise in interest rates, which relieves pressure on their lending margins. On the other, squeezed household budgets and reduced consumer confidence tends to reduce demand for credit. Back in October, chief executive Alison Rose saw \u201cchallenges in the economy and for our customers\u201d but her tone was positive overall. Any change to that nuanced outlook will be of wider interest because NatWest is the first big UK lender out of the blocks in this year\u2019s reporting season. One suspects she\u2019ll defer any excitement over the government\u2019s looming sub-50% holding until the milestone has been passed. Instead, the focus will be on dividends and share buy-backs, where the City expects a large helping of both on the back of pre-tax profits forecast to be \u00a33.1bn. But the outlook statement is the thing: NatWest, along with Lloyds, offers a good guide to the underlying health of the UK economy, and the mood may be shifting."

            "date": "2022-02-09T19:37:46Z",
            "content": "Blockades on the busiest border bridge between Canada and the US could have a serious impact on the economies of both countries, disrupting the automotive industry, agricultural exports, and causing multimillion-dollar losses, the two countries\u2019 governments have said. The warnings came as business associations said that manufacturing plants at the heart of North America\u2019s automotive industry face potential shortages, shutdowns, layoffs as \u201cfreedom convoy\u201d protesters continue to block traffic on the Ambassador Bridge, between the car-manufacturing cities of Detroit and Windsor. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for everyone in Canada and the United States to understand what the potential impact of this blockage is on workers, on the supply chain,\u201d the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said on Wednesday. Tiff Macklem, the governor of the Bank of Canada said: \u201cIf there were to be prolonged blockages at key entry points into Canada that could start to have a measurable impact on economic activity in Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already got a strained global supply chain. We don\u2019t need this.\u201d Late on Wednesday Ford announced that it had been forced to close an engine plant in Windsor, and reduce hours at a second factory because of the blockade. David Adams, president of auto industry group Global Automakers of Canada, told the Guardian that between 5,000 and 7,000 trucks use the Ambassador Bridge daily to deliver automotive parts. The bridge is responsible for 27% of all Canada-US trade. \u201cIt\u2019s a pivotal border crossing,\u201d he said. Vehicles are Canada\u2019s second-largest export, with the US buying more than 90% of that supply. Business associations warned that manufacturers in the region risk losing $50m a day because of delays. Meanwhile hundreds of protesters remain encamped in Canada\u2019s capital, Ottawa, and in the west of the country disruptions have continued at Alberta\u2019s main road crossing into the United States. Flavio Volpe, head of Canada\u2019s Automotive Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association \u2013 said the blockades, organized in the name of Canadian truckers who oppose mandatory mask mandates \u2013 could result in layoffs for the very people the protests purportedly represent. Volpe described the blockade as a \u201cbrain dead move\u201d. \u201cBy allowing the protests to continue, we\u2019re giving the impression that you can take over the country with a couple Hyundai Tucsons and a flimsy cover that you\u2019re representing a group that has clearly said you do not,\u201d Volpe told the Guardian. He said that the blockade could ultimately lead to the shutdown of automotive parts manufacturers on both sides of the border. \u201cThis is literally the stupidest thing you could do,\u201d he continued. Between 50 and 75 vehicles and 100 individuals were involved in the blockade, the Windsor police chief, Pam Mizuno, said on Wednesday. At the same news conference, Windsor\u2019s mayor, Drew Dilkens, said that the demonstration had so far been \u201cpeaceful and without incident\u201d but added that local authorities had requested additional support. He also said he didn\u2019t want to \u201crisk additional conflict\u201d by removing protesters. Police have repeatedly been accused of turning a blind eye to brazen infractions of the law as protests proliferate across the country. The protest movement was initially spurred by a federal vaccine mandate for truck drivers crossing the Canada-US border, but has evolved into a mixture of anti-vaccination, anti-mandate and anti-government complaints. In Ottawa, 23 arrests have been made and hundreds of tickets have been issued by local police. But the downtown area remains paralysed by rows of trucks and other vehicles, some of which are parked directly in front of the Canadian parliament. Police say a considerable amount of financial support is coming from the US, which has enabled protesters to stay in place. Dozens of small businesses and their employees have been affected by the blockades, some of them having to close for the duration of the protests to avoid run-ins with the protesters \u2013 many of whom are unvaccinated and who refuse to wear masks inside. Convoy representatives have said they have no intention of leaving until their demands are met. Late on Tuesday, one organizer prompted concern with comments that the protest convoy would move on to Canada\u2019s most populous city, Toronto, but he later said he was just \u201cplaying a game\u201d with the police. But on online protester channels, calls were made to block additional border crossings between Canada and the US, further threatening a trade relationship valued at more than US$700bn. Meanwhile anti-vaccine mandate protesters in France launched their own \u201cfreedom convoy\u201d, with many displaying Canadian flags. Some 200 protesters assembled in a parking lot in Nice, on France\u2019s Mediterranean coast, saying that they planned to head first to Paris, then on to Brussels to demand the scrapping of rules barring people from public venues if they do not have a Covid-19 vaccination. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2022. Owing to an editing change, an earlier story version spoke of blockading at an \u201cinternational bridge\u201d in Alberta. The Coutts border point is a normal land crossing."

            "content": "Russia\u2019s central bank has more than doubled interest rates to 20% and refused to open the Moscow stock exchange as it sought to protect its economy from Ukraine-related sanctions that sent the value of the rouble plunging by a fifth. Amid growing queues at cash machines across Russia, the central bank tried to prevent the currency falling further by increasing the main rate from 9.5% to 20% and preventing trading. It went further by ordering domestic businesses to sell 80% of their dollar assets held abroad to circumvent a clampdown by the US and EU aimed at preventing the central bank from selling foreign holdings worth $640bn (\u00a3477bn) under its control to help the war effort. With the invasion of Ukraine by Kremlin forces entering its fifth day on Monday, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank spearheaded plans to effectively ban assets sales by Russia\u2019s central bank. Restrictions on trades using the Swift international trading system were agreed by the western powers over the weekend, in a move that targeted a range of commercial banks, including a ban on transactions by the central bank. The UK government said the package of sanctions would \u201cdevastate Russia\u2019s economy\u201d. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said they \u201cdemonstrate our steadfast resolve in imposing the highest costs on Russia and to cut her off from the international financial system so long as this conflict [with Ukraine] persists\u201d. The US went further, saying it would place sanctions on Russia\u2019s most prominent sovereign wealth fund, the RDIF, and its chief executive, Kirill Dmitriev, a key ally of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin Without access to foreign buyers, the rouble was expected to crash further once markets inside Russia re-opened, analysts said. Russian bonds tumbled as investors braced for the possibility that the sanctions could push Moscow to default on its debt for the first time since 1998. The Institute of International Finance said it was \u201cextremely likely\u201d that Moscow would default on its foreign debts, although the relatively small $60bn size of the holdings would limit the fallout. Russia\u2019s central bank initially delayed trading on Moscow\u2019s stock exchange on Monday until at least 3pm local time, before saying it would stay closed all day. The rouble fell 30% to a record low against the dollar before the intervention, and later eased to stand 20% down. \u201cExternal conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,\u201d the central bank said, adding that the interest rate increase would \u201censure a rise in deposit rates to levels needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risk\u201d. The central bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, said in a speech on Monday afternoon that Russia had a system that could replace the Swift international payments system internally, stressing the need to support clients of banks. She said all banks in Russia would fulfil their obligations and all funds on their accounts were secured. On Friday, rating agency S&amp;P Global cut Russia\u2019s debt rating to \u201cjunk\u201d status, underlining the risk that the economic situation inside Russia could deteriorate rapidly. S&amp;P also downgraded Ukraine\u2019s credit rating, though it said aid promised by the US, UK, EU, Japan and the International Monetary Fund, should be enough to finance most needs this year, though it added that a prolonged war would change the financial situation dramatically. The Geneva-based Bank of International Settlements (BIS), an umbrella body for the world\u2019s central banks, said it would act in concert with the US, UK and EU to isolate Russia\u2019s central bank, adding: \u201cThe BIS will not be an avenue for sanctions to be circumvented.\u201d The head of the BIS\u2019s monetary and economic department, Claudio Borio, said the invasion of Ukraine, and the retribution for Russia, meant the global economy was now facing widespread uncertainty. Rising energy and commodity prices would further push up global inflation, he said, though it was unclear whether there would be unintended consequences from such far-reaching sanctions that have never been applied to a country so interconnected in the world economy as Russia. \u201cIt is hard to tell where markets will go from here,\u201d Borio said. \u201cThe situation has clearly changed.\u201d He added: \u201cCentral banks\u2019 challenges have become more complex\u201d\u2013 a reference to the fact many had been preparing to raise interest rates before the invasion. Neil Shearing, the group chief economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe central bank of Russia has this morning raised interest rates to 20% but other measures (eg limits on deposit withdrawals) are possible \u2026 All of this will accelerate Russia\u2019s economic downturn \u2013 a fall in GDP of 5% now looks likely. \u201cSubsidiaries of some Russian banks overseas are likely to come under intense pressure (and may fail), but we judge that these are probably too small to create systemic risks.\u201d"

            "content": "European stock markets have closed lower. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 31 points, or 0.4%, at 7,458 Germany\u2019s Dax down 106 points, or 0.7%, at 14,461 France\u2019s CAC down 93 points, or 1.4%, at 6,658 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 357 points, or 1.4%, at 25,415 And Shell has just said it will exit all its Russian operations, including its flagship Sakhalin 2 LNG plant in which it holds a 27.5% stake and which is operated and 50% owned by Russian gas giant Gazprom. The move comes a day after BP abandoned its stake in Rosneft, which could cost it $25bn. Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bye! The Institute of International Finance has warned that Russia is likely to default on its foreign debts. Ellina Ribakova, the institute\u2019s deputy chief economist, told reporters: If we stay here and this [the crisis] escalates, then default and restructuring is likely. She said a default was \u201cextremely likely,\u201d although the relatively small size of foreign debt holdings, of $60bn, would limit the fallout. Britain will impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s Sberbank once new legislation is introduced, according to the foreign secretary Liz Truss. She told parliament: We will bring a full asset freeze on all Russian banks in days, looking to coordinate with our allies. This same legislation will prevent the Russian state from raising debt here and it will isolate all Russian companies, that\u2019s over 3 million businesses, from accessing UK capital markets. The Moscow stock exchange remained closed, but London-listed Russian companies suffered heavy losses, led by the country\u2019s biggest lender Sberbank, which has a secondary listing in London, which plunged as much as 75%. The oil and gas producers Gazprom and Lukoil both lost more than 50% while Rosneft plunged 41%. The European Central Bank warned today that the European arm of Serbank could fail. Russian miners Polymetal and Evraz were the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 index throughout the day, falling 56% and 28% respectively. While trading in London continues, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the German stock exchange operator, suspended a number of Russian companies from trading today, including Sberbank and VTB Bank. With fierce fighting under way in Kyiv and other large Ukrainian cities, and grim reports of civilian casualties, the war in Ukraine shows no signs of abating. Financial markets responded in predictable fashion to wider western sanctions against Russia. The rouble crashed to a new record low of 120 per dollar in offshore trading and was down 18% to 98.21 per dollar in Moscow trading, after earlier losses of close to 30%. European stock indices have lost more than 2% while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index has dropped 105 points, or 1.4%, to 7,383. Wall Street has also opened lower. The Central Bank of Russia more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% and announced a slew of measures to prop up the rouble and the Russian economy, including ordering domestic exporting companies to sell 80% of their foreign exchange revenues. It refused to open the Moscow stock exchange on Monday, after initially delaying trading until 3pm Mosocow time. Governor Elvira Nabiullina said the central bank had sold $1bn of its foreign currency reserves to shore up the rouble last Thursday and a smaller amount on Friday, but did not intervene in currency markets today to preserve its reserves. Crude oil, gas and other commodities prices have surged. Bent crude is still trading above $100 a barrel, up 2.6%, after giving some of its earlier gains, while US light crude is 3.5% higher at $94.84. Aluminium set a new record and wheat, corn and soybean futures rose in Chicago. Palladium, used in car catalytic converters, rose 5% amid supply fears. Russia\u2019s Nornickel is the world\u2019s largest supplier of the precious metal. Spot gold, a safe-haven investment, is up 1.3% at $1,913 while the dollar has also benefited from a flight to safety. Gold has increased about 6.5% in February, touching an 18-month high of $1,7973.96 last week. Spot silver rose 1.3% to $24.50. The benchmark British natural gas price rose 14% to 255.50p while the Dutch gas futures April contract added 12% to \u20ac104.38 per megawatt hour. Our other main stories today: Wall Street has opened lower as the west ratcheted up sanctions against Russia. The Dow Jones fell 190 points, or 0.55%, to 33,870 at the opening bell, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped 30 points, or 0.7%, to 4,354 while the Nasdaq lost 124 points, or 0.9%, to 13,570. The Bank of Russia governor, Elvira Nabiullina, has set out the thinking behind the central bank\u2019s rate hike and other emergency measures. She said the central bank had sold $1bn of its foreign currency reserves to shore up the rouble last Thursday and a smaller amount on Friday, but did not intervene in currency markets today, to preserve its reserves. You can read the speech in full here. The conditions for the Russian economy have altered dramatically. The new sanctions imposed by foreign states have entailed a considerable increase in the ruble exchange rate and limited the opportunities for Russia to use its gold and foreign currency reserves. Accordingly, we need to employ a wide range of tools to maintain financial stability... We will make further decisions on monetary policy depending on actual developments and the assessment of risks, primarily related to external conditions. Today, Russia\u2019s financial system and economy are facing a totally abnormal situation, and the Bank of Russia will use any necessary tools very flexibly. As regards the banking sector liquidity, the Bank of Russia is continuously providing cash and non-cash rubles to banks. Due to the high demand for cash, the banking sector is now experiencing a structural liquidity deficit. Banks have sufficient collateral to increase the amount of liquidity raised from the Bank of Russia. Speaking of the foreign exchange market, the Bank of Russia carried out FX interventions totalling $1bn on Thursday and in a smaller amount on Friday. Considering the restrictions on using the gold and foreign currency reserves in dollars and euros, we have not carried out interventions today. Here is our full story on petrol prices in the UK rising above the 150p a litre threshold for the first time. The boss of the tour operator Tui, Fritz Joussen, has written a letter to staff in which he insists that having Alexey Mordashov, a high-profile Russian businessman who is pro Putin, as the travel company\u2019s single largest shareholder is not a problem. Mordashov owns a third of Tui, and sits on the 20-member supervisory board. He is the chairman and majority owner of Russia\u2019s biggest steel and mining company Severstal. Some of you have also asked me about our largest single shareholder Alexey Mordashov and our position with him. Mr Mordashov has been a TUI shareholder for around 15 years and has held about a third of our company since he propped it up during the Corona crisis. Two thirds of our shareholders are from Germany, the EU, the UK, the US or are funds. Mr Mordashov is also one of 20 representatives on the Supervisory Board elected by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. However, our company is run by the Executive Board, like any German public limited company, and not by the shareholders or the Supervisory Board. We therefore assume that any restrictions or sanctions against Mr Mordashov will not have any lasting negative consequences for us as a company. The EU is considering adding Mordashov and other oligarchs to its sanctions list, Bloomberg reported. Joussen added: We ourselves are no longer represented with companies in Russia and Ukraine. As you know, we sold our shareholdings in the tour operators in Russia and Ukraine some time ago. However, in order to ensure the safety of our customers, we will make or have already made adjustments in some areas, such as flight routes and cruise destinations. We are in contact with the employees of service providers in Ukraine who work for us and are supporting them as best we can to keep themselves and their families safe. GlaxoSmithKline boss Emma Walmsley has said she is \u201cextremely confident\u201d that the pharmaceutical firm will complete the giant spinout of its consumer healthcare unit in July, despite the market volatility caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, reports my colleague Jasper Jolly. The FTSE 100 company is demerging the unit, named Haleon last week, in what is expected to the largest London listing for a decade and the biggest demerger in 20 years. GSK on Monday pledged to investors that the new company, which will run brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Centrum vitamin supplements, would offer strong growth opportunities. The financial market turmoil caused by the invasion of Ukraine has already delayed the initial public offerings of some companies in Europe and the US. However, demergers are somewhat less dependent on market conditions as they do not usually involve the same need to persuade new investors to back them. GSK employs 400 people in Ukraine, and lists two businesses in Kyiv in its annual report, although it does not own any factories in the country. Walmsley said: We utterly condemn this invasion and the harm that it is causing the people of Ukraine. We strongly support the actions being taken by the UK and other governments, including sanctions. She added that the safety of employees was GSK\u2019s priority, and that she had personally spoken to the country managers. The company was helping with efforts to relocate workers where possible, and is in talks with Direct Relief, a charity, about donations of medicines. The US Treasury has banned transactions with Russia\u2019s central bank. This action effectively immobilizes any assets of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation held in the United States or by U.S. persons, wherever located. Russian stock markets will remain shut all day today, the Central Bank of Russia announced, after initially delaying trading until at least 3pm Moscow time. The Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea FC, is trying to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, according to his spokesperson. He handed \u201cstewardship and care\u201d of the Stamford Bridge club to to the trustees of the club\u2019s charitable foundation on Saturday, although this is legally contentious. The oligarch, who bought Chelsea in 2003, remains the owner but has relinquished the running of Chelsea after a call in parliament for him to be sanctioned following the invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich is now trying his hand at being a peace broker. His spokesperson told the PA news agency: I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since. Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement. Thank you. A natural gas pipeline linking Poland and Lithuania will open earlier than planned to help ease any supply issues. The pipeline, called GIPL, will open on 1 May, rather than this summer. It links the Polish grid with a route to a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Lithuania. This was announced by the Polish grid operator Gaz System, after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine triggered fears that Russian gas supplies to Europe could be cut. GIPL will allow Poland to boost its gas imports and to ship gas to the Baltic states to smooth out any interruptions. Here\u2019s a handy map showing the pipeline: Talks between Ukraine and Russia have begun, the foreign ministries of both countries have confirmed. Ukraine has said its goal for the talks is an \u201cimmediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops\u201d. Its delegation includes several high-ranking officials, but not its president Volodymyr Zelenskiy himself. The Kremlin has declined to comment on its aim in negotiations, but Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky has said Russia wants to reach an agreement that was in the interests of both sides.

Petrol averaged 151.25p a litre yesterday while diesel rose to 154.72p a litre. A year ago, filling up the typical 55-litre petrol tank cost \u00a367.86. It now costs \u00a383.19. Luke Bosdet, the AA\u2019s fuel price spokesman, said: Petrol at [above] 150p a litre reaches a milestone that millions of motorists, faced with a cost of living crisis, have dreaded. It comes as households are getting notices of domestic energy price rises in April. To think that, less than two years ago, fuel at \u00a31 a litre beckoned - although only a handful of forecourts went that far as most hung on to large chunks of potential savings from oil crashing below $22 a barrel. It is the cumulative impact of record pump prices, other inflation and tax rises, along with a raft of extra charges implemented or threatened by councils for motoring in city and town centres, that threatens those least able to bear the financial burden. For hundreds of thousands of them, the car is essential for going about their daily lives. Russ Mould, investment director at the investment firm AJ Bell, has looked at today\u2019s UK market moves. Disturbing footage of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine over the weekend and the former\u2019s decision to put its nuclear forces on high alert has served to spook investors once again, with equity markets falling across Europe. Weighing on the FTSE 100 was a 6.1% decline in BP, its biggest one-day fall since November 2021 and driven by the decision to exit its stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft. Expect a growing investor backlash against anything Russia-related, which explains why gold miner Polymetal has taken another beating, falling another 46%. Year to date the shares have now fallen by two thirds in value, putting the share price at levels not seen since 2015. Even worse was Sberbank whose London listed shares collapsed by 75%. Many investors are showing solidarity with the Ukraine and no longer believe it is morally right to have anything do with Russia in their portfolio. BAE Systems soared by 14% as investors flocked to the defence sector most likely in the belief that governments around the world would take another look at their defence budgets and increase spending. Fellow defence companies were also in demand, Chemring jumped 10% and Qinetiq was up nearly 9%, while French electrical systems group Thales advanced 13% given its position as a supplier to the defence sector. Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have become two of the country\u2019s first leading businesspeople to speak out against Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Fridman, who is one of Russia\u2019s richest men, controls private equity firm LetterOne and was a founder of Alfa Bank, Russia\u2019s largest private bank. In a letter to his employees he called for an end to the \u201cbloodshed\u201d. Britain\u2019s banks are among the biggest fallers on the London Stock Exchange this morning, after western governments agreed over the weekend to expand financial sanctions against Russia, reports our economics writer Phillip Inman. HSBC, NatWest, Barclays and Lloyds lost more than 3% of their value and were joined by the insurers Prudential and Legal &amp; General as investors shifted their funds to defence manufacturers and firms likely to benefit from price rises after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. As just reported, the European Central Bank has warned that the European arm of Russia\u2019s biggest bank, Sberbank, could fail under the weight of sanctions. Along with the escalation of the war in Ukraine, this has sent shockwaves through the European banking sector, with the European banking stock index falling 5.7%, compared with a 2.4% drop in the Euro Stoxx index of European bluechip shares. The hardest hit, with the most exposure to Russia, were Austria\u2019s Raiffeisenbank, which lost as much as 18%, while France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale fell 11% and the Dutch banking group ING and Italy\u2019s UniCredit both dropped about 10%. Russian stock markets remain shut for now, but London-listed Russian companies have plummeted. Sberbank collapsed more than 70% and Gazprom fell 44%. The European Central Bank warned that Sberbank Europe, the European arm of Russia\u2019s biggest bank, and two other subsidiaries under its watch \u201care failing or likely to fail ... owing to a deterioration of their liquidity situation\u201d. Austria\u2019s Financial Market Authority said it imposed a moratorium on Sberbank Europe, which is based in Austria. While trading in London continues, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the German stock exchange operator, suspended a number of Russian companies from trading, including the country\u2019s two biggest banks, Sberbank and VTB Bank. The warning to rich Russians linked to Putin that the UK government \u201cwill come after you\u201d and ensure oligarchs have \u201cnowhere to hide\u201d is likely to hit hard at the gated luxury housing estate in Surrey dubbed \u201cBritain\u2019s Beverly Hills,\u201d reports our wealth corrrespondent Rupert Neate. Russians and those from former Soviet states own more than a quarter of the 430 luxurious homes in St George\u2019s Hill, a heavily guarded 964-acre estate near Weybridge, Surrey, where mansions have changed hands for more than \u00a320m each. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said on Sunday that the government was drawing up a \u201chitlist\u201d of oligarchs with links to Putin who will be added to the sanctions list in coming days and weeks. Here is our full story on the Central Bank of Russia\u2019s emergency measures: Russia\u2019s central bank has more than doubled interest rates to 20%, and banned foreigners from selling local securities, in a bid to protect its currency and economy in the face of international sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine, writes my colleague Mark Sweney. The rate rise, from 9.5%, is aimed to balance the precipitous fall in value of the rouble and surging inflation as the country braces for its financial markets to take battering this week. Currency trading got under way in Moscow, but other markets were delayed from opening until at least 3pm. European stock markets are sliding: UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 1.6% at 7,372, a fall of 116 points Germany\u2019s Dax down 2.4% at 14,213 France\u2019s CAC down 3% at 6,545 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 2.8% at 2,5044 European defence stocks including Germany\u2019s arms manufacturer Rheinmetall (up 32%) and the UK\u2019s BAE (up nearly 14%) are surging on news that Germany will ramp up its defence spending to more than 2% of GDP. The Russian rouble is trading about 20% lower at 99.5 per dollar in Moscow, after crashing 28% to 106.44 earlier on the latest sanctions against Russia. In Asian trading it tumbled even further, to a new record low of 199.50 per dollar. Crude oil prices have jumped more than 4% above the $100 threshold, to $102.16 a barrel for Brent, the global benchmark, and $96.12 for US light crude. Gas prices are also soaring in response to wider economic sanctions against Russia. The Dutch benchmark rose 24% to \u20ac115 per megawatt hour while the UK March price climbed 22% to 275.5p per therm. Investors are worried that Russia could turn off its gas supplies to Europe, although Gazprom said it was shipping gas to Europe via Ukraine in line with customers\u2019 requests. A spokesperson for Germany\u2019s largest power producer RWE, which receives gas from Gazprom, also confirmed to Reuters that gas was flowing normally from Russia. Other commodities continue to charge higher. Aluminium hit a new all-time high of $3,525 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. Chicago wheat futures posted their biggest one-day gain in a decade, while corn prices rose 4% and soybeans were 2.6% higher. Russia and Ukraine together account for nearly 30% of global wheat exports and a fifth of the world\u2019s corn supply, according to Reuters. Spot gold has gained 0.7% to $1,901 an ounce as investors pile into safe-having investments, including the dollar. HSBC has started winding down relations with a number of Russian banks including the second-largest, VTB, as per the latest sanctions imposed by western nations. In a memo to staff seen by Reuters, HSBC, one of the world\u2019s biggest banks, tells staff how they should apply the new global sanctions on Russia. Headed \u201caction required\u201d and dated 27 February, it says that the UK Office of Financial Sanctions has authorised the \u201cwind down of certain transactions involving VTB Bank and certain UK subsidiaries\u201d. Last week, HSBC\u2019s chief financial officer said it had little exposure to Russia \u2013- only around 200 employees and annual revenues of $15, a frantion of its global total of $50bn. But the firm is the world\u2019s leading trade finance bank and Europe\u2019s second-largest lender and so remains a vital cog in the global banking machine. As sanctions against Russia widen, Norway\u2019s $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund -- the world\u2019s largest \u2013\u2013 announced on Sunday that it would sell its Russian assets. The Norwegian government said the fund\u2019s Russian assets, consisting of shares in 47 companies as well as government bonds, were worth 25bn Norwegian crowns at the end of 2021, down from 30bn a year earlier. The fund\u2019s most valuable stakes at the end of 2020 were in Sberbank, where the fund was the fourth-biggest shareholder; followed by the oil and gas producers Gazprom and Lukoil. Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said: Markets are digesting a raft of fresh sanctions that landed over the weekend: Swift ban, Russian central bank assets frozen, flight bans and all sorts. We have also seen an incredible turnaround in German post-war military restraint as it announced plans to increase the defence budget by \u20ac100bn this year. Hensoldt, a German aerospace and defence supplier, jumped 87%, whilst Rheinmetall rallied almost 50%. Other defence stocks rose handsomely: BAE Systems rallied 13% and Leonardo in Italy climbed 15%. Look for [US companies] Lockheed Martin and Raytheon later on. Travel bans and air space restrictions left travel stocks down: Tui \u20135%, [British Airways owner] IAG \u20133% in early trade. European banks were broadly lower as investors de-risked from institutions with direct exposure to the Russian economy; Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank both -7%, SocGen and BNP Paribas -8-9%. Sberbank was warning on outflows, ECB says its European branches face collapse. Restriction on Russia + possible retaliation = slower growth for Europe. London-listed Russian companies are also sharply lower. The Anglo-Russian miner Polymetal and the Russian steelmaker Evraz are once again the two biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, down 44.5% and nearly 20% respectively. European defence stocks have jumped after the German chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a dramatic increase in military spending, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Military spending will rise to more than 2% of GDP, in a dramatic shift in German policy (it is estimated to have been 1.5% last year). Germany has long resisted pressure from the US to increase its defence spending in light of its role in 20th century history (the two world wars), and amid strong pacifism among its population. Shares in Germany\u2019s arms manufacturer Rheinmetall jumped as much as 48%, Italy\u2019s Leonardo rose 17%, France\u2019s Thales 11% and the UK\u2019s BAE gained more than 13%, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 index of bluechip companies. Analysts at ING said Russians are very sensitive to the dollar-rouble exchange rate and \u201cclearly the current rouble decline is hitting home\u201d. Turning to the Russian central bank\u2019s emergency measures: This looks like a package of measures to defend the rouble including new mandatory sales of 80% of FX revenues for Russian companies. This latter measure looks to prevent the kind of FX hoarding seen during the Crimea crisis of 2014, when Russian energy companies were alleged to have held onto FX earnings and contributed to heavy RUB losses during that period. Additionally, the CBR has temporarily suspended the sale of Russian assets by non-residents. This comes as companies like BP and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund announce plans to divest Russian assets. With Western nations moving to extreme sanctions very quickly - e.g. measures to sanction the CBR are now starting to draw parallels with Iran - investors will be nervous that Western leaders bite the bullet and consider whether exposure to Russian oil and gas supplies comes into focus, too. What is clear is that commodity prices, (gas, oil, certain precious/industrial metals and softs such as wheat) will continue to rise and this supply shock should be a negative for activity and equities. Suffice to say that the dollar should continue to be the preferred safe haven in these unprecedented times. The European bourses have opened with declines of between 1% and 2%. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 1% at 7,412, a loss of 77 points Germany\u2019s Dax down nearly 2% at 14,277 France\u2019s CAC down 2% at 6,616 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 2% at 25,240 Talks between officials from Russia and Ukraine are expected to begin at 12pm local time (9am GMT) near the border. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was not hugely optimistic yesterday but said: \u201cLet them try so that later not a single citizen of Ukraine has any doubt that I, as president, tried to stop the war.\u201d Defence ministers from the European Union will meet virtually later today to coordinate their assistance (in the form of arms deliveries) to Ukraine, after the bloc decided for the first time to jointly fund weapons and send them to Kyiv, according to the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. You can catch up on the latest developments on our Ukraine crisis live blog: The earlier sharp declines in the rouble were in Asian trading. On the Moscow exchange, the rouble initially fell 15% to 95.48 per dollar before extending losses to 21.6%, taking the rouble to 100.96 per dollar. Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, is predicting a decline in Russian GDP of about 5% this year. He said about the exclusion of some Russian banks from the Swift payments system: The list of institutions affected has yet to be released, but when it is it\u2019s worth watching whether Gazprombank is included (since it handles a large share of Russia\u2019s energy exports this could have implications for energy flows). However, so far at least the West has stopped short of a ban on energy imports from Russia, which would be the most powerful sanctions they could implement. He has also looked at the impact of sanctions on the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). This is perhaps a more significant move since it will substantially reduce the ability of the CBR to liquidate its foreign assets to support the ruble and help Russian firms service FX-denominated liabilities. Around 40% of Russia\u2019s international reserves are held in the financial systems of the countries that have signed up to these sanctions. Key areas to watch going forward are whether the US adds the CBR to its \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals\u201d list, which would ban US entities from dealing with the central bank and therefore acting on its behalf, and whether the US introduces \u2018secondary sanctions\u2019 that would affect any foreign entity dealing with the CBR. Another key area to watch is whether the CBR sanctions contain a carve out for sovereign debt repayments (we expect that they will). The sanctions have caused turmoil in Russia\u2019s financial markets, with the rouble opening down 30% against the dollar in offshore trading and falling by much more (~70%) on local retail currency exchanges. These are the conditions in which runs on local banks begin. The CBR has this morning raised interest rates to 20% but other measures (e.g. limits on deposit withdrawals) are possible later today. All of this will accelerate Russia\u2019s economic downturn \u2013 a fall in GDP of ~5% now looks likely. Subsidiaries of some Russian banks overseas are likely to come under intense pressure (and may fail), but we judge that these are probably too small to create systemic risks. The west\u2019s sanctions on Russia also include curbs on the country\u2019s currency reserves. Analysts at Rabobank said the sanctions on currency reserves removed what little support the rouble had. Even the gold is not liquid if nobody can use FX in exchange for it. There will be a complete collapse in the rouble today. Ozkardeskaya has also looked at the west\u2019s decision to block some Russian banks from the international payment system Swift. SWIFT is the messaging system of international transactions and being left outside SWIFT complicates the oversees transactions terribly. It doesn\u2019t block them, but it makes them chaotic and unreliable. It\u2019s like going to a restaurant and not being able to order the food you want. The sanctions increase the risk of insolvency of big Russian banks and the risk of a bank run in Russia. More importantly, the Russian central bank is also concerned with Western sanctions which will greatly weaken its ability to manage the war, the crisis, and the financial stability. Russian markets will again be under a huge selling pressure, and dollarization will be the next chapter in Russia. The Ruble has already been smashed by near 30% this morning to a record low, and there are hints that this could extend to 175-200 range. This means that this needless and compulsive Ukrainian war will become hard for Russia to finance. According to the latest news, Russians are surprised and frustrated by how strong the Ukrainians resist to protect their home. The two countries will talk today at the Belarus border, but the expectations are pessimistic. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at the bank Swissquote, has looked at the latest jump in oil prices. The week kicks off with soaring energy prices and a decent selling pressure on European and American index futures as the Russian invasion in Ukraine and the bigger sanctions imposed on Russia take a severe toll on market sentiment. The barrel of US crude jumped more than 5% to $100 this morning, whereas the European natural gas futures closed last Friday 50% higher. Could OPEC help? Yes, but it will probably choose not to. About two years ago, OPEC countries had refused to restrict production as a response to the pandemic, sending the price of a barrel all the way down to minus $40. There is no guarantee that they don\u2019t do the opposite move this week and announce they won\u2019t raise production in the face of the Ukrainian crisis and send the energy prices soaring. Therefore, the risks to the energy markets remain tilted to the upside. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Russian rouble has crashed more than 40% to a new record low against the dollar, oil prices have jumped as much as $7 a barrel and gold prices have gained 1%, as financial markets opened for trading for the first time since western nations announced wider economic sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions include blocking some Russian banks from the Swift international payments system, leading to expectations among investors of a run on the Russian currency as people scramble to swap their roubles for dollars and other denominations. The Russian central bank was quick to respond and hiked its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% this morning to stem the slide in the rouble, which will lead to higher inflation. Russia has also ordered companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues, the central bank and the finance ministry said. This comes after a number of measures announced by the Bank of Russia on Sunday to counter the economic impact of western sanctions. It said it would resume buying gold on the domestic market, launch a repurchase auction with no limits and ease restrictions on banks\u2019 open foreign currency positions. It also increased the range of securities that can be used as collateral to get loans and banned brokers from selling Russian securities to foreigners. The rouble dropped as low as 119 per dollar in Asian trading, and later traded 28.8% lower at 118, compared with its closing price of 83.64 on Friday. Russian markets will open at 10am local time, three hours later than usual. European stock markets are set to fall at the opening bell after chunky gains on Friday. Brent crude has moved back above $100 a barrel, after falling below that threshold on Friday (it touched close to $106 a barrel on Thursday when Russia began its invasion of Ukraine). This morning the global benchmark is trading at seven-year highs again, up $5 at $103.01 a barrel, a 5.2% rise, while US light crude is $5.46 ahead at $97.08 a barrrel, a 6% gain. Gold has benefited as a safe-haven investment, with spot gold rising by 1% to $1,905 an ounce. In a sign that the war in Ukraine isn\u2019t going as planned for Russia, Vladimir Putin on Sunday ordered his military to put Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, a rather scary development. The US responded that this was a \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d escalation. But there was also hope for talks: the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced that a delegation would meet Russian officials without preconditions on his country\u2019s border with Belarus, but it was far from clear Putin was ready to entertain talks that did not involve compliance with his demands that Ukraine accept partition and disarm. Things have moved on fast since last Monday when Putin announced he was formally recognising separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and ordered troops into the region. This was followed by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday, and a Russian assault on the capital, Kyiv, on Friday and Saturday. The fierce fighting, also in Ukraine\u2019s second-biggest city, Kharkiv, prompted the US, Britain, the EU and Canada to block Russia\u2019s access to the Swift international banking payment system on Saturday, after mounting pressure for greater sanctions. Berenberg analyst Holger Schmieding said: The exclusion of major Russian banks accounting for 70% of the Russian banking market from the SWIFT system to make payments and the possibly even more far-reaching attempt to limit the use of Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves of some $630bn can cause problems for financial and non-financial companies outside Russia. The precise impact is difficult to predict in advance. But we would expect central banks, regulators and finance ministers to see to it that the measures will not cause a major financial accident in the advanced world beyond temporary frictions. The British oil giant BP bowed to pressure to exit its stake in the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft last night. The firm announced that it was offloading its 19.75% voting stake in Rosneft, saying Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine represented a \u201cfundamental change\u201d in relations with Moscow. The value of the stake was estimated at $14bn (\u00a310.4bn) at the end of last year. It is unclear who BP would sell it to. The oil firm said its chief executive, Bernard Looney, was resigning from the Rosneft board with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d. Former BP chief executive Bob Dudley also stood down from the Rosneft board, which is chaired by the former German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and run by Igor Sechin, a close ally of president Vladimir Putin. Russian airlines are facing an almost complete blockade from flying west over Europe after they were barred from the airspace of nearly 30 countries. On Sunday evening the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the whole bloc would close its airspace to Russian aircraft. And Britain has compiled a \u201chit list\u201d of Russian oligarchs who will face sanctions over the coming weeks, according to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. She said there were more than 100 billionaires in Russia and that some of them would face \u201ca rolling programme of sanctions\u201d as officials compiled the evidence to justify their assets being frozen in the UK.

            "date": "2022-02-24T17:27:47Z",
            "content": "Global markets were thrown into turmoil on Thursday as the outbreak of war on European soil sent prices of commodities from oil and gas to wheat surging, while stock market plunged. The ramifications of a potentially prolonged conflict involving Europe\u2019s primary supplier of gas sent a chill through markets, affecting prices across a broad spectrum of asset classes and investments. Oil Brent crude hit $105 a barrel for the first time since August 2014, following a rise of more than 8% on international energy markets. The increase signalled a further rise on garage forecourts to record-breaking retail price for unleaded petrol of more than 155p a litre. Russia is the world\u2019s second-largest oil producer and sells most of its crude to European refineries. It is also the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, providing about two-fifths of its supply. Oil prices have surged more than $20 a barrel since the start of 2022 as the Ukraine crisis went unresolved, with fears that the US and Europe would impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s energy sector, disrupting supplies, should the situation escalate. Gas The price of British gas for next-day delivery jumped 53% to 326p per therm as the invasion stoked fears of a disruption to global energy supplies. Dutch futures, a closely watched measure for European prices, were up 57% on contracts for delivery in March. Analysts at Investec think the renewed surge in gas price could force the energy regulator Ofgem to increase the household bills price cap to \u00a33,000 in October. The 54% increase to nearly \u00a32,000 announced earlier this month has already caused significant political fallout and sparked warnings of families having to choose between food and heating. Gold Typically seen as a safe haven in times of crisis, gold moved through $1,950 (\u00a31,460) per ounce at one point before settling back, reaching levels not far away from its 2020 all-time high of $2,067. Russia and Ukraine are also large producers of important industrial metals such as palladium, nickel and aluminium, which analysts said could be in short supply over the coming months unless the war ends quickly. Russia produces 6% of the world\u2019s aluminium and 7% of its mined nickel. Aluminium rose more than 5% to hit a record high of $3,466 a tonne in London. Nickel hit its highest level since May 2011 at $25,240 at one stage. Palladium, used in catalytic converters for cars, was trading more than 5% higher on Thursday afternoon, after touching $2,695.57 an ounce in the morning, up 7% to the highest level since August. Wheat Between them, Russia and Ukraine export a quarter of the world\u2019s wheat, with Ukraine in particular known as the \u201cbreadbasket of Europe\u201d. Short-term European wheat prices neared record highs on Thursday afternoon. Ukraine is also a major exporter of corn and barley, as well as a key source of cooking oils. Stock markets There was a broad sell-off of shares across Europe, and banks with big operations in Russia were especially hard hit, such as Austria\u2019s Raiffeisenbank, Italy\u2019s Unicredit and France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, following moves by governments across the continent and in the UK to impose sanctions on Russian banks and wealthy Russian individuals. The FTSE 100 index in London tumbled 291 points, or 3.8%, to 7,207, while the Dax in Frankfurt lost nearly 4%, the Cac in Paris dropped 3.8% and the Italian borsa in Milan closed 4.1% lower. On Wall Street, the Nasdaq pared earlier losses and was flat in the afternoon while the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.9% and the Dow Jones slid 2%. Russian stocks plummeted as much as 50% when trading resumed on the Moscow stock exchange on Thursday morning following a temporary suspension. The dollar-denominated RTS index tanked 49.93% in early trading, and later traded 39% lower. The rouble-denominated Moex index fell 45% to 1,690.13, and was later down 33%. Thirty-one Russian companies are traded on the London Stock Exchange. State-owned banks Sberbank and VTB, along with state-backed oil and gas producers Gazprom and Rosneft have secondary listings in the UK while their primary listings remain in Moscow. A freeze on Russian bank assets in the UK nnounced by Boris Johnson sent shares in Sberbank plunging 74% while VTB held its value following a 30% drop since January. Gazprom, the mainly state-owned Russian energy company that trades some of its shares in London, was down 30%. Rosneft, the oil major which is 20%-owned by BP, dropped 50% and Lukoil fell 43%. The Anglo-Russian miner Polymetal was the top faller on the FTSE 100, down 38%, with the Russian mining group Evraz in second place, down 30%. Economic Impact A prolonged war could pile pressure on economies including the UK, with the cost-of-living crisis a particular concern. Inflation is already at a 30-year high of 5.5% but with oil, gas and food ingredients all rising on the back of the Ukraine conflict, economic analysts are warning it could go still higher, while growth could be affected too. Tatiana Orlova, an economist at Oxford Economics, said: \u201cWe will incorporate higher European gas, oil and food prices over the medium term in our baseline, as well as more financial market disruption and tougher EU and US sanctions on Russia. The impact of these changes on our forecast for the global economy is significant, cutting 0.2 percentage points from GDP growth in 2022 and 0.1ppts in 2023.\u201d"

            "content": "Thanks for reading the blog. This one is closed now but you can follow all the developments at our new blog here: China may take advantage of the Ukraine crisis and do something \u201cprovocative\u201d in Asia while western powers are focused on defusing tensions with Russia, a US general has warned. General Kenneth Wilsbach, the head of US Pacific Air Forces, noted that China had aligned itself with Russia in the crisis, Agence France-Presse reports. Wilsbach told reporters on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow on Wednesday: From the standpoint of will China see what\u2019s happening in Europe and... try to do something here in the Indo-Pacific - absolutely yes, that\u2019s a concern. I do have my concerns that they would want to take advantage. It won\u2019t be surprising if they tried something that may be provocative, and see how the international community reacts.\u201d Wilsbach said that when Beijing expressed support for Russia in the Ukraine standoff, he held talks with his staff and other \u201centities\u201d in the region about its implications. Based in Hawaii, Wilsbach\u2019s command would play a central role if conflict erupts in the Pacific though he did not go into specifics about what China might do during the Ukraine crisis, saying only that there were \u201cprobably a number of options\u201d for Beijing. Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison responded to Russia\u2019s claims it has pulled back its military presence from Ukraine, describing the reports as \u201cunconvincing and unconfirmed\u201d. Morrison said cyber attacks on Ukraine ran counter to reports that Russia was about to engage in a pullback. The Australian Associated Press reports he told colleagues in parliament on Wednesday: Russia must unconditionally withdraw. If Russia attacks Ukraine, it will be met with overwhelming international condemnation. The world will not forget that Russia chose needless death and destruction.\u201d Tensions continue in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine as soldiers carry out training exercises in preparation for a potential war. Militants of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR), seen pictured below, prepare for battle on the line of separation from the Ukrainian armed forces near the rebel-controlled settlement of Staromykhailivka. Ukrainian servicemen are also seen carrying out training exercises. Japan continues to watch the situation in Ukraine unfold with grave concern despite a Russian announcement of a partial pullback of armed forces, Japan\u2019s top government spokesperson said, as reported by Reuters. Chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference on Wednesday: [US] President Biden has said the possibility of an invasion of Russian forces into Ukraine clearly remains. The Japanese government sees that the situation remains unpredictable, and we will keep a close eye on the situation with high alert and grave concern.\u201d Russia\u2019s refusal to participate in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) talks demonstrates its contempt for the commitments it voluntarily signed, the UK foreign secretary has said. Responding to Russia\u2019s failure to send a representative to an OSCE meeting about its military build-up, Liz Truss issued a statement reading: Russia is patently failing to live up to the international commitments it has made around transparency. If the Kremlin is serious about a diplomatic resolution, then it needs to show up to diplomatic meetings and commit to meaningful talks. Russia\u2019s refusal to engage with the OSCE process demonstrates its contempt for the commitments it freely signed up to. It is Russia that is the aggressor here. The troops stationed on the border are clear threat to Ukraine. The UK and our allies urge the Kremlin to withdraw its troops and enter discussions based on the proposals put forward by NATO to improve transparency and reduce risk.\u201d Hopes that Russia could be scaling back its military buildup on the border with Ukraine have boosted stocks in Asia at the start of Wednesday\u2019s trading day. The Nikkei in Japan is up nearly 2% after two days of losses this week, while the Hang Seng is up more than 1% and so is the Kospi in Seoul. Another barometer of investor angst \u2013 Brent crude oil \u2013 was down slightly at $92.85 as it continued to slide back from seven-year highs hit on Monday. It\u2019s still rallied $20 \u2013 or more than 20% \u2013 since August. Snaps from on the ground in Ukraine\u2019s most populous city of Kyiv in the west of the country and Lviv in the north show life as normal for Ukraine citizens. Many in the Ukrainian capital remain sceptical about an attack taking place, regardless of the exodus of diplomats. Most locals are going about their lives as normal, Guardian correspondent Shaun Walker reports from Kyiv. A pair of Ukraine\u2019s banking websites are back in operation following a suspected cyberattack. Websites for Oschadbank and Privatbank have resumed online operations, according to a statement from Ukraine\u2019s data security agency. The statement reads: \u201cStarting from the afternoon of February 15, 2022, there is a powerful DDoS attack being observed on a number of information resources of Ukraine. In particular, this caused interruptions in the work of web resources of Privatbank and Oschadbank. The websites of the ministry of defense and the armed forces of Ukraine were also attacked. As of 19:30, the work of banking web resources has been resumed. A working group of experts from the national cybersecurity is taking all necessary measures to localize and resist the cyberattack.\u201d The websites of Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry and armed forces were also impacted by a cyberattack on Tuesday, according to statements from Ukrainian government agencies. As we\u2019ve been reporting, US president Joe Biden gave an update on the situation unfolding in Russia and Ukraine, warning that an invasion is \u201cvery much a possibility\u201d, but that a diplomatic resolution was still possible. \u201cIf Russia proceeds, we will rally the world to oppose its aggression,\u201d Biden said in Washington, confirming that export controls and other actions not pursued during the 2014 Russia-Crimea invasion will take place if Ukraine is invaded. Here are the highlights of the speech: Hello it\u2019s Samantha Lock joining you on the blog as my colleague Maanvi Singh signs off. Here is a quick recap of the key developments over the past few hours: US president Joe Biden warned that an invasion from Russia is \u201cvery much a possibility\u201d but a diplomatic resolution was still possible. He also warned that despite reports from Russia that some of its troops were returning to home bases, analysis from the US has not verified that and that Russian troops continue to remain in a threatening position. Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry and two banks were knocked offline on Tuesday. \u201cIt is not ruled out that the aggressor used tactics of little dirty tricks because its aggressive plans are not working out on a large scale,\u201d the Ukrainian Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security, which is part of the culture ministry, said in a statement. The White House said it is aware of the cyberattacks and has offered its support though clarified it has nothing on attribution concerning the attacks, US press secretary Jen Psaki told a press briefing. The attacks likely affected Ukraine\u2019s military, energy, and other key systems according to recently declassified US intelligence, the Washington Post reports. Boris Johnson said Russia was sending \u201cmixed signals\u201d over its intentions in Ukraine, despite the troop movement reports. \u201cThe intelligence we are seeing is not encouraging,\u201d he said. The US and European allies agreed that harsh sanctions against Russia would be the most effective way to deter Putin as Biden proposed to halt Nord Stream 2, a Russian natural gas pipeline to Europe if Russia further invades. Oil prices fell as much as 4% and stocks were in positive territory in Asia Pacific on Wednesday morning on hopes of a de-escalation of the standoff. However, Biden also warned that sanctions against Russia could cause further oil spikes. US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and minority leader Mitch McConnell issued a joint statement saying they wanted to send \u201ca bipartisan message of solidarity and resolve to the people of Ukraine\u201d as negotiations over a sanctions package against Russia stall. Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry and two banks were knocked offline on Tuesday, raising suspicions that Russia is to blame as tensions between the countries continue to rise. Ukraine has blamed Russia for similar attacks in the past, and has been on high alert for cyber-sabotage as fears of military action intensify. \u201cIt is not ruled out that the aggressor used tactics of little dirty tricks because its aggressive plans are not working out on a large scale,\u201d the Ukrainian Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security, which is part of the culture ministry, said in a statement. The websites were reportedly overwhelmed using a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in which assailants direct an influx of traffic to a set of servers to take them down. The Ukrainian defense ministry tweeted that its website was apparently under a cyberattack and it was working on restoring access to it, and a message on its home page said it was under maintenance. Oshadbank also confirmed the cyberattack, according to Reuters, saying it resulted in the slowing down of some of its systems. Allies to Ukraine have been on high alert for such an attack, as White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there were \u201ca range of means that we could respond \u2013 both seen and unseen \u2013 to a cyber attack or any other attack\u201d. The attack on Tuesday appears to be small in scale and not particularly detrimental, yet, said Rick Holland, chief information security officer at computer security firm Digital Shadows. \u201c[The attacks] could be a precursor to a significant attack or a component of a broader campaign to intimidate and confuse Ukraine,\u201d he said. Joe Biden\u2019s speech sounded like a closing argument, one that had been honed for some time and one that suggested expectations are still high in the White House that Russia will take military action. Biden briefly nodded to Moscow\u2019s claims to be withdrawing before abruptly contradicting them, raising the US estimate of the number of troops surrounding Ukraine to 150,000 in a \u201cthreatening position\u201d. It was the sort of speech normally delivered on the eve of momentous action, usually military action, to prepare expectations of the population. Biden addressed the American people directly, telling them he was not going to \u201cpretend this will be painless\u201d and that they would feel it at the petrol pump. He promised his administration would do what it could to alleviate that. The president also sought to speak over Putin\u2019s head to ordinary Russians, who have heard little from their own media about the unprecedented deployments of their soldiers around Ukraine. Biden talked about their \u201cdeep ties of family history and culture\u201d to the Ukrainians, and warned a war would bloody the country\u2019s reputation in the history books. The world, he said, would \u201cnot forget that Russia chose needless death and destruction\u201d. He made clear that the US remained open for negotiations on mutual security concerns, saying they would pursue talks \u201cas long as there is hope\u201d for diplomacy, but he stuck to the US position there would no compromise on the fundamental principle of the right of Ukraine and other states to choose their alliances. Earlier in the day, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had stressed that Ukrainian membership would not happen in the foreseeable future, but Biden did not echo that conciliatory note. The US has already concluded that such verbal assurances will not be enough for Putin Biden\u2019s concluding declaration, \u201cIf we do not stand for freedom. where it is that risk today, we\u2019ll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow\u201d is likely to be greeted with grim mirth in Kyiv, in the wake of the US embassy\u2019s evacuation and the retreat of American diplomats to the western end of the country. But the US has kept up arms supplies, and is reportedly making arrangements to keep the weapons flowing to an Ukrainian insurgency if it comes to that. This administration is well aware that it has been portrayed as weak for the manner in which it left Afghanistan. But Biden had long ago lost faith in the US mission there, whereas he believes wholeheartedly in Nato. He used the word \u201csacrosanct\u201d to describe America\u2019s obligation to its allies. It was deliberately resonant language. Biden is clearly aware this could turn out to be a defining test of his presidency. Michael McFaul, who served as US ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, is mixing metaphors and indicating that it\u2019s still unclear whether Russia is looking to turn toward or away from diplomacy at the moment. In a joint statement, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, minority leader Mitch McConnell and other senators from both parties said they wanted to send \u201ca bipartisan message of solidarity and resolve to the people of Ukraine\u201d. They write: Should Vladimir Putin further escalate his ongoing assault on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, Russia must be made to pay a severe price. We are prepared to fully support the immediate imposition of strong, robust and effective sanctions on Russia, as well as tough restrictions and controls on exports to Russia, and we will urge our allies and partners in Europe and around the world to join us. In the face of Russian escalation against Ukraine, we will continue to support robust security, economic, and humanitarian assistance for the people of Ukraine. The United States and our partners should also move quickly to ensure that the Government of Ukraine receives sustained emergency assistance to defend against an illegal Russian invasion. The statement comes as bipartisan negotiations over a sanctions package has stalled. Republicans have introduced their own package, which would impose immediate sanctions on Russian oligarchs and members of Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle, regardless of whether Russia invades Ukraine. The bill would also mandate sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invades, and authorize more security funding for Ukraine, and create a lend-lease program. Senate Foreign Relations chair Bob Menendez said the Republican bill amounted to \u201cpartisan posturing\u201d and that the \u201clatest proposal by Republicans is largely a reflection of what Democrats had already agreed to\u201d. In his update today, Biden emphasized that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would affect Americans and European allies. \u201cI will not pretend this will be painless,\u201d he said, noting that economic sanctions against Russia could cause oil prices to rise even as the US copes with broader inflation. But the president said that the US and European allies agreed that harsh sanctions against Russia would be the most effective way to deter Putin. He proposed to halt Nord Stream 2, a Russian natural gas pipeline to Europe if Russia further invades. \u201cWhen it comes to Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany if Russia further invades Ukraine, it will not happen,\u201d he said Cyberattacks on Ukraine reported today likely affected Ukraine\u2019s military, energy, and other key systems according to recently declassified US intelligence, reports the Washington Post. Russian government hackers have likely broadly penetrated Ukrainian military, energy and other critical computer networks to collect intelligence and position themselves potentially to disrupt those systems should Russia launch a military assault on Ukraine, according to newly declassified US intelligence. Moscow could seek to disrupt Ukrainian entities that provide critical services such as electricity, transportation, finance and telecommunications \u2013 either to support military operations or to sow panic in an attempt to destabilize the country, according to a senior administration official who described the intelligence. The US government has determined only that Russia could undertake disruptive cyber-activity, not that it will, said the official, who like several others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter\u2019s sensitivity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that they have intention to do so,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut we have been working with Ukraine to strengthen their cyberdefenses.\u201d A Kremlin spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

During today\u2019s White House press briefing, the White House said that it has nothing on attribution concerning cyberattacks in Ukraine. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything on attribution at this time,\u201d said US press secretary Jen Psaki during today\u2019s press briefing. \u201cWhat I can say is that we have been in touch with the Ukrainians, our allies and partners, working with them to deter and respond to malicious cyber activity,\u201d said Psaki. Reactions to Biden\u2019s speech on the Russia-Ukraine situation have started to come in as experts share their thoughts on Biden\u2019s remarks. Here\u2019s Dr. Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International studies on Biden\u2019s speech, with Lewis tweeting: That speech by Biden was the one POTUS gives if he still expects an invasion. I was quite struck by how much expectation setting Biden did. Ben Rhodes, Former Deputy National Security Advisor of the United States, also shared his thoughts on Twitter, writing: Biden did not seem optimistic about the latest Russian overtures - remained focused on warning of invasion, detailing consequences for Russia (and the world), not giving an inch on the core NATO issues that Putin has been focused on. During a speech updating on the Russia-Ukraine situation, Joe Biden warned that an invasion from Russia is \u201cvery much a possibility,\u201d but that a diplomatic resolution was still possible. Today, Biden warned that despite reports from Russia that some of its troops were returning to home bases, analysis from the US has not verified that and that Russian troops remain in a threatening position. \u201cAn invasion remains distinctly possible,\u201d said Biden, again announcing that Americans in Ukraine should leave now \u201cbefore it is too late to leave safely.\u201d Biden also confirmed that the US has engaged in \u201cnon-stop diplomacy\u201d to prevent a Russian invasion, saying \u201cWe should give diplomacy every chance to succeed.\u201d Biden also, again, noted that NATO allies are united in opposition to an invasion and prepared to respond with consequences. \u201cThe West is united and galvanised,\u201d said Biden, noting that Russia invading Ukraine would be a \u201cself-inflicting wound.\u201d \u201cIf Russia proceeds, we will rally the world to oppose its aggression,\u201d said Biden, confirming that export controls and other actions not pursued during the 2014 Russia-Crimea invasion will take place if Ukraine is invaded. Biden also confirmed again that Nord Stream 2 will not happen if Russia invades Ukraine. Joe Biden is currently speaking on the Russia-Ukraine situation, with video available here. Stay tuned! US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said that he will be releasing a \u201cbipartisan\u201d statement with US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, along with ranking chairs from other relevant committees, on the Russia-Ukraine situation. The White House is aware of cyberattacks against Ukraine and has offered its support, reports Reuters. Today, following reports that Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry website and at least two large banks had been subject to a cyber attack, the White House said it is aware of the cyberattacks and offered its support as an investigation continues. This story is developing. Russia has deployed fighter jets to its air base in Syria for naval exercises, reports Reuters. Russia has deployed MiG-31K fighter jets with hypersonic Kinzhal missiles and long-range Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bombers to its air base in Syria for naval exercises, Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday, citing the defence ministry. The aircraft dispatched to Russia\u2019s Hmeimim air base will take part in exercises in the eastern Mediterranean, part of a surge of Russian military activity amid a standoff with the West over Ukraine and security in Europe. Moscow announced on Jan. 20 that its navy would stage an array of exercises involving all its fleets from the Pacific to the Atlantic, drawing on 10,000 servicemen, 140 warships and dozens of planes. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Damascus has been a staunch ally of Moscow since Russia launched an air strike campaign in Syria in 2015. Apart from the Hmeimim air base, Russia also controls the Tartus naval facility. Read the full article here (paywall). Following up on Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s tweet about the US having \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Ukraine, here is a summary of the call between Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, according to United States Department of State spokesperson Ned Price: The Secretary reiterated the U.S. commitment to continue to pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis Moscow has precipitated. He stated that the United States looks forward to receiving Russia\u2019s written response to the U.S. and NATO papers shared with Moscow last month proposing concrete areas for discussion regarding European security in coordination with our Allies and partners. He noted the Foreign Minister\u2019s statement that it would be transmitted within the coming days. Secretary Blinken reiterated our ongoing concerns that Russia has the capacity to launch an invasion of Ukraine at any moment and emphasized the need to see verifiable, credible, meaningful de-escalation. He underscored that, while further Russian aggression against Ukraine would result in a swift, severe, and united Transatlantic response, we remain committed to the diplomatic path and believe that a window remains to resolve the crisis peacefully. In addition to confirming US support of Ukraine, US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley has also spoken with sources in Ukraine to confirm US support. A Reuters reporter tweeted that Milley spoke with a Ukrainian counterpart and \u201creaffirmed unwavering support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d according to sources from the Pentagon. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has tweeted his country\u2019s \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Ukraine. The New York Times\u2019 Moscow bureau chief, Anton Troianovski, writes that following his joint press conference with Vladimir Putin, German chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters in a separate briefing that \u201cNATO membership for Ukraine is not on the agenda\u201d. Scholz said: Everyone must step back a bit here and make it clear to themselves that we just can\u2019t have a possible military conflict over a question that is not on the agenda. It is the question of leadership ability for all involved \u2013 in Russia, in Ukraine, in NATO \u2013 to make sure that we don\u2019t have an absurd situation that would be about something like that. Andriy, a 34-year-old bank clerk living in Kyiv, was feeling very pleased with the announcement on Tuesday that some Russian troops had started to move away from the border with Ukraine. First, it seemed to lower the threat of an all-out Russian attack on Kyiv. And second, it meant he might win a bet with his sister. Most locals are going about their lives as normal. \u201cShe took a plane to Poland on Saturday with her kids because she was reading about all this war threat, but I didn\u2019t believe in it, and also I wanted to stay because had a haircut booked,\u201d he said, as he took a stroll in the sunshine on the central Khreshchatyk street on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe had a bet about whether the Russians would attack,\u201d he said. In recent days, many Kyiv residents, while alarmed by the military buildup, have shared Andriy\u2019s scepticism about American warnings that their lives were about to be disrupted by missile barrages and that tank incursions would come to pass. From the UK\u2019s prime minister Boris Johnson: Russia failed to attend a meeting of members of the OSCE, the world\u2019s largest security body, to explain its military buildup near the Ukraine border, a source confirmed to Agence France-Presse Kyiv had requested the meeting with Russia and other members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to \u201cdiscuss the reinforcement and movement of Russian forces along our border\u201d under the so-called Vienna Document. The agreement requires the Vienna-based body\u2019s 57 members to share information about their military forces and notify each other about major activities. \u201cThe United States welcomes the decision by Ukraine to call for this meeting,\u201d Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the OSCE, told the closed-door session. \u201cUnfortunately and regrettably, though perhaps not surprisingly, the Russian Federation has absented itself today,\u201d he added, according to his statement. Regions in Ukraine where Russians are allegedly facing human rights abuses are occupied by Russia, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the UK has said. Vadym Prystaiko responded to claims by Vladimir Putin that there were human rights abuses in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine: Strangely enough when he claims that Russians are threatened in Ukraine, the only place where Russians are threatened in Ukraine is occupied by Russians as territory. He added that it was a \u201ca very unfortunate development\u201d that the Russian parliament had called for the two regions of Ukraine, seized by Russian-backed separatists, to be recognised as independent republics. US President Joe Biden will give remarks on the situation between Ukraine and Russia from the White House at 3.30pm EST (8.30pm GMT). Biden \u201cwill reiterate that the United States remains open to high-level diplomacy in close coordination with our Allies, building on the multiple diplomatic off-ramps we and our Allies and partners have offered Russia in recent months,\u201d the White House said. What exactly does Putin want in Ukraine? The websites of Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry, armed forces, state banks Privatbank and Oschadbank have been targeted by cyberattacks that could have could have Russian origins, according to reports. In a statement posted to its Facebook page, Ukraine\u2019s national cybersecurity agency said the internet banking of Privat bank and Oshchadbank - two of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions - were under attack but that some services were still functioning. It added that for now there are no risks to citizens\u2019 money. Oshadbank confirmed the cyber attack saying that it resulted in slowing down of some of its systems. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility of further attacks,\u201d says PrivatBank. The Ministry of Defense and Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces\u2019 public-facing websites are not currently accessible. The defence ministry site showed an error message saying the site was \u201cundergoing technical maintenance\u201d. The ministry tweeted that its website was apparently under a cyber attack and it was working on restoring access to it. The Ukrainian Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security did not say who was responsible for the attack, but a statement suggested it was pointing the finger at Russia: It is not ruled out that the aggressor used tactics of little dirty tricks because its aggressive plans are not working out on a large scale Russia\u2019s president said he was \u201cready to work further\u201d with the west on how to de-escalate the crisis on the Ukrainian border while Germany\u2019s chancellor said the diplomatic channels were \u201cnot yet exhausted\u201d, at a joint press conference also marked by subtle swipes and simmering historical resentment. \u201cWe are ready to work further together, we are ready to go down the negotiations track\u201d, said Vladimir Putin, who denied that his country was seeking an invasion of Ukraine. \u201cAs to whether we want [war]. Of course not! That\u2019s why we have made these proposals about negotiations, the results of which should be an agreement about equal security for all countries, including ours.\u201d But Putin also complained he could not \u201cturn a blind eye\u201d to how Washington and Nato \u201cfreely interpreted\u201d the principle of the indivisibility of security, that no country should strengthen its security at the expense of others. German leader Olaf Scholz, who travelled to Moscow a day after a state visit to Kyiv, said he refused to describe the diplomatic situation as \u201chopeless\u201d. \u201cFor my generation war in Europe has become unthinkable,\u201d the centre-left politician said. Politics, he added, had to ensure \u201cthat it remains that way.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry has confirmed that its website likely experienced a cyber attack today. The United States has not seen evidence yet of any Russian troop pullback near Ukraine, Washington\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations said. In a statement provided by her spokesperson, US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: It would be welcome news if it is legitimate. We have not seen evidence of that yet. Ukraine\u2019s cybersecurity centre said websites of the Ukrainian defence ministry and banks Privatbank and Oshadbank have been subject under a cyber attack, Russia\u2019s TASS news agency reported. The Ukrainian cybersecurity centre said Russia could be to blame for the attack, TASS reported. A message on the home page of the Ukrainian defence ministry website said it was under maintenance. In Washington, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken is on the phone to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, in the wake of positive noises from Lavrov about possible talks on intermediate-range missiles and other measures to reduce military risks. These are the sort of discussions the US and Nato allies have offered to hold in the written proposals they sent to Moscow. Joe Biden is due to speak to Emmanuel Macron later today, the White House says. Meanwhile, the Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, has been telling CNN, that her government so far see no signs of Russian withdrawal. She said: We haven\u2019t seen any de-escalation yet. We believe it when we see it but we don\u2019t see it right now. She warned that even if the Russians pull back, it will by no means be the end of the threat to Ukraine. Putting the military around Ukraine and pulling them off is a tactic to confuse and tire the West. You know the fairy tale of a boy who cried wolf. Only Ukraine and NATO should determine Kyiv\u2019s bid to join the alliance, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said after meeting his Italian counterpart Luigi Di Maio today. Kuleba said: No one but Ukraine and NATO members should have a say in the discussions about Ukraine\u2019s future NATO membership. Here is a summary of the main news so far on another intense day of diplomacy aimed at averting war in Ukraine. Russia announced it is withdrawing troops from near Ukraine\u2019s borders, but Kyiv and western diplomats voiced caution, saying they needed to see what Moscow did. The announcement from a Russian defence ministry spokesman did not reveal the numbers of troops being drawn down. Western officials estimate more than 60% of Russian ground forces have massed near Ukraine, with some units having travelled from the Russian Far East. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said he had seen no sign yet of a withdrawal of troops and equipment from Ukraine\u2019s border. Nato\u2019s scepticism was echoed by UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who described the intelligence the UK government is seeing as \u201cnot encouraging\u201d. Russian field hospitals were being constructed near Ukraine, which \u201conly can be construed as preparation for an invasion\u201d Johnson said. The Russian government mocked western claims of an imminent invasion, while Vladimir Putin said western assurances that Ukraine would not join Nato anytime soon were not good enough. Putin was speaking after he met German chancellor Olaf Scholz, where the Russian president again claimed that \u201chuman rights violations\u201d were taking place in two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine. The status of the self-declared \u2018republics\u2019 of Donetsk and Luhansk came into focus, after the Russian Duma called on Putin to recognise them as independent. Western leaders, including Stoltenberg at Nato and the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, warned this would be a violation of international law and Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. Scholz, who like French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Putin from one end of a very large table, welcomed the pullback of Russian troops and said diplomacy was not exhausted. The German leader reiterated Berlin\u2019s view that the conviction of the Russian leader Alexei Navalny was not in line with the rule of law. Navalny was undergoing another criminal trial on Tuesday on charges widely believed to be trumped up that could land him in prison for 15 more years. His supporters fear that international attention on Ukraine, which is diverting attention from his trial, means the chances of him being killed in prison are far higher. That\u2019s all from me, Jennifer Rankin, as I hand over to Leonie Chao-Fong. Thank you for following so far. Western officials say they have seen no sign of Russian de-escalation, but instead continuing reinforcements of forces close to the Ukrainian border, writes the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour. \u201cWe see no sign of Russian de-escalation,\u201d western officials said. \u201cWe see the opposite. We have seen reinforcements of combat and other capabilities close to the Ukraine border.\u201d The officials did not rule out a full-scale invasion on Wednesday or Thursday as previously predicted despite firm Russian denials, but seemed to be placing more emphasis on the possibility that Russia will maintain this force level for an extended period. Overall, 60% of Russian land combat forces and 50% of its air combat power were now deployed. The officials could yet see a Russian \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation that will trigger an invasion, adding it would be wrong to select a date by which Putin will have to pull back his troops. The officials continued to insist that Putin has not yet made up his mind, and he may be being pressed by his military about the consequences of a second Russian Afghan-style crisis with body bags coming home to Russia. The official said the staged meeting between Putin and Sergei Lavrov on Monday may reflect a genuine decision by Putin to walk back from the brink, and accept some third-tier diplomatic concessions on arms controls treaty talks that have already been offered to him. A Russian reply to the Nato offer of talks has yet to be received. The officials added that one consequence of the crisis will be a strengthened Nato presence on the eastern flank and a determination that Nato conducts itself well as a new generation of younger Europeans come to experience the threat of war in Europe for the first time. Russian analysts have voiced doubts that the Kremlin will recognise the self-declared Donbass \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d in eastern Ukraine, a move that could shatter fragile hopes of peace. Earlier on Tuesday, the Russian Duma called on Vladimir Putin to recognise the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, a popular cause for Russian nationalists that would destroy any hope of salvaging the Minsk accords, a largely unimplemented peace plan that emerged in 2015. In a report on the vote, the Moscow Times highlights the political games being played, in the view of well-connected analysts. Here is a flavour: \u201cRecognising the Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics means our departure from the Minsk Agreements and the destruction of our position on the resolution of this conflict,\u201d Konstantin Zatulin, a United Russia lawmaker who is deputy chairman of a Duma commission on relations with the former Soviet Union, told the liberal Moscow Echo radio station Tuesday. \u201cIn that sense, [recognition] won\u2019t benefit Russia or the republics.\u201d \u201cUnited Russia needed to close the question of the Donbas, and stop itself from being outflanked,\u201d said Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of R.Politik, a political consultancy, regarding the ruling party\u2019s support for the motion. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t mean other elements in the government are on side,\u201d said Stanovaya, who believes the Russian foreign ministry is particularly opposed. \u201cAt the end of the day, there won\u2019t be any recognition.\u201d And here is the Moscow Times\u2019 full story: Russian parliament backs plan to recognise breakaway Ukrainian regions Vladimir Putin has said western assurances that Ukraine will not join Nato anytime soon were not good enough and that Russia needed to resolve the issue now. Speaking at his joint press conference with German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Putin also said Moscow was ready for talks with the US and Nato on limits for missile deployments and military transparency. Scholz said Ukraine\u2019s membership was not on the agenda, using the opportunity to make a joke at Putin\u2019s expense, according to the FT\u2019s Max Seddon. Russia has been pressing for a veto on Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership since the Kremlin set out a series of maximalist security demands last December, while members of the alliance have continually stressed their right to allow new countries to join. Putin also called for the conflict in eastern Ukraine to be resolved through the Minsk peace process. According to reporter Mark MacKinnon, Scholz also referred to Minsk and the vote in the Russian Duma, where deputies urged Putin to recognise the two breakaway self-declared republics in eastern Ukraine. Scholz said if that vote became reality, the [Minsk] process would end. The Minsk accords, a stalled 2015 agreement between Moscow and Kyiv, brokered by France and Germany, has also been highlighted by French president Emmanuel Macron as a way out of the current impasse. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has welcomed the pullback of some Russian troops from near Ukraine on Tuesday, adding that a diplomatic solution remained possible, Reuters reports. The diplomatic possibilities are far from being exhausted \u2026 That we hear now some troops have withdrawn is a good sign, we hope more will follow. It should be possible to find a solution. No matter how difficult and serious the situation seems to be, I refuse to say it is hopeless. Speaking at a joint press conference with Vladimir Putin, after their meeting, he restated Germany\u2019s position that the conviction of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was not in line with the rule of law. Asked about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia and Germany, Scholz said his government was committed to ensuring gas transit works via Ukraine. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has long been seen by western analysts as a way to weaken Ukraine, by allowing Russia to bypass the country. Russian president Vladimir Putin has said there has been no constructive response to Russia\u2019s proposals on security and once again claimed there are \u201chuman rights violations\u201d in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine. Putin is speaking at a joint press conference with Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz, following their meeting. On a day when the Russian Duma called for recognition of the self-declared \u201crepublics\u201d of Donetsk and Luhanks in eastern Ukraine, Putin also repeated his claim there was genocide in the Donbass region. I\u2019ll bring you more as I get it. While Boris Johnson is talking tough on sanctions against Russia, it is worth remembering that successive UK governments missed chances to clamp down on suspicious Russian money in London. Now a former Conservative minister, once at the heart of efforts to clamp down on money laundering in London, goes further, by revealing that during Theresa May\u2019s premiership, No 10 \u201cleant on him\u201d when he tabled amendments to introduce a public register of overseas property owners. Speaking to the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, Lord Faulks said he had first tried to put the register into the criminal finances bill in 2017 and then again into a government bill on money laundering in 2018. He had described the overseas ownership of dirty money in London as an obscenity. Faulks, a distinguished barrister and now an independent peer, said he was rung by Downing Street during May\u2019s tenure and told to go to a meeting where he met civil servants from four government departments including the Foreign Office, business officials and the Home Office. They told him to drop the amendments \u2013 for which he had a voting majority in the Lords \u2013 because they assured him Whitehall had the issue in hand. He told the Guardian: \u201cI was obviously misled because nothing has subsequently happened. I can only think a deluded desire to protect the City of London has led to all these delays. \u201cQuite frankly, I was leant on. I was leant on by No 10 Downing Street and summoned to a meeting of officials from all sorts of different departments, who told me it was very unfortunate that I was going to do this because the matter was in hand.\u201d Meanwhile, Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, said the government had done \u201cnothing\u201d to stem the flow of illicit funds entering Britain from Russia. No 10 pressured me to drop anti-money laundering measures, says ex-minister Boris Johnson has said intelligence seen by the British government shows that Russia is still making plans to invade Ukraine, although Moscow was \u2018open\u2019 to talks. In a video statement released after Russia announced it would draw down some troops, the British prime minister said the government was getting \u201cmixed signals\u201d from Moscow. There are grounds for a conversation about Ukraine, with Ukraine and that\u2019s good. We are seeing Russian openness to conversations. On the other hand, the intelligence that we are seeing today is still not encouraging. We\u2019ve got Russian field hospitals being constructed near the border with Ukraine, in Belarus, for only what can be construed as a preparation for an invasion. We have got more battalions, tactical groups actually being being brought closer to the border with Ukraine, according to the intelligence that we are seeing. He said these \u201cmixed signals\u201d were all the more reason \u201cto remain very tough and very united\u201d. especially on economic sanctions. UK sanctions were \u201cready to go\u201d if Russia was \u201cso rash, so reckless\u201d as to launch an invasion. Johnson said. He promised the UK government would take steps \u201cto unpeel the facade\u201d of Russian ownership of companies and property, as well as to stop Russian companies from raising money on London markets. The government last week missed its own 10 February deadline to have sanctions against Russia in place. High-stakes, socially distanced diplomacy in the Kremlin means one thing at least: Vladimir Putin\u2019s very big table is back in the spotlight. Here are some pictures of German chancellor Olaf Scholz seated some metres away from the Russian president. With the cameras in the room, the two leaders each have little more on the table than a few notes (white cards for Putin, some A4 papers for Scholz), pens and pencils, and the interpretation devices. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has voiced caution about reports of a Russian troop withdrawal, saying \u201cwe believe what we see\u201d. Writing in English on Twitter, aiming at an international audience, he echoes his earlier comments to Ukrainian media. The Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth has been taking a closer look at the Russian announcement of a troop withdrawal. A decision by Russia to recognise two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine would amount to a violation of international law, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has warned. Asked about a potential Russian move to recognise the so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d of Donetsk and Luhansk at a Nato press conference, Stoltenberg said: If that happens, that would be a blatant violation of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty once again. He said such an act would be \u201ca violation of international law\u201d, the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, as well as the Minsk agreements. Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament voted on Tuesday to ask Vladimir Putin to recognise two Russian-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent, Reuters has reported. If approved, the move could inflame the wider standoff over Russia\u2019s military buildup near Ukraine that has fuelled western fears of an invasion. Stoltenberg said Nato allies were \u201cready to engage with Russia\u201d on Europe\u2019s security. He said Nato had set out \u201cconcrete proposals for a substantive agenda\u201d at a meeting on 26 January of the Nato-Russia council. Nato was ready to listen to Russia concerns, share its own and look for common ground, he said. Continuing the press conference, Stoltenberg has said Nato needs to see a \u201csignificant and enduring withdrawal of forces\u201d of troops and equipment by Russia from Ukraine\u2019s borders. Asked by Bloomberg what de-escalation looked like, the Nato secretary general said: What we have to see is a substantial withdrawal of troops, not only troops but equipment. Stoltenberg said Russia had moved out troops before, only to move them back again. De-escalation meant \u201csignificant and enduring withdrawal of forces, troops and not least, heavy equipment\u201d, he said. In answer to another question from AP, he said: It\u2019s too early to say whether we see anything on the ground, but we are following very closely what they are doing. Nato\u2019s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has reiterated that Ukraine has the right join Nato. Asked by Interfax Ukraine about the country\u2019s right to join Nato as outlined at the Bucharest summit in 2008, he said: \u201cThe Bucharest decision stands. Nato strongly believes that all nations have the right to choose their own path.\u201d He added that the enlargement of Nato had been \u201ca great success\u201d, that helped to secure democracy, freedom and security in Europe. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said Russia\u2019s announcement of a troop withdrawal gives grounds for optimism, but the alliance has yet to see real de-escalation. Ahead of a meeting of Nato defence ministers on Wednesday, Stoltenberg is briefing reporters. On the Russian troop withdrawal announcement, he said: This gives the grounds for cautious optimism, but so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground. So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground, not seen any signs of reduced Russian military presence on the borders of Ukraine, but we will continue to monitor. He said Russia had amassed a \u201cfighting force unprecedented since the cold war\u201d. Everything is now on place for a new attack but Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start preparing for a peaceful solution. India has asked its nationals to \u201cconsider leaving\u201d Ukraine on a temporary basis. The country\u2019s embassy in Kyiv released a letter today saying the move was due to the \u201cuncertainties of the current situation in Ukraine\u201d. Several countries have updated their travel advice during the crisis. On Friday, the UK Foreign Office urged British citizens in Ukraine to leave while commercial means were still available. A day before, the US president Joe Biden called for all US citizens to leave, saying \u201cthings could go crazy very quickly\u201d. German chancellor Olaf Scholz is attending a ceremony in Moscow ahead of his meeting with Putin. He laid flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. While the world\u2019s attention is focused on Ukraine, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is undergoing a new criminal trial in a case widely seen as politically motivated. Russia could extend Navalny\u2019s imprisonment for up to a further decade in a trial that his supporters warn has been overshadowed by the crisis in Ukraine, writes the Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth. The Russian opposition leader is accused of embezzling donations to his FBK anti-corruption organisation, which has accused Vladimir Putin of owning a \u00a31bn mansion and other top officials enriching themselves through corrupt schemes. Navalny has denied the charges and calls them politically motivated. Maria Pevchikh, a top Navalny ally, has said the danger to Navalny has increased as public attention has increasingly been diverted away from human rights concerns to the potential for a Russian attack on Ukraine. \u201cThe danger to Navalny\u2019s life, ie the probability of him being killed in prison, will increase exponentially depending on what happens in Ukraine,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe odds are pretty bad already, but a full-on Russian invasion barely leaves him any chance to survive.\u201d Read Andrew\u2019s full report here: Alexei Navalny faces 10 more years in prison as focus shifts to Ukraine crisis The Kremlin has said it expects \u201cprolonged\u201d talks between Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian president Vladimir Putin, as they have \u201ca lot of issues to discuss\u201d, news agencies in Moscow report. A Kremlin spokesperson described warnings that Russia will launch a new attack on Ukraine on Wednesday as \u201cbaseless hysteria designed to ramp up tensions\u201d. Asked about the Russian president\u2019s reaction to western reports of a planned invasion, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin was already joking, asking if the western media had published \u201cthe exact time in hours when the war will begin\u201d. The Kremlin would prefer to discuss each other\u2019s concerns with western countries, rather than see \u201cinformation campaigns\u201d, Peskov said. Russia and western countries should discuss each other\u2019s security concerns in earnest, he said. This is what President Putin is proposing. This is what President Putin wants. Addressing the Russian defence ministry announcement about a troop withdrawal, Peskov said Russia had always said troops would return to their base. We have always said that after the exercises are over \u2026 troops would return to their permanent bases. There\u2019s nothing new here. This is a usual process. Quotes from Reuters, APF and Russian state agency Ria Novosti. The meeting between Russia\u2019s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau appears to be wrapping up. Rau, who is currently chairing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has proposed a new dialogue with Russia, a proposal that Lavrov described as \u201cinteresting\u201d, while stressing the importance Moscow attaches to talks with the US and Nato. Here are the snaps from Reuters: MOSCOW-POLISH FOREIGN MINISTER RAU SAYS WE PROPOSED NEW DIALOGUE ON SECURITY IN EUROPE RUSSIA\u2019S LAVROV SAYS PROPOSALS ON RESUMPTION OF TALKS ON EUROPEAN SECURITY AT OSCE ARE \u201cINTERESTING\u201d, BUT OUR DIALOGUE WITH NATO, U.S. IS IMPORTANT RUSSIAS LAVROV AFTER TALKS WITH POLISH COUNTERPART SAYS TRUST AMONG OSCE COUNTRIES IS AT RECORD LOW Expect more footage of Vladimir Putin\u2019s very big table from his meeting with the German chancellor Olaf Scholz. According to the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Moscow correspondent, Nataliya Vasilyeva, Scholz has declined to take a PCR test in Russia, following the example of Emmanuel Macron. Macron refused to take a PCR test done by Russian authorities, so had to meet the Russian president under strict social-distancing protocols. The French president took a PCR test in France and did an antigen test in Russia administered by his own doctor, but did not want his DNA in the hands of the Russian state, according to French government sources. Ukraine is waiting for evidence that Russian troops really are being pulled back, its foreign minister has said, in response to Moscow\u2019s announcement of a withdrawal of some forces. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister said Dmytro Kuleba said: If we see a withdrawal, we will believe in a de-escalation. The quote comes from Interfax Ukraine via Reuters. Poland\u2019s foreign minister Zbigniew Rau is meeting his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday, as part of continuing diplomatic efforts to avert war. It comes on the same day as the more high-profile meeting between Germany\u2019s new chancellor Olaf Scholz and Vladimir Putin. Rau said \u201ca lot can be achieved through dialogue and diplomacy\u201d, according to the Polish Press Agency (PAP). The Polish minister is currently chairing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which counts Russia, Ukraine, EU countries and the US among its members. The spokesperson of Russia\u2019s foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, has posted this statement on her Facebook page. February 15 2022 will go down in history as the day of failure of western propaganda war. Embarrassed and destroyed without firing a shot. The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would not go ahead, if war broke out between Russia and Ukraine, the EU\u2019s top diplomat Josep Borrell has said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cIf there is a war between Russia and Ukraine, Nordstream 2 would not become operational.\u201d Borrell was more direct than Germany\u2019s chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has avoided giving a clear answer on the issue, although foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has spelt out Berlin\u2019s position. EU sanctions are agreed by unanimity, and Borrell appears confident he has the backing of all 27 member states. Borrell also reiterated that the EU was ready to discuss Russia\u2019s security concerns. Andrew Roth in Moscow has more on the announcement by Russia\u2019s defence ministry that it will withdraw some of its troops from the border with Ukraine in a possible de-escalation of the threat of a potential invasion. He cautions that the size of the withdrawal remains unclear and may involve just a fraction of Russia\u2019s forces at the Ukrainian border, which western officials estimate at more than 60% of the country\u2019s ground forces. He writes: The announcement of the withdrawal came in a statement from defence ministry spokesman Igor Konoshenkov, who described ongoing exercises that involved forces from \u201cpractically all military districts, fleets, and the airborne forces\u201d. \u201cUnits of the Southern and Western Military Districts, which have accomplished their missions, are boarding trains and trucks and will head for their garrisons later today,\u201d Konoshenkov said in the statement. The defence ministry also released a video of some Russian tanks and other heavy weaponry being loaded on to railway cars, the Interfax news service reported. Russia\u2019s rouble currency reportedly posted gains following the announcement, indicating that investors hoped this would mark the beginning of a de-escalation of tensions between Russia and the west. Russia has previously announced the conclusion of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, but social media and satellite photography taken in the following days have not shown considerable changes to Russia\u2019s force posture. Those exercises involved just a small number of troops. And many of the troops located close to the Ukrainian border are not involved in any formal trainings. When questioned on the buildup, Russia has merely said that it has the right to move troops as it wishes within its own territory. Russia is holding large joint exercises with Belarus scheduled to end on 20 February. Western countries have warned that those drills could be used as cover to prepare for an attack on Ukraine, while Russia has said those troops will return to base once the exercises have concluded. Russian government officials moved quickly to accuse the West of hysteria and argue that the withdrawal of troops showed that Nato warnings of an invasion were spurious. \u201cFebruary 15 2022 will go into history as the day western war propaganda failed,\u201d Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, wrote in a Facebook post after the announcement. \u201cThey have been disgraced and destroyed without a single shot being fired.\u201d Reporters in Moscow are reacting cautiously to the announcement from the Russian defence ministry that troops are being withdrawn. And here is a view from a correspondent in Kyiv, Olga Tokariuk. The Russian rouble gained 1.5% soon after Russia\u2019s defence ministry reported that some troops near Ukraine\u2019s border were being withdrawn. The Russian currency has been under pressure because of investor fears about the impact of further western sanctions. Some troops in Russia\u2019s military districts adjacent to Ukraine are returning to bases after completing drills, Russia\u2019s defence ministry was quoted as saying on Tuesday, Reuters reports. Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency cited the ministry as saying that while large-scale drills across the country continued, some units of the Southern and Western military districts have completed their exercises and started returning to bases. As the FT\u2019s Moscow bureau chief reports, markets are reading this as a sign of de-escalation. For other analysts, it will be too early to tell if this really signals a shift. The UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has said there could be a \u201clong protracted war\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, as she warned an invasion was \u201chighly likely\u201d. Speaking to Times Radio, Truss said war \u201cwill not be easy or simple for Vladimir Putin\u201d, pointing to the defensive weapons supplied to Ukraine by the UK and other allies. This could be a long, protracted war, which would, of course, create huge damage for both the people of Ukraine and the people of Russia as well as threatening European security. Earlier on Sky News, Truss said: \u201cIt is still the case that an invasion could be imminent, and it is highly likely.\u201d During a round of media interviews on Tuesday, she was also asked about UK plans to clamp down on Russian oligarch money in London. The foreign secretary had promised laws would be in place by 10 February, but the timing has slipped, raising concerns the government was struggling to frame the sweeping new laws. The foreign secretary told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme there was still a British presence in Kyiv as it is \u201cimportant that we are supporting British citizens\u201d in Ukraine. Some UK staff had been moved to Lviv in western Ukraine, while some remained in Kyiv, she said. And in case you missed it: the Observer profiled Truss\u2019s instagram diplomacy, following her photo opportunity on Red Square last week. Since she became foreign secretary five months ago, more than 700 photos featuring Truss have been uploaded to the government\u2019s official photo-sharing website Flickr \u2013 an average of one photo for every five hours in the job. This is Jennifer Rankin, taking over the liveblog from Samantha Lock. New satellite images released by a US company reportedly show a flurry of Russian military activity at several locations near Ukraine, including Belarus, Crimea and western Russia. Maxar Technologies, which has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine\u2019s border for weeks, said on Tuesday that images taken on Sunday and Monday captured significant new activity showing increased military activity in the regions. The images could not be independently verified by Reuters. Maxar pointed to the arrival of several large deployments of troops and attack helicopters as well new deployments of ground attack aircraft and fighter-bomber jets to forward locations. The images also captured the departure of multiple ground forces units from existing garrisons along with other combat units seen in convoy formation, Maxar said. Buzzfeed eastern Europe correspondent Christopher Miller also shared some images purported to be showing \u201cRussia\u2019s continuing buildup in the past 48 hours\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the US and Canada for their financial support in the face of escalating tension with Russia. Zelenskiy thanked the two leaders on Tuesday. He tweeted: We are grateful to the United States for providing substantial financial support of $1 billion and $3 billion available for projects in Ukraine. Thank you [president Joe Biden] for the quick decision and concrete results after our conversation. Thank you Justin Trudeau for your timely decision to provide additional half a billion dollar package of financial assistance \u2026 we are much stronger together.\u201d Germany says it is up to Russia to de-escalate the conflict around Ukraine, and has called for Moscow to withdraw its troops, as chancellor Olaf Scholz prepares to meet president Vladimir Putin over the crisis. Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock issued a statement on Tuesday, saying: The situation is particularly dangerous and can escalate at any moment. The responsibility for de-escalation is clearly with Russia, and it is for Moscow to withdraw its troops. The EU and Nato are united around Ukraine \u2026 we must use all opportunities for dialogue in order to reach a peaceful solution.\u201d A Russian invasion of Ukraine is still highly likely and could take place imminently, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary Liz Truss said on Tuesday, adding that the government was on alert for any false flag operations in the next few days. Truss told Sky News that were Russian troops to enter Ukraine, they could get to Kyiv quickly. \u201cIn terms of the timing of an attack, it could be imminent,\u201d she said. She said Russian troops could get to Kyiv \u201cvery, very quickly\u201d. British prime minister Boris Johnson will lead a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee today as western leaders voice concerns a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen imminently. Johnson cut short his UK tour to return to London in order to convene the meeting to discuss the UK\u2019s consular response. He is believed to have received an intelligence briefing upon his return after maintaining there is still time for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis. Foreign secretary Liz Truss will consider whether to change advice to UK diplomats in the country, after it issued new guidance on Friday advising British citizens in Ukraine to leave immediately while commercial flights are still available. It could be another turbulent day on the markets after Asian stocks fell sharply today in line with the big losses in London and Europe yesterday. The FTSE is due to lose about 0.4% at the opening although hopes of more diplomacy in Ukraine could take the edge off investor nerves. Oil has dropped about 1% today while the pound is flat at $1.353 and \u20ac1.196. Thousands more US service members have boarded flights from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in preparation for deployment to Poland. The additional 3,000 soldiers will join the 3,000 who left last month for Poland and Germany. Australia\u2019s prime minister has urged China to denounce Russian threats against Ukraine. Scott Morrison noted that Beijing and Moscow had announced they were pursuing closer relations since more than 100,000 Russian troops were sent to the Ukrainian border. Morrison told Parliament in Canberra earlier today: We would expect all nations, all governments around the world, to be denouncing what is taking place with the threats of violence against Ukraine. I do note that the Chinese government, together with the Russian government, have been banding together on this issue and that the Chinese government has not denounced what is occurring in Ukraine.\u201d Morrison called on all federal lawmakers to join the Australian government in \u201curging the Chinese government to denounce those actions and to allow an appropriate response through the United Nations rather than resisting that being done\u201d through its membership of the UN security council. Japan\u2019s defence minister has also warned of an increased Russian naval presence in the Sea of Japan and the southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk. Defence minister Nobuo Kishi said in a tweet on Tuesday that \u201clarge-scale exercises by the entire fleet during this period are unusual\u201d. In January-February, the entire Russian Navy fleet announced that it would conduct military exercises in the waters around the base, the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. It is thought that the intention is to show off the ability to operate in the east and west in response to the recent movement of the Russian army around Ukraine.\u201d Japan\u2019s ministry of defence also announced today that it has confirmed a total of 24 Russian ships known to have been operating in the waters of the Sea of Japan and the southern Okhotsk Sea since earlier this month, according to Sankei News. Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida will speak with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday, a government source has said, as Tokyo expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the risk of a Russian invasion. Tokyo was preparing for the call on Tuesday evening local time while Kishida said Japan was \u201cwatching the situation with grave concern\u201d, Agence France-Presse reports. Japan\u2019s foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi stressed Tokyo\u2019s support for \u201cthe integrity of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territory\u201d in a statement earlier on Tuesday but declined to give details on what form any sanctions might take. He told reporters: First and foremost, Japan is strongly seeking a resolution through diplomatic dialogue. But if a Russian invasion takes place, Japan will take appropriate steps including possible sanctions, in response to what has actually happened, and in coordination with the G7 and international community.\u201d Following a 40-minute call between Boris Johnson and Joe Biden on Monday night, the two leaders say they believe there remains a \u201ccrucial window for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine\u201d. Britain said the pair emphasised the importance of unity and, while neither the UK nor the US will send troops to defend Ukraine, they insisted that any further Russian incursion \u201cwould result in a protracted crisis for Russia with far-reaching damage for both Russia and the world\u201d. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will travel to Moscow today to meet Vladimir Putin in a bid to avert war. Scholz, who was in Kyiv on Monday, warned that any Russian attack on Ukraine would be met with heavy economic consequences, adding that the \u201cterritorial integrity of Ukraine is not negotiable\u201d. The chancellor has said he will hammer home the message from the west that they are open to dialogue about Russia\u2019s security concerns but will impose sanctions if it invades Ukraine. \u201cWe are ready for very far-reaching and effective sanctions in coordination with our allies,\u201d he said on Monday. Germany is Russia\u2019s number one trade partner in Europe and the biggest consumer of Russian natural gas. Scholz is under pressure to make his presence felt on the international stage after succeeding Angela Merkel last year. Canada\u2019s announcement on Monday that it will supply lethal weapons to Ukraine has been labelled \u201cunacceptable\u201d by Russian ambassador to Ottawa, Oleg Stepanov. \u201cAny supply of arms to a country with an unresolved internal armed conflict is unacceptable. This does not bring peace closer and only prolongs and aggravates the fratricidal conflict in Ukraine,\u201d Stepanov told Russian state news agency TASS. \u201cBy providing weapons, western countries are pushing the Kiev regime to continue the war against its own people,\u201d he added. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro is facing backlash after deciding to go ahead with an official visit to Russia to meet with Putin on Wednesday in what has been described as awkward timing, amid the tense standoff between Moscow and the west over Ukraine. Bolsonaro will go ahead with the visit despite pressure from Brazil\u2019s traditional ally the United States and within his own cabinet. He says the visit is to build trade relations. Agence France-Presse quotes an interview with Bolsonaro on Radio Tupi on Saturday: President Putin has invited me. Brazil depends in large parts on fertilisers from Russia, Belarus. We pray to God that peace may reign in the world. We will also take with us a group of ministers who will deal with issues such as energy, defence and agriculture.\u201d Shares in Asia came under renewed selling pressure on Tuesday amid continued concerns about the potential for conflict in Ukraine. The Nikkei slipped is down 0.73% in the afternoon session, while the Kospi index in Seoul is off 0.66% and the ASX is off 0.3% in Sydney. Hong Kong is also down around 0.7% but shares on the mainland are doing better, up 0.4%. Even so, the losses are mild compared to the bloodbath in London and Europe on Monday where somes indices such as the Dax in Germany shed 2%. Kyle Rodda at online trader IG in Melbourne said the outlook for the German economy was very uncertain with the possibility of war to the east. War in Europe would a blow to the economy and a driver of even greater inflation, in what would be a one-two punch for the Dax that would almost certainly see it break down. As US intelligence sources warn of an imminent Russian invasion, residents of the Ukrainian capital are refusing to be cowed. The Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker is in Kyiv and tells Michael Safi that, on the face of it, much of the city is continuing life as normal. Restaurants are open, shops are full and the snow-lined streets buzz with people going about their normal business. This is in stark contrast to many foreign diplomats who are scrambling to leave the Ukrainian capital before any military action that could begin within days or even hours. But how likely is the full-scale military assault being warned of by western intelligence agencies? And is there a diplomatic solution that could be sold to Vladimir Putin that would also satisfy the Ukrainian government? Listen to our latest podcast episode: How the Ukraine crisis looks from Kyiv. Hello, welcome to our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis, I\u2019m Samantha Lock. This morning the German chancellor Olaf Scholz will fly to Moscow for a meeting with president Vladimir Putin, after spending Monday in Kyiv in the latest round of diplomacy aimed at averting a war in Europe. His visit comes as the US state department urged its citizens in Belarus to leave, citing an \u201cincrease in unusual and concerning Russian military activity near the border with Ukraine\u201d. Here are some of the other recent developments: Brazillian president Jair Bolsonaro announced he would fly to Russia on Tuesday to meet Putin. During a carefully choreographed meeting on Monday with Putin, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said \u201cthere is always a chance\u201d of reaching an agreement with the West over Ukraine. Canada has said it will send lethal military weaponry to Ukraine with a promise to loan Kyiv $500m to help defend itself in the face of Russian aggression. British PM Boris Johnson and US president Joe Biden agreed there \u201cremained a crucial window for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine\u201d. Global stock markets steadied a little on Tuesday after taking a battering on Monday because of concern about a possible conflict in Ukraine. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday called on the country\u2019s people to fly flags and sing the national anthem in unison on 16 February, a date that some Western media predict Russian could invade. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres spoke with the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine on Monday to express his serious concern over the heightened tensions and insisted \u201cthere is no alternative to diplomacy\u201d. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin that some of the drills were \u201cending\u201d and more would end \u201cin the near future\u201d, signalling a possible easing of the crisis."

            "title": "Russian central bank buys up roubles to avert stock market collapse",
            "date": "2022-02-24T17:51:50Z",
            "content": "The Russian central bank has purchased millions of roubles to prevent the collapse of the Moscow stock exchange and prop up the currency after it plunged to an all-time low of 89.60 against the dollar. In a scramble to prevent the invasion of Ukraine pushing Russia\u2019s financial system into meltdown, officials in Moscow closed the stock exchange while the Bank of Russia mounted a rescue operation to put a floor under the skidding rouble. By midday, the stock market had reopened and the rouble recovered to trade at 84 to the dollar, though late in the day it climbed back to 87 and analysts said an escalation of the war could force the central bank to intervene further to prevent the currency sinking even lower. \u201cTo stabilise the situation on the financial market, the Bank of Russia decided to start interventions on the currency market,\u201d the central bank said. Russia\u2019s main stock exchange fell 30% after reopening, falling from 3,000 to 2,000 points, while the MSCI index of shares in Russian companies traded in London and New York dropped by 45%. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia had created a financial safety net to withstand market volatility and said the \u201cemotional\u201d reaction of the financial markets to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine would even out. He added that all necessary measures were being taken to ensure the market reaction was as brief as possible. After weeks of denying plans to attack Ukraine, Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its coast, prompting analysts to predict that severe pressure on global financial markets was likely to persist over the coming weeks. Russia\u2019s currency, bonds and stocks all sank before its central bank announced its first foreign exchange intervention to shore up financial stability since 2014, when the country annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Russia holds a formidable war chest of more than $600bn (\u00a3450bn) in foreign-exchange reserves and gold that it can use in currency markets to prop up the rouble. A rapidly depreciating currency makes it harder to pay off foreign debts and leads to higher prices on imported goods and lower returns on exports. Officials at the Bank of Russia are understood to have sold foreign reserves to buy roubles to put a floor under the price, though the extent of the buying operation is not yet clear. One of the biggest falls in the value of the rouble was against the euro. Before the recent round of geopolitical tensions between Moscow and the west began to escalate in October, the rouble was trading at around 80 to the euro. It is now heading towards 90. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cMarket volatility has increased since the beginning of the year, stoked by rising interest rates, and today\u2019s news has added fuel to the market turbulence.\u201d As the US said it may cut off Russia\u2019s top banks from dollar transactions if Moscow moves its troops into Ukraine, data showed in December that Russian banks brought $5bn in foreign exchange back to Moscow and moved some of their long-term foreign exchange holdings into more liquid assets if needed in an emergency. To support Russian commercial banks under pressure from falling share prices and western sanctions, the central bank increased the daily amount of roubles it would swap for dollars from $3bn to $5bn. This will allow commercial banks to replenish the dollar stocks needed to repay foreign debts. The Bank of Russia also expanded the list of securities it accepts as collateral in exchange for the liquidity it provides. Markets are now bracing for the impact of fresh harsh western sanctions to punish Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThe sanctions hit is going to be significant, unlike the soft sanctions imposed on Tuesday and Wednesday,\u201d said the investment firm Renaissance Capital. The effective interest rate on Russian government debt soared to almost 10% as bond investors sold heavily to seek safer havens, although the effect is expected to be limited as most of the debt is held by domestic financial institutions. Ukraine\u2019s government debt collapsed in value, pushing the country towards a further bailout by the International Monetary Fund. The Washington-based lender of last resort said this week it was poised to start a virtual mission to Ukraine with a view to releasing $700m in aid. Since 2014, the IMF has committed more than $20bn in loans to Ukraine in a series of bailouts, though in 2019 it demanded that Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s government show it would aggressively try to recoup an estimated $15bn that was stolen from more than 100 banks, including the country\u2019s largest, PrivatBank, over the previous decade before a further $4bn was released. The Russian central bank is expected to ease pressure on the rouble further by increasing its main interest rate, which it hopes will lure back foreign investors searching for high returns. The bank is also expected to continue monetary tightening by raising interest rates as it struggles to rein in inflation, which is set to worsen from the falling rouble."

            "title": "UK shop price inflation almost doubles in January",
            "date": "2022-02-02T00:01:08Z",
            "content": "Shop price inflation almost doubled in January to the highest level for nearly a decade as the cost of furniture and flooring shot up. Annual inflation of goods bought from retailers rose to 1.5% last month from 0.8% in December, according to the latest data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body and the market research company NielsenIQ, the highest level since December 2012. The price of food rose by 2.7% in January, up from 2.4% in the previous month and the highest rate since October 2013. However, the biggest change in inflation was in non-food items, with prices rising by 0.9% compared with 0.2% a month before. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cJanuary saw shop price inflation nearly double, driven by a sharp rise in non-food inflation. In particular, furniture and flooring saw exceptionally high demand leading to increased prices as the rising oil costs made shipping more expensive. \u201cFood prices continue to rise, especially domestic produce which have been impacted by poor harvests, labour shortages, and rising global food prices.\u201d The retail price of UK furniture was up by a record 12.5% on a year before in December according to the Office for National Statistics, in the fourth consecutive month of double-digit price rises. A rise in the cost of materials, such as wood, and fuel has combined with a an increase in shipping and labour costs, which have affected many types of manufacturers and retailers. Raw materials and shipping costs have also pumped up the prices of flooring, including carpets. Dickinson warned of further price rises, on top of higher household bills, such as gas and electricity. \u201cMany households will find it difficult to absorb the additional costs, as well as others on the horizon. Retailers are working hard to cut costs, but it would be impossible to protect consumers from any future rises. As commodity prices, energy prices and transportation costs continue to rise, it is inevitable that retail prices will continue to follow in the future,\u201d she said. The latest evidence on inflation comes after data showing that households\u2019 annual grocery bills are on track to rise by \u00a3180 this year. Grocery prices rose 3.8% over the four weeks to 23 January compared with the same period last year, according to the market research company Kantar. It said prices are rising fastest for fresh beef and poultry, savoury snacks, crisps, skincare and cat food but are falling for fresh bacon, vitamins and beer."

            "content": "Pay growth in the UK continued to lag behind inflation in December as households faced the biggest fall in living standards in three decades. Average weekly pay, excluding bonuses, fell in real terms, according to official figures. The Guardian spoke to workers and employers about the pressure to keep up with inflation. Home From Home Care, Lincolnshire Paul de Savary has raised pay to recruit and retain staff at the care home provider he runs in Lincolnshire. With shortages of staff in the sector nationwide, the managing director of Home From Home Care has raised the firm\u2019s wage bill by 20% in a year to avoid losing staff. \u201cWe saw a situation building in the summer where we were going to run out of staff if we weren\u2019t careful. They were all going to hospitality and other sectors than care,\u201d he said. The operator of 11 care homes, which has 450 staff and supports adults with learning difficulties and complex needs, has raised starting pay from the \u00a38.91 national living wage to at least \u00a310 an hour. This is above increased legal pay floor of \u00a39.50 an hour due from April. However, the firm faces spiralling costs across the board, including for energy bills and insurance, and lacks the ability to pass on bumper prices to its customers owing to a lack of adequate government funding for social care. Still, de Savary said retaining staff was vital, even if at the expense of profitability in the short-term. \u201cWe were concerned about the cost of living for our staff,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re worrying about things, we have to help them. They\u2019re at the heart of everything we do.\u201d Matthew Tovey, NHS nurse, south Wales \u201cIt seems to me like I\u2019m just working to be able to cover the bills,\u201d said Matthew Tovey. The 30-year-old from Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, said his pay had not risen above inflation for a decade under the Conservatives\u2019 austerity drive. Tovey, who uses his car to commute to work, has seen the cost of diesel rise sharply and is concerned that his pay packet will not keep up with the surge in gas and electricity bills due in April. \u201cI\u2019m quite fearful of how I\u2019m going to manage,\u201d he said. He said it felt as if NHS staff had been ignored despite being on the frontline of the pandemic. \u201cI worked through three waves, and they stood on their doorsteps and clapped, but they\u2019re taking food away from our tables, really.\u201d Having gone to university to become a nurse, Tovey says he probably earns more than other people but is still struggling. \u201cIt feels like if I\u2019ve worked hard and gone into a profession to better myself, and I\u2019m in this position, how the hell are other people coping? \u201cIt impacts on your mental health, there\u2019s nowhere to turn. You\u2019re caught between a rock and a hard place and you wonder, when are we going to have a break?\u201d Jaltek, Luton The Luton-based electronics manufacturer Jaltek has found hiring staff tougher as Brexit barriers and Covid-19 have reduced the number of EU workers in Britain, while rising inflation has led the company to increase pay. \u201cIt\u2019s a scarcity of people,\u201d said Steve Blythe, the business manager at the family-owned company. \u201cIt\u2019s an employees\u2019 market. I think short-term that will put pressure on wages. It goes back to when Brexit happened. Some staff went back to Romania, Poland. These aren\u2019t people who politicians would have you believe are low-paid and low-skilled. They have degrees in science and engineering and are on good money. It leaves you looking for a pool of people who are scarce in the UK.\u201d The firm, which is a member of the Make UK trade body and builds electronics for cars, spacecraft and medical devices, is raising pay to compensate workers for higher rates of inflation, though this is made harder as inflation climbs more than expected. \u201cWhen we looked at pay a month ago it\u2019s a different picture to where we\u2019re even at now. We have to monitor inflation keenly,\u201d Blythe said."

            "content": "The company behind Irn-Bru has revealed it is increasing its prices after its packaging, ingredients and energy-linked commodity costs jumped, as it raised its sales and profit estimates. AG Barr said owing to rising costs, which includes fruit and wages, it had put up prices \u201cwhere appropriate\u201d and signalled further price increases as it pointed to the UK\u2019s inflation rate rising above 5%, the highest in decades. Sales of the Scottish fizzy drink, made to a secret recipe, are likely to have been boosted in part by it becoming the talk of the recent climate summit Cop26 in Glasgow. The drink made global headlines when the US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted an Instagram video of herself praising Irn-Bru, after being handed a can by the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on her arrival in Glasgow. Irn-Bru is often referred to as Scotland\u2019s other national drink \u2013 after whisky \u2013 and AG Barr was the exclusive soft drink and water supplier at two convention centres in Glasgow used during Cop26. The company, which also makes Rubicon drinks and Funkin cocktail mixers, said it made revenues of \u00a3267m in the year to 30 January, up 17.5% on the previous year and ahead of its own expectations \u2013 despite the spread of the Omicron Covid variant and restrictions on socialising. Sales are also higher than its pre-pandemic performance of \u00a3255.7m. As a result, AG Barr expects its full-year profit before tax and one-off items to be slightly higher than its November estimate of \u00a341m. The company said: \u201cWhile government restrictions have impacted consumer behaviour across the year, both our Barr Soft Drinks and Funkin business units have traded well, particularly during the periods when restrictions were eased.\u201d Its chief executive, Roger White, said: \u201cWe have remained fully operational throughout the year, producing high-quality products and providing strong business support to all of our customers. \u201cWe have delivered an excellent financial performance against a volatile backdrop, while at the same time delivering on our strategic priorities.\u201d"

Sky\u2019s Essential broadband package will increase 10% to \u00a327.50 a month from 1 April, while the Superfast service rises 9% to \u00a330.50 a month. The company, which has more than 12 million UK customers, said the average TV and broadband customer will pay an additional \u00a33.60 a month from April and that the average price increase was below 5%. However, the price of some services is rising by as much as 14%. The announcement came on the same day official figures showed inflation rose to a 30-year-high of 5.5% in January as prices continued to surge across the board. On Tuesday, the regulator Ofcom said 20% of UK households had struggled to pay their TV, internet and phone bills in the last year, with some having to cancel services or cut back spending on essentials such as food and clothing to make payments. A Sky spokesperson said on Wednesday: \u201cWe know price increases are never welcome so we aim to keep prices as low as possible while still delivering the content customers love, the flexibility to choose the right package, and our leading customer service.\u201d The company said the exact increase customers faced would depend on their plan and whether they were in a contract. HD television will increase by \u00a31 to \u00a38 a month while call rates (UK landlines and UK mobiles) will rise by 2p a minute to 22p. Sky Mobile will reintroduce roaming charges of \u00a32 a day for its UK customers who visit the rest of Europe after 3 May. The EU ban on roaming charges between member states no longer applies to people with UK mobile phones because of Brexit. Ernest Doku, a telecoms expert at Uswitch.com, said: \u201cSky does not base their mid-contract rises on inflation, but any hopes that customers might be spared the pain of increases have been dashed. For many this will be an unwanted burden during a time when households are feeling the pinch from bill hikes across the board. \u201cBroadband customers still in the minimum term of their contract can leave penalty-free if they act within 30 days of receiving their notification.\u201d January\u2019s inflation figures mean Virgin Mobile and O2 customers\u2019 mobile phone bills will increase by 11.7% because they are linked to the retail prices index, which reached 7.8% last month. The increase has been set at 3.9% above RPI. \u201cShould you find yourself in financial difficulty, don\u2019t suffer in silence.

            "date": "2022-02-15T09:29:46Z",
            "content": "The UK labour market was hit by two big shocks towards the end of 2021: the end of the government\u2019s furlough scheme and the arrival of the Omicron variant. The good news from the latest official data is both were negotiated without the feared lengthening of the dole queues. Employment is up, job vacancies are at a new record high and the unemployment rate is down. The bad news is that the challenge posed by rising inflation looks like it will prove to be a tricker hurdle to surmount than the end of the furlough or the restrictions that were imposed by the four nations of the UK in response to Omicron. When the Bank of England held off from raising interest rates last November it did so because it wanted to judge the impact of ending wage subsidies. The evidence is now in: there is nothing in the latest figures to stay the hand of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee. Borrowing costs have been raised at the MPC\u2019s last two meetings and will go up again. The tightness of the labour market means average earnings are rising at an annual rate of more than 4%. That\u2019s because the demand for workers as businesses recover exceeds supply. The number of people in employment is more than 500,000 below its pre-pandemic level, largely because of a fall in self-employment. Older workers have left the workforce, many of them on health grounds. This combination of factors means employees are in a stronger bargaining position than they might have expected a year ago, when the economy was locked down and the furlough still in place. But earnings would need to rise by even more to keep pace with rising prices. Inflation hit a 30-year high of 5.4% in December and will rise still further over the coming months, which means the squeeze on real incomes will intensify. In the circumstances, workers will seek to protect their living standards by asking for higher pay. That pressure will be sufficient to make the Bank of England nervous about a wage-price spiral, but not strong enough to compensate employees when the cost of living exceeds 7% in the spring. Going is tough in post-furlough Britain Government support meant corporate insolvency was a dog that didn\u2019t bark earlier in the pandemic. Help came in a number of forms: firms had their wage bills covered, there were grants and business rates holidays; and companies in trouble were given breathing space from their creditors. Businesses are now being asked to manage on their own, and unsurprisingly a large number of them are finding the going extremely tough. The latest figures for England and Wales in January show the number of company insolvencies more than doubled from the same month in 2021, as did the number of compulsory liquidations. That\u2019s not quite as alarming as it looks given the artificially low levels of business distress during the pandemic. Business failures last month were only slightly up on the pre-pandemic month of January 2020, a better comparison. Even so, the trend is now clearly upwards. Creditors are taking a tougher line now that they can. And, having just about kept going through two years of Covid-19, the owners of some small businesses are giving up because they can\u2019t see things improving with a year of rocketing energy bills, rising inflation and higher interest rates ahead. To some extent, this is perfectly normal. Businesses cease trading all the time, and the failure rate is bound to be higher now given the acceleration of structural changes \u2013 the increase in online shopping, for example \u2013 seen in the past two years. So while insolvencies are still a dog that hasn\u2019t really barked, they are starting to emit a low growl. They need to be watched. US inflation figures a worry for UK Another day, another set of worrying inflation news from the other side of the Atlantic. US producer prices \u2013 a gauge of what businesses charge for their goods and services \u2013 rose by 1% last month, double what Wall Street was expecting. There are two points to note here: producer prices are a good early guide to future consumer prices and, as a rule of thumb, what happens in the US happens in the UK with a lag of a few months."

            "date": "2022-02-15T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England is facing fierce criticism from both sides over its plans to raise interest rates. For hawkish economists, Threadneedle Street has fallen badly behind the curve, miscalculating the rise of inflationary pressures, and now needs to play catch-up to regain credibility. Others say the Bank is navigating the most dangerous moment for the economy in decades, but now risks a huge policy mistake. They argue that driving up borrowing costs will have little effect on inflation caused by global supply chain disruption, and that it risks engineering the conditions for a recession in an economy still grappling with Covid-19 and struggling for momentum. Each side fears that a lack of coherent strategy either way will fatally undermine the central bank\u2019s credibility. Behind the curve Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), said a steady rise in interest rates last year, clearly communicated to financial markets, would have been a sensible reaction to rising prices, and he criticised the Bank for a kneejerk response. \u201cThey\u2019ve sent conflicting messages on monetary policy since last November, and they seem to have lurched from being very cautious to being seen to want to act. But it\u2019s still not clear what strategy they\u2019re going to be following in the future.\u201d With inflation poised to hit more than triple the Bank\u2019s 2% target rate come April \u2013 rising to about 7% \u2013 City investors are betting that the MPC will add several more interest rate rises to one in December and another this month in an attempt to restore its credibility after waiting and watching for too long last year. The Bank governor, Andrew Bailey, was criticised as being out of touch when he urged workers this month not to demand big pay rises. Financial markets expect rates to reach 2% by the end of the year, the highest in more than a decade, since rates sank close to zero during the 2008 financial crisis. Roger Bootle, chairman of the consultancy Capital Economics, told MPs on the Commons Treasury committee last week that the Bank was \u201cway behind the curve\u201d, breeding a mismatch between the degree of tightening of policy and how quickly the inflation danger was picking up. \u201cThe Bank has not communicated clearly enough how tough it may need to be,\u201d he said. Official figures are expected to confirm on Wednesday an inflation rate of close to 5.4% in January, the highest level in three decades. The Bank has said the measure for the annual increase in the cost of living could peak at about 7.25% by April as surging energy prices feed through. \u201cOut of the blue, for the first time in 20 years, inflation comes powering ahead, way above what they dreamed of, and they are like: \u2018Oh my God,\u2019\u201d Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Treasury minister who sits as a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, told MPs at the same hearing. O\u2019Neill, a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said acting too fast could exacerbate the damage. \u201cAt this point they have to get out of that dilemma, but they now run the classic risk, for those who have been around long enough, that they might end up going too much in completely the wrong way, just to get their own credibility back,\u201d he said. On the Bank\u2019s own forecasts, it anticipates unemployment rising from the current rate of 4.1% to 5% by early 2025 as the economic outlook deteriorates due to weak real income growth and fading consumer demand. Helped by higher interest rates, inflation is forecast to fall back below target to 1.5%. Despite the risks to the economy, Karen Ward, a former adviser to Philip Hammond when he was chancellor, and now the chief market strategist for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at JP Morgan Asset Management, said Threadneedle Street was still likely to prioritise protecting growth. \u201cThey\u2019re walking a tightrope between maintaining their credibility and showing that they will not tolerate such high inflation, but not being so heavy-handed that they short-circuit the recovery. On that balancing act, I feel they\u2019ll err on the side of inflation rather than [damaging] growth\u201d she said. Hold your nerve It\u2019s possible to be too critical of policymakers when they are coping with a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, said Neil Shearing, chief economist at the global consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cThere is lots of gnashing of teeth about inflation at the moment. And there is an argument that governments and central banks have over-stimulated their economies, triggering higher prices than would have been the case. But in the 2008 financial crash they were rightly criticised for not providing enough stimulus, and that mistake led to a much worse situation in the years that followed.\u201d Dario Perkins, the head of global macroeconomics at the consultancy TS Lombard, said the BoE should not be blamed for the rise in inflation. He believes it was sensible to maintain ultra-low rates last year while the economy recovered from the pandemic. \u201cHowever, the bank\u2019s credibility is at stake now as it starts to increase interest rates without a good reason for doing so,\u201d he said. Ben Broadbent, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor, has tackled criticism of the Bank head on, saying the economy was weak last year and continued to need low interest rates. He has justified the turnaround since December by arguing that the Bank needs to clamp down on early signs that workers, keen to limit the damage from rising inflation, are demanding higher wages, triggering a wage/price spiral. Perkins, a senior Treasury economist during the 2008 crash, described the concern about spiralling wages variously as \u201cridiculous\u201d, \u201cspurious\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d. It\u2019s a view that goes to the heart of the Bank\u2019s dilemma. It also potentially undermines the credibility of the central bank\u2019s regional agents, who underpin the Bank\u2019s forecasts of future earnings and have reported that wage increases are already running hot across the country. \u201cI think with every move it makes, the MPC is trying to convince us that despite two years of unexplained policy changes, and despite appearing to embark on a new and undeclared policy of financing government debt, despite an economy showing no sign of above-average wage growth, it remains a credible and independent policymaking body,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cIt is when this defensive mindset takes over that policy mistakes are possible.\u201d Rupert Harrison, George Osborne\u2019s chief economic adviser from 2006 to 2015, said all central banks were in danger of making their first major mistake. \u201c[It] really feels like central bankers around the world are making a collective policy mistake \u2013 trying to use rapid rate rises to cool inflation that is driven mainly by supply constraints, just as growth momentum is slowing,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cOnly in the US can you see anything like the hot labour market that would justify significant tightening \u2013 I really struggle to understand the Bank of England\u2019s reasoning today.\u201d Robert Skidelsky, a peer who sits on the Lords economics affairs committee, said the central bank was struggling to maintain a fiction that it was independent from Treasury policymaking. \u201cIt is terrified of losing its credibility as an independent central bank, but cannot admit that it has become like an agency of the Treasury. Now it is trying to act independently and yet its dual mission \u2013 to bring down inflation while also fostering growth \u2013 leaves its policymaking in disarray.\u201d Danny Blanchflower, a former member of theMPC, believes a series of missteps through the pandemic mean the Bank\u2019s credibility is \u201ctotally shot\u201d. He said: \u201cSince the time the Bank was made independent [in 1997], I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything so bad.\u201d Blanchflower said higher unemployment was riskier than above-target inflation. \u201cThe danger is they\u2019re going to generate a recession,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine poses a dilemma for the UK government and the Bank of England with an obvious answer. The dilemma centres on the cost of living crisis, which is only going to worsen now that gas prices are on course to rocket again and oil prices along with them. Within seconds of the first reports from Ukraine of the invasion, traders were hiking the cost of gas back towards levels seen in December last year. That was the month prices reached nine times the five-year average, before falling back to five times the average in January. Analysts have warned that household gas and electricity bills could rise by a further \u00a3600-\u00a31,000 a year \u2013 to as much as \u00a33,000 \u2013 if wholesale gas prices are kept high by an ongoing war. Petrol prices, which in January appeared to have passed their peak when they began falling towards \u00a31.40 a litre, are heading back to record highs of \u00a31.50 and beyond. In some parts of the country, they have already exceeded \u00a31.60 a litre. A surge in energy costs has put inflation on track to hit 7% or 8% by the spring, and possibly higher in the summer, eating into the disposable incomes of middle earners and pushing many of those on low wages into poverty. The combined effect on the bottom two-thirds of households will be to slow the economy, which has come to depend to a disturbingly high degree, during a decade or more of public spending cuts, on consumer spending. Rishi Sunak is planning to make the cost of living crisis worse by increasing taxes \u2013 national insurance will rise by 1.25% in April and income tax will rise via a freeze on thresholds, bringing more people into paying tax at the standard rate and more people paying higher-rate tax. The Bank of England has its own scheme to increase the costs of borrowing for tens of thousands of small and medium-sized business, and millions of mortgage payers, who face higher-cost loans in the near future if not straight away. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, financial markets were expecting interest rates to rise by at least one percentage point this year. Some City economists believed Threadneedle Street was on course to increase the base rate to 2% by the middle of next year. With inflation soaring, taxes rising and interest rates climbing higher, no wonder the GfK consumer confidence index for February slumped to -26. This was its lowest level since February last year and not far from its worst ever level of -34 when the pandemic took hold in April and May 2020. In February 2020 it stood at -7. It\u2019s true that plenty of people are plotting how to fly on holiday to spend their pandemic savings, but they are in a minority, albeit a large one. Most people are reeling from forecasts from their energy suppliers of an extra \u00a3700, \u00a3800 or \u00a3900 on their energy bills this year, made before the war began. Should the Bank of England press ahead with interest rate rises to quell even higher inflation? Should Sunak shoot holes in everyone\u2019s take-home pay in April to rebuild the public finances? The answers must be no and no. Even staff at the International Monetary Fund, who gave their verdict on the UK economy last week and are not known for any socialist tendencies, said the tax burden should shift to higher earners to allow the Treasury to offer more support for those on middle and low incomes. The Washington-based lender of last resort, which this week will be confronted by a separate dilemma when it considers a request from Ukraine\u2019s government for financial assistance, knows it would be foolish for British ministers to plough on when, without offering extra financial support to the worst hit, the energy crisis could push the economy into recession. As for the Bank of England, it will need to let inflation rise without increasing interest rates, knowing that the likelihood of a huge squeeze on living standards will on its own bring down demand and reduce pressure on prices. It will be difficult for the anti-inflation warriors inside Threadneedle Street to leave prices to rise and fall without taking action, but extra borrowing costs in the current environment, coupled with tumbling consumer spending, would make a recession next year almost certain. It may seem callous to debate the economic situation in the UK when soldiers and civilians are dying. But it won\u2019t help the people of Ukraine if British policymakers, along with their blinkered counterparts in the US and EU, drive the west into recession. Thankfully, there is every prospect that the US Federal Reserve will resist pushing interest rates higher at its next meeting, and the Bank should follow suit. It would send a positive signal: that at least the central banks understand."

            "date": "2022-02-13T12:21:49Z",
            "content": "Central banks are getting twitchy about inflation. Cost of living pressures are rising just about everywhere and the relaxed mood of last autumn has been replaced by an urgency that could soon become panic. In the US, where inflation is at its highest in four decades, the latest chatter on Wall Street is that the Federal Reserve will take every opportunity to raise interest rates between now and the end of the year, seven times in all. Inflation figures for the UK are out on Wednesday, and even though little change is expected this month from the 5.4% recorded in December, further increases are expected by the spring. Bank of England forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt because they have been wrong for the past year, but for what it\u2019s worth Threadneedle Street now predicts inflation to peak at just over 7%. The Bank of England and the Fed are getting stick for waiting so long before taking steps to rein in inflation. The US and the UK economies, it is said, are overheating as the threat from the pandemic recedes, one reason being that central banks have delayed putting up borrowing costs. This might seem a compelling argument but the idea that the US, the UK and the big economies of the eurozone are in the middle of a rampant boom doesn\u2019t square with the facts. The fastest growing G7 economy over the past two years has been the US, where output has increased by 1.5% on average. The next best-performing country has been France, where growth has averaged less than 0.5% a year. UK output is 0.4% below its pre-pandemic level, while Germany and Italy have still more ground to make up. So where is the inflation coming from? The answer is that prices are rising more quickly than they were because of supply-side pressures. As economies lifted restrictions and demand has returned to more normal \u2013 although not boom \u2013 conditions, severe bottlenecks have emerged. Everything from computer chips to natural gas has been in short supply, and that has pushed up inflation. This was the explanation the Fed and the Bank of England trotted out last summer and autumn when price pressures first started to bite, and it was broadly right. Yes, they said, interest rates would need to be raised from their emergency levels but there was no great urgency because their economies were still operating short of where they would have been in the absence of Covid-19. In any event, increasing the cost of borrowing would have zero impact on global energy prices. The Bank of England had an additional problem, which was that Rishi Sunak removed some of the support the Treasury was providing for the economy last autumn. With the benefit of hindsight, the end of the furlough did not lead to the feared rise in unemployment, but there was no way of knowing that at the time. As a result, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee responded to the chancellor\u2019s tightening of policy by keeping interest rates lower than they might otherwise have been. As the National Institute for Economic and Social Research pointed out last week, it would have been preferable had policy been the other way round, with a less aggressive approach by Sunak providing space for the Bank to raise rates modestly. The Bank of England and the Fed subsequently realised price pressures were more acute than they had predicted, while unemployment fell more quickly. This raised concerns that workers would use the bargaining power provided by a tight labour market to secure higher pay awards. If, say, an annual inflation rate of 7.5% in the US led to salary increases of 8%, a wage-price spiral redolent of the 1970s would then set in. In the short-term, inflationary pressures are likely to persist. The first three months of 2022 will be an echo of last summer as restrictions are lifted and economies open up. Those people who have built up savings during lockdown now have cash to spare to buy a new car or book a foreign holiday. Firms will have trouble filling vacancies, while energy costs will remain high as long as there is a threat of Ukraine being invaded. The cost of a barrel of oil is already closing in on $100. Things look a lot trickier from the spring onwards. In the UK, energy bills and taxes both go up in April, and it will become clear to many workers that their wages are not keeping up with inflation. Cost increases that were initially inflationary will turn deflationary as they add to costs for business and squeeze consumer spending power. Against this backdrop, the Bank of England needs to calibrate its response carefully (as does the Fed). Central banks clearly feel their credibility will be at risk if they allow inflation to take hold, and that means a more aggressive approach to interest rates than seemed likely as recently as late last year. There is a way that central banks can emerge with their credibility intact. If they are right in believing inflation is currently a supply-side problem, only a limited tightening of policy will be needed. Inflation will come down with only a small increase in unemployment. The Bank and the Fed will then be the heroes of the hour. There is, of course, an alternative scenario in which central banks act tough but still damage their credibility, which is what will happen if they add to the pain already coming the way of their economies through interest-rate overkill. The growing risk of that would quickly turn the recovery of early 2022 into the recession of early 2023."

The gap is likely to be larger for mothers, who have the double whammy of no superannuation contributions while on maternity leave and smaller contributions (blame that wage penalty) on their return. The injury isn\u2019t just financial. About 15% of mothers report experiencing discrimination in relation to performance assessments and career advancement while on or requesting parental leave. On the flipside, men seem to get moderate pay bumps along with fist bumps when they become parents. Estimates range between no impact on their pay and a 2% increase. So, let\u2019s get this straight. Women are 2.5 times more likely to take parental leave than men. Yet there\u2019s a wage premium for being a dad and a wage penalty for being a mum. It doesn\u2019t seem to stack up. Why aren\u2019t new dads more likely to take time off? Some of the reasons are pragmatic. Breastfeeding is difficult (though not impossible) for men. Mums need time to recover from childbirth. It follows that women need to take leave after giving birth. If there\u2019s a choice between maternity and paternity leave for a newborn, maternity leave is prioritised. Others reasons are societal. Mothers are often expected to take time off. Whether a woman is taking too much leave or not enough seems to be a popular water cooler conversation. Fathers \u2013 not so much. Patriarchal views still argue that men should be breadwinners, not caregivers. The same views argue that men who spend time with their families are less committed to their work. What really gets me, though, are the financial reasons. Birth mothers of newborn children in Australia are entitled by law to up to 18 weeks of paid leave. Birth fathers? Just two weeks of paid leave. Here we have a law which explicitly discriminates against men on the basis of biological sex. In doing so, the law entrenches old social gender roles and expectations. It also has negative impacts across the board. Paternity leave brings a range of benefits \u2013 and not just to dads. Kids report feeling closer to fathers who took paternity leave \u2013 even years later. Where couples are married, dad taking paternity leave means a lower probability of divorce. There\u2019s a more equal sharing of household tasks, even years after paternity leave has ended. Yes, providing paid paternity leave would involve some cost to taxpayers. But it would also provide an economic boost. It could be the thing which encourages our next baby boom \u2013 and our ticket out of a recession. Normally, an increased fertility rate is economic short-term pain (lower participation rates) for long-term gain (bigger population). Equal paid parental leave could provide the latter while mitigating the former. Perhaps counterintuitively, having paid paternity leave could actually increase the number of hours couples are willing to work while they have young children. Paid paternity leave encourages mothers to go back to work earlier. What\u2019s more, couples who share household tasks more evenly are willing to spend more time on paid work. It also incentivises people to become parents. At a time when population growth seems as elusive as economic growth, this is a pretty good deal. Globally, each woman is having fewer children than ever in recorded history. By 2100, the global population will have plateaued, or even begun to decline. Good for the environment, but not great for economic growth (if GDP was all we cared about). I\u2019m far from the first person to advocate for this. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency has long argued for universal, gender-neutral paid parental leave. More than half of Australia\u2019s largest employers already offer gender-neutral paid parental leave on top of government entitlements. Other countries provide equal paid parental leave for fathers. It\u2019s good for women and men both. With the economic sweetener thrown in, it seems like a no-brainer. \u2022 Jessica Mizrahi is an economic consultant and commentator"

            "date": "2022-02-17T15:12:29Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s low-carbon and renewable energy economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data showing a fall in the number of green jobs. In a blow to the government\u2019s pledge to boost net-zero employment opportunities, the Office for National Statistics said its latest figures, covering 2020, showed \u201cno significant change\u201d in turnover and job numbers in the sector compared with six years earlier. Employment in the low-carbon and renewable energy economy \u2013 which includes manufacturing, energy supply and construction \u2013 fell by about 28,000 across the UK over the period, to just 207,800. Among the steepest declines were in factories producing energy-efficient products, onshore wind, and solar energy. Trade unions raised questions over the government\u2019s plan to boost Britain\u2019s low-carbon economy after years of limited progress. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the UK had an opportunity to be a pioneer on the path to net zero. \u201cBut we will miss out on these opportunities if ministers do not step up public investment and action. And we could see existing jobs lost to other countries who modernise their industry faster,\u201d she added. Although the latest snapshot includes the first year of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 when the British economy plunged into the deepest recession for 100 years \u2013 the figures show that in 2019, before the health emergency struck, green business turnover also fell compared with a year earlier. According to the latest data, the sector with the largest growth in jobs was in low-emission vehicles and infrastructure, where employment more than doubled to 19,100. However, this was not enough to offset bigger falls elsewhere, including a decline of more than a quarter, or 32,000, in the number of jobs in energy-efficient product manufacturing. The number of green businesses operating in the UK fell by 13% over the six-year period, while the combined turnover for the low-carbon economy fell by almost 6% to \u00a341.2bn. The ONS said the fall in turnover was largely driven by the energy-efficient products and low-emissions vehicles sectors. The majority of businesses in the low-carbon and renewable energy sectors are in manufacturing and construction, both of which suffered a downturn in 2020. However, it said employment should have been less affected than turnover because the figures included staff on furlough. While green sectors including offshore wind have recorded substantial growth in recent years, with a sharp rise in renewable energy production, critics argue that much of the activity has been driven by foreign companies, with a reliance on the UK importing turbine blades and components manufactured abroad. Boris Johnson announced an ambition in late 2020 to create 250,000 green jobs across the country through a 10-point plan, as part of a wider government drive to hit net zero and embed a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Ministers are seeking to encourage the growth of green jobs in sectors such as offshore wind, including through the creation of freeports in an attempt to boost investment and jobs in the low-carbon economy. However, experts and campaigners have warned the government\u2019s net zero plans lack the required ambition and are not backed up with adequate funding from the Treasury, instead relying on the private sector. A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cOver the last three decades, the UK has achieved record clean growth. Our economy has grown by 77%, while our emissions have decreased by 44% - faster than any other G7 nation. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of the worst economic recession in a lifetime and an unprecedented pandemic, the low carbon economy has continued to support 430,000 jobs across the UK. We\u2019ve already seen 56,000 jobs created and supported in green sectors last year, including in offshore wind and electric vehicle manufacturing. \u201cAs we recover from the pandemic, we are unlocking \u00a390bn of private investment to continue to support the creation of new jobs in new British industries, such as Gigafactories, offshore wind, and nuclear power generation.\u201d"

            "content": "Who should be famous? There are people who are so brilliant at \u2013 and dedicated to \u2013 what they do that their work makes the world seem bigger and more exciting. Watching them act, hearing them sing, reading their writing or seeing their art can make you feel like something inside you is waking up \u2013 like there is more to life than work, bills and shopping. It really hits you. There are people who live wild, fascinating lives, full of stories that remind you rules can be broken. There are people who are so beautiful they seem to come from a different planet. You see a face like this and it stays with you. You find yourself, months later, in a supermarket queue, smiling and wondering about them, still. There are people who are very brave. Who will do the right thing, whatever the personal cost, because someone has to. Then there are influencers. The typical mainstream influencer is conventionally attractive but unexceptional. They are accessible. They painstakingly document the minutiae of their lives: a parade of nights in; batch-cooked lunches; cups of tea (herbal after 5); cocktails in chain bars; Ikea trips; gym outings; worthy non-fiction books; bland clothes from high street brands (they know fast fashion is bad, don\u2019t worry); and their political views \u2013 corporate-brochure style progressivism. They are safe and unchallenging, a symptom of a risk-averse culture. As Natasha Stagg writes in Sleeveless: \u201cA typical influencer today is basic \u2013 the opposite of avant garde.\u201d They are famous because they want to be. And often thanks to a deeply random origin story \u2013 appearing on a homepage, buying followers, being tagged by a bigger influencer, accidentally going viral \u2013 or via their participation in reality TV. Mainstream influencers revel in their ordinariness. The larger their following, the more ordinary they tend to be. The biggest TikTok-er is Charli D\u2019Amelio (135.8 million followers), a perfectly average suburban teenager whose skill is tap dancing. For a while her bio was a self-deprecating joke: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t get the hype either.\u201d Social media has democratised fame and elevated banality. My sense is that this banality has driven the demand that influencers conform to a narrow definition of a \u201cgood person\u201d. A squeaky-clean type with brand-friendly progressive views, who lists their privileges and performs plainly superficial gestures, such as the trend for white people \u201cconfessing\u201d to whiteness (a characteristic that is usually obvious). If a famous person is unexceptional, the subject of their morality becomes more salient because it poses an uncomfortable question: why do they deserve their fame? Earlier this year, Molly-Mae Hague, an influencer who gained prominence as a contestant on Love Island, attracted ire for an interview where she said: \u201cWe all have the same 24 hours in a day \u2026 If you want something enough, you can achieve it.\u201d This was interpreted as a shocking revelation of her Thatcherite worldview. Particularly stark since she serves as creative director of Pretty Little Thing, a brand that got bad publicity after its suppliers were revealed to be paying garment workers in Leicester just \u00a33.50 an hour. The vehemence of the response was striking. It seemed overstated, or mistimed. Hague\u2019s position at PLT predated this \u2013 and the wages were national news in 2020. Nobody needed clairvoyant powers to discern that Hague\u2019s politics would not align with those of a union rep. Was the issue her views? Or that she didn\u2019t conform to the regulation performance? If she had woodenly listed her privileges and self-castigated, while remaining at PLT, what difference would that have made? While Hague\u2019s media storm raged, I was subjected to a concerted advertising campaign by Uber, using a YouTube influencer named Lucy Moon. \u201cSafety Matters with Lucy Moon,\u201d went the tagline: \u201cI love exploring the city. But as a woman, I also want to feel safe.\u201d Footage showed Moon sipping cocktails and zipping around in a taxi. Uber has been beleaguered by issues linked to low driver pay, as Polly Smythe documented, and by safety concerns. This advert seemed like Uber\u2019s attempt to mitigate these issues. I imagine I saw so much of it because it was targeted at young women. This is not the most sinister (or canny) marketing strategy. But the influencer partnership struck me. Moon\u2019s social media brand is familiar: a beige array of cardigans, teas and stock privilege disclaimers. In posts from summer 2020, when the outcry over George Floyd\u2019s murder made disavowing racism a brand imperative, Moon (who is white) exhorted followers to be better allies and advertised her own credentials by announcing that she was now reading Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race. When I watched her Instagram story, it was a video explaining colonialism. This self-conscious progressivism, performed while in partnership with a company that had to be forced by the UK supreme court to recognise workers\u2019 rights, seems like galling hypocrisy. But I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s that; I think it\u2019s mindlessness. The natural outcome of a politics that is proudly proclaimed when it is of personal benefit but totally unconsidered. Is this posturing better than what Hague said? Or worse? Moon looks like just one example of the cynical and deeply unserious way that social justice operates among influencers: as a branding device. Melodramatic language (phrases like \u201ctaking a stand\u201d) disguises the fact that what counts as activism on social media is inherently low-effort and low-cost. Even under these conditions, influencers are spineless. They frantically espouse support for causes that have mainstream buy-in and ignore controversial ones. The anti-racism black square in 2020, for example, was ubiquitous. Expressing views on Palestine is rare. Inconsistencies abound. Rejecting colonialism is common, but there was silence last month on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, when British soldiers shot dead 13 people at a march for civil rights in Derry. The regular instances when a smear campaign (posing as a social justice crusade) is used to attract followers and advertise righteousness never involve personal risk. The recent West Elm Caleb saga was so corporate-brochure friendly that a mayonnaise conglomerate was involved within hours. It\u2019s all just fake and silly. None of this would matter if this progressivism was not being used to sell us something. Not just Uber or mayonnaise. But these people. These bland, ordinary figures. These symptoms of a culture that is forgetting the value of beauty, weirdness and coolness. Of people who are brave. Of people who are very good at something that matters. Of feeling like something inside you is waking up. A culture that is so risk-averse it has stupefied itself. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 July 2022 to remove a reference to a branded product.

            "date": "2022-02-23T10:00:03Z",
            "content": "Last week, Republican senator Ted Cruz posted a photo of himself alongside UFC legend Chuck Liddell. The photo, which showed the two men posing with raised fists, was the latest example of a politician using an athlete\u2019s star power, in this case to pander to a younger demographic. It also underscored the American right\u2019s ongoing love affair with the UFC. Over the past few years, UFC has become synonymous with rightwing politics due to its well-documented relationship with former president Donald Trump. As previously reported by the Guardian, the organization effectively became the sports arm of the Maga regime and was an ideal platform for Trump to espouse his political agenda. UFC president Dana White was among Trump\u2019s most boisterous supporters, having campaigned for the former president as far back as 2016. White has since defended Trump\u2019s policies, produced a documentary on him Combatant-in-Chief, and even used his relationship with the former president to defy government mandates at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the 2020 presidential election, Trump deployed several UFC fighters as campaign surrogates, placing them in front of crowds at rallies in swing-states such as Florida in order to secure a key demographic that forms the majority of mixed martial arts\u2019 fanbase: young men. And though Trump lost the election, Republicans continued to flirt with the UFC in order to benefit from the organization\u2019s popularity. UFC fighters and executives have become regular guests on conservative shows such as those hosted by Sean Hannity and Candace Owens. Over the past few months, Owens has invited fighters like UFC lightweight Beneil Dariush to discuss the woes of communism while White was brought on to discuss the supposed importance of keeping politics out of sports. \u201cIt\u2019s America,\u201d White told Owens in April 2021 when asked about the UFC\u2019s supposed political apathy. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. And you shouldn\u2019t have to go to work and listen to that shit.\u201d While White\u2019s assertion is tenuous at best due to his own history with Trump, his comments endeared him to conservative audiences dissatisfied with the rise of social justice narratives in leagues such as the NFL and NBA. By taking saying the UFC does not support so-called \u201cwoke politics,\u201d White is essentially positioning the organization as a fitting alternative for the American right. This, in turn, has warmed conservative pundits and politicians to the organization, which they now view as a market for their ideology. Among the politicians who embraced the UFC over the past year is Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, who invited the organization to host UFC 261, a capacity-crowd event in Jacksonville, Florida, in April 2021. DeSantis, who is viewed as a contender for the Republican nomination in 2024, has been criticized for using his state\u2019s limited Covid restrictions to increase his political clout. Hosting a capacity-crowd UFC show during a particularly difficult period during the pandemic was a clear show of defiance. \u201cThis is going to be the first [indoor] full-throttle sports event since Covid hit anywhere in the United States and I think it\u2019s fitting,\u201d DeSantis said to a cheering crowd at the UFC 261 pre-fight press conference. \u201cWelcome to Florida. You guys aren\u2019t the only ones looking to come to this oasis of freedom.\u201d It is worth noting that UFC 261 was celebrated by the likes of Steve Bannon, as well as user wrote on a QAnon Telegram channel with more than 20,000 subscribers. \u201cWatch UFC.\u201d UFC fighters have also stepped into the political arena in recent months. In December 2021, lightweight contender Michael Chandler spoke at Turning Point USA\u2019s Americafest event alongside conspiracy-monger Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr, and alt-right personality Jack Posobiec. Chandler first made his political leanings clear when he questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election, tweeting at the time \u201cis Joe Biden really just taking the mic to talk about how \u2018patient\u2019 we have to be and how \u2018long\u2019 we are going to have to wait AKA we are going to contest these results\u2026hard #wakeupsheep.\u201d The fighter deleted the tweet shortly thereafter. Other UFC fighters such as Colby Covington, whom the Guardian described as the athletic embodiment of Trump\u2019s politics, continues to strengthen his ties to prominent conservatives such as Trump Jr and Owens. In fact, Owens revealed that it was Covington who helped her become a fan of the UFC and that she plans to attend his upcoming fight against fellow Trump loyalist Jorge Masvidal at UFC 272 next month. \u201cI will definitely be there [at UFC 272],\u201d Owens said on Full Send podcast. \u201c100% will be there. I love Colby.\u201d Owens previously called for the UFC to replace the NFL as America\u2019s national pastime, a term that was once reserved for baseball. \u201c[The UFC] is exploding right now and it\u2019s because they do not get involved in politics. They are not woke and they do not bend the knee,\u201d Owens said, adding that the UFC is the \u201conly real sport left.\u201d It is perhaps no surprise many on the right identify more with the UFC than the NFL. Although the league is currently being sued for racial discrimination in a high-profile lawsuit, it has at least paid lip service to social justice in recent years, particularly after the police murder of George Floyd. According to a recent survey, approximately one-third of those polled stated that they were less of a fan of the NFL now than they were five years ago. The poll found that those who did not approve of the NFL\u2019s current stance on social justice were disproportionately Republican, and that 45% of those who identified themselves as Republican believed the NFL was doing \u201ctoo much\u201d to show respect for Black players. Whether this disapproval is actually making a difference to the NFL\u2019s bottom line is debatable. Viewing figures for the 2021 regular season were up 7% on the year before, so some Republicans are clearly still tuning in. Nevertheless, since the NFL\u2019s policies no longer coincide with Republican ideals, the American right has since shifted much of its attention to the UFC, a hyper-masculine sport that is popular among young men. As Republicans forge ahead with shaping the GOP\u2019s post-Trump future, they will continue to rely on the UFC as an ideological incubator and a breeding ground for future supporters."

            "content": "Details about Donald Trump\u2019s new social media app \u201cTruth Social\u201d are trickling out as about 500 beta testers have begun using an early version of the platform. The former president announced his plans for the new social media platform in October, promising to rival the tech companies that banned him from their platforms after the Capitol insurrection. His new media and technology venture, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG), has pledged to deliver an \u201cengaging and censorship-free experience\u201d on the Truth Social app. TMTG remains shrouded in secrecy and is regarded with skepticism by many in tech and media circles. Comments from beta testers this week suggest the platform bears a striking resemblance to Twitter. Liz Willis, a correspondent and vice-president of operations at Right Side Broadcasting Network, told Reuters she received an email Tuesday stating that \u201cT Media Tech LLC has invited you to test Truth Social.\u201d Willis was able to download the app on her iPhone through the beta testing site TestFlight, the Apple-owned product that developers use prior to launching their apps in the App Store. Users have been posting on this version of Truth Social for the past 24 hours, Willis said Wednesday morning. Truth Social allows users to post and share a \u201ctruth\u201d the same way they would with a tweet. There are no ads, according to Willis and a second source familiar with TMTG. Users choose who they follow and the feed is a mix of individual posts and an RSS-like news feed. They will be alerted if someone mentions or begins following them. According to a screenshot, the app says that \u201cA new direct messaging experience will be available soon. Please stay tuned.\u201d By late Wednesday, Trump\u2019s account on Truth Social had 317 followers, according to a screenshot viewed by Reuters. Trump had 88 million followers before Twitter banned him. Trump\u2019s account shows one \u201ctruth\u201d posted three days ago, verified at the account of @realDonaldTrump with a red check and with the message: \u201cGet Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!\u201d Donald Trump Jr on Twitter highlighted his father\u2019s first post on Truth Social. Several conservative media personalities also have accounts, according to a screen shot reviewed by Reuters. Reuters could not immediately reach those individuals for comment. TMTG released an updated version, \u201cTruth Social 0.9\u201d, Wednesday morning. It is testing for bug fixes for \u201cre-truths\u201d, which is what it calls a retweet, \u201cimage aspect ratios and compression, improved error handling and account creation\u201d. On Wednesday morning, Devin Nunes, TMTG chief executive, who joined the app on 10 February, posted: \u201cGood morning Truth testers. Please screenshot any bugs when the screenshot preview comes up.\u201d If a tester sees anything that they don\u2019t like, they can screenshot it and report it to the developers. A message says: \u201cBeta feedback and device information is collected and shared with the developer and it will be linked to your email address.\u201d But much remains unclear about the app, including its launch date. Nunes told Reuters the app will launch by the end of March. When Trump announced the platform in October, a press release said the platform would be open to \u201cinvited users\u201d for a beta launch in November, with plans to make it available to the broader public in the beginning of 2022. There are also questions whether the app\u2019s goal of \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d can coexist with Apple and Google\u2019s app store policies. TMTG was not immediately available to comment. Trump sued Facebook, Twitter, and Google in July 2021 for allegedly censoring him. The companies have so far upheld their bans and suspensions on the former president."

The left guard, who is in the prime years of his career and was named to the Pro Bowl last season, confirmed the surprise decision on Instagram on Sunday. ESPN reported the decision was down to health concerns. \u201cAfter seven formidable years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, I\u2019ve come to the decision to retire from the game that has given me so much,\u201d Marpet wrote in his post. \u201cThis organization and the people surrounding it have helped not only fulfill a dream, but also helped build me into the person I am today. I\u2019ve made Tampa Bay my home and I look forward to serving this community in the coming years. To the coaches and teammates, family and friends, an Instagram post simply can\u2019t express the profound impact you\u2019ve had on me. I\u2019m eternally grateful. Thank you Tampa Bay.\u201d Marpet was due to make $20m in the final two seasons of his current contract. He has career earnings of $37m. Marpet took an unconventional path to the NFL. The son of a fashion videographer and a former rock star, he played for tiny Hobart College before becoming the highest-drafted player ever out of a Division III program when Tampa selected him with the 61st overall pick in 2015. However, he flourished in the NFL and according to ESPN Stats &amp; Information he had the ninth-best pass-block win rate among NFL guards from 2018 to 2021. \u201cI think he accomplished his goals, values his health, is looking for more challenges. Ali has a very strong inner voice, and he is courageous enough to follow it. I\u2019m in awe,\u201d Marpet\u2019s father, Bill, told ESPN on Sunday. Brady also paid tribute to Marpet, leaving a comment below his Instagram post. \u201cCongratulations, @AliMarpet you are a warrior,\u201d Brady posted. \u201cIt was an honor!!\u201d Marpet was active behind the scenes in the league, and served on the Bucs\u2019 social justice advisory board. Last summer he discussed voting rights with US vice-president Kamala Harris during the team\u2019s visit to the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough about what Ali has meant to our team over the three seasons since my arrival. He has been the consummate professional and has been a rock for us in the interior of our offensive line,\u201d Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said in a statement. \u201cWe will miss him on the field and in the locker room, but I am happy that he gets to go out as a Super Bowl champion and Pro Bowler. It is never easy saying goodbye to a player who has meant so much to our success, but I support and respect his decision and wish him a great life after football.\u201d"

At the beginning of that month, with Covid cases rising again, restrictions had been reintroduced that encouraged all residents to stay at home and limited groups to two people. Each group had to be 1.5 metres from one another. The shadows on the floor of the shopping centre created a natural grid for this social distancing. Au\u2019s photograph was part of a series that saw him shortlisted last week, from among 156,000 entrants, for this year\u2019s Sony World Photography awards in the architecture and design category.

He is drawn to environments, he says, \u201cthat can create a geometric context\u201d; the sunlit shopping centre matrix was perfect for his purposes, and the Covid regulations added to the formal symmetries.

            "date": "2022-02-06T10:00:22Z",
            "content": "During a visit to 1 Police Plaza, the headquarters of the NYPD in downtown Manhattan, Joe Biden asked officer Sumit Sulan to stand as he praised his bravery. Last month, the rookie officer shot and killed a man who mortally wounded two of his colleagues while responding to a domestic dispute in Harlem. The deaths of the two young officers, Jason Rivera, 22, and Wilbert Mora, 27, was one of several violent episodes that have shaken New York and tested its new mayor, former police captain Eric Adams. \u201cI admire the hell out of all of you,\u201d Biden, flanked by Adams and other elected officials, said to the rows of uniformed blue seated behind him. \u201cThe answer is not to defund the police,\u201d he continued to applause. \u201cIt\u2019s to give you the tools, the training, the funding to be partners, to be protectors.\u201d Later, the presidential motorcade crossed the East River to Queens, where Biden met with a violence intervention group and community leaders at Public School 111, in a classroom decorated for Black History Month. \u201cWe can\u2019t just talk about violence and not talk about students feeling safe in schools,\u201d K Bain, the founder and executive director of Community Capacity Development, a community violence intervention program, told the president. \u201cI agree,\u201d Biden interjected quietly, as Bain advocated for a community-based approach to reducing violence. The meetings at 1 Police Plaza and PS 111 underscored the complex public safety \u2013 and political \u2013 challenge confronting Democratic leaders from New York\u2019s city hall to the White House and many other places across the US. Amid rising crime, Democrats are under pressure to prove that they are aggressively confronting the issue, an increasingly salient concern among voters, without abandoning their promises of police reform and accountability in response to the repeated police killings of Black Americans and a history of racism in law enforcement. In New York, Biden sent dual messages. He forcefully asserted his support for law enforcement, loudly distancing himself from activist calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d, which emerged during the summer of racial justice protests after the killing of George Floyd and that Republicans are mercilessly using to try to brand the president and his party as unconcerned with public safety. But Biden also sought to convey that he was listening to \u2013 and even learning from \u2013 the communities of color most affected by the pandemic-era violence. \u201cWe all want safety, right?\u201d said Quentin James, the president of Collective Pac, an organization dedicated to electing African American candidates. \u201cSafety from criminals but also safety from police overreach. It\u2019s not either/or. It has to be both/and.\u201d Gun violence and homicides rose sharply in 2020 and 2021, with Black and Latino communities hit the hardest. Though the toll remains far lower than it was in the early 1990s, the jump from 2019 to 2020 represented the largest single-year spike in homicides in modern history, according to the CDC. \u201cThis is not a make-believe kind of thing,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a prominent New York-based Democratic consultant who was a police officer before working in politics. Public polling shows voters are deeply concerned about rising crime and unhappy with Biden\u2019s handling of the issue. A Fox Business poll from December found that 77% of voters, including 67% of Democrats, were concerned about higher crime rates across the country. The only issue more concerning to voters, according to the poll, was inflation. Yet, in a sign of the complexity of the issue, the same poll found that despite voters\u2019 growing concern over the issue, less than half said they feared criminal activity \u201cin their neighborhood\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the sense that things are out of control,\u201d Sheinkopf said. \u201cAnd Democrats tend to lose elections when things appear to be out of control.\u201d Republicans believe the issue will be a powerful motivator for their base in November, especially against a Democratic party divided over its response to the problem. And there are signs the Republican effort to paint American cities as lawless under Democratic control, amplified by a conservative media echo chamber, are resonating. According to Gallup\u2019s annual \u201cmood of the nation\u201d survey, just 24% of Americans were satisfied with efforts to \u201creduce or control crime\u201d, the lowest it\u2019s been. Frank Luntz, a prominent Republican pollster, said the issue was a top priority for voters in his focus groups, many of whom have grown disillusioned with political leadership on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the spike in criminality that impacts people,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s the perception that anyone, anywhere could themselves become a victim. It\u2019s also the belief among many that the police are being handcuffed by the politicians into doing nothing.\u201d The White House has pushed back on rightwing accusations that it has been unresponsive to the issue, pointing to the crime-fighting agenda Biden released last summer. \u201cI think we all agree or should agree that violent crime is a serious problem,\u201d the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said, noting the uptick began in 2020, under the previous administration. \u201cWe\u2019re about the facts here, and addressing crime is something that is a root of the president\u2019s agenda.\u201d From Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d to Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d, Republicans have a long history of using the threat of crime to stoke fear among white voters, said Michael Tesler, a political scientist at the University of California at Irvine who has written extensively about the partisan divisions over race and identity. \u201cThe Republican party and their base are increasingly animated by white grievance issues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see this in their playbook on critical race theory, the strong push against Biden\u2019s immigration policies and also on crime.\u201d The politics of violent crime are complex, said James. But he said the debate too often ignores the voices and the needs of the people in the communities that are the most affected. \u201cCrime is always of concern with Black voters,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re hearing about it now because it\u2019s happening in places that people thought were safer.\u201d Experts who study violence point to several possible drivers, among them the economic hardship and social instability caused by the pandemic, which fell hardest on impoverished communities and led to fewer criminal trials, school closures and after-school programs, and reduced access to mental health services and drug treatment. Another possible contributing factor is the surge of firearm purchases and the rise of \u201cghost guns\u201d \u2013 firearms assembled from parts bought online that lack serial numbers needed to trace them. DeVone Boggan, the founder of Advance Peace, a community violence intervention program, said the pandemic \u201cexposed just how disconnected those communities\u201d are from the services they need to address systemic health and economic disparities. But it\u2019s also proved how successful meaningful investment in violence prevention programs can be. In Richmond, California, where Advance Peace was first developed, gun homicide rates dropped by nearly 70% over the past decade. In 2020, the Bay Area city saw only a modest increase in homicides, with 22 people killed that year compared with 17 the year before. \u201cThat tells us that when we make long-term commitments to non-law-enforcement-based strategies, and we make requisite funding commitments long-term \u2026 that work can support reductions in gunfire even when you see things like a pandemic,\u201d said Boggan, who made this point directly to Biden during a meeting at the White House on gun crime prevention in June. During his visit to New York, Biden emphasized his administration\u2019s efforts to reduce violent crime by cracking down on illegal gun sales and encouraging state and local governments to use the pandemic relief aid to \u201cput more cops on the beat\u201d. Biden has also called on Congress to approve his budget proposal, which includes $300m in federal grants for police departments and $200m for community violence prevention programs, and to pass gun safety legislation, like universal background checks. Yet the approach also highlights the limits of what Biden can do without action in Congress and buy-in from local governments. A bipartisan attempt to overhaul policing tactics and accountability collapsed last year. A proposal to invest $5bn in community violence intervention initiatives is tied up in the stalled negotiations over the president\u2019s Build Back Better agenda \u2013 derailed by Republican intransigence and conservative Democrats. The focus on crime also brings Biden to the forefront of an issue that has proved difficult for him over the course of his long tenure in elected office. As a senator, Biden helped write several major pieces of anti-crime legislation, including a 1994 omnibus bill that academics and many elected officials in both parties now say paved the way for an era of mass incarceration of Black Americans. During the 2020 presidential primary, Biden was pushed to disavow some elements of the bill he helped write. And as president, he has taken steps to further undo the legacy of the law, such as endorsing a bill that would end the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. Now he finds himself caught between an aggressive Republican campaign to paint him as soft on crime and a progressive flank demanding he live up to his promises of criminal justice reform. Many Democrats see Adams as a model. Adams, the city\u2019s second Black mayor and a moderate who joined the NYPD after being beaten by officers when he was 15, placed public safety as the center of his campaign, portraying himself as a bridge between liberal activists and law enforcement. Sheinkopf said the mayor\u2019s credibility with law enforcement and his support among voters of color helps deflect Republican accusations that the party is anti-police as well as progressive criticism of a tougher approach. \u201cAll he\u2019s got to do is cling to Adams and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to follow what Eric Adams does because he\u2019s an expert,\u2019\u201d Sheinkopf said. The interplay was on display in New York, where Adams, referring to himself as the \u201cBiden of Brooklyn\u201d, praised the president as he called for a \u201c9/11-type response\u201d to the \u201cdomestic terror that is pervasive in this city and country\u201d. \u201cMayor Adams, you and I agree,\u201d Biden said at the NYPD headquarters. The alliance worries progressives who hear echoes of the punitive \u201claw and order\u201d approach Democrats embraced in the 1990s. Aspects of Adam\u2019s \u201cblueprint\u201d to reduce gun violence \u2013 welcomed by Democrats who believe the problem has become a political liability for the party \u2013 sparked backlash from progressives, such as a proposal to resurrect a version of the plainclothes anti-crime units that were disbanded in 2020. Police reform advocate Robert Gangi called the plan \u201cold wine in a new bottle\u201d that relied \u201cmainly on punitive law enforcement tactics\u201d. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, told the New York Times that she was concerned Democrats were reverting to a \u201cjails-and-police-centered policy\u201d that doesn\u2019t address the root causes of crime. Boggan, too, worries about this. \u201cIf we go down this road, this road that we\u2019ve already been down,\u201d he warned, \u201cwe will dramatically and in devastating fashion cost the communities most impacted by gun violence the opportunity for real public safety.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-15T08:00:07Z",
            "content": "In 1998, Sir Paul Condon, the then Metropolitan police commissioner, wrote a letter to the Macpherson inquiry into the response to the murder of Stephen Lawrence. \u201cRacism in the police is much more than \u2018bad apples\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe debate about defining this evil \u2026 is cathartic in leading us to recognise that it can occur almost unknowingly, as a matter of neglect, in an institution. I acknowledge the danger of institutionalisation of racism. However, labels can cause more problems than they solve.\u201d In one sense, Condon\u2019s words were insightful \u2013 his rejection of the \u201cbad apple\u201d argument strikes a contrast with Cressida Dick\u2019s words about her own officers years later. But the fact that Dick would eventually be forced to resign amid a similarly fractious debate about problems of culture and institutional behaviour within the Met shows just how much work there is still to be done. Dick was internally popular, but ultimately failed to convince Sadiq Khan that she would address the Met\u2019s problems with the urgency and on the scale that was required \u2013 particularly in light of the recent Charing Cross report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. That contained shocking details of police officers sharing racist and misogynistic messages with each other. But the sad truth is that it also revealed nothing new. It was released after a period of consultation with the Met and related to investigations that were several years old. In April 2021, the director general of the IOPC had cause to write to the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council raising a concern that they were seeing cases that \u201cmay be indicative of broader cultural issues within some police forces\u201d. The letter referred to a number of cases in which officers shared inappropriate images or content on social media that was \u201cracist, misogynistic or homophobic\u201d. It drew the NPCC\u2019s attention to the fact that often the cases would start by \u201clooking at the conduct of one officer but were then broadened to include the actions of others because inappropriate content was shared widely\u201d. A corresponding statement was placed on the IOPC\u2019s website, listing examples of cases the regulator had seen since replacing the IPCC in 2018. This referred to cases in the Met, south Wales, Cheshire, Warwickshire and Kent. The highlighted Met case dated back to December 2020 and dealt with several officers receiving \u201cfinal written warnings for gross misconduct after sharing text messages which contained offensive references to people with disabilities and jokes about rape, paedophilia, racism, and homophobia.\u201d There was very little press coverage of that letter and statement. The NPCC responded with a general commitment to \u201cactively [work] with the IOPC to put further guidance and safeguards in place\u201d around use of social media and messaging. There was no public outcry, and no push for the highlighted forces to respond with substantive measures they would take to deal with those problems. Yet those cases identified the same poisonous culture that allowed Wayne Couzens to continue to serve as a police officer despite co-workers nicknaming him \u201cthe rapist\u201d due to his outrageous behaviour; and that allowed two police officers not only to take photographs of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman\u2019s bodies, but also to share them with impunity in WhatsApp groups with colleagues. Dick\u2019s resignation has symbolic significance. The Met is England and Wales\u2019 largest police force and it serves the most diverse population in Britain. Not only does it have regional responsibility, it holds national portfolios and heads counter-terrorism. The direction of policing in the Met can have a huge impact on national policing. However, substantive transformation requires more than a change at the top. It needs commitment from all levels of officers; scrutiny from the press; public engagement and demand for change; and the mandate from the Home Office. So far, frankly, those elements have not come together for a long enough period to apply the required pressure. This is despite the fact that trust and confidence among certain groups is extremely low. In December 2021, a YouGov survey found that more than half of Britons from minority ethnic backgrounds no longer trust the police; in October 2021, YouGov found that 47% of women and 40% of men said trust in police had decreased since the murder of Sarah Everard. Instilling confidence entails a willingness to call cultural and institutional problems exactly what they are and then doing something radical about it. This doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that many officers are in the job for positive reasons, or that some progress has been made in these areas. Engaging with criticism of an institution does not undermine it, it legitimises it and keeps it relevant. It shows a willingness to be held accountable. Since last August, I\u2019ve been in post as chair of the independent scrutiny and oversight board for the police\u2019s action plan on inclusion and race. My role is to hold all 43 police chiefs across England and Wales accountable while they, with the College of Policing, develop and implement an action plan to create an \u201canti-racist police service\u201d \u2013 their words. The plan focuses in particular on the experiences of Black communities with the police. By committing to it, each police chief accepts the need to deal with these problems. That acceptance reflects an acknowldgement that racial disparities are present in most areas of policing, and that conscious steps need to be taken to deal with them. The initiative was announced in June 2020; however, we\u2019re now in February 2022 and discussions about institutional racism remain ongoing. I hope that this resignation, and the clear gauntlet that has been thrown down by the mayor of London, will provide the next Met chief with the mandate to push for reform internally, while externally acknowledging the extent of the issue. It shows that the elected officials really do have the power to hold police chiefs to account. I hope that other chiefs will be galvanised and inspired to undertake the charge \u2013 some of them already have. Dick\u2019s resignation marks an opportunity for us, the public, and the media to make sure police reform stays at the top of the agenda.

Am I unduly pessimistic in thinking we have very little choice? The norms of our society are set primarily by huge international technology companies and their relationship with advertising and social discourse. Our politics is conducted under systems and conventions that are no longer fit for purpose, where the House of Lords seems more representative of democracy and justice than either the Commons or the government. Not even supporters of Brexit can have chosen to bring the country to its present sorry state. And there is nothing we (the people) can do, until the powers allow us another vote. Yes, the monarchy needs changing (or for some, abolishing), but the whole structure is in desperate need of reform. The status of the monarchy, the power and structure of the executive, the powers of legislation and scrutiny of parliament, the methods of election and appointment, justice and accountability \u2013 all these and no doubt other matters need to be examined publicly and forensically in citizens\u2019 assemblies. Then \u201cwe\u201d can choose, and it is to be hoped that our political establishment will listen and put through parliament the bulk of our wishes, regardless of the vested interests against them. Hugh Legge Northampton \u2022 It is unfortunate that Simon Jenkins (Whisper it, but the time is right for the Queen to abdicate, 14 February) does not stay with his thought that the head of state being chosen by birth and religion is inherently absurd. It is also inherently undemocratic. Tom Nairn, in his work The Enchanted Glass, proposes that the \u201cconstitutional monarchy\u201d is \u201cboth the apex and essence of the British state, the symbol of its backwardness\u201d. It is simply not the case that the monarchy\u2019s role is powerless and \u201cemphatically detached from political partisanship\u201d. The powers are real, even if not usually exercised. The recent revelations of the process of Queen\u2019s consent further undermine the notion of being free from partisanship and independent of the political process. The removal of the crown from the constitution and an elected second house are minimum requirements for a modern and mature democracy. Nigel Florence Mevagissey, Cornwall \u2022 It is refreshing to see Polly Toynbee argue clearly for the end of our feudal and anachronistic monarchy (Clearly Britain loses more than it gains from the monarchy. Let us be brave and end it, 17 February). The Queen is rightly admired for her lifelong service, even by many of us who advocate for a republican Britain. This is the time to do it with minimum fuss and rancour, almost a celebration of Her Majesty as Polly shrewdly recommends, before moving on to becoming a modern European state. There is no guarantee that the Queen\u2019s successors will be like her. Electing our head of state would allow all the safeguards that Polly mentions to come into effect. Most importantly, it will pull the rug away from class-based entitlement that has bred a nation of inequality. And let\u2019s have some meaningful honours \u2013 drop the \u201cempire\u201d as if it were alive and well, and something that citizens who serve their country and society should be made \u201cmembers\u201d of. Christopher Tanner Llandovery, Carmarthenshire \u2022 Polly Toynbee is right. The future of the monarchy is worthy of a full-blown inquiry. It will take time to reach its conclusions, but who seriously thinks that hereditary peers is a feature we should be happy with in the 21st century, and will there ever be a more suitable monarch to be the last? It is time to start the process. Andrew Dean Exeter \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication."

Sir Michael Barber, the chair of the Strategic Review of Policing in England and Wales, will say that a \u201cBetamax police force\u201d is unsuccessfully pursuing \u201cblockchain-enabled criminals\u201d as he urges modernisation of crime-fighting technology and new training for officers. His intervention comes just weeks before the publication of the findings of his review, which is expected to make more than 50 recommendations for the future of forces in England and Wales. It also follows the resignation of the UK\u2019s most senior police officer, Cressida Dick, as head of the Met after multiple allegations of misogyny and racism among the UK\u2019s largest force. In front of an audience of senior figures from police forces, criminal justice bodies and government officials at the Centre for Policy Studies webinar, Barber will say: \u201cThere is a clear crisis of confidence in policing in England and Wales. This is not just the result of recent high-profile issues but is far more fundamental. \u201cHuge societal, technological and environmental changes are happening at warp speed yet too often policing seems stuck in the past, hardly fit for the present yet alone the future.\u201d In comments which will question police cuts under recent governments, Barber will say that the blue line is stretched \u201ctoo thin\u201d and is focused on dealing with social issues instead of fighting and preventing crime. \u201cIt is encouraging that more police are now being recruited but there is a long way to go. Too often our police are effectively a social service dealing more with mental health and family breakdown than a crime-fighting or crime-prevention service. We need more police and they need a laser focus on the crime challenges of today,\u201d he will say. \u201cIn the digital age, where the dark web is often the new crime frontline, it can feel like a contest between a Betamax police force and blockchain enabled criminals. As an illustration, we have a National Police Computer that is nearly 50 years old and is an emblem of the past rather than a cutting-edge tool of the present.\u201d In a nod to the recent revelations of racist, sexist and homophobic comments made by officers at Charing Cross station, he will say: \u201cTaken together with some deep-rooted issues around professional development, training and leadership, the challenges for our police are great and growing. \u201cIn two weeks we will publish our report, which will make 54 recommendations for change, and I hope it will mark a fundamental turning point in the modernisation of a public service that matters deeply to us all. Barber, who served as the chief adviser on delivery during Tony Blair\u2019s second term as prime minister, will be joined by policing minister Kit Malthouse and Surrey police and crime commissioner Lisa Townsend for the discussion. Malthouse is expected to say: \u201cWe know that crime is changing and that the future will present new challenges to policing. \u201cI thank Sir Michael for his work and I look forward to looking at this report and the recommendations once released to make sure we take the right action to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-10T07:00:14Z",
            "content": "Northern Ireland\u2019s first legally binding climate act faces a race against time to get passed before the devolved institutions at Stormont are dissolved in the coming weeks. The second of two climate change bills \u2013 introduced by the agriculture minister, Edwin Poots \u2013 has moved through consideration stage, with a batch of new amendments prompting more than 25 hours of assembly debate. But its passage into law is threatened by a congested legislative timetable in the time before Stormont\u2019s dissolution next month to allow for elections. After Paul Givan\u2019s resignation as first minister last week, deputy first minister Michelle O\u2019Neill said the climate bill was among high-priority pieces of legislation that parties would hope to fast-track before the approaching deadline. New features to the bill will see the legislation introduce a 2050 net zero target for Northern Ireland, along with an independent Climate Change Commissioner\u2019s office. Other amendments added to the bill will include a \u201cjust transition\u201d fund aimed at supporting agriculture, statutory carbon budgets, targets for biodiversity and soil quality. There will also be a commitment that 10% of future transport budgets will go towards active travel. Northern Ireland is the only jurisdiction in the UK and Ireland at present without dedicated climate legislation. The country\u2019s low public transport spend (27% per head compared with the UK average) and declining biodiversity levels, among other considerations, have emboldened calls for a promised climate act. The Green party NI leader, Clare Bailey, who tabled a first climate bill in 2020, told assembly members this week: \u201cA majority of MLAs have made it clear that they support robust and ambitious climate legislation for Northern Ireland. We will have a net zero Climate Change Act for Northern Ireland, in whatever form it takes, because people want it, and the climate emergency demands it. \u201cIt was not so long ago that climate denial was rife in Stormont. I never thought we would see the day where we had such consensus across the political spectrum that action on climate change was urgent and necessary. \u201cThe voice of the people has been heard. The will of the assembly has been recorded. I hope that the minister will respect democracy. It\u2019s time for a Climate Change Act for Northern Ireland.\u201d An amendment proposing greater monitoring of Northern Ireland\u2019s nitrogen levels was voted down last week and another proposed amendment seeking an outright ban on fracking was excluded from the consideration stage debate. A separate fracking bill, which follows a 2020 moratorium on petroleum licensing and drilling, is making its way through the assembly. About two weeks are expected for any final amendments to be made to the climate change legislation, before the bill progresses to a final-stage vote and can then become law. Civil society groups and campaigners who had previously criticised the bill\u2019s lack of ambition have welcomed the new additions to the legislation. Daith\u00ed McKay, from the Climate Coalition Northern Ireland group, said the bill in its amended form \u201crepresents a progressive way forward to net zero\u201d. He added: \u201cThe public expects the assembly to deliver and we now need a clear timetable from the minister setting out when he plans to complete the passing of the climate change act.\u201d Friends of the Earth NI director James Orr said: \u201cIf the amended bill passes, Northern Ireland will be in a position to hold its head high with the right climate action alongside the rest of the UK and the ROI and will no longer be the only place on these islands without climate legislation. \u201cWe must ensure that these amendments are refined and developed to form a collective climate change act that is greater than the sum of its parts \u2013 one which truly reflects the gravity of the climate crisis and what needs to be done.\u201d Poots, a strong advocate for Northern Ireland\u2019s agrifood industry, said that implementing a 2050 net zero target would have \u201cprofound and irreversible consequences\u201d for the sector. He has also suggested he would seek to \u201cexempt\u201d farmers from some of the bill\u2019s requirements. He said: \u201cI am disappointed that the assembly have agreed an amendment to my climate change bill to set a 2050 net zero target. \u201cTo push to net zero within that timeframe will have profound and irreversible consequences for our agri-food sector and our economy. \u201cI will now consider my next steps and aim to find a way forward that minimises the impacts on our agri-food sector and maximises the benefits for the climate change agenda. The approach and actions have to balance climate change, the economy and the wider environment.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-28T12:08:48Z",
            "content": "What is the IPCC? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is made up of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, charged with publishing regular comprehensive updates of global knowledge on the climate crisis, intended to inform government policymaking. Each \u201cassessment report\u201d takes about five to seven years to complete, involving hundreds of scientists reviewing the work of thousands more experts. The current report \u2013 being published in four parts, from August 2021 to October 2022 \u2013 is the sixth since the body was set up in 1988. What are the four parts? The three working groups that make up the IPCC each publish their own reports. The first looks at the physical basis of climate science \u2013 that is, how the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere are changing and are likely to change in future, and whether human influence is responsible. The second \u2013 the group producing the latest report \u2013 assesses the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather, droughts, floods and temperature rises, and how humanity can adapt to these. The third group looks at ways of cutting emissions, and the fourth report is a synthesis, to be published in October, ahead of the Cop27 UN climate summit, to be held in Egypt in November. What does the report say? The warnings make for grim reading. 3.5 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate impacts and half the world\u2019s population suffers severe water shortages at some point each year. One in three people are exposed to deadly heat stress, and this is projected to increase to 50% to 75% by the end of the century. Half a million more people are at risk of serious flooding every year, and a billion living on coasts will be exposed by 2050. Rising temperatures and rainfall are increasing the spread of diseases in people, such as dengue fever, and in crops, livestock and wildlife. Even if the world keeps heating below 1.6C by 2100 \u2013 and we are already at 1.1C \u2013 then 8% of today\u2019s farmland will become climatically unsuitable, just after the global population has peaked above 9 billion. Severe stunting could affect 1 million children in Africa alone. If global heating continues and little adaptation is put in place, 183 million more people are projected to go hungry by 2050. The ability to produce food relies on the water, soils and pollination provided by a healthy natural world, and the report said protection of wild places and wildlife is fundamental to coping with the climate crisis. But animals and plants are being exposed to climatic conditions not experienced for tens of thousands of years. Half of the studied species have already been forced to move and many face extinction. Maintaining the resilience of nature at a global scale depends on the conservation of 30% to 50% of Earth\u2019s land, freshwater and oceans, the IPCC report said. Today, less than 15% of land, 21% of freshwater and 8% of oceans are protected areas, and some regions, like the Amazon, have switched from storing carbon to emitting it. What role do governments play? IPCC reports run to thousands of pages, incorporating data from years of research. But the key document that emerges at the end of the process is a distillation of all this knowledge known as the summary for policymakers, which contains the key messages. It is pored over line by line by the lead scientific authors but also by representatives from governments, a process open to all states who want to contribute. Critics say this process waters down key messages; defenders say the scientists take a robust line and few significant changes are made. Will governments try to water down this report? This second part of the report is likely to be the most politically sensitive, because it deals with the probable real world impact of the climate crisis, including issues such as the potential for food shortages. One of the most contentious issues is over how the world adapts to the climate crisis and the question of \u201closs and damage\u201d \u2013 the impacts of the climate crisis that are too great for countries to adapt to. This issue has dogged the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate negotiations for more than a decade, and at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year many countries were disappointed that rich nations failed to agree a programme to issue funding to poor countries for the loss and damage they sustain. Concerns have already been raised by some campaigners that \u201closs and damage\u201d has been changed to \u201closses and damages\u201d, but analysts say this change is minor and does not change the substance of the findings. The substantive issue will be what the report says about adaptation and the global need to adapt to extreme weather that, as the first IPCC working group found in August, is becoming inevitable."

            "date": "2022-02-11T08:19:23Z",
            "content": "Perth festival is facing calls to drop the orchestral production Become Ocean from this year\u2019s program over a sponsorship arrangement with fossil fuel company Woodside Energy. The production, scheduled for Saturday 5 March, is a performance of John Luther Adams\u2019 Pulitzer prize-winning work \u2013 originally written as a reflection about oceanic changes brought on by global heating \u2013 by the Western Australian Youth Orchestra (WAYO) and the West Australian Symphony Orchestra (WASO), in a partnership between the orchestras sponsored by Woodside. Fossil Free Arts WA have called for the production to be dropped from the festival lineup over concerns that Woodside\u2019s sponsorship amounts to \u201carts-washing\u201d. Steven Alyian and Madeleine Antoine, both members of Selfless Orchestra and spokespeople for Fossil Free Arts, said they wanted Perth festival to \u201ctake a stand\u201d where WAYO and WASO had not. \u201cAs Australian artists and musicians, a lot of us want to see the end of greenwashing and the exploitation of artists for corporate interests,\u201d Alyian said. \u201cThis is quite a blatant attempt at arts-washing.\u201d Antoine said that as an important training ground for future generations of musicians, WAYO had an obligation to find alternative sponsorship arrangements. Greenpeace chief executive, David Ritter, said the organisation wanted the sponsorship arrangement with Woodside to end as it was \u201cdamaging the festival\u2019s reputation by cynically sponsoring, of all things, an event celebrating the ocean\u201d. \u201cGas is a fossil fuel that is driving dangerous climate change, which is the greatest threat to our oceans \u2013 so for Woodside to be sponsoring this event is grotesque corporate hypocrisy,\u201d Ritter said. In a piece for the Guardian in 2018, Adams, the piece\u2019s composer, wrote about the inspiration behind Become Ocean. \u201cAs the polar ice melts and sea levels rise, we humans find ourselves facing the prospect that once again we may literally become ocean \u2026 There is no time to waste. I want my art to matter in the deepest possible way.\u201d Amber Fresh, a member of Perth band Rabbit Island, is playing the festival\u2019s Aesoteric event on 25 February. She also called for WASO to drop Woodside as sponsor. \u201cIf these companies give up fossil fuels, I\u2019ll be happy to take their money. With pleasure,\u201d Fresh said. \u201cI want to be writing love songs, not worrying whether the kids who come after me will have fresh water.\u201d \u201c[Fossil fuel companies] shouldn\u2019t be asked \u2018to sponsor\u2019 and they shouldn\u2019t offer. Linking yourself with beautiful things like the arts is a way to pretend what\u2019s happening is not outrageous.\u201d Other artists calling for the funding arrangement to be dropped include Fringe World performer Noemie Huttner-Koros, Kuruma Marthedunera woman and Murujuga traditional owner Josie Alec, and Nick Allbrook, lead singer of the band Pond, which allowed their opening night performance on Friday to be interrupted by activists to speak about climate change. It is understood the sponsorship arrangement with Woodside was arranged by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra (WASO). Fossil Free Arts WA had attempted to meet with WASO about the arrangement, but said their approach was refused. Woodside is currently working to develop the $16bn Scarborough gas project off WA\u2019s coast that has been described as a \u201cbet against\u201d efforts to control the worst effects of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels such as gas are a key driver of global heating. Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021. WAYO was contacted for comment but did not respond by deadline. WASO said it \u201cwill not be providing comment at this time\u201d. Woodside sponsors a large number of arts and sporting organisations, some of which have also faced opposition, such as Surf Life Saving WA\u2019s Nippers program. The company has been a longtime WASO sponsor, with Woodside\u2019s chief executive, Meg O\u2019Neill also serving on the orchestra\u2019s board. Woodside has also been the \u201cprincipal partner\u201d of the Western Australian Youth Orchestra since 1991, with naming rights to some of its programs. The orchestra has regularly played Woodside events, including the company\u2019s annual general meetings. A spokesperson for Woodside said its 2021 partnership deal had \u201cconnected WAYO with the [WASO]\u201d and was \u201chelping develop our local talent, creating pathways for the next generation of gifted musicians\u201d. \u201cThrough the partnership, WAYO musicians are provided with unique opportunities to learn from Western Australia\u2019s professional state orchestra,\u201d they said. Perth festival itself receives considerable funding from fossil fuel companies. An ongoing arrangement with US oil giant Chevron is among several that have drawn controversy in recent years. Nathan Bennett, Perth festival executive director, said its corporate sponsors \u201callow us to bring meaningful cultural experiences to hundreds of thousands of people in Western Australia\u201d and bring in acts that \u201cotherwise would not happen\u201d. \u201cBecome Ocean is a major work involving two orchestras at the heart of our musical culture in WA. Perth festival is proud to showcase and support local companies in our 2022 program,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe receive support from a wide range of partners \u2013 including corporate sponsors, government supporters and philanthropists \u2013 that represent the scope of the Western Australian business sector.\u201d Lucy Manne, CEO of 350.org, described Woodside\u2019s sponsorship of Become Ocean as \u201cfarcical\u201d as it was \u201cvery similar to what we have seen with cigarette companies and big tobacco\u201d. \u201cWhen you have a business model based on causing harm, you spend a lot of time and effort to improve your image,\u201d Manne said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely farcical for an arts event about the ocean to be sponsored by Woodside, as it is a company that is damaging marine environments and fuelling dangerous climate change.\u201d According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burning of fossil fuels by humanity contributes to warming oceans, acidification, oxygen depletion and the frequency of marine heatwaves. Manne said arts organisations should be free to refuse fossil fuel sponsorship and follow the example of organisations like the Australian Open, which appeared to have abandoned a multi-year partnership with Santos last year. Though Perth\u2019s fringe arts festival Fringe World appeared to have divested itself from Woodside last year, it instead transitioned the sponsorship to its parent company, Artrage. Woodside is also a sponsor of Perth theatre companies Barking Gecko and Yirra Yaakin. Arts companies elsewhere have been divesting themselves of fossil fuel sponsorship, including the Royal Shakespeare Company and Edinburgh festival, which ended a 34-year relationship with BP in 2016."

            "content": "Rising global temperatures have shifted at least twice the amount of freshwater from warm regions towards the Earth\u2019s poles than previously thought as the water cycle intensifies, according to new analysis. Climate change has intensified the global water cycle by up to 7.4% \u2013 compared with previous modelling estimates of 2% to 4%, research published in the journal Nature suggests. The water cycle describes the movement of water on Earth \u2013 it evaporates, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses into rain or snow and falls again to the surface. \u201cWhen we learn about the water cycle, traditionally we think of it as some unchanging process which is constantly filling and refilling our dams, our lakes, and our water sources,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Dr Taimoor Sohail of the University of New South Wales, said. But scientists have long known that rising global temperatures are intensifying the global water cycle, with dry subtropical regions likely to get drier as freshwater moves towards wet regions. Last August, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s sixth assessment report concluded that climate change will cause long-term changes to the water cycle, resulting in stronger and more frequent droughts and extreme rainfall events. Sohail said the volume of extra freshwater that had already been pushed to the poles as a result of an intensifying water cycle was far greater than previous climate models suggest. \u201cThose dire predictions that were laid out in the IPCC will potentially be even more intense,\u201d he said. The scientists estimate the volume of extra freshwater that shifted from warmer regions between 1970 and 2014 is between 46,000 and 77,000 cubic kms. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing higher water cycle intensification than we were expecting, and that means we need to move even more quickly towards a path of net zero emissions.\u201d The team used ocean salinity as a proxy for rainfall in their research. \u201cThe ocean is actually more salty in some places and less salty in other places,\u201d Sohail said. \u201cWhere rain falls on the ocean, it tends to dilute the water so it becomes less saline \u2026 Where there is net evaporation, you end up getting salt left behind.\u201d The researchers had to account for the mixing of water due to ocean currents. \u201cWe developed a new method that basically tracks \u2026 how the ocean is moving around with reference to this freshening or salinification,\u201d Sohail said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a rain gauge that\u2019s in constant motion.\u201d Dr Richard Matear, a chief research scientist in the CSIRO Climate Science Centre, who was not involved in the research, said the study suggested existing climate modelling has underestimated the potential impacts of climate change on the water cycle. \u201cThere\u2019s been a dramatic uplift in our ability to monitor the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cObservational datasets [like those used in the study] are really ripe for revisiting how global warming is changing the climate system, and the implications it might have on important things like the hydrological cycle.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-02-17T07:30:29Z",
            "content": "In June 1802, the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt ascended the inactive volcano Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. As he climbed from tropical rainforest towards the snow-covered peak almost 21,000ft above sea level, he acquired a new vision of nature, interwoven with \u201ca thousand threads\u201d. It was like taking a journey from the equator to the poles: an entire world of diversity collapsed on to this single mountain, a \u201cmicrocosm on one page\u201d. Here Humboldt began to develop the notion he called Naturgem\u00e4lde, a scarcely translatable word that implies a unity or wholeness in nature. Humboldt is often credited with the idea of an ecosystem as a web of interdependent living species, each playing a part in supporting the whole. But as conservation biologist Thor Hanson says in Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid, Chimborazo also opened the intrepid German naturalist\u2019s eyes to another profound realisation: climate, not mere geographical location, \u201cdictated what grew where, and similar vegetation should occur in any place where temperature, humidity and other conditions were the same, regardless of geography\u201d. The corollary \u2013 when climate changes, ecosystems must change too \u2013 is the topic of Hanson\u2019s book. The simplest outcome is a shifting of boundaries separating different climatic zones: as temperatures rise, temperate flora and fauna will move poleward. If that were all there was to it, climate change would rearrange but not otherwise perturb the mosaic of life that Humboldt identified. But it isn\u2019t so straightforward. The responses of the natural world to the changes that human activities have induced in our climate range from the alarming, such as species extinctions, to the creative. The natural world is resilient, but to different degrees in different places and among different organisms. What\u2019s more, timescales matter: adaptations feasible over the slow climate shifts that have happened naturally in the distant past might not be managed in the face of today\u2019s rapid warming. Nature is doing what it can, but it is confused and often imperilled. It\u2019s a somewhat guilty pleasure, then, to revel in Hanson\u2019s globetrotting exploits, some of them conducted under the constraints of the pandemic. We are taken from the rainforests of Costa Rica to the Arctic ice of Franz Josef Land and the coral reefs of Indonesia. The range of species he investigates and the climate responses they exhibit are sometimes dizzying, but some general features emerge. When confronted with a climate shift \u2013 warmer ocean or air temperatures, say, or altered patterns of rainfall or melting ice \u2013 organisms have several options. They can migrate to where the original conditions still prevail, or they can try to adapt their behaviour to the new. In some cases they can evolve: Darwinian natural selection is often imagined to happen slowly over millennia, but it can take place much more quickly (as the coronavirus reminds us). As they decimate populations, sudden and extreme changes in climate are a brutally selective filter. The \u201churricane lizards\u201d of the title are those individuals in a species of Caribbean lizard whose stronger grip, thanks to larger toe pads, allowed them to survive more frequent hurricanes by clinging to trees and shrubs. Another option is that organisms find niches in their existing habitat where the original conditions persist: so-called refugia, such as slopes sheltered from the sun. Whether this is a viable long-term solution is not clear \u2013 but it has so far sustained populations of rabbit-like American pikas in the western Rockies, which find their preferred cooler conditions preserved in the cold air that gathers over scree slopes, even while the snowpack elsewhere retreats. But amid these diverse strategies, the ecosystem as a whole may still be disrupted. It\u2019s no good one species adapting to stay put if its main food source has migrated elsewhere. And as climate change moves the boundaries of the seasons, the delicate interlocking of growth patterns may be thrown out of kilter. \u201cTiming is everything in ecosystems,\u201d Hanson writes. \u201cIf plants at the foot of trees have not finished their bloom and growth before the trees overhead come into leaf and block much of the sunlight, they\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Hanson supplies abundant reason to marvel at nature\u2019s ingenuity, but also to fear for it in the face of the drastic changes we are generating. He reminds us that our own responses, as we try to adjust to wildfires, heatwaves and sea level rise, are a part of that story too. \u201cIt\u2019s now a running joke that every biologist in the world is studying the effects of climate change,\u201d he writes. \u201cSome of them just don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d It\u2019s a good joke, but nothing to laugh about. \u2022 Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid is published by Icon (\u00a320).

            "date": "2022-02-03T07:00:46Z",
            "content": "The government is failing to cut greenhouse gas emissions from heating the UK\u2019s homes, an influential committee of MPs has warned, with little sign of a clear plan for ending reliance on increasingly expensive gas. Home heating is responsible for about 14% of the UK\u2019s carbon emissions, and must be tackled urgently if the government is to meet its carbon reduction targets. Last year, ministers announced a heat and buildings strategy, with the intention of weaning the UK away from gas \u2013 which makes up about 80% of domestic heating \u2013 and on to lower carbon alternatives, such as heat pumps. But the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) select committee found that the strategy did not set out how the changes would be achieved, that government \u201clacked clear direction\u201d on the issue, and that current policies were inadequate to the scale of the problem. The warning comes amid soaring gas prices around the world, which are also likely to result in a sharp rise in the energy price cap, to be announced on Thursday, and expected to hit lower income households hardest. The government is considering measures to reduce the impact of the price rises. Some Tory MPs and commentators have blamed investments in renewable energy and the net zero target for price rises, but analysts have made it clear that renewable energy has brought down energy costs in the UK and over-reliance on gas is behind the rises. Jan Rosenow, a director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, who advised the committee, told the Guardian: \u201cShifting away from fossil fuels is the only real solution to the energy price rises. The alternative is to keep using fossil fuels, and then we will see this again and again.\u201d The BEIS committee report underlined that the government must communicate clearly to households that decarbonising heating and reaching net zero emissions should result in a net saving for households, and protect them from volatile gas prices. But the MPs said the government had not yet done enough to make this clear, and to make the transition easy for people on low and middle incomes. Darren Jones, chair of the cross-party committee, warned: \u201cReplacing gas boilers is a huge task and we are not making anywhere near enough progress \u2026 Bill payers today are deeply worried about their energy costs, with many people struggling to afford to heat their homes.\u201d He added: \u201cMost people don\u2019t realise that their gas boiler will need to be replaced within the next ten to 15 years. The government and energy companies should explain to bill payers why switching away from gas and insulating our homes is not only important in tackling climate change, but also a route to reducing energy bills. The government also needs to spell out what financial help will be put in place for those who need it most.\u201d Ministers have a target of installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028, up from only a few thousand today, but the committee said it was not clear how this could be met with current policies, including a \u00a35,000 grant for installing heat pumps. The green homes grant, the short-lived scheme to insulate homes and install heat pumps, was abandoned last year after botched administration, and has not been replaced. The Treasury is also reported to want to scrap the Energy Company Obligation, a \u00a31bn a year levy on energy companies, paid for through additions to energy bills, that funds the installation of insulation and other low-carbon measures for lower income households. Green campaigners say scrapping ECO would be counter-productive. Jones said the government must urgently come up with a replacement for the green homes grant. \u201cMinisters can\u2019t simply leave this to the market \u2013 government should tackle the cost of heating our homes in the round, and bring forward joined-up policies that address these issues together,\u201d he said. Recent research showed that energy efficiency measures over the last two decades have saved UK households about \u00a31,000 a year on current energy bills. But much of the saving came from regulations meaning only the most efficient gas boilers could be sold, and future cost savings and carbon reductions must come from replacing gas with alternatives such as heat pumps, electricity and district heating, as well as insulating Britain\u2019s draughty housing stock. Juliet Phillips, campaign coordinator at the Electrify Heat campaign, said: \u201cHeat pumps are the way to go for clean, safe and efficient heat \u2013 but there remains much work to be done to turn government ambition into delivery on the ground. This means building a skilled workforce who can install and maintain heat pumps across the country; widespread public engagement and provision of trusted advice to support households to make the switch; and boosting affordability through removing legacy policy costs from electricity bills, which currently unfairly penalise electricity use compared to gas.\u201d Laura Bishop, chair of the Ground Source Heat Pump Association, an industry body, said: \u201cWithout heat pumps and other low-carbon heating systems, the UK\u2019s net zero ambitions will be hard to achieve. Heat pumps are suitable for the majority of homes in the UK.\u201d The committee also called for measures including help for households to access finance to install low-carbon heating, including grants for those most vulnerable, and for investment in the training of engineers and installers, in cooperation with the UK\u2019s heating and construction industries. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has been approached for comment."

            "content": "The UK\u2019s reliance on gas to heat homes, generate electricity and fuel heavy industry has come at a steep cost, which is expected to keep on rising. In recent weeks the financial hit to household incomes has reignited calls for the UK to move more urgently to break its dependence on fossil fuels in favour of homegrown low-carbon energy sources. If UK homes were better insulated, warmed by low-carbon alternatives and powered by renewables then bill payers would be better off, according to experts. The cost of supporting the UK\u2019s green policies is falling fast too. Green levies, including support for social schemes, renewable subsidies and energy efficiency, tumbled from \u00a3186 on the average annual energy bill under the energy regulator\u2019s summer 2021 cap on standard energy tariffs to \u00a3173 over the winter, according to analysis by industry journal Carbon Brief. Under the next energy price cap, which is set to surge to an average of almost \u00a32,000 a year from April, policy costs will fall to \u00a3155, according to the analysis. So can going green help keep a lid on home energy bills as well as carbon emissions? Here are the top ways the UK can guard homes against future gas market shocks while tackling the climate crisis too. Renewable electricity Generating more electricity from renewable energy is a guaranteed way to avoid firing up gas power plants and protecting electricity bills from gas market shocks. Under the government\u2019s scheme to support renewable energy projects, windfarms and solar panels receive payments from household energy bills to top up the earnings from the energy market to an agreed level, or \u201cstrike price\u201d. But in return they are expected to pay cash back to consumers when market prices surge above this set subsidy level. Over this winter, renewables covered by the scheme are expected to generate enough electricity to pay back \u00a3770m, which would save an average of \u00a327 from the annual home energy bill. The UK\u2019s existing pipeline of renewable energy projects, which are expected to be under construction until 2023, could save households up to \u00a33.9bn in the future, according to analysis by energy company SSE, or enough to shave \u00a3140 off the average bill. The savings could be even higher if the growth of renewable energy sources meant the UK could significantly cut the volume of gas required by the electricity system, and reduce Britain\u2019s exposure to the whims of the global energy markets. Home insulation Better insulation means cheaper energy bills and lower carbon emissions. But the government\u2019s faltering commitment to upgrading Britain\u2019s draughty homes \u2013 considered the least efficient in Europe \u2013 has left millions of homes exposed to unnecessarily high heating bills. Research undertaken by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found that homes with energy efficiency band D typically use 13,200 kWh of gas a year, which costs \u00a3630 under the regulator\u2019s current price cap, or \u00a3100 more than homes insulated to band C level, which is the level targeted by government. The saving is expected to widen from April as the energy price cap rises, reaching \u00a3170 while the costs for homes insulated to band D climb to \u00a3340. The least energy efficient homes in the UK \u2013 in which many households are living in fuel poverty \u2013 typically pay \u00a3240 more a year to heat than band C homes. Those living in homes rated F are expected to pay \u00a3400 a year more on their heating bills from April than bill payers in a C grade home, which could be transformed into savings if energy efficiency improved. The findings have renewed calls for the government to use public money to help make home insulation affordable, which would help cut home heating bills and move the UK towards its legally binding climate targets. Low carbon heating About 85% of British households rely on gas heating to stay warm. But in the future homes that are well insulated and connected to an electricity system rich with renewable energy could enjoy energy bill savings by switching to an electric heat pump. Electricity bills are not rising as fast as gas bills because gas power plants make up about half of the UK\u2019s generation mix while renewable and nuclear energy generation helps to cushion the rising cost of electricity. Under the regulator\u2019s energy price cap a default electricity-only tariff is poised to climb by 42% from April while gas bills will rise by 69%. By the end of the decade paying for power could be even cheaper because the green levies that are currently collected through electricity bills \u2013 and stand at \u00a3153 a year \u2013 may be moved to gas bills under new proposals from the regulator. The catch? The cost of buying and installing a heat pump has fallen, but remains a hefty investment for most families particularly as a cost of living crisis looms. Heat pumps also rely on good home insulation and skilled installation to run effectively. The government\u2019s climate agenda would need to help households find affordable options to help accelerate the rollout of heat pumps \u2013 including good training options for new installers \u2013 if bill payers are to reap the benefit. Smart energy systems The energy industry has struggled for years to make the case for installing a smart meter, but soon the rollout of a new generation of energy tariffs and digitally enabled appliances could convince the doubters that it is savvy to go smart. By opting for a so-called \u201ctime-of-use\u201d tariff households could save money on their energy bills by running a load of laundry or the dishwasher during periods when energy is cheap, and avoiding times when energy is most expensive. Smart home appliances, electric vehicles and batteries could automatically pick the best time to charge up overnight, which would make saving money even easier. Octopus Energy, a leader in time-of-use tariffs, has found that the average customer using its Agile tariff would save \u00a3188 a year by avoiding energy use during peak \u201csurge pricing\u201d periods compared with using a standard variable tariff. But the even bigger benefits for households take place well beyond the front door. By using less electricity during peak demand hours, and making better use of renewable energy during low demand hours, the energy system could avoid investing billions in new power plants and grid connections, which are ultimately paid for through home energy bills. A study by Imperial College London and the Carbon Trust found that the UK could save up to \u00a38bn a year by 2030 by using a more flexible electricity system. The study found that shifting how we use electricity, using more energy storage and trading electricity with neighbouring countries via giant subsea cables could save up to \u00a340bn by 2050 \u2013 even after taking into account the cost of these investments."

            "date": "2022-02-28T16:00:14Z",
            "content": "Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation this century are far higher than previously thought, doubling in just two decades and continuing to accelerate, according to a study. The world\u2019s forests form an enormous carbon store, holding an estimated 861 gigatons of carbon \u2013 equivalent to nearly a century\u2019s worth of annual fossil fuel emissions at the current rate. When trees are cut down, they release the carbon they store into the atmosphere. Since 2000, the world has lost about 10% of its tree cover, becoming a major driver of global heating. Yet, despite being the second largest human source of greenhouse gases after fossil fuels, the carbon accounting behind emissions from land still contains significant uncertainties, often relying on limited data that poses difficulties for researchers tracking progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. A study published on Monday in Nature Sustainability shows that carbon loss from tropical deforestation in the last two decades has doubled and continues to rise, driven largely by the expansion of agricultural frontiers. The findings contrast with previous assessments, such as the Global Carbon Budget 2021, which had suggested a slight decline in carbon loss from deforestation. Using high-resolution satellite data, researchers found that the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia and Brazil recorded the largest acceleration in forest loss from 2001 to 2020, with the South American country responsible for the largest total emissions from clearing in the Amazon and other forest ecosystems. The analysis found that about a fifth of land clearing in the tropics took place in mountainous regions, which are home to relatively high carbon stocks, especially in Asia. \u201cDeforestation and forest carbon loss are accelerating. There is a massive gulf between where we want to get to and where we are going, which is really worrying,\u201d says Dominick Spracklen, a professor at the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds, who co-authored the study. The increase took place despite commitments to slow deforestation, such as the New York Declaration on Forests in 2014, which aimed to halve deforestation rates by 2020. At Cop26 in Glasgow, a coalition of 142 countries \u2013 accounting for more than 90% of the world\u2019s forests \u2013 committed to halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030. \u201cThe standard methods used by the IPCC are not spotting some of the things we\u2019ve seen in this paper, such as small-scale deforestation and the movement of land-clearing into mountains. They aren\u2019t really capturing the trend that we\u2019ve seen in the last two decades,\u201d Spracklen added. The research was led by Yu Feng, a PhD candidate at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), and Zhenzhong Zeng, associate professor at SUSTech. \u201cTropical forests are huge stores of carbon. We must reduce deforestation to slow global warming,\u201d said Yu Feng. Cattle farming, palm oil, soy, cocoa, rubber and coffee are all leading causes of tropical forest loss, destroying some of the most biodiverse places on Earth, home to species including jaguars, sloths, orang-utans, toucans and lemurs. On Monday, an IPCC report warned climate breakdown was accelerating rapidly and said many of the impacts would be more severe than predicted, with only a narrow chance left of avoiding its worst ravages. Satellite monitoring is playing an increasingly important role in tracking greenhouse gases on Earth, such as those monitoring methane emissions. For forests, Global Forest Watch hosts satellite data tracking forest loss, and projects such as Nasa\u2019s Gedi mission, which uses lasers to analyse the biomass of trees, is helping provide a more accurate map of the world\u2019s forests and carbon stores.

            "title": "Why the shutdown of AGL\u2019s coal-fired plants will probably happen even sooner than power giant says ",
            "date": "2022-02-10T16:30:25Z",
            "content": "When AGL, Australia\u2019s biggest electricity generator, announced plans on Thursday to accelerate the timetable to close its two largest coal-fired power plants, environmental groups complained the pace wasn\u2019t fast enough. Out would go Bayswater, AGL\u2019s 2640-megawatt black coal-fired power plant in New South Wales\u2019s Hunter Valley, between 2030 and 2033, rather than 2035 as previously flagged. And by 2045, the 2210MW Loy Yang A brown coal-fired station in Victoria would follow, compared with a 2048 schedule, the company said. That at least was AGL\u2019s objective, Graeme Hunt, the company\u2019s chief executive told investors, adding with a flourish: \u201cthe path to net zero [emissions] will be the defining challenge of our era. Companies that don\u2019t adapt, that don\u2019t innovate, and don\u2019t set themselves on this path will be left behind\u201d. Greenpeace Australia dismissed the new dates as a \u201ctoken effort\u201d, noting the two plants at current pollution rates add about 35m tonnes of CO2 yearly, or about 7% of the nation\u2019s total. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the updated plan was \u201cnext to meaningless for these crumbling assets\u201d given Bayswater will be 48 years old by 2033 and in 2045, Loy Yang A will be 61 years old\u201d. The latter point was perhaps the most germaine. The Australian Energy Market Operator is already preparing scenarios for all brown coal plants and two-thirds of black coal ones to disappear from the grid by 2032. That\u2019s about a decade earlier than AGL is now forecasting for Loy Yang A. \u201c[Thursday] will not be the last time the closure of a fossil fuel generator is brought forward,\u201d said Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, which counts AGL among its almost 1,000 members. \u201cIf you look at the rate at which renewables are coming into the market, if you look at the rate at which big batteries are being deployed and the commitments that are being made in the projects being committed to, the pace of change is just accelerating.\u201d Thornton said. Data released a fortnight ago by Aemo underscored the woes facing AGL \u2013 which by 30 June plans to split into a generator arm Accel Energy and a retailing one, AGL Australia \u2013 and other big fossil-dominated generators like EnergyAustralia and Origin Energy. Gas and coal prices are being pushed higher by global supply constraints and rising demand, while costs of wind and solar farms are falling and their energy source is basically free. Plant profitability isn\u2019t helped, either, by 3m households with solar panels generating their own power, particularly during the middle of the day. As Aemo noted, Victoria\u2019s spot prices in the December quarter were on average negative between 09.25 and 14.20. Between 08.00 and 16.30, they averaged just 10 cents per MW-hour. EnergyAustralia last year brought forward the planned closure of its Mt Piper coal-fired power plant near Lithgow in NSW by at least three years, while its Yallourn plant in Victoria will now shut in 2028 rather than 2032. Origin Energy, meanwhile, says the first of the units at its Eraring plant will shut in NSW by 2030. Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at the University of Melbourne said Aemo\u2019s draft integrated system plan has various scenarios based on emissions goals. The most ambitious, assuming a trajectory that is in line with keeping global warming to 1.5C, has the first of AGL\u2019s Loy Yang A\u2019s units closing by 2027 and all of it by 2029, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a mismatch,\u201d McConnell says. \u201cYou have this sort of market approach and then you have this planning approach, and they just don\u2019t line up.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One reason is Aemo\u2019s modelling assumes a carbon budget. \u201cIn the real world, there isn\u2019t a carbon price or any financial penalty for that,\u201d he says. Not yet, at least. Another challenge is that while renewables have been booming, the pace of growth, particularly for new windfarms, has slowed sharply, in part because of planning uncertainties, McConnell says. Head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, agrees there\u2019s every likelihood loss-making coal-fired power plants will drop out of the market faster than companies are saying publicly. AGL\u2019s Bayswater, for instance, will lose its low-cost coal supplies from about 2024, which will then undermine its role as one of the more profitable plants. A 2030 closure date, if that\u2019s what happens, will be challenging for NSW, Mountain says. \u201cThe NSW government needs to get another, call it 4000-5000MW of wind and solar capacity operational and producing by [2030], and a very good deal likely of storage capacity,\u201d he says. NSW seems committed to implement its electricity infrastructure roadmap \u201cbut there isn\u2019t time to lose\u201d, Mountain says. Victoria is also stepping up its support for new generation capacity while Queensland \u201cremains the real laggard\u201d. Aemo, meanwhile, is also forecasting demand to almost double by 2050 to 330 terawatt-hours a year, from 180 TWh now, particularly as cars switch from petrol and diesel to electricity. To meet that demand and cope with plant closures, the current pipeline of proposed generation and storage capacity in the NEM stands at 138 gigawatts (GW), or more than double today\u2019s capacity of 59GW. Renewables account for 86% of proposed projects, Aemo says. The challenges facing the power sector will only grow, though, if hopes for a hydrogen export sector are realised, McConnell said \u201cThe growth in electricity for that is really quite phenomenal,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there\u2019s a bit of a disconnect between what the market is doing or saying versus what the expectations are.\u201d"

            "title": "Can you really carbon offset a power station? It should be a last resort | Graham Readfearn",
            "date": "2022-02-09T23:30:04Z",
            "content": "\u201cAt EnergyAustralia, we\u2019re already building Australia\u2019s first carbon offset power station,\u201d says a smiling tradie in hi-vis overlooking a construction site. The line is from EnergyAustralia\u2019s new TV ad that has been appearing in prime time slots accompanied by Fleetwood Mac\u2019s 1977 classic tune, Don\u2019t Stop. The company said the ad campaign would showcase \u201chow the leading energy retailer and generator is supporting cleaner, affordable and reliable energy.\u201d But what is a \u201ccarbon offset power station\u201d anyway and is it different from any other power station? The power station in question \u2013 Tallawarra B \u2013 is under construction near Wollongong in New South Wales and will be a fast-start plant that will burn gas and, as the ad said, be \u201chydrogen-capable\u201d. But in reality, what EnergyAustralia is doing in building a \u201ccarbon offset power station\u201d is constructing a regular fossil fuel power station, then working out what the emissions are, and then buying some carbon offsets. To understand how unimpressive this is, think about how you could make the same claim about anything else you chose to construct like, for example, a diesel generator. As long as you know its emissions, you can magically turn it into a \u201ccarbon offset diesel generator\u201d through the purchase of carbon credits. \u201cOffsetting should only be used as a last resort, and not to justify projects that should be avoided,\u201d said Dr Megan Evans, an expert in environmental offsets at the University of New South Wales in Canberra. \u201cThis is an inappropriate use of offsetting, but it is increasingly being used as a first resort, rather than a last resort,\u201d she said. EnergyAustralia told Temperature Check it would buy government-accredited Australian Carbon Credit Units for its offsets. But Evans said any benefits from buying offsets tended not to be realised until many years into the future, whereas burning gas in a power station releases emissions immediately. \u201cWe need to be cutting emissions now to stay within carbon budgets, rather than starting in the future.\u201d Hydrogen helping? What about adding hydrogen to the gas at Tallawarra B. Will that make it less polluting? EnergyAustralia said the power station was designed to accept gas mixed with 5% \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d by volume. Dr Fiona Beck, an expert in the emerging hydrogen economy at the Australian National University, said adding this much zero-emissions hydrogen would only reduce emissions from the plant by about 1.6%. As this column has explored before, some experts say using zero-emissions hydrogen in the power sector is likely to be one of the least economical uses of the liquid fuel. An EnergyAustralia statement said the company would \u201coffer to buy 200,000kg of green hydrogen for 10 years from 2025\u201d and would investigate adding more hydrogen to the mix in the future. The \u201cresidual\u201d emissions from the power station would then be offset, the company said. Taking Beck\u2019s analysis, those \u201cresidual emissions\u201d will be about 98.4% of them. Climate champion? In the 45 second TV ad, a staff member makes a bold signoff. After walking over the MCG turf, the staff member says: \u201cwhile others just talk about making a better tomorrow, we\u2019re actually doing it.\u201d EnergyAustralia launched its advertising campaign the same week it was ranked 47th out of 50 in a Greenpeace \u201cgreen electricity\u201d guide. According to data from the Clean Energy Regulator, EnergyAustralia is the second highest corporate emitter of greenhouse gases in the country, releasing 17.9m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019-20. Glenn Walker, senior campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said the company was ranked so low because of its high annual emissions and because the company mines coal and plans to keep burning it until 2040. \u201cEnergyAustralia talks about building a better tomorrow, but this is just blatant greenwashing,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe \u2018tomorrow\u2019 they\u2019re most contributing to is one of climate chaos.\u201d EnergyAustralia said the Tallawarra B \u201csets a new benchmark for how gas generators can be consistent with NSW\u2019s plan to be net zero by 2050 by using green hydrogen and offsetting residual emissions\u201d. The company was committed to being net zero by 2050, \u201cto be out of coal by 2040, and to reduce our direct emissions by 60% by 2028-29 relative to 2019-20\u201d. The company had announced the early retirement of its Yallourn brown coal power station and had made commitments to pumped hydro, battery and gas projects \u201cdesigned to enable more renewables to enter the system\u201d. \u201cWe are focused on a smooth energy transition for all, made possible through respectful and responsible actions,\u201d EnergyAustralia said. Booking CO2 storage? A central plank of the information that energy companies routinely announce to investors is how much fossil fuels they have in their reserves. But this week oil and gas company Santos added another metric to their \u201cannual reserves statement\u201d \u2013 the amount of CO2 storage capacity the company has on its books. The company\u2019s managing director, Kevin Gallagher, announced it had listed 100m tonnes of CO2 storage which related to its $220m Moomba carbon capture and storage project in the Cooper Basin in South Australia. \u201cThis globally significant carbon storage capacity booking is another tangible example of Santos leading the way in establishing the foundations to support the energy transition,\u201d Gallagher said. Temperature Check understands the 100m tonnes of storage relates to the annual 1.7m tonne capacity of its planned Moomba project \u2013 meaning it would take 59 years to fill. Even though Santos has \u201cbooked\u201d the storage, the company has only stored 100 tonnes of CO2 during a trial, with the first injection into the Moomba CCS project not scheduled until the first half of 2024. Santos also reported that thanks mainly to a merger with another energy firm, its \u201cproved plus probable\u201d reserves had gone up by 80% to stand at the equivalent of 1,676m barrels of oil. Experts at Climate Analytics \u2013 a respected not-for-profit climate science and policy consultancy \u2013 told Temperature Check that if sold and burned, those reserves would release about 512m tonnes of CO2. Santos has insisted its business plans won\u2019t compromise its target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. That target excludes the emissions from the fossil fuels that are burned after the company has sold them."

            "date": "2022-02-28T22:09:51Z",
            "content": "Defense and cybersecurity stocks are seeing a sharp rise in values as investors take note of pledges by the EU to boost defense spending and governments warn of an increased threat of cyber intrusions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. US stock markets seesawed again on Monday as the war in Ukraine escalated. Most of the major US markets closed lower after regaining some of their losses, but defense contractors continued to gain as investors bet their businesses would benefit from the conflict. Raytheon Technologies, the US defense giant and maker of the Stinger ground-to-air missile that Germany has pledged to supply to Ukrainian forces, has seen its shares price increase more than 10% since the invasion began last Wednesday. Raytheon\u2019s stock rose over 4.6% on Monday and has risen more than 18% this year. Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-35 fighter jet, advanced more than 5.4% on Monday. The company, with Raytheon, is the manufacturer of the Patriot missile defense system set to be deployed with the Nato battlegroup in Slovakia. Northrop Grumman, leading manufacturer of attack and surveillance drones, saw its stock rise close to 7% on Monday, after rising 3% since the Ukrainian conflict began. Huntington Ingalls Industries, the largest US military shipbuilder, is up over 7%. By contrast, the US Dow Jones Industrials has risen 760 points since 23 February to close at 33,892 on Monday. Outside the US, Britain\u2019s BAE Systems, the largest defense contractor in Europe, Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall, France\u2019s Thales and Italy\u2019s Leonardo have all seen their share prices rise sharply. The jump in defense stocks comes after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that defense spending in Europe\u2019s biggest economy will be increased to 2% of gross domestic product, from an estimated 1.5% in 2021. While the US and its allies haven\u2019t intervened in the conflict on the ground, they have been supplying arms and financial backing. Over the weekend, Germany said it would supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles so it can defend itself against Russia, and it vowed to channel about $113bn into its military this year. \u201cIf Germany is feeling pressure to bolster its military and defense systems in this way, other countries are likely to follow suit,\u201d said Investor Place in a note. \u201cThis means that companies that produce military technology and weapons are likely to see a significant spike in demand throughout the coming months. Wall Street will be keeping a close watch on defense stocks as the industry prepares for a boom.\u201d But defense analysts have also raised concerns that some companies, including Raytheon, also supply Russian civil use aircraft makers. In a speech last week, Joe Biden said his administration\u2019s actions and those of allies aimed to \u201ccut off more than half of Russia\u2019s hi-tech imports, and we\u2019ll strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military\u201d. That comes as defense contractors watch for signs that the Pentagon will ask Congress for additional funding to pay for increased costs, including the deployment of 7,000 US troops to Europe and the cost of additional surveillance flights. \u201cRussia\u2019s actions in Ukraine have renewed the arguments for higher US defense spending and I think we\u2019re likely to see it grow more than previously expected,\u201d said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Congress is set to approve a Department of Defense (DoD) budget of $740bn for 2022-2023. The DoD has been in the process of shifting focus to the Asia-Pacific region. But Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine could alter that calculation, Harrison said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see more of split focus around counter-Russia in Europe in the short term and countering China in the Pacific in the long term.\u201d While the conflict stands to benefit companies that rely largely on defense work, shares of cybersecurity software companies have also risen on expectations of increased spending on security-related services. Among exchange-traded (ETF) funds that track the sector, the Global X Cybersecurity ETF rose 3.6% and is up more than 12% over the past three trading sessions. Morgan Stanley wrote that the heightened geopolitical tension \u201cwill continue to provide a strong tailwind for cybersecurity stocks\u201d. Among companies that stand to gain are the cloud storage security firm Zscaler, Crowdstrike Holdings, which markets anti-ransomware services, and Fortinet, a maker of network security systems. \u201cAnytime there is a new threat announced, or there\u2019s a hack or ransomware attack, that\u2019s effectively an advertisement for cybersecurity as something that companies and other organizations need to be investing in,\u201d Hilary Frisch, an analyst at ClearBridge Investments, told Bloomberg this month."

            "date": "2022-02-24T14:55:17Z",
            "content": "A cyber report published by intelligence agencies in the UK and US on Wednesday has attributed insidious new malware to a notorious Russia-backed hacking group. The findings come as Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine. The joint research was published by the National Cyber Security Centre in the UK and US agencies including the National Security Agency. It warned that a Russian state-backed hacker group known as Sandworm had developed a new type of malware called Cyclops Blink, which targets firewall devices made by the manufacturer Watchguard to protect computers against hacks. The sophisticated virus can withstand typical remedies including reboots, the report said. The findings come as the UK and US, allies to Ukraine, are on high alert for Russian state-sponsored hacks. The agencies added that their statement was a \u201croutine advisory\u201d not directly linked to the situation in Ukraine. However, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant said the announcement was a reminder of the damage that could be inflicted by Sandworm, which has been blamed for the devastating NotPetya attack on Ukraine in 2017. John Hultquist, a vice-president at Mandiant Threat Intelligence, said Sandworm remained a \u201ccapable and clever\u201d adversary. \u201cIn light of the crisis in Ukraine we are very concerned about this actor, who has surpassed all others we track in terms of the aggressive cyber-attacks and information operations they have conducted,\u201d he said. \u201cNo other Russian actor has been so brazen and successful in disrupting critical infrastructure in Ukraine and elsewhere.\u201d Ukraine has suffered a string of cyber-attacks that Kyiv has blamed on Russia. Moscow, which is caught up in a mounting confrontation with the west over Ukraine, has denied any involvement. Wednesday saw a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that targeted websites of Ukraine\u2019s government and banks. \u201cAt about 4pm, another mass DDoS attack on our state began. We have relevant data from a number of banks,\u201d said Mykhailo Fedorov, minister of digital transformation, adding that the parliament website was also hit. Ukrainian authorities said this week they had seen online warnings that hackers were preparing to launch major attacks on government agencies, banks and the defense sector. Wednesday\u2019s hack was consistent with the country\u2019s tactics to distract and disrupt adversaries while \u201cproviding a level of plausible deniability\u201d, said Rick Holland, chief information security officer at the cybersecurity firm Digital Shadows. \u201cRussia didn\u2019t just decide to invade Ukraine this week,\u201d he said. \u201cMilitary planners have prepared for this campaign years in advance. Disinformation, false flags, DDoS attacks, and destructive wiper malware are a part of Russian military doctrine; the battle plans have been drawn up and are now being executed.\u201d The White House said on Wednesday that it was in touch with Ukrainian authorities about their cybersecurity needs, in the wake of the fresh cyber-attack, which the US government has not yet attributed. \u201cWe are in conversations with Ukraine regarding their cyber-related needs including as recently as today and we\u2019re going to move with urgency to assess the nature and extent of this, what steps need to be taken, and therefore a response,\u201d the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said.

            "content": "Cyber experts have identified a new strain of computer-disabling malware unleashed on Ukrainian targets as part of Russia\u2019s offensive, as the UK government and banks said they were on alert for online attacks. Russia was widely expected to launch a cyber assault alongside its military campaign, and the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine was marked by the deployment of \u201cwiper\u201d malware . A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which paralyses websites by bombarding them with spurious information requests, also hit Ukrainian government sites. On Thursday, requests for volunteers from Ukraine\u2019s hacker underground began to appear on forums in a bid to help protect critical infrastructure and conduct cyber spying missions against Russian troops, Reuters reported, citing two sources. \u201cUkrainian cybercommunity! It\u2019s time to get involved in the cyber defense of our country,\u201d one post read. Yegor Aushev, co-founder of a cybersecurity company in Kyiv, told Reuters he wrote the post at the request of a senior defence ministry official who contacted him on Thursday. Aushev\u2019s firm Cyber Unit Technologies is known for working with Ukraine\u2019s government on the defence of critical infrastructure. On Wednesday, ESET Research Labs, a Slovakia-based cybersecurity company, said it had detected a new piece of data-wiping malware on hundreds of machines in Ukraine. ESET said large organisations had been affected, while security experts at Symantec\u2019s threat intelligence team said the malware had affected Ukrainian government contractors in Latvia and Lithuania and a financial institution in Ukraine. ESET has called the malware, which renders computers inoperable by disabling rebooting, HermeticWiper. The NotPetya attack of 2017, which devastated Ukrainian businesses, was a wiper attack that encrypted computers irretrievably and spilled over into other countries, causing $10bn (\u00a37.5bn) of damage worldwide. Alexi Drew, a senior analyst at RAND Europe, a research institute, said cyber offensives carried the risk of escalating rapidly if attacks spill over widely into other countries, although in the case of HermeticWiper the malware does not appear to be self-propogating, whereas NotPetya was able to spread. Further attacks, however, could be different, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a history of cyber-attacks not staying where they\u2019re meant to go. If you look at NotPetya, the splash damage there was significant. There is a danger here of escalation because offensive cyber activity is fundamentally not very good at staying where you put it.\u201d Priti Patel said officials were on alert for cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns from Moscow. \u201cAs we monitor developments, we will be especially mindful of the potential for cyber-attacks and disinformation emanating from Russia,\u201d the home secretary said. The chief executive of Lloyds Bank, Charlie Nunn, said on Thursday the lender was on \u201cheightened alert \u2026 internally around our cyber risk controls, and we\u2019ve been focused on this for quite a while\u201d. Preparation for potential cyber-attacks was discussed in a meeting between the government and banking industry leaders on Wednesday, Nunn added. According to Symantec, the wiper attack that hit Ukraine this week had been planned for some time. One Ukrainian organisation suffered an initial hack in December last year that was related to the recent attack. DDoS attacks were also deployed ahead of the military offensive in order to spread confusion, according to the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant. In a DDoS attack, websites are deluged with vexatious requests for information and become unreachable. The targets on Wednesday included the Ukrainian defence ministry and PrivatBank, Ukraine\u2019s largest commercial bank. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much the technical disruption, it\u2019s what it does to undermine confidence, like in the financial sector. It gets people quite nervous. It\u2019s more that kind of secondary impact,\u201d said Jamie Collier, a Mandiant consultant, who described a DDoS as akin to stuffing a thousand envelopes through a letterbox every second. However, Dr Lennart Maschmeyer at the Center for Security Studies at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, said Russia\u2019s cyber strategy so far seemed more improvised. \u201cA plausible scenario for more devastating cyber-attacks was that Russia had planned this invasion for a long time, and prepositioned implants across Ukraine\u2019s critical infrastructure in order to cause mass disruptions coinciding with the military invasion. That does not seem to be the case. The cyber operations we have seen do not show long preparation, and instead look rather haphazard,\u201d he said. \u2022 The headline and text of this article were amended on 24 February and 3 March 2022 to make clear that this was a malware incident affecting machines, not a virus."

            "date": "2022-02-23T15:20:45Z",
            "content": "British officials are concerned about \u201cspillover\u201d from any heightened Russian cyber-activity in Ukraine, as demonstrated by last week\u2019s attack on two banks by hackers linked to the GRU spy agency. Although there have been no Ukraine-related Russian attacks on the UK since the start of the crisis, cyber-specialists have been holding meetings with key companies to discuss the possible threat and how it could be tackled. \u201cOrganisations need to understand there is a heightened risk,\u201d said one official, with a particular focus on monitoring whether an intense Russian cyber-attack on Ukrainian targets could have wider consequences. Jeremy Fleming, the head of the spy agency GCHQ, held a roundtable last week to discuss the threat with organisations responsible for Britain\u2019s \u201ccritical national infrastructure\u201d, which includes the communications, energy, food, health and transport sectors. Ukraine has been a target for regular Russian cyber-attacks since the start of the war in 2014 and last week was hit with a \u201csophisticated\u201d attack that tried to disrupt customer services at two Ukrainian banks and the website of the defence ministry. On Friday, the NCSC, Britain\u2019s cybersecurity agency, said it believed Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence was behind the \u201cdenial of service\u201d attack. But although relatively serious, officials believe it was \u201cnot necessarily a precursor\u201d for a military offensive or enhanced cyber-action. A recent NCSC briefing, which is considered still valid, said: \u201cWhile the NCSC is not aware of any current specific threats to UK organisations in relation to events in and around Ukraine, there has been an historical pattern of cyber-attacks on Ukraine with international consequences.\u201d In 2017, Russian state actors launched the NotPetya malware against Ukrainian companies, but it spread indiscriminately around the world, affecting a string of western companies and even some Russian corporations. Western spy agencies have previously said that attack was also conducted by GRU operatives. Ukraine\u2019s long experience in dealing with cyber-attacks \u2013 two of which, in 2015 and 2016, briefly disrupted some power supplies \u2013 means that western officials believe Kyiv is relatively experienced at picking up the pieces after a damaging attack. Nevertheless, the UK and the US have been helping the country\u2019s cybersecurity agencies, as the crisis has intensified. On Tuesday, six EU countries said they, too, would offer further assistance. A western official said: \u201cWe share our understanding of the threats and we have and continue to make them aware of threats.\u201d"

            "title": "Ukraine accuses Russia of cyber-attack on two banks and its defence ministry",
            "date": "2022-02-16T19:12:52Z",
            "content": "Ukraine accused Russia on Wednesday of being behind a cyber-attack that targeted two banks and its defence ministry, which the country\u2019s deputy prime minister said was the largest of its type ever seen. The Kremlin denied it was behind the denial of service attacks \u2013 attempts to overwhelm a website by flooding it with millions of requests \u2013 but the disruption reignited wider concerns of ongoing cyberconflict. Ilya Vityuk, cybersecurity chief of Ukraine\u2019s SBU intelligence agency, said it was too early to definitively identify specific perpetrators, as is typically the case with cyber-attacks, where perpetrators make efforts to cover their tracks. But the official added: \u201cThe only country that is interested in such \u2026 attacks on our state, especially against the backdrop of massive panic about a possible military invasion, the only country that is interested is the Russian Federation.\u201d Denying responsibility, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cWe do not know anything. As expected, Ukraine continues blaming Russia for everything\u201d. He added that Russia had had \u201cnothing to do with\u201d the denial of service attacks. Russia has been accused of being behind a string of cyber-attacks against Ukraine since the 2014 war between the two countries, and some experts believe that if the Kremlin does de-escalate militarily, similar deniable attacks could follow. Danny Lopez, a former diplomat who runs cybersecurity firm Glasswall, said: \u201cWhile we trying to find out if de-escalation is real, it\u2019s in Russia\u2019s interest to keep everybody guessing. Cyber-attacks could now play an important role, to keep the pot warm on the stove but not spilling over into actual conflict.\u201d Some of the incidents in the years following the war alarmed the west. Two brief regional power outages in December 2015 and 2016 were blamed on Russian hackers from the GRU military intelligence, according to a US indictment. The first affected 225,000 customers in the west of Ukraine. The second, affecting northern Kyiv, lasted about an hour, but amounted to the loss of about one-fifth of the capital\u2019s power consumption. The same group, members of Unit 74455, according to the US Department of Justice, was also accused of being behind the NotPetya malware attack of June 2017. That initially targeted Ukraine\u2019s financial, energy and government sectors but spread indiscriminately, causing billions in financial damage to western and even Russian companies. Ciaran Martin, the former chief of the UK\u2019s NCSC cyber-agency, warned: \u201cIf Russia escalates against Ukraine, there\u2019s the risk of another NotPetya-style accident. After all, NotPetya, perhaps the most economically damaging cyber-attack of all time, was the accidental fallout against the west of the Russians hacking Ukraine.\u201d Such attacks may suggest what is possible in an all out conflict, but Ukraine\u2019s defences have been improving. Mindful of the risks, Kyiv signed a cybersecurity pact with the US in November. Help followed Tuesday\u2019s attack, which disrupted banking services and, less seriously, knocked out the Ministry of Defence website. Other analysts, however, also believe that the attacks likely emanating from Russia have become more carefully calibrated to avoid international condemnation. Jamie MacColl, a research fellow at the Rusi thinktank, said: \u201cSince NotPetya, the more disruptive ops have been more limited.\u201d A recent example of a more limited attack, according to MacColl, was the WhisperGate malware, which Microsoft detected in Ukraine in the middle of January. It was designed to look like ransomware, a virus that encrypts an organisation\u2019s data, but without the unlock for payment mechanism that is a feature of such attacks. The political cost of such attacks is relatively low. Periodically western intelligence agencies will accuse the Russian actors as being behind such hacking, but the Kremlin is resistant to embarrassment. The US also seeks to indict individuals but as Russia will not extradite them, there is no danger of any trials going ahead. Yet the goal of any cyber-attacks need not be a dramatic effort to knock out a utility or banking system; it could simply be to wear out the morale of a country like Ukraine. Esther Naylor, a research analyst at Chatham House, said: \u201cAttacks don\u2019t have to do anything more destructive than a denial of service. Their goal is to cause panic, and to make people think what might come next.\u201d"

            "content": "This blog is now closed. You can follow all the developments in the crisis at our new blog here: Agence France-Presse has shared a video of empty streets across eastern Ukraine this morning. In the footage, loudspeakers announce the location of evacuation centres in the Ukrainian city of Khartsyzsk, after Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, ordered troops into the self-proclaimed rebel republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States has hit back at the imposition of sanctions imposed by US president Joe Biden, suggesting the move would hurt global financial and energy markets as well as ordinary citizens. According to a recent post on the Russian embassy Facebook page early Wednesday, ambassador Anatoly Antonov said: Sanctions will not solve anything regarding Russia. It\u2019s hard to imagine that anyone in Washington is counting on Russia to review its foreign policy course under threat of restrictions. I don\u2019t remember a single day when our country lived without any restrictions from the Western world. We learned how to work in such conditions. And not only survive, but also develop our state. There is no doubt that the sanctions imposed against us will hurt the global financial and energy markets. The United States will not be left out, where ordinary citizens will feel the full consequences of rising prices.\u201d New Zealand has summoned Russian ambassador Georgii Zuev to meet on Wednesday with top diplomatic officials who are urging Russia to return to diplomatic negotiations over Ukraine, the Associated Press reports. Foreign affairs minister Nanaia Mahuta is currently out of the country but said in a statement that the ambassador was called in \u201cto hear New Zealand\u2019s strong opposition to the actions taken by Russia in recent days, and condemn what looks to be the beginning of a Russian invasion into Ukraine territory.\u201d The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed to the Associated Press that the meeting had taken place but declined to provide any further details. Canada has delivered a second aircraft filled with \u201clethal military aid\u201d to Ukraine on Tuesday. National defence minister Anita Anand said: Today, our Canadian Armed Forces made a second delivery of lethal military aid to support our Ukrainian partners. Russia\u2019s further invasion of a sovereign state is absolutely unacceptable, and we will continue to stand by Ukraine as the country defends its sovereignty and independence.\u201d \u2018Grab him by the roubles\u2019: Here\u2019s how the British papers covered the threat of war in Ukraine. The prospect of a full-blown invasion dominated the front pages, along with doubts as to the effectiveness of first tranche of sanctions on Moscow. Australia has confirmed it will hit Russia with a range of sanctions targeting transport energy, telecommunications, oil, gas and mineral reserves. Sanctions and travel bans will also target eight members of the Russian Federation\u2019s security council, while existing sanctions in place over past Russian aggression will be expanded, prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Wednesday. Russian banks have also been targeted. Morrison said he expects further tranches of sanctions that will target more individuals after convening cabinet\u2019s national security committee earlier in the day. Morrison told reporters from Canberra: The invasion of Ukraine has effectively already begun. Australians always stand up to bullies and we will be standing up to Russia along with all of our partners, and all those who believe that it is totally unacceptable that Russia could invade its neighbour. Morrison said the government will \u201cimmediately\u201d begin placing sanctions on Russian individuals and will amend the Autonomous Sanctions regulation of 2011 to extend existing sanctions that apply to Crimea and Sevastopol to the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Oil prices dipped at the start of Wednesday\u2019s trading session as the market judged that sanctions against Russia will not do much to disrupt supplies from the world\u2019s third largest producer. Crude prices have surged in recent weeks to a seven-year high on alarm about the conflict in Ukraine possibly interrupting supplies from Russia, which accounts for about 11% of global supply. But Brent crude fell 13 cents, or 0.1%, to $96.71 a barrel at 0142 GMT, after soaring as high as $99.50 on Tuesday, the highest since September 2014 as it became clear the first wave of US and European sanctions on Russia for sending troops into eastern Ukraine would not disrupt oil supply. A potential return of more Iranian crude to the market, with Tehran and world powers close to reviving a nuclear agreement, also helped to push prices down. Asian stock markets were back in positive territory on Wednesday despite more losses on Wall Street on Tuesday. While we are in the Asia Pacifc region, Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison is set to convene a cabinet national security committee as western nations begin to impose sanctions against Russia. The committee is expected to finalise what targeted sanctions and measures Australia will introduce. International security and intelligence professor John Blaxland said Australia would look to support European and Nato action \u201cwithout overstepping the mark\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit worried that this may once again become a political football and we need to be very, very cautious at this point,\u201d he told the Nine Network. Australia has ruled out direct military assistance and is supporting Ukraine\u2019s cyber-capability. It has left the door open for technical military support but the prime minister declined to elaborate on what the term meant. Home affairs minister Karen Andrews told radio 4BC: \u201cWe\u2019ll be considering sanctions and the extent of those and in the days to follow.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s security and armed forces must increase their surveillance and alertness on military activities in the region, president Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday during a meeting to discuss the Ukraine crisis, Reuters reports. Taiwan and Ukraine are fundamentally different in terms of geostrategic, geographical environment and importance of international supply chains, but government units must tackle possible \u201ccognitive warfare\u201d and misinformation by foreign forces, Tsai\u2019s office cited her as saying. US secretary of state Antony Blinken earlier said an invasion of Ukraine had been Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cplan all along\u201d, calling the situation a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d. In a joint press conference with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Washington held on Tuesday evening local time, Blinken said: His plan all along has been to invade Ukraine; to control Ukraine and its people; to destroy Ukraine\u2019s democracy, which offers a stark contrast to the autocracy that he leads; to reclaim Ukraine as a part of Russia. That\u2019s why this is the greatest threat to security in Europe since world war two\u201d. Another Ukrainian serviceman was wounded by shelling on Tuesday with five others also injured and in need of medical care, according to Ukraine\u2019s joint forces operation situation recently published report. The report says Ukraine recorded a further 72 violations over the past 24 hours from Russia-backed forces, 53 of which were using weapons prohibited by the Minsk agreements. A pumping station was also damaged in the settlement of Zolote, leaving more than 3,000 civilians of the settlement of Popasna without drinking water, according to the latest briefing report published by Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defence. A residential building in the village of Vodiane was destroyed, as was a farm building and agricultural property in the settlement of Verkhnotoretske. Some 42 families were evacuated from the village of Vrubivka, including 30 school-age children and 15 preschool children, the ministry added. We have some more detail surrounding the sanctions Japan has announced against Russia. Prime minister Fumio Kishida said Japan will prohibit the issuance of Russian bonds in Japan and freeze the assets of certain Russian individuals, Reuters reports. Kishida, who also called on Russia to return to diplomatic discussions, said he did not see a significant impact on energy supplies in the short term from the current situation and said further steps would be considered should the situation worsen. The Ukraine crisis, for now, revolves around the country\u2019s eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, now proclaimed independent states by Vladimir Putin. So it might be useful to use this map as a reference point. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrapped up his interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper this evening by providing a list of reasons as to why the United States should be invested in the conflict in Ukraine. First, in 1994 Ukraine abandoned its nuclear arsenal which was the third in size in the world ... We abandoned it in return for security guarantees issued in particular by the United States. We were promised that if anyone attacks us, the United States would be among countries who will be helping us. Second, what is happening in Ukraine is not only about Ukraine. President Putin challenges Euro-Atlantic order. If the West fails in Ukraine, the next target of Putin will be one of the Nato members on its eastern flank. Third, if Putin succeeds in Ukraine, other players across the globe who want to change rules, who want to bypass the United States, they will see that this is possible, that the West is incapable of defending what it stands for. All in all ... Americans should be interested in keeping the world order as it stands and the future of this order is being decided right now in Ukraine.\u201d Continuing to dissect Kuleba\u2019s interview with CNN earlier, the foreign minister said that although he supports the recent US sanctions as an \u201cimportant\u201d message, he believes they are insufficient in dissuading a Russian attack. No sanctions will be enough until Russian boots withdraw from Ukrainian soil. This is [the] fundamental principle, that we have to keep putting pressure on Russia and we in Ukraine proceed from the fact that the sanctions announced today by President Biden is just the beginning of the process of deterring president Putin and making him withdraw.\u201d Referring to any further sanctions, Kuleba suggested no single option or possibility should be left off the table. We want every instrument available to be used in order to stop Putin. If the price of saving a country is the most, harshest sanctions possible, then we should go for the harshest sanctions possible.\u201d Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s ultimate goal is to \u201cdestroy Ukraine\u201d and \u201cno sanctions will be enough\u201d until Russian forces withdraw from Ukrainian soil. During an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Kubela said: His ultimate goal is to destroy Ukraine. He\u2019s not interested in parts of Ukraine. He is not interested in even keeping the entire country under his control. What I know for certain, and this was eloquently proved, regretfully, in his address yesterday, is that he hates [the] Ukrainian statehood, he believes that Ukraine has no right to exist. Putin \u201cwants the idea of the Ukrainian statehood to fail. This is his objective,\u201d Kubela added. Former US president Donald Trump has called Russian president Vladimir Putin a \u201cgenius\u201d for his decision to recognise the two self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk of Ukraine and deploy troops into the Russian-controlled territory. In an interview with American conservative talk radio hosts on the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Trump said: This is genius Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine \u2014 of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that\u2019s wonderful. So, Putin is now saying, \u2018It\u2019s independent,\u2019 a large section of Ukraine. I said, \u2018How smart is that?\u2019 ... Here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s very savvy\u2026 I know him very well. Very, very well.\u201d Trump accused Joe Biden of being \u201cweak\u201d in his response to Putin, adding that it \u201cnever would have happened\u201d if he were still president. By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened.\u201d Referring to Putin, Trump added: I think he sees this opportunity. I knew that he always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it. I said, \u2018You can\u2019t do it. You\u2019re not gonna do it.\u2019 But I could see that he wanted it. I used to ask him. We used to talk about it at length.\u201d Japan\u2019s prime minister Fumio Kishida has also followed in the footsteps of the United States by imposing sanctions on Russia, Reuters reports. We will have more on this story as it develops. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba described US President Joe Biden\u2019s move to impose a first tranche of sanctions against Russia as a strong \u201cfirst move,\u201d adding he also received a promise of more weapons from US officials. \u201cThe sanctions that President Biden announced today - they look strong if we consider them as a first move,\u201d the Ukraine foreign minister said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. He added Ukraine was not seeking US troops on the ground to resolve the crisis. Western nations on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. The United Nations secretary general has said Russian troops on Ukraine border are \u201cnot peacekeepers\u201d, while calling for an immediate ceasefire. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he is \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the latest developments. At this critical moment, I call for an immediate ceasefire and re-establishment of the rule of law. We need restraint &amp; reason. We need de-escalation now.\u201d Earlier we reported US president Joe Biden\u2019s announcement that the United States would be issuing sanctions against Russian banks, oligarchs and others, with plans to escalate sanctions if Russia advances its invasion. The decision comes as retaliation for Russia recognising two self-proclaimed republics, Donetsk and Luhansk, and sending troops there, adding to western efforts to stop what they fear is the beginning of a full-scale invasion. The measures target Russian banks and sovereign debt, among other steps. Watch the video of the key moments from Biden\u2019s speech below. Satellite images show a new deployment of more than 100 military vehicles and dozens of troop tents in southern Belarus near the Ukraine border, a private US company said on Tuesday. The images reportedly show a new field hospital has been added to a military garrison in western Russia close to the border with Ukraine, according to a statement from Maxar Technologies, which has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks. The images could not be independently verified by Reuters however they have been widely shared by correspondents reporting from Ukraine. A large pro-Ukraine rally broke out earlier today in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region. It is the same region that unilaterally declared its independence from Ukraine yesterday, with Putin recognising the expanded borders of Donetsk and Luhansk. Joyce Karam, senior correspondent for the National News, uploaded a video of the event with footage showing hundreds of people waving the Ukrainian flag and singing. Hello it\u2019s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Maanvi Singh signs off. As we reported earlier, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that he will be introducing the conscription of thousands of reservists for military service as Russia moves its troops into east Ukraine. In a televised address which has since been published on the Ukraine ministry of defence website late on on Tuesday night, Zelenskiy said he was still pursuing diplomatic ways out of the crisis and would not cede any territory to Russia. Reuters cites the president: There is no need for general mobilisation today. We need to promptly replenish the Ukrainian army and other military formations. As the supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Ukraine, I issued a decree on the conscription of reservists during a special period. We must increase the readiness of the Ukrainian army for all possible changes in the operational situation. Russia\u2019s upper house unanimously voted to grant Vladimir Putin\u2019s request to deploy troops outside Russia. The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said: \u201cEvery indication is that Russia is continuing to plan for a full-scale attack of Ukraine,\u201d adding that it was \u201cnever too late\u201d for Russia not to attack. Putin said that Russia will support the territorial claims of its proxy states in east Ukraine, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a larger war in the near future. European Union foreign ministers voted to sanction Russian individuals and entities over Ukraine. US president Joe Biden said that \u201cthis is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine\u201d during remarks today, imposing new sanctions on Russia but adding that diplomacy is still possible. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said that he will no longer be meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov: \u201cNow that we see the invasion is beginning and Russia has made clear its wholesale rejection of diplomacy it does not make sense to go forward that meeting at this time.\u201d The doors to the Russian embassy in Kyiv were shut on Tuesday. Seemingly nobody was at home. Outside on the street a small, noisy crowd of demonstrators waved blue and yellow Ukrainian flags. \u201cWe are not afraid of Vladimir Putin. Or his army,\u201d said one activist, Roman Tyschenko. Behind him protesters banged kettle drums and broke into a rhythmic chant of \u201cPutin huiylo\u201d, to blaring music from a loudspeaker. \u201cIt means Putin is a motherfucker,\u201d Tyschenko explained. \u201cIt\u2019s our anthem. Football fans in Kharkiv invented the song in 2014, when Russia stole Crimea.\u201d After a meeting with his security council on Monday in Moscow, Putin recognised the so-called breakaway territories of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent. In a long, and menacing speech he also asserted that Ukraine was not a state, but a historical mistake made by Lenin. \u201cPutin is insane, crazy,\u201d Tyschenko said. \u201cUkraine is both a country and a state. We have ancient traditions. Kyiv was founded before Moscow. We have a much longer record of nationhood.\u201d The threat of war hangs over Kyiv, a city of 3 million people plus another million who commute daily from its suburbs. The US and UK governments believe Putin\u2019s ambitions go beyond the Donbas region, whose separatist administrations Moscow has long armed and propped up. They believe that Russia\u2019s president is poised to attack and encircle the Ukrainian capital, sending in tanks and troops currently parked two hours\u2019 drive away, just across the border in Belarus. The talk among intelligence professionals is of Baghdad-style shock and awe. His goal: to subjugate Ukraine. And yet so far Kyiv residents have reacted to the situation with a collective weapon: carrying on as normal. Cafes and restaurants were open on Tuesday, mothers pushed their toddlers through parks bathed in spring sunshine, and cyclists bumped over cobbled streets. Read more: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a minor, middle or major invasion. Invasion is an invasion,\u201d Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said. Kuleba said that his country was \u201cpuzzled\u201d by the US decision to sanction individuals in Ukraine\u2019s breakaway territories because that did not punish Russia directly. But he said Ukraine was pleased with sanctions against Russian banks and oligarchs. His message: \u201cHit Russia\u2019s economy now and hit it hard.\u201d \u201cThe Ukrainian people will surely remember the United States standing with Ukraine at this decisive moment in history,\u201d he said. US secretary of state Antony Blinken has called the Russia-Ukraine situation \u201cthe greatest threat to security in Europe since World War Two\u201d during a joint press conference with Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken doubled down on remarks made by Joe Biden earlier about Russia\u2019s intentions to invade Ukraine, saying that Putin\u2019s intention all along has been to \u201cinvade Ukraine, to control Ukraine, its people, to destroy Ukraine\u2019s democracy\u201d. Blinken also added that he will no longer be meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov: \u201cNow that we see the invasion is beginning and Russia has made clear its wholesale rejection of diplomacy it does not make sense to go forward that meeting at this time.\u201d The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is currently holding a press conference with Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba about developments in the Russia-Ukraine situation. The joint meeting follows Joe Biden\u2019s announcement today about the first round of sanctions against Russian banks, oligarchs and others, with plans to escalate sanctions if Russia advances its invasion. Video of the press conference is also available here. Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, M\u00e9lanie Joly, said today that Canada will be imposing sanctions on Russia, tweeting: I have directed my Deputy Minister to summon the Russia Ambassador to explain Russia\u2019s continued aggression, violation of international law, and disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty. Canada stands with Ukraine. We will be imposing severe sanctions in response. During updates given today in Ukraine\u2019s parliament, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that he will be calling on reservists for a special period, ruling out a general mobilisation as Russia moves its troops into east Ukraine, reported Reuters. Zelenskiy said that he is still pursuing diplomatic solutions with Russia and welcomed Turkey\u2019s participation in talks between Russia and Ukraine, but noted again that Ukraine will not be ceding any territory to Russia. Zelenskiy also announced the beginning of a new \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d programme that would incentivise local production and provide tax cuts on gasoline. Russia\u2019s upper house unanimously voted to grant Vladimir Putin\u2019s request to deploy troops outside Russia. The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said: \u201cEvery indication is that Russia is continuing to plan for a full-scale attack of Ukraine,\u201d adding that it was \u201cnever too late\u201d for Russia not to attack. Putin said that Russia will support the territorial claims of its proxy states in east Ukraine, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a larger war in the near future. European Union foreign ministers voted to sanction Russian individuals and entities over Ukraine. US president Joe Biden said that \u201cthis is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine\u201d during remarks today, imposing new sanctions on Russia but adding that diplomacy is still possible. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said today that there was no need for general mobilisation, noting that his priority was to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, reported Reuters. As the situation between Russia and Ukraine escalates, reporter Pjotr Sauer wrote an article for the Guardian about how residents in Moscow feel amid an impending invasion: Like many of her friends, Tatyana, a barista at the fashionable Moscow coffee-shop chain Skuratov, was glued to the screen of her mobile phone as Vladimir Putin addressed the nation. \u201cUsually, I don\u2019t watch television, especially when our president speaks. But I felt like I had to tune in this time. I was witnessing history in the making,\u201d she said, smoking an e-cigarette. \u201cBut I am not sure yet if history is going in the right direction.\u201d The day after the Russian leader\u2019s late-night speech, in which he recognised the independence of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, Muscovites were digesting what Putin\u2019s decision could mean for them and their futures. While he ended his address by \u201ccongratulating\u201d fellow Russians on the recognition of the two territories, a celebratory mood was absent in the capital, with many fretting about the political and economic consequences his decision might have. \u201cIf the recognition brings peace to the region, fine, why not do it,\u201d said Andrei, a regional director at a large logistics firm in Moscow. \u201cBut it is already costing me money. I have invested a lot of my savings in shares of Russian companies.\u201d Read the full article here. Australia prime minister Scott Morrison will hold a meeting with the country\u2019s National Security Committee to discuss next steps with regards to the Russia-Ukraine situation. Further sanctions will likely be imposed against Russia. During a speech today updating on the Russia-Ukraine situation, US president Joe Biden warned that \u201cthis is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine\u201d, adding that he hopes diplomacy is still an option. In his remarks, the US president warned Putin has taken steps to invade Ukraine, adding that the Russian president \u201cbizarrely\u201d claimed two Ukrainian territories were no longer a part of Ukraine. Biden said: \u201cWho in the Lord\u2019s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries?\u201d \u201cTo put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,\u201d he said, adding that Putin\u2019s actions are a \u201cflagrant violation of international law\u201d. But Biden said the US and its allies are still open to exploring a diplomatic option with Russia to avoid a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d: \u201cThe United States and our allies and partners remain open to diplomacy \u2013 if it\u2019s serious.\u201d Biden announced that further sanctions will be imposed on Russia, targeting Russian banks and debts, among other things. Biden also noted that such sanctions will go beyond those implemented in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea. While Biden said his administration is working to reduce the financial burden such sanctions will have on American households, especially on the price of gas domestically, he said: \u201cDefending freedom will have cost for us as well, here at home ... But as we do this, I\u2019m going to take robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at the Russian economy, not ours.\u201d The US president, Joe Biden, is currently giving remarks with updates on the Russia-Ukraine situation, including an announcement of sanctions being rolled out starting tomorrow. This story is developing \u2013 stay tuned. The Guardian US political blog is also reporting on Biden\u2019s speech here. The US embassy in Kyiv tweeted support to the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, about his decision to freeze Nord Stream 2, the controversial natural gas pipeline that would link Germany to Russia. From the US Embassy Kyiv Twitter account: We applaud German Chancellor Sholz\u2019s decision to freeze NS2. Strong Allied unity in the face of Russian aggression. More will follow. A meeting between the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has been cancelled. From the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Vivian Salama: Poland is \u201cquite well prepared to welcome a lot of Ukrainians\u201d fleeing a Russian offensive in their country, the EU\u2019s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, told AFP. Speaking after talks with Poland\u2019s deputy interior minister, Bartosz Grodecki, on his country\u2019s plans and preparations to handle various scenarios that might be thrown up by Moscow\u2019s actions, she said: I must say that I\u2019m quite convinced that Poland is quite well prepared to welcome a lot of Ukrainians if necessary. Johansson did not advance any estimate of how many Ukrainians might seek shelter in Poland from Russian military action, nor details of the plans drawn up by Warsaw. France has accused Vladimir Putin of failing to respect his country\u2019s commitments to key international accords including the 2014 Minsk agreement, AFP reports. In a statement following the unanimous decision by the EU\u2019s 27 member states to impose new sanctions on Russia, France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said the Russian president \u201cno longer honours Russia\u2019s signature\u201d. Referring to the separatist-held areas of Donetsk and Lugansk in Ukraine, Le Drian said: President Putin doesn\u2019t honour his own commitments, because he stated publicly that the idea of a vote by the Duma resulting in recognition of the two republics \u2026 was not on the agenda. The Minsk agreement was also Russia\u2019s signature, Putin\u2019s own, renewed at a meeting in Paris in December 2019. Asked if the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had been misled by Putin with false hopes of a breakthrough, Le Drian said the French leader \u201cknows the methods, character and cynicism\u201d of his Russian counterpart. The government in Kyiv is unlikely to accept any of Putin\u2019s ultimatums, which would involve voluntarily handing over large swathes of its territory and endorsing the annexation of Crimea. Before Putin spoke, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had addressed the country saying: We will give nothing away, we fear nothing and nobody. Even dropping the country\u2019s bid for Nato membership would be political suicide, much less agreeing to the dismemberment of the country. The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, responded indirectly to Putin\u2019s evening speech, underlining Ukraine\u2019s ties to the west by revealing that he had renewed requests to the European Union for a path to membership. At a memorial service for a soldier killed on the frontline, the minister of defence, Oleksii Reznikov, accused Putin of trying to rebuild the Soviet empire: The Kremlin has made yet another step towards resurrection of the Soviet Union, with a new Warsaw Pact and Berlin Wall. The only thing that stands in between is Ukraine and its army. Increasingly in Kyiv, there was a sense that Russia had decided to escalate military conflict with Ukraine, and the only remaining question was scale. Bohdan Yaremenko, MP and member of parliament\u2019s foreign policy committee, said: Unfortunately, there are more and more confirmations that such a decision by Russia is a reality. As Russia abandons diplomacy as a tool for resolving the conflict, Ukraine has no choice but to prepare to defend its territory. We expect that \u2026 the democratic countries of the world, which respect international law and reject military force as a mechanism for establishing borders, will express their position by applying sanctions against the Russian Federation. Officials also called on western allies to come good on their promises of a strong response to Russian aggression, after criticism that some sanctions including those unveiled by the UK seemed limited in scope and target. This is a public ultimatum to Ukraine and the west, said Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the ministry of interior. He said it left Ukrainians with no option \u201cexcept to resist all the ways we have\u201d. In Kyiv there was both gratitude for western responses and frustration that some did not seem to go very far. UK sanctions targeted only individuals and smaller banks. The unfolding crisis in Ukraine poses a diplomatic dilemma for China but also offers an opportunity for Beijing as Joe Biden\u2019s administration is likely to continue to be distracted by Russia ahead of the US mid-term elections later this year. China\u2019s position in this round of Russia v the west is under particularly heavy scrutiny following Xi Jinping\u2019s pledge with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on 4 February that there would be \u201cno \u2018forbidden\u2019 areas of cooperation\u201d in their bilateral relationship. In the last few days, as the crisis in Ukraine dominated international headlines, Chinese analysts have debated the country\u2019s policy choice. While hardliners advocate a pro-Russia foreign policy, others think Beijing should seize on this crisis to protect ties with Washington. \u201cChina ultimately wants good relations with the US,\u201d said Wang Huiyao, president of the Centre for China and Globalisation, a Beijing-based thinktank, who also advises the government. It is true that Beijing and Moscow have pledged closer cooperation, because both countries have similar concerns over external involvement in their own security issues, Wang said, adding that China sees some parallels in Nato\u2019s eastward expansion with its own concerns relating to the South China Sea, which, he said \u201cshould all be resolved by the countries in the region without foreign interference\u201d. Russia has said it will evacuate its diplomatic staff from Ukraine to \u201cprotect their lives and safety\u201d. A statement from the foreign ministry said: Our first priority is to take care of Russian diplomats and employees of the embassy and consulates general. To protect their lives and safety, the Russian leadership decided to evacuate staff of Russian missions in Ukraine, which will be implemented in the very near future. A military convoy of more than 100 trucks with soldiers was seen heading in the direction of the Ukrainian border in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, according to a witness who spoke to Reuters. Vladimir Putin can still avoid a full-blown war of choice, the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said at the start of talks at the Pentagon with Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Austin condemned Russia\u2019s \u201clatest invasion\u201d of Ukraine but said the United States is working with allies to prevent the conflict from growing. He said the US will continue to work closely with Kyiv and allies \u201cin trying to find a way to avoid further conflict\u201d, and praised Ukraine\u2019s \u201cmeasured response\u201d in calling for a peaceful solution \u201cin the face of Russia\u2019s aggression, provocations and false accusations.\u201d The US president, Joe Biden, is expected to deliver remarks on Ukraine and Russia in the next few minutes. For live updates from Biden\u2019s speech, head over to our US politics live blog. I will continue here with our global coverage of the Ukraine crisis, and post the top lines that emerge from the White House. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is talking in Brussels following the unveiling of EU sanctions. She says she welcomes the package of sanctions against Russia. Russia is not respecting its international obligations and it is violating core principle of international law. Russia has manufactured this crisis and is responsible for the current escalation. She says the decision by Germany to halt the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project is \u201cabsolutely right\u201d. Nord Stream 2 has to be assessed in light of the security of energy supply for the whole European Union. This crisis shows us that Europe is still too dependent on Russian gas. She adds that the European Union is \u201cunited and acting fast\u201d: Our action today is in response to Russia\u2019s aggressive behaviour. If Russia continues to escalate this crisis that it has created, we are ready to take further action in response. European Union foreign ministers agreed on Tuesday to sanction 27 Russians and entities, as well banks, the defence sector and limiting Russian access to European capital markets, Reuters reports. All members of Russia\u2019s Duma, parliament\u2019s lower house, will be hit with EU sanctions, which typically involve travel bans and asset freezes. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, told a news conference alongside France\u2019s foreign minister at a meeting in Paris: This package of sanctions that has been approved by unanimity by the member states will hurt Russia, and it will hurt a lot. We have been asking people living in Ukraine to share their reaction to the situation. Here are some views: \u2018Staying means psychological pressure\u2019 Roman, a 37-year-old software developer, based near Kyiv: Putin\u2019s actions were predictable, Russia wouldn\u2019t have attacked directly as it would mean immediate sanctions. But now they have greater leverage. I think there will be high tensions for a long time. If we stay here, we stay under psychological pressure. Last night I was discussing leaving with my wife and she was crying. We don\u2019t want to leave here, it\u2019s a very nice place to live. I have three children aged 10, eight and six-months. We also have a cat which makes it difficult to move abroad. It doesn\u2019t feel good. We\u2019ve been looking at immediate flights to Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, but because of visa reasons we\u2019d need to return fairly quickly. It\u2019s expensive and only solves the immediate problem. We decided not to leave right now, but wait three to five weeks and try to move to western Ukraine, near the Slovakian border. \u2018The level of anxiety is high but we\u2019re not sitting back, I have shooting lessons this weekend\u2019 Iryna, a 32-year-old thinktank co-founder in Kyiv: I don\u2019t plan to go anywhere, this is our home and it\u2019s the place we have to defend. With my friends we are going to a shooting lesson this weekend and we\u2019re planning to receive permission to have guns at home, which takes between two weeks and one month for the papers. People with small children or elderly people are thinking about moving to western Ukraine, but others want to defend their home. No one else is going to help us. We\u2019re not expecting a big war but we have to be ready. A lot of people are taking medical courses. Some of the sanctions have been disappointing. Germany cancelling the pipeline was good, and the UK\u2019s actions were a strong move. We\u2019re waiting to see what the US will do. The level of anxiety is high but you have to manage. There is no place for you to relax and be calm. We\u2019re not going to just sit and wait. \u2018I don\u2019t think there will be a big war, but I keep the car tank refuelled just in case\u2019 Maksym, a 24-year-old web developer in the city of Lviv, western Ukraine: I\u2019m worrying about Donetsk and Luhansk and about if Ukraine starts a mobilisation. But I think this will be the end of the conflict, a big war will be really bad for Russia, it won\u2019t be able to sell its gas. My friends think the same, and even if a big war does happen, they think it won\u2019t impact western Ukraine as much. If it turns to active war I would leave the country \u2013 possibly to somewhere like Cyprus. But for now I\u2019m just working, it just looks like a normal day here, everything is good for now. However, I keep the car tank refuelled and I plan to withdraw funds from bank accounts just in case. I have a friend from about 150 miles near Donetsk, and she\u2019s worrying, she doesn\u2019t know whether she needs to leave. If you\u2019re in Ukraine and want to share views or experiences with us you can do that here. Russia\u2019s recognition of two separatist regions of Ukraine and its decision to send troops are the start of a new invasion, the US deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, said. In a statement to an extraordinary meeting of the OSCE, she said: Make no mistake: Yesterday\u2019s actions are the beginning of the latest Russian invasion of Ukraine. She added: We are on the precipice of a dark and dangerous era. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have spoken about the \u201cchilling developments in Ukraine\u201d, a No 10 spokesperson said. A Downing Street spokesperson said: The prime minister updated President Macron on the new sanctions he unveiled against Russia today, and the leaders agreed they needed to continue to work in lockstep to target Russian individuals and entities bankrolling President Putin\u2019s aggressive approach.\u201d The prime minister said that President Putin\u2019s actions were a gross violation of international law, and by sending forces into Eastern Ukraine he had ripped up the Budapest and Minsk agreements. The two leaders agreed that Russia\u2019s actions \u201cdon\u2019t just threaten Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, but are a blatant attack on freedom and democracy\u201d, the spokesperson added. The pair reiterated that together, the UK and France were working to reinforce Europe\u2019s borders and defend European security against increasing Russian aggression. More from Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, speaking at a briefing in Brussels. He said Nato allies have more than 100 warplanes on high alert and more than 120 warships ready at sea from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean Sea. He said Nato response force remains on high readiness but is not yet being deployed, although some allies are moving troops, ships and planes into the Baltic states and near the Black Sea to defend other Nato members. Nato has to respond when we see aggressive actions by Russia, but we continue to strive for dialogue, for de-escalation and we believe it is important to talk. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will support the territorial claims of its proxy states in east Ukraine, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a larger war in the near future. Putin confirmed that Russia had recognised the expanded borders of the two Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine in remarks to the press. \u201cWe recognised the states,\u201d he said. That means we recognised all of their fundamental documents, including the constitution, where it is written that their [borders] are the territories at the time the two regions were part of Ukraine. His dry explanation has explosive consequences: Russia could use the territorial claims as a cause to launch an invasion of more Ukrainian territory, saying it was defending the interests of its proxy states in Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin stopped short of saying that he was about to launch a further invasion. But we expect, and I want to underline this, that all the difficult questions will be solved during negotiations between the current Kyiv government and the leadership of this government. But Kyiv has always resisted negotiating directly with the governments of the Russian-controlled territories, saying it wants to speak with Moscow directly. Having recognised the territories and received authorisation to use military force abroad on Tuesday evening, it has become clear that Russia is building the framework for what could be a broader conflict in Ukraine. All three Baltic states called for tough economic sanctions to be levied now against Russia in the margins of the Joint Expeditionary Force meeting \u2013 and called for more British and other Nato troops to deploy in their countries and around eastern Europe. Artis Pabriks, Latvia\u2019s defence minister, was the most outspoken, calling for tough sanctions to be introduced now. This should \u201cinclude everything which is economically painful\u201d including banking, energy and oligarchs \u201cmust be personally targeted\u201d \u2013 while Britain should \u201ccertainly\u201d clean up the flow of dirty money in London. A former soldier who served unwillingly, he said, in Soviet forces, he said Putin could not be appeased and was weighing up whether to invade Ukraine based, in part, on the strength of the West\u2019s response. If we are mild today, then instead of spilling money, we will spill blood, because he [Putin] will not stop? Kalle Lannet, the defence minister of Estonia, said \u201cwe need to orient more of these sanctions towards oligarchs\u201d while Margiris Abukevicius, the deputy defence minister of Lithuania, called for a \u201cdoubling of the number\u201d of Nato forces in eastern Europe. Nato currently operates four battle groups of about 1,500 in Estonia \u2013 led by the UK \u2013 Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, with the creation of similar forces being considered for Romania and Bulgaria. Both the US and the UK have already sent additional forces to the region. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, describes an \u201carmed to the teeth Ukraine\u201d as \u201canti-Russia\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Speaking at a briefing in Moscow, Putin says Russia is \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about the threat of Ukraine developing nuclear weapons. He claims Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s recent remarks deploring Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal in 1994 were \u201ctargeted at Russia\u201d, and says the only thing that Ukraine lacks in this regard is the systems to enrich uranium. Asked whether Russian troops will be deployed to the separatist-held republics or go beyond that, Putin does not give a straight answer. I didn\u2019t say they will go there straight after our meeting. He adds that deployment of troops to Ukraine depends on the situation on the ground. In the wake of Russia\u2019s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, Ukrainians took to social media to pledge they would no longer speak Russian. Alex Cooper, a well known restaurateur, was one of them. I was born in Bessarabia, since childhood my friends and I spoke a mix of three or four languages. In my family, everyone spoke Ukrainian with Cherkasy touches, because my mother is from that region, and I always considered it my homeland. Then after 10 years in Odessa for school and higher education, I continued to think in Ukrainian, but I spoke Russian, because it was more convenient. But at the moment I see no option for myself other than to stay in Ukraine, work honestly, do my job even better, do new projects and speak Ukrainian. Another woman with family in Russia said: My name is Katya, I am 31 years old, I thought and spoke in Russian every day. My closest, most dearly loved people live in Russia \u2013 my mother, grandmother, sister and nephews. I love, adore and respect them infinitely. I am in excruciating pain for this language gap, but I am grown up and an independent person. And I don\u2019t even want to be lexically involved in this madness. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, says the Minsk agreements \u201cno longer exists\u201d, Reuters reports. Addressing reporters at a second news conference in Moscow this afternoon, Putin says the \u201cbest decision that Ukraine could take would be to renounce its Nato membership ambitions\u201d. He says Russia will provide military assistance to rebels in the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. If there is a conflict of course, if it is necessary, we will follow through on the obligations we took. We\u2019re counting on resolution of all these differences. These differences will be sorted out between Kyiv, and Luhansk and Donetsk regions. But for the moment we understand that this is probably impossible in this current situation but we\u2019re hoping for this in the future. Putin called for international recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, claiming Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula should be internationally recognized as a legitimate reflection of the local population\u2019s choice. The White House has now said that the US president, Joe Biden, will deliver remarks on the Ukraine crisis at 6pm UK time (1pm EST). The address will provide \u201can update on Russia and Ukraine,\u201d the White House said, bringing forward the scheduled time by one hour. Russia has not stopped planning for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine since recognising the independence of separatist enclaves, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. \u201cEvery indication is that Russia is continuing to plan for a full-scale attack of Ukraine,\u201d Stoltenberg tells reporters. We see the ongoing military build up... We see that more and more of the forces are moving out of the camps and are in combat formations and ready to strike. And we see the ongoing provocations in Donbas and the different false flag operations where they tried to create a pretext for an attack. And then of course we saw last night that further Russian troops moved into Donbas, into parts of Donetsk and Luhansk. And then we have the threatening rhetoric, which was actually confirmed in the speech of President Putin yesterday. Stoltenberg goes on to insist it\u2019s \u201cnever too late\u201d for Russia not to attack. We continue to call on Russia to step back, to de-escalate, and to engage in good faith in diplomatic efforts to find a political solution. Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament has unanimously voted this afternoon in favour of giving Putin the authority to deploy Russia\u2019s armed forces abroad for what it described as a \u201cpeacekeeping mission\u201d in two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine. The vote formally allows Putin to send troops into the Donbas region of Ukraine. The decision takes immediate effect, one of the lawmakers said as they discussed the motion. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, speaking at a news briefing in Brussels, continues: We commend Ukraine for its restraint in not responding to Russia\u2019s repeated provocations. He insists that the military alliance will continue to provide Ukraine with \u201cstrong political support\u201d. This is a crisis created by Russia alone. He commends Ukraine for its \u201crestraint\u201d in not responding to Russia\u2019s \u201crepeated provocations\u201d, adding that Nato is \u201cunited in their full support of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territory integrity\u201d. We will continue to provide Ukraine with strong political support and allies are providing equipment to help Ukraine defend itself as well as sustained financial support. Nato is \u201cresolute and united in its determination to protect and defend all allies\u201d, he adds. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, describes the Ukraine crisis as \u201cthe most dangerous moment for European security in a generation\u201d. Stoltenberg is speaking at a news conference in Brussels: Moscow has moved from covert attempts to destabilise Ukraine to overt military action. He adds the move was a \u201cserious escalation by Russia and a flagrant violation of international law\u201d. Vladimir Putin has asked legislators for permission to use force outside Russia, which could pave the way for a broader attack on Ukraine, AP reports. The Russian president asked the upper house of parliament for permission to use Russia\u2019s armed forces abroad after formally recognising two eastern Ukrainian regions, the chamber\u2019s speaker said. Addressing the chamber during a part of an evening session that was broadcast on the chamber\u2019s website, one of Russia\u2019s deputy defence ministers said that Russia had been left with no choice, and asked to approve a deployment abroad. The US president, Joe Biden, will deliver remarks at 7pm UK time (2pm ET) to provide an update on the situation concerning Russia and Ukraine, the White House has said. From Lauren Gambino, our US political correspondent: Ukraine is cautiously optimistic that its allies are finally listening to Kyiv about the need to impose sanctions on Russia, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said. Speaking at a briefing, Kuleba said he would have more talks with US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and that separately he had contacted the UK and other countries with additional requests for weapons. Kuleba separately welcomed the move by Germany to put the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on hold, tweeting that it was a \u201cmorally, politically and practically correct step\u201d. Human Rights Watch has highlighted Russia\u2019s track record for bombing civilian infrastructure in Syria\u2019s conflict and voiced fear \u201cwar crimes strategy\u201d could be repeated in Ukraine if the conflict escalates further, AFP reports. HRW chief, Kenneth Roth, warned the region could \u201cbe on the verge of a significant armed conflict\u201d and that given Russia\u2019s recent behaviour during Syria\u2019s civil war, that was a deeply worrying prospect. Speaking to reporters during a video briefing, Roth said the Syrian government and its Russian ally \u201cshowed callous disregard\u201d for civilian life in late 2020 as they strived to retake the Idlib province and surrounding areas in northwest Syria. The nearly year-long Idlib bombing campaign \u201cgives us a sense of the way the Russian military has been fighting recently\u201d, Roth said, adding that Russian bombers were \u201cdeliberately attacking civilian institutions to try to make life unlivable and make it easier for the Syrian military to roll in\u201d. During this time, he said, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, \u201chad command responsibility\u201d, and had given top honours to the \u201ccommanders who were overseeing this war crimes strategy\u201d. Roth said: We are deeply concerned that this war crimes strategy (could) be replicated in the case of Ukraine should armed conflict break out there. The Kremlin regrets Germany\u2019s suspension of certification of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany, Interfax news agency reported, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The Kremlin hopes the delay of Nord Stream 2 is temporary, Interfax quoted Peskov as saying on Tuesday. (Via Reuters) More from Shaun on that apparent decision from Turkish Airlines ... The White House has begun referring to Russian troop deployments in eastern Ukraine as an \u201cinvasion\u201d, AP reports. Several European leaders said earlier in the day that Russian troops had moved into rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine after Putin recognised their independence \u2013 but some indicated it was not yet the long-feared, full-fledged invasion. The White House, which had been reluctant to use the word \u201cinvasion\u201d, signalled a shift in its own position on Tuesday. \u201cWe think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia\u2019s latest invasion into Ukraine,\u201d said Jon Finer, principal deputy national security adviser. He said \u201clatest\u201d was important. \u201cAn invasion is an invasion and that is what is under way.\u201d The White House decided to begin referring to Russia\u2019s actions as an \u201cinvasion\u201d because of the situation on the ground, according to a US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The administration resisted initially calling the deployment of troops because the White House wanted to see what Russia was actually going to do. After assessing Russian troop movements, it became clear it was a new invasion, the official added. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, wrapped up the Joint Expeditionary Force conference of 10 European defence ministers in Britain \u2013 mostly from the Baltic and Nordic countries \u2013 with a challenge to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s view of history: If you want to know what his next intentions are, I recommend you listen to his latest speech that he made last night, full of huge inaccuracies, one of them is that Ukraine is not a proper state. I should remind people Ukraine has been separate to Russia as a nation longer than it\u2019s been part of Russia. That\u2019s a simple fact of history. You should look at the history books and not selectively pick dates that suit the narrative. The conference, held in Belvoir Castle, wrapped up a couple of hours earlier in response to the Ukraine crisis, with all 10 defence ministers \u201cunited in our condemnation\u201d of Russia\u2019s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, \u201cthe buildup of Russian forces on the border with Ukraine, and further incursion in the Donbas region\u201d. Navalny not holding back here, as Shaun points out. Jessica Elgot, the Guardian\u2019s chief political correspondent, on the disappointment with which the UK government\u2019s sanctions package has been met. The UN human rights chief has warned that a military escalation in Ukraine would significantly increase the risk of serious violations, AFP reports. Michelle Bachelet said in a statement that she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d following Putin\u2019s decision to recognise the independence of eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk and Luhansk separatist republics. \u201cAny significant escalation in military action creates a heightened risk of serious human rights violations as well as violations of international humanitarian law,\u201d Bachelet said. The UN high commissioner for human rights stressed that \u201cat this critical juncture, the priority, above all, must be to prevent a further escalation, and to prevent civilian casualties, displacement and destruction of civilian infrastructure\u201d. \u201cI call on all sides to cease hostilities and to pave the way for dialogue instead of setting the stage for further violence,\u201d she added. The UN rights agency, she said, would \u201ccontinue to monitor the situation closely from our offices on both sides of the contact line in the east of the country\u201d. Or, as Shaun Walker puts it \u2026 It appears the US embassy in Kyiv is engaging in some Moscow baiting \u2026 Vladimir Putin\u2019s angry and rambling hour-long potted history of Ukraine\u2019s failings on Monday night, culminating in a commitment to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk, left western diplomats scratching their heads and wondering whether they had been made redundant. The European Union is set to activate an EU cyber response team to help Ukraine face Russian attacks, Lithuania\u2019s deputy defence minister, Margiris Abukevicius, tweeted. On Monday, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Russia had been using hybrid tactics to \u201cescalate the situation\u201d. Russian-backed separatist leader Denis Pushilin said on Tuesday that Moscow formally recognised the breakaway region of Donetsk within the wider boundaries of eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, much of which is controlled by Ukrainian forces. Speaking on Russian state television, Pushilin said the matter of the territory not controlled by separatists would be resolved later. \u201cThe border issue is not simple, it will be resolved later,\u201d he said. (Via Reuters) A little explanation from our central and eastern Europe correspondent, Shaun Walker, on what this matters: The territory currently controlled by the so-called people\u2019s republics is less than half of the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but both entities claim sovereignty over the whole regions. In the summer of 2014, the Ukrainian army took back control over many towns that had initially been seized by Russia-backed separatists. If Russia recognises the territories in those borders, it raises the threat of a potential military campaign to retake them. Russia has announced recognition of two new republics inside Ukraine\u2019s borders, but Putin\u2019s spokesman won\u2019t define how big they are. The UK has imposed sanctions on five Russian banks and three high net-worth individuals. Prime minister Boris Johnson is speaking to parliament now. He says this is just the \u201cfirst tranche\u201d and there will be more. More details from our Brussels bureau chief Daniel Boffey on possible EU sanctions: Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, presidents of the European council and commission in Brussels, have issued a statement that for the first time sketches out the areas in which the EU wants to hit Russia with sanctions. The proposals will need to garner unanimous support from the member states whose foreign ministers are meeting this afternoon. The two EU institutional leaders suggest that the bloc is prepared to go further than expected, given that Josep Borrell, the EU high representative for foreign affairs, had earlier suggested the Russian move into the Donbas was not a \u201cfully fledged invasion\u201d. They say that the package contains the following proposals: to target those who were involved in the illegal decision. to target banks that are financing Russian military and other operations in those territories. to target the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU\u2019s capital and financial markets and services, to limit the financing of escalatory and aggressive policies. to target trade from the two Russian-controlled territories to and from the EU, to ensure that those responsible clearly feel the economic consequences of their illegal and aggressive actions. UK prime minister Boris Johnson will speak in parliament imminently. He is expected to announce the \u201cfirst barrage of UK economic sanctions against Russia\u201d. Readers: You can follow the speech on the Guardian\u2019s UK politics live blog. We are not expecting to see Russia\u2019s parliament act against Putin, but for completionist sake, the upper house of parliament just voted unanimously to approve friendship treaties with two self-proclaimed people\u2019s republics in eastern Ukraine. Yesterday I interviewed Oleh Synehubov, the governor of the Ukrainian municipality of Kharkiv. We spoke in the Stalin-era regional administration building in the centre of the city. Kharkiv is a city of nearly 1.5 million people \u2013 mainly Russian-speaking \u2013 and sits just across the border from Russia. I asked him what the plans were in the event of a Russian invasion. He told me that at the first sign of \u201canomalous\u201d activity at the border he would be called into the office and an operation would start to warn citizens of a Russian attack. He said: There is a clear plan of action. To start with there will be warning signals for all citizens. There will be television, radio and internet announcements, messages to mobile phones, sirens will sound, patrol cars and fire engines will go through the city with loudspeakers to tell people what to do. Special measures would be taken at military sites and other strategic locations, and special efforts would be made to evacuate places such as care homes and schools, he added. The exact plan \u2013 whether the orders to people were to find the nearest bomb shelter, or whether an evacuation would be instigated \u2013 would depend on the kind of invasion, he said. If it\u2019s an artillery attack, then it\u2019s clear everyone has to go to bomb shelters, if it\u2019s a full-scale invasion then we are already in a zone of military action and there would be an evacuation. \u201cI hope that we will not have to put this plan into action,\u201d he told me, adding that the local parliament had a regular week of work, including reviewing the annual budget on Thursday. Here\u2019s a quick recap of developments so far today: Germany\u2019s chancellor says he won\u2019t certify a key gas pipeline from Russia as the situation has \u201cfundamentally changed\u201d after Putin ordered troops over Ukraine\u2019s border. The UK government believes the Russian invasion of Ukraine has already begun. The health minister, Sajid Javid, says it is clear Russian president Vladimir Putin has decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine. The west has struggled to maintain unity in response to the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine as the UK and the EU prepared to unveil the scale and scope of the sanctions to be imposed on the Kremlin. Moscow is sending mixed signals about whether it will seek to conquer more territory in east Ukraine. Donetsk and Luhansk claim they should have more territory \u2013 but so far it\u2019s unclear whether Moscow is recognising the existing borders or the area they want to control. UK government reminding all Britons to leave Ukraine now ... The United Nations is relocating some of its non-essential staff and their family members in Ukraine, AFP reports. \u201cWe are committed to staying and to continue delivering in Ukraine, especially in eastern Ukraine,\u201d UN spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci told reporters in Geneva. We continue to be fully operational.\u201d She acknowledged though that \u201cas a result of the evolving situation on the ground, we have allowed for temporary relocation of some non-essential staff and some dependents\u201d. The UN has 1,510 staff members in Ukraine, including 149 international staff, Vellucci said. In all, around 100 staff members are based in the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. There have been warnings that a scale-up in the conflict could displace millions of people and cause a humanitarian crisis. The UN refugee agency said on Tuesday that for now it was not seeing any increased movements outside the eastern regions. But \u201cthe situation does remain unpredictable,\u201d spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo told reporters in Geneva. Meanwhile, the UN humanitarian agency OCHA warned that it was seeing reports of increased hostilities in the east of Ukraine, which has been wracked by conflict for eight years already. Spokesman Jens Laerke said the UN was continuing to follow a humanitarian response plan put in place before the latest escalation in tensions, including most recently sending an aid convoy into the non-government-controlled areas last Friday. He warned though that even that response lacks funding, stressing that the best preparation for what could possibly be a dramatic increase in needs was to finance the existing aid efforts on the ground. We stand united with Ukraine. We will not walk away. We will continue to support you in every possible way. I praise the Ukrainian leaders who, despite constant provocations, remain calm and express willingness to solve this conflict peacefully. Russia must end the intolerable provocations and stop fuelling the conflict, which has been ongoing for eight years. Moscow should immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from Ukraine\u2019s territory and its immediate vicinity. We strongly condemn all military and hybrid actions against Ukraine. We regret that despite diplomatic efforts, there are no signs of willingness to de-escalate \u2013 quite the opposite, [with] the buildup of Russian forces continues, including in Belarus. I align myself with everyone who wishes we had a way to secure peace through the force of diplomacy and dialogue. Indeed, it is a decisive moment in European history. President Putin will answer to future generations for his violent actions. As European and western leaders, we also have the responsibility to step up to our values [and] our commitment to a Europe that is united and at peace. We regret every single life lost. It is our duty to protect our common values and the democracy we all helped to build. A threat to Ukraine is a threat to the security of Europe. The minimum we can do is to step up our practical support to Ukraine, which Estonia has done and will continue to do. In the EU, we will deliver on a massive package of sanctions and do so swiftly and decisively. But most importantly we must keep the door to EU and Nato open for Ukraine and we must have concrete next steps for further cooperation and integration. We know you will continue to value democracy and remain on the path of reforms. Eventually we will welcome you as the member of the European Union \u2013 you belong in Europe. We support Ukraine\u2019s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We remain fully committed to the policy of non-recognition of illegal annexation of Ukraine\u2019s territories. Ukraine has a right to defend its borders and independence and we continue helping Ukraine to build its military capabilities to stand against the aggression. Greece, which has a large expatriate community in east Ukraine, says diplomats in the region have been placed on alert to help the 120,000-strong community following the latest developments. After an emergency meeting of the government\u2019s foreign affairs and defence council (Kysea), Athens insisted that it was \u201ccompletely synchronised\u201d with its EU and Nato partners, calling Russia\u2019s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk a \u201cviolation of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and of the fundamental principles of international law\u201d. A reinforced consular team in Mariupol, the frontline city where ethnic Greeks are mostly based, was \u201cin a constant state of readiness to provide whatever assistance may be necessary\u201d, the council said in a statement. As tensions have escalated in eastern Ukraine, the plight of ethnic Greeks living there has been highlighted by Athens, with some analysts going so far as to say that Hellenic naval ships could be dispatched to evacuate community members in the event of a full-blown invasion. In 2014, Mariupol briefly came under the control of pro-Russian separatist forces in the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic. Greece\u2019s deputy foreign minister in charge of diaspora affairs, Andreas Katsaniotis, told state-run TV this morning that while Greek citizens, such as teachers, living in the region had returned to Athens, ethnic Greek Ukrainians with roots in the area had stayed put as \u201cthey have roots there that go back years\u201d. \u201cWe are doing whatever we possibly can to assist them,\u201d said Katsaniotis, adding that diplomats had also appealed to Greek media representatives dispatched to Ukraine to make contact with consular staff. Addressing a visiting delegation from Bulgaria following the Kysea meeting, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, emphasised how important the community was for Athens. \u201cOur country has an additional reason for concern when following developments,\u201d he said, \u201cThe protection and support of ethnic Greeks in Ukraine and the very large community in Mariupol which has been present in the region for over 2,000 years.\u201d Moscow is sending mixed signals about whether it will seek to conquer more territory in east Ukraine. The two Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine claim that they should control more territory than they currently do. That includes the large city of Mariupol, which is on the government side of the front lines. If Moscow supports their claim, then Russia could launch an attack to capture that territory. So the key question in Moscow today is whether Russia is recognising the territories\u2019 existing borders \u2013 or the territory they would like to control. Thus far, it\u2019s not clear. A Russian deputy foreign minister gave a direct answer during a press conference that Russia recognises the borders in which those states \u201cexercise their authority and jurisdiction\u201d. That\u2019s fairly straightforward \u2013 Russia supports the status quo. But then Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman answered a similar question. Dmitry Peskov said that the borders are \u201cthose in which they exist and were proclaimed\u201d. Those are different things. The proclaimed borders in 2014 include cities like Mariupol. The current borders do not. So what\u2019s happening? The ambiguity may be intentional, allowing Vladimir Putin to make his decision on the basis of how the west responds to his formal occupation of Ukrainian territory. If he needs a new bargaining chip in his negotiations, he could threaten a new war to capture additional territory. On the other hand, it is possible that many of those speaking just don\u2019t know the answer. Peskov, who was questioned at length by a BBC journalist, said he couldn\u2019t add anything to his talking points. For their part, the authorities in the Russian-controlled territories have said that they continue to view their borders as the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. If Moscow agrees, then a new war is a likely result. Germany has stopped the certification process for the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in reaction to Russia\u2019s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in east Ukraine, chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced. On Tuesday morning, Germany\u2019s energy minister, Robert Habeck, instructed the withdrawal of a positive assessment required to authorise the pipeline between Russia and Germany. \u201cWithout this certification Nord Stream 2 cannot go into operation,\u201d Scholz said at a press conference in Berlin at midday. The German leader described Putin\u2019s recognition of the Russian-controlled territories as a \u201cgrave breach\u201d of international law that broke with decades of agreements between Russia and the west. \u201cThe situation today is fundamentally different.\u201d Ambassadors for the 27 EU member states met this morning in Brussels to discuss the next steps with regard to sanctions against Russia. Concerning divisions have emerged, diplomatic sources tell me. The EU\u2019s foreign affairs wing, the European external action service (EEAS), proposed sanctioning 27 persons and entities involved in the Kremlin\u2019s decision to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk; the 351 members of the Duma who voted in favour of it, and the 11 who proposed it, along with the commanders of the Russian military \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d mission. Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government in Hungary has refused to support the move at this stage. \u201cThey stressed the importance of dialogue and wanted to reconvene with [Budapest]\u201d, a diplomat said. \u201cIt was to be expected but Orb\u00e1n has now really shown his true colours. Again, this begs the question where Orb\u00e1n loyalty is: to Moscow or his European allies? And the question of how much more of this blocking behaviour other leaders can swallow.\u201d A wider sanctions package is being worked on by the European Commission, mirroring the sanctions imposed at the time of the annexation of Crimea by Russia. This, it is said, will have a strong impact on imports and exports to Russia and Russian banks. Sources said there were also, however, \u201csome worrying signals regarding the broader sanctions package\u201d. According to one diplomat, Austria, Germany and Italy stressed the importance of incrementalism. The source said: \u201cThis fetish for incremental steps really raises questions on these countries\u2019 willingness to approve the \u2018big bang\u2019 sanctions package when we need it.\u201d It is expected that the EEAS proposal will be finalised or early tomorrow with the commission proposals due to take longer. Any sanctions package requires unanimity. Nord Stream 2, the 750-mile pipeline connecting Russia and Germany, has been completed but has not yet certified by Germany\u2019s energy regulator. These words, via my colleague Philip Oltermann, suggest the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has decided to pull the plug on the pipeline because of the Ukraine crisis. Here\u2019s Reuters with some more context on reports that Russia recognises the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk within the borders they currently control. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Tuesday questioned whether Ukraine had a right to sovereignty because he said the government in Kyiv did not represent the country\u2019s constituent parts, the Interfax news agency reported. \u201cIf we talk about the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity, one of the key documents \u2026 is the declaration on principles of international law concerning friendly relations among peoples,\u201d he was quoted as saying. Lavrov accused Ukraine of being out of line with that since 2014 when a Moscow-backed president was overthrown in Kyiv and replaced by a pro-western leader, prompting Russia to annex Ukraine\u2019s peninsula of Crimea and back an insurgency in its eastern regions. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can claim that the Ukrainian regime, since the 2014 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, represents all the people living on the territory of the Ukrainian state,\u201d Lavrov was quoted as saying. RUSSIA\u2019S FOREIGN MINISTRY SAYS RUSSIA RECOGNISES BREAKAWAY UKRAINIAN REPUBLICS WITHIN BORDERS THAT THEY CURRENTLY CONTROL - IFAX (Via Reuters) My colleague Paul Macinnes reports that Uefa is ready to drop St Petersburg as the venue for this year\u2019s Champions League final as the military crisis in Ukraine deepens. As Andrew Roth points out (see here), the key question today is whether Russia recognises the Luhansk and Donetsk People\u2019s republics in their existing borders - or claims their 2014 borders. This includes territory controlled by Ukraine. One possible precedent is Georgia, where Russia fought a five-day war in August 2008. There are ominous parallels. The Kremlin sent troops from breakaway South Ossetia into Georgia \u201cproper\u201d. Vladimir Putin did not ultimately seize the Georgian capital Tbilisi. But he did capture additional territory and restore the old Soviet border of South Ossetia. This included seizing the town of Akhalgori, where Georgian and South Ossetian residents had previously lived peacefully together under Georgian government control. The operation was simple. Russian troops blocked a mountain road with an armoured vehicle and stationed what it said were \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d in Akhalgori\u2019s main square. The town today is under separatist control. Analysts believe an attempt to repeat Georgia in 2022 would be much harder, and more bloody, and involve a full-scale war with the Ukrainian military. Reuters has this on Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, calling Russia\u2019s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Nato member Turkey is a maritime neighbour with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. Erdo\u011fan has offered to mediate in the conflict, warned Russia against invading Ukraine, and criticised the west\u2019s handling of the crisis. Speaking to reporters on a flight over Africa, Erdo\u011fan said: We see this decision by Russia as unacceptable. We repeat our call for common sense and respect for international law by all sides. Italy has condemned Russia\u2019s decision to recognise Russian-controlled territory in Luhansk and Donetsk. \u201cThe decision of the Russian authorities to recognise the so-called separatist republics of Luhansk and Donetsk is to be condemned as a violation of the Minsk agreements,\u201d Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said in a statement. Di Maio said the decision \u201crepresents a serious obstacle in the path towards a diplomatic solution of the Ukrainian crisis\u201d. He added: \u201cItaly is in constant contact with European and Atlantic partners to coordinate the response to the announcement by the President of the Russian Federation.\u201d The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Donetsk is responding to severe water shortages caused after active hostilities put several water stations and pipelines out of order in eastern Ukraine. Today it will dispatch 3,000 litres of potable water to Dokuchaevsk hospital to keep services running, and send 7,000 litres of potable water to Donetsk municipality to distribute to essential facilities. The ICRC will also set up five 5,000-litre capacity water points in Olenovka. The ICRC says its engineers are in close contact with their counterparts at the Voda Donbasa water utility company to get specifications on the equipment needed to restore the activity of the 1st Lift Pumping Station. My colleague Shaun Walker on one of the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s current lines ... China has urged all parties on the Ukraine issue to \u201cremain calm, ease tensions and resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation\u201d. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, also told US secretary of state Anthony Blinken in a phone call today that \u201cthe legitimate security concerns of all countries must be respected\u201d. China\u2019s reaction to Russia\u2019s move in Ukraine has been under heavy scrutiny in recent weeks. On 4 February, China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin pledged \u201cno \u2018forbidden\u2019 areas of cooperation\u201d in the bilateral relationship. But Moscow\u2019s manoeuvre in Ukraine clearly posed a headache for Beijing. On the one hand, like Russia, China is frustrated with its deteriorating relations with the US and its allies. On the other hand, however, it does not foresee much diplomatic gain by fully backing Russia on its action in Ukraine. \u201cThe sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country should be respected and safeguarded,\u201d Wang told the Munich Security Conference by video link over the weekend. \u201cUkraine is no exception.\u201d This from the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, explains the measures the US is taking to protect its diplomatic staff in Ukraine. It also echoes calls for US citizens to get out of Ukraine immediately. For security reasons, Department of State personnel currently in Lviv will spend the night in Poland. Our personnel will regularly return to continue their diplomatic work in Ukraine and provide emergency consular services. They will continue to support the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government, coordinating on diplomatic efforts \u2026 The fact that we are taking prudent precautions for the sake of the safety of US government personnel and US citizens, as we do regularly worldwide, in no way undermines our support for, or our commitment to, Ukraine. Our commitment to Ukraine transcends any one location. We strongly reiterate our recommendation to US citizens to depart Ukraine immediately. The security situation in Ukraine continues to be unpredictable throughout the country and may deteriorate with little notice. Imposing sanctions against Russia is \u201ca question of firmness and credibility\u201d, France\u2019s Europe minister, Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, said as he condemned a \u201cgrave violation\u201d of international law by Russia. Beaune, a close ally of French president Emmanuel Macron, is chairing a routine meeting of EU ministers in Brussels that is being overshadowed by the crisis in Ukraine. With EU foreign ministers holding a separate emergency meeting later on Tuesday, he declined to be drawn on the nature of the EU response, saying it was \u201cnecessary to respond with sanctions adapted to the situation\u201d. Finland\u2019s Europe minister, Tytti Tuppurainen, said Putin had made a historic mistake: \u201cHis actions are in clear violation of international law and sovereignty of Ukraine and its territorial integrity,\u201d she said, vowing a strong and united response from the EU. The EU had prepared sanctions for every scenario, she said. \u201cWe have prepared massive sanctions and we are ready to create severe consequences [for] Russia and Putin.\u201d As diplomats met in Brussels on Tuesday, it remained unclear whether Putin\u2019s order to send troops into Ukraine is the trigger for the massive sanctions the EU has been threatening for weeks. In co-ordinated statements leaders of the EU institutions referred to \u201csanctions against those involved in this illegal act\u201d, suggesting the first response to Russia\u2019s actions might not be sweeping economic sanctions. Lithuania continues to urge the EU to move ahead with economic sanctions against Russia. \u201cHow we react as the European Union will define our character and indeed the future of Europe,\u201d said Lithuania\u2019s deputy Europe minister Arnoldas Pranckevi\u010dius. He called on Europe to move ahead with economic sanctions, double its support to Ukraine - including boosting the physical presence of political and diplomatic leaders in Kyiv - and to rethink its defence posture in the Baltic region. Pranckevi\u010dius said: The [EU sanctions] have to be serious, they have to be real, they should not be symbolic. If we want to deter further actions of President Putin, if we indeed want to stop the war from happening, we need to move ahead with serious measures. Martin Klus, Slovakia\u2019s Europe minister, suggested the EU would start with sanctions against individuals, adding that his country was open to further sanctions against Russia. Ireland\u2019s Europe minister Thomas Byrne said: We have got to ensure that whatever happens that Russia certainly feels the pain and that is going to happen. Today what has happened is a grotesque breach of international law, it\u2019s a grotesque breach of the sovereignty of Ukraine. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has brushed off the threat of sanctions on Tuesday, describing the west\u2019s actions as predictable. Our European, American, British colleagues will not stop and will not calm down until they have exhausted all their possibilities for the so-called \u2018punishment of Russia\u2019. They are already threatening us with all manner of sanctions or, as they say now, \u2018the mother of all sanctions\u2019. Well, we\u2019re used to it. We know that sanctions will be imposed anyway, in any case. With or without reason. (Via Reuters) Russia\u2019s decision to recognise two self-proclaimed regions in eastern Ukraine means the Kremlin has taken another step towards the revival of the Soviet Union, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said on Tuesday: The Kremlin has taken another step towards the revival of the Soviet Union. With the new Warsaw Pact and the new Berlin Wall. (Via Reuters) One of the big questions today will be whether the incursion of Russian troops into eastern Ukraine will spell the end of Nord Stream 2, the pipeline between Russia and Germany that poses an obvious target for sanctions. Following a phone call with US president Joe Biden and France\u2019s Emanuel Macron last night, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, harshly condemned Russia\u2019s actions as \u201ca clear breach of the Minsk Protocol\u201d, vowing that \u201cthis step will not remain unanswered\u201d. But so far Germany\u2019s government has not yet said what its answer will entail. Scholz\u2019s Social Democrat party colleague Michael Roth, the chair of the Bundestag\u2019s foreign policy committee, has called for swift sanctions targeted at \u201cthe oligarchic system, the people who have become rich through Putin\u201d. Roth told Reuters: \u201cThe first sanctions already have to be painful for the Putin system.\u201d The SPD party group\u2019s foreign policy spokesperson, Nils Schmid, warned any reaction to the breach of the Minsk protocol should not affect Germany\u2019s restrictive stance on exporting lethal weapons. \u201cWe should not deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine\u201d, Schmid said. The far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, meanwhile, wants the German government to rule out any sanctions whatsoever, since these would lead to \u201cfurther escalation\u201d. Instead, it proposes an independence referendum in Donetsk and Luhansk, \u201csuch as has been carried out in western European states like Scotland\u201d. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said that Russia had \u201cbroken international law\u201d by unilaterally recognising the self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region. Ukraine, he added, was a sovereign state that had had land \u201ceffectively annexed\u201d from it as Russian troops appeared to be entering the separatist regions overnight. The cabinet minister was speaking at the opening of a day-long meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a forum of 10 European defence ministers from the UK, Nordic and Baltic countries at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. It was a \u201cclear fact that Russia has broken international law,\u201d Wallace said. He added: Many of us were forewarning that President Putin already had an agenda. You heard that agenda in his speech last night. This is a sovereign state that has now had some of its land effectively annexed from it. This is a sovereign state that is a democratic state in Europe, all of us in Europe should worry. Frans Timmermans, the former Dutch foreign minister who is now vice-president of the European commission, has described today as \u201cno doubt one of the darkest days of European history\u201d. Speaking in Paris at the EU Indo-Pacific forum, he said: Russia is no longer the power to dominate, therefore chooses to disrupt. And our reaction to that behaviour is going to determine not just the security of Europe, it is going to determine global security for the years to come. That is why I believe we need to answer this blatant act of disregard for the rule of law and for international law with increased resolve to increase our cooperation across the globe, and especially also with the Indo-Pacific. Meanwhile, the Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, has said the EU should \u201chit Russia where it hurts.\u201d He added: Russia is doing what it always wanted to do, take a piece of territory of Ukraine. We will respond in an appropriate way to what is happening here. It has to be appropriate sanctions, we have to keep a cool head, but we have to show that this leads to a high cost for Russia. EU foreign ministers will decide on the level of sanctions this afternoon. Britain will immediately impose hard economic sanctions on Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, Boris Johnson has said. We will immediately institute a package of economic sanctions. This is, I should stress, just the first barrage of UK economic sanctions against Russia, because we expect I\u2019m afraid that there is more Russian irrational behaviour to come \u2026 [The sanctions] will hit Russia very hard, and there is a lot more that we are going to do in the event of an invasion. Johnson said he would set out the sanctions in the House of Commons, probably at around 1230 GMT. The sanctions, Johnson said, would be \u201ctargeted not just at entities in Donbas and Luhansk and Donetsk, but in Russia itself \u2013 targeting Russian economic interests as hard as we can\u201d. Britain has threatened to cut off Russian companies\u2019 access to US dollars and British pounds, blocking them from raising capital in London and to expose what Johnson calls the \u201cRussian doll\u201d of property and company ownership. Britain has not yet spelled out who would fall under the sanctions, but has pledged that there would be nowhere for Russian oligarchs to hide. Johnson has said targets could include Russian banks. Hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into London and Britain\u2019s overseas territories from Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and London has become the western city of choice for the super-wealthy of Russia and other former Soviet republics. Putin will find he has \u201cgravely miscalculated\u201d, Johnson said, adding that Moscow appeared to be bent on a full-scale invasion of its former Soviet neighbour. Johnson chaired a meeting of Britain\u2019s national emergency security committee early on Tuesday. Speaking afterwards, he said: I think that the tragedy of the present situation is that President Putin has surrounded himself with like-minded advisors who tell him that Ukraine is not a proper country. And I think that he is going to find that he has gravely miscalculated. (Via Reuters) In his BBC interview, Sajid Javid also said the current situation could be compared to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. I do think it\u2019s as serious a situation as that. There is still an opportunity here for President Putin to step back, despite him having now chosen confrontation over dialogue. It is not too late for him to step back and bring his troops back into Russia and open dialogue. But we have to be realistic \u2013 clearly that does not seem his intent, certainly at this point in time, and we have to respond very significantly. This is a real test for the west as well. (Via PA Media) The US briefed a week ago that, unlike during the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, sanctions this time would start at the top of the ladder and stay there, rather than be gradually escalated. Last week, Boris Johnson said sanctions would be implemented as soon as one Russian toe-cap crossed into Ukrainian-held territory. But the reality is proving different, partly due to Vladimir Putin\u2019s step-by-step tactics. The US was briefing that sanctions will probably go wider later today than those intended to cover trade and investment in the two breakaway Republics announced on Monday night. Putin, however, has not yet done enough to justify the big bazooka package. Similarly, Johnson made clear this morning he is not planning to let loose all his firepower when he makes a statement to MPs today. There look to be two reasons. So far, the Russian \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d have not gone beyond the borders of the territory currently held by the Russian supporting forces within the two Republics. The borders of the territories that Russia is preparing to recognise are unclear. Sajid Javid has said the invasion of Ukraine has begun. He may be right \u2013 but so far the invasion to which he is referring occurred in 2014. But there is a second reason for restraint. The EU is privately struggling to get agreement on the trigger point for its sanctions, which will be announced as early as this afternoon. The bloc will not unleash everything in its locker \u2013 hence the call between Joe Biden and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Monday evening. Even now \u2013 despite the fact that a full-scale invasion is the overwhelming likelihood \u2013 some European leaders are looking for diplomatic routes out. If there are no exits, it will turn into a battle between the banks \u2013 western financial firepower \u2013 and the tanks, Russian\u2019s military hardware. Russia\u2019s legislature is expected to rubberstamp the Kremlin\u2019s decision to recognise the self-proclaimed territories in Luhansk and Donetsk on Tuesday, paving the way for Russian troops to formally occupy Ukrainian territory in what they call a \u201cpeacekeeping mission\u201d. But a key question remains: In what borders will Russia recognise its two proxy territories? The fine print could determine whether Vladimir Putin is preparing to launch a broader invasion in Ukraine. Both of the Russian-backed territories lay claim to Ukrainian territories that are not currently under their control. For instance, the self-proclaimed Donetsk people\u2019s republic has said that it should control the city of Mariupol, which is firmly on the Ukrainian side of the line of conflict. If Russia recognises those larger territorial ambitions, then under the terms of the treaty Putin signed with the territories yesterday, it would imply a further war of conquest backed by Russia is to come. Andrei Kortunov, the director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, said: The open question is what particular borders they\u2019re going to defend. The question is whether these newly recognised republics might have territorial claims \u2026 that might constitute a casus belli. If we assume that Russia is not interested in a big war in Ukraine \u2013 because that would definitely mean a war \u2013 then we can assume the ball is in the Western court. In Kortunov\u2019s thinking, Putin may wait before sending large numbers of troops into the territories in order to gauge the Western response: The West needs to decide how it is going to react - what kind of sanctions and what will happen to the political dialogue between Moscow and Western capitals? Some western analysts believe that Russia\u2019s massive buildup of more than 190,000 troops near the borders of Ukraine indicates that Putin plans on more than just a recognition of the two territories. According to Michael Kofman of the CNA thinktank: Russia doesn\u2019t need 190k troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders to recognize the independence of separatist republics. These troops are not even near the Donbas. This is the first step in what will likely be a large-scale Russian [military] operation to impose regime change. The decision to recognise the territories also will likely scuttle the Minsk agreements, a peace deal that Moscow hoped to use as leverage to force Ukraine into imposing unpopular political decisions about the conflict. Russia appeared to be leaving the question of the borders open on Tuesday morning before the parliament sessions. Leonid Kalashnikov, an MP, initially told Russian media the Duma would recognise the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LPR) as the territories recognised at \u201creferendums\u201d in 2014. \u201cThis agreement does not specify [the borders], but I think it means statehood, which was approved in the old and only referendum that was held in other borders than those currently occupied by the DPR,\u201d Kalashnikov told reporters on Tuesday, answering a question from Interfax. \u201cHow these borders will be restored is not provided for in this agreement. How they will be restored is not our competence,\u201d said Kalashnikov, the head of the a Duma committee that manages issues dealing with ex-Soviet countries. But he soon clarified his remarks, which many took to imply a coming war, saying that they were just his \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d. In his speech on Monday, Putin appeared to be setting the stage for Russian claims to far more than just the Donbas regions: From those who have seized and are holding power in Kyiv, we demand an immediate cessation of hostilities. Otherwise, the entire responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine. Didier Reynders, the European commissioner for justice, has said that while Russia\u2019s move is an \u201cact of war\u201d, the large-scale sanctions package prepared in Brussels in the event of an invasion of Ukraine will be imposed gradually. Speaking to Belgian media, Reynders said that the first punitive measures would be travel bans against individuals, adding that this could be followed by the seizing of assets in Europe and abroad. Reynders said that in time, depending on developments, it \u201cwill be necessary to ensure that there are no more imports of goods or services from Russia, such as energy, and that Russia\u2019s global access to financial services is terminated\u201d. He added: \u201cEverything is on the table.\u201d The UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, has just been interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said that while the government has ruled out military action, it is ready to impose sanctions: We have already, as a leading member of Nato, played a significant role in shoring up and protecting Nato members and that will certainly continue. We have ruled out any forces or military action by soldiers in Ukraine itself. The defence secretary has been clear on that but in terms of support for Ukraine in other ways, including support through military equipment and arms, that will continue. Asked whether it was time to impose sanctions on oligarchs close to Putin who own property in the UK, send their children to British schools and who have funded the Conservative party, Javid said: I think it is. The prime minister has already actually been clear on this \u2013 that if Russia were to violate the territorial integrity \u2013 the sovereignty \u2013 of Ukraine, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to act. That of course means sanctions \u2026 That action in terms of sanctions will almost certainly include action against any individuals, and, for that matter, any companies or businesses, or any other entities, that are linked to the Russian state that have any kind of significant economic influence in Russia. But also I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll consider what sectors in the Russian economy we can target as well. A clear division has become apparent between the UK and the EU over the presence of Russian troops in the Donbas region of Ukraine. While the health secretary, Sajid Javid, has said the presence of troops is evidence that the invasion of Ukraine has already begun, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, was more cautious when talking in Paris this morning. It was not, to his mind, he said, a \u201cfully fledged invasion\u201d. The comments reflect the nervousness in some EU capitals \u2013 including Paris and Berlin \u2013 at hitting Moscow too early with the full \u201cunprecedented\u201d package of sanctions prepared over recent weeks and being left without any further leverage over the Kremlin. In contrast, EU member states in the Baltics argue that Putin will only taunt the bloc with incremental incursions that have the appearance of falling shy of the threshold for the \u201cmassive costs and severe consequences\u201d threatened by the bloc over a military invasion. Those EU governments argue that it will be death to Ukraine by a thousand cuts if the bloc prevaricates. The UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, has just been interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said that while the government has ruled out military action, it is ready to impose sanctions: We have already, as a leading member of Nato, played a significant role in shoring up and protecting Nato members and that will certainly continue. We have ruled out any forces or military action by soldiers in Ukraine itself. The defence secretary has been clear on that but in terms of support for Ukraine in other ways, including support through military equipment and arms, that will continue. Asked whether it was time to impose sanctions on oligarchs close to Putin who own property in the UK, send their children to British schools and who have funded the Conservative party, Javid said: I think it is. The prime minister has already actually been clear on this - that if Russia were to violate the territorial integrity - the sovereignty - of Ukraine, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to act. That of course means sanctions \u2026 That action in terms of sanctions will almost certainly include action against any individuals, and, for that matter, any companies or businesses, or any other entities, that are linked to the Russian state that have any kind of significant economic influence in Russia. But also I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll consider what sectors in the Russian economy we can target as well. The EU\u2019s foreign affairs high representative, Josep Borrell, has said he will call an extraordinary meeting today where EU foreign ministers will adopt sanctions against Russia over its recognition of Ukrainian separatist regions and further deployment of troops on Ukraine territory. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a unanimous decision\u201d, he said. There are differences in opinion within the EU as to the strength of the package that will be imposed on Russia at this stage, with Borrell suggesting this morning that Russia had not, as yet, launched a \u201cfully fledged\u201d invasion although its troops were on Ukrainian soil. Borrell said a text on sanctions would be drafted this morning and a decision would be made this afternoon by ministers. I cannot go into the details. The Russian troops have entered into Donbas. We consider Donbas as part of Ukraine. I wouldn\u2019t say that is a fully fledged invasion but Russian troops are on Ukrainian soil.\u201d Amnesty International has just put out these lines from the organisation\u2019s secretary general, Agn\u00e8s Callamard: After weeks of fruitless negotiations, the protection of civilians in Ukraine must now be the absolute priority. While the potential for full-blown conflict is now a devastating reality, every effort must be made to minimise civilian suffering and prioritise humanity in this crisis. It is a legal obligation of all parties to do so. We urge all parties to adhere strictly to international humanitarian and human rights law. They must ensure the protection of civilian lives and refrain from indiscriminate attacks and the use of prohibited weapons such as cluster munitions. We also call on all parties to allow and facilitate access of humanitarian agencies to provide assistance to civilians affected by hostilities. Amnesty International will be monitoring the situation closely to expose violations of international law by all parties.\u201d In case you missed it last night, this analysis piece from Shaun Walker is well worth a read: Sitting alone at a desk in a grand, columned Kremlin room, Vladimir Putin looked across an expanse of parquet floor at his security council and asked if anyone wished to express an alternative opinion. He was met with silence \u2026 EU member states\u2019 ambassadors will meet on Tuesday morning to discuss possible sanctions against Russia in response to its formal recognition of two breakaway regions of Ukraine, with limited sanctions a possible option, an EU official said. An EU diplomat said separately that the meeting would be an \u201cinformation point\u201d for the envoys, but would also consider how to act on the statement made by EU leaders on Monday that the bloc would \u201creact with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act\u201d. The EU official said some member states wanted sanctions to be limited in response to Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s move on eastern Ukraine, while others want to see the full range of sanctions that have been discussed in recent weeks to be rolled out now. The official said there may be a meeting of EU leaders to discuss the bloc\u2019s response, but a decision on this has not yet been taken. (Via Reuters) Meanwhile, in the markets ... The mood in Kyiv is concerned but defiant. MP Serhii Rakhmanin described the recognition of Russian controlled-regions of Eastern Ukraine as independent states \u201can act of aggression, and Putin\u2019s speech a \u201cde facto call for war\u201d. He added: Military escalation, especially in the Donbas, is becoming almost inevitable. It has not happened yet, but the level of threat has changed from orange to red. He called on the government to mobilise reservists, increase the defence budget, consider cutting diplomatic relations with Russia, and impose martial law in regions claimed by Russia. Rakhmanin said Western countries needed to bring in the toughest possible sanctions, send military aid to Ukraine, and consider an urgent economic rescue package for an economy hobbled by the threat of war. On social media Tuesday morning Ukrainians criticised US sanctions, which directly target the Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, as too limited in scope. A little more on Sajid Javid\u2019s comments, via PA Media. The health secretary told Sky News: We are waking up to a very dark day in Europe and it\u2019s clear from what we have already seen and found out today that the Russians, President Putin, has decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine and its territorial integrity. We have seen that he has recognised these breakaway eastern regions in Ukraine and from the reports we can already tell that he has sent in tanks and troops. From that you can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun.\u201d Good morning. Sam Jones here, taking over the blog from my colleague Samantha Lock. Before I handover to my colleague, Sam Jones, here is a rundown of developments overnight: British prime minister Boris Johnson is chairing a Cobra meeting this morning to \u201ccoordinate the UK response\u201d, including agreeing to a \u201csignificant package of sanctions to be introduced immediately\u201d, PA Media reports, citing a Downing Street spokesperson. UK health minister Sajid Javid says it is clear Russian president Vladimir Putin has decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine and believes an invasion has already begun, Reuters reports. Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed by shelling overnight and 12 more were injured, according to Ukraine\u2019s Joint Forces Operation situation report published this morning. The UK is also set to announce new sanctions on Russia today after foreign secretary Liz Truss said Putin\u2019s actions could not be allowed to go \u201cunpunished\u201d. Downing Street also said Boris Johnson told Ukraine\u2019s President Zelenskiy that he would \u201cexplore sending further defensive support to Ukraine\u201d at the request of the country\u2019s government. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement condemning Russia\u2019s decision to recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states. The ministry says the decision has \u201cno legal implications\u201d and \u201csharply escalates the situation\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s defence minister said his country is \u201cready and able\u201d to defend itself from Russia and says the world cannot be silent. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s representative to the United Nations has reiterated its combative stance, saying Ukraine \u201cis on the verge of a new military adventure\u201d in a tweet on Tuesday morning local time. UN security council members condemned Russia\u2019s actions in an extraordinary war of words as representatives from the US, the UK, France, Germany, India, Ireland, the UAE, Kenya and Ghana all emphatically urged peace and diplomacy in a bid to avert war in Ukraine. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, dismissed Putin\u2019s assertion that the Russian troops heading into the separatist regions of Ukraine would take on a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d role. Ukraine\u2019s president used a televised address in the early hours of Tuesday to accuse Russia of wrecking peace talks and has ruled out making any territorial concessions. Zelenskiy added Ukraine was committed to peace and diplomacy. If you\u2019d like to read even more developments, we posted a summary earlier here. Russian state Duma deputy Leonid Kalashnikov, who chairs the Duma\u2019s committee on post-Soviet affairs, said that Russia will recognise the independence of the whole of Donetsk and Luhanks regions in eastern Ukraine, according to Moscow Times reporter Pjotr Sauer. Currently, only one-third of the territories is controlled by the Russian-backed separatists. UK health minister Sajid Javid says it is clear Russian president Vladimir Putin has decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine and believes an invasion has already begun, Reuters reports. We are waking up to a very dark day in Europe and it\u2019s clear from what we have already seen and found out today that the Russians, President Putin, has decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine and its territorial integrity.\u201d The health secretary told Sky News: We have seen that he has recognised these breakaway eastern regions in Ukraine and from the reports we can already tell that he has sent in tanks and troops. From that you can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun.\u201d Javid added that Boris Johnson will make a statement to parliament today on Ukraine. We will have more on this story as it develops. Two Ukrainian soldiers have been killed by shelling overnight and 12 more were injured, according to Ukraine\u2019s Joint Forces Operation situation report published this morning. The report says Ukraine recorded 84 violations over the past 24 hours from Russia-backed forces, 64 of which were using weapons prohibited by the Minsk agreements. As a result of the shelling, two Ukrainian service personnel died from shrapnel wounds while 12 service personnel were injured and are receiving treatment, Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defence added. South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry has joined the ranks of other countries to voice its \u201cgrave concern\u201d over the Ukraine crisis and called for related nations to respect the Minsk agreement while finding a diplomatic solution, the Associated Press reports. Ministry spokesperson Choi Young-sam made the remarks during a briefing on Tuesday, reiterating President Moon Jae-in\u2019s comments during an earlier national security meeting. Our government has consistently supported Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and the preservation of its territory. Our government strongly calls for related nations to pursue peaceful resolutions based on respect for international law and the Minsk agreement.\u201d Choi was referring to a 2015 ceasefire arrangement signed between Russia and Ukraine at the Belarusian capital following months of bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine. One of the standout submissions to the United Nation\u2019s emergency security council meeting earlier was delivered by Kenyan representative Martin Kimani. Video of Kimani\u2019s emphatic plea to Russia to pursue diplomacy and not conflict can be viewed below. This situation echoes our history. Kenya and almost every African country was birthed by the ending of empire. Our borders were not of our own drawing. Today across the border of every single African country live our countrymen with whom we share deep bonds. The UK is also set to announce new sanctions on Russia today after foreign secretary Liz Truss said Putin\u2019s actions could not be allowed to go \u201cunpunished\u201d. The sanctions will be in response to Russia\u2019s \u201cbreach of international law and attack on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d she said. The foreign secretary added that she had spoken to Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, following \u201cRussia\u2019s latest assault on Ukrainian sovereignty\u201d. We agreed (the UK) and (the EU) will coordinate to deliver swift sanctions against Putin\u2019s regime and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine. Financial markets in London, Europe and the US are braced for a tough day of trading after the mounting crisis in Ukraine inflicted big losses on stocks in Asia Pacific on Tuesday. The broad MSCI Asia index, excluding Japan, was down more than 2% in its worst day for a month. The Nikkei shed 1.7%, Seoul was off 1.4% and the ASX in Sydney closed down 1% as investors worried about the possibility of conflict. Safe havens such as gold rallied. Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia\u2019s main export, was up 2% at $97.30 a barrel. Hong Kong was worst hit, down 3%, with tech stocks especially affected in the wake of another crackdown on the sector by Beijing. Bitcoin fell 6% to $36,826, while the Russian rouble sank to a more than 15-month low. That all paves the way for some heavy losses on the European indices as indicated by futures trade: New York is also set for losses later on Tuesday: Downing Street also said Johnson told Ukraine\u2019s President Zelenskiy that he would \u201cexplore sending further defensive support to Ukraine\u201d at the request of the country\u2019s government. A spokesperson told PA Media: He told President Zelenskiy that the UK had already drawn up sanctions to target those complicit in the violation of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, and that those measures would come into force tomorrow. The prime minister also said he would explore sending further defensive support to Ukraine, at the request of the Ukrainian government. Meanwhile, Downing Street said Johnson outlined his \u201cgrave concern at recent developments in the region\u201d in a call with the Ukrainian president on Monday evening, PA Media reports. The prime minister strongly condemned the Kremlin\u2019s decision today to recognise Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states, and said the move made the Minsk agreements and process unworkable. Johnson added that the UK was already engaging with partners on the issue and said the UK would raise it at the United Nations Security Council and Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe in the coming days. British prime minister Boris Johnson is moments away from chairing a Cobra meeting this morning to \u201ccoordinate the UK response\u201d, including agreeing to a \u201csignificant package of sanctions to be introduced immediately\u201d, PA media reports citing to a Downing Street spokesperson. Johnson earlier told Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he believes a Russian invasion is \u201ca real possibility in the coming hours and days\u201d, No 10 said. A No 10 spokesperson said on Monday evening: \u201cThe Prime Minister will chair a COBR at 0630 tomorrow morning to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine and to coordinate the UK response including agreeing a significant package of sanctions to be introduced immediately.\u201d It comes after foreign secretary Liz Truss said the UK will announce new sanctions against Russia on Tuesday \u201cin response to their breach of international law and attack on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs has just issued an official statement condemning Russia\u2019s decision to recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states. The ministry says the decision has \u201cno legal implications\u201d and \u201csharply escalates the situation\u201d. The statement released on Tuesday morning reads: The Ukrainian side understands Russia\u2019s intentions and its objective to provoke Ukraine. We are taking into account all the risks and not giving in to the provocations as we remain committed to politico-diplomatic settlement of the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defence minister says his country is \u201cready and able\u201d to defend itself from Russia and says the world cannot be silent. \u201cSanctions? Another brick in the wall? New Berlin Wall?\u201d Oleksii Reznikov tweeted Tuesday morning local time. We\u2019ve now got video of the US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, calling Putin\u2019s claims \u201cnonsense\u201d. For those just joining our live coverage now, here is a summary of what was exchanged during the United Nations emergency security council meeting which wrapped up just hours ago. It was an extraordinary war of words as representatives from the United States, the UK, France, Germany, India, Ireland, the UAE, Kenya and Ghana all emphatically urged peace and diplomacy in a bid to avert war in Ukraine. Addressing the session, US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield cast doubt on Putin\u2019s assertion that the Russian troops would take on a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d role in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas. He calls them peacekeepers. This is nonsense. We know what they really are. Referring to Putin\u2019s recent allegations, the ambassador said his words amounted to a \u201cseries of outrageous, false claims\u201d that were aimed at \u201ccreating a pretext for war.\u201d Putin wants to travel back to a time when empires ruled the world. This is not 1919,\u201d she added. The UK\u2019s permanent representative to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, highlighted the humanitarian impact of a possible invasion. The actions Russia has chosen today will have severe and far-reaching consequences. First, to human life. An invasion of Ukraine unleashes the forces of war, death and destruction on the people of Ukraine,\u201d she said. In seeking to redraw borders by force, Russia\u2019s actions show blatant contempt for international law.\u201d After about an hour we finally heard from Russia ,with Vasily Nebenzya calling the prior statements a \u201cdirect verbal assault\u201d and saying they would go \u201cunanswered\u201d. Nebenzya also attacked the west for \u201cnudging\u201d Ukraine towards conflict and accused other nations of overlooking the plight of those in the Donbas. Most of you did not find any place for the nearly four million residents of Donbas ... Our western colleagues have been unashamedly cramming weapons into Ukraine.\u201d Russia then alleged Ukraine was on the brink of \u201cmilitary adventure\u201d. Allowing a new bloodbath in the Donbas is something we do not intend to do.\u201d Finally, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya took the stand, insisting that his country\u2019s borders remain \u201cunchangeable\u201d despite Russia\u2019s actions. We are on our own land. We are not afraid of anything or anyone, we owe nothing to anyone and we will not give away anything to anyone. There should be no doubt whatsoever. The international borders of Ukraine are and will remain unchangeable. We demand from Russia to cancel the decision on recognition and return to the table of negotiations. We condemn the order to deploy additional Russian occupation troops to the territories in Ukraine. We demand immediate and complete verifiable withdrawal of the occupation troops. The United Nations is sick. That\u2019s a matter of fact. It has been hit by the virus spread by the Kremlin. Will it succumb to this virus?\u201d US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has dismissed Vladimir\u2019s Putin\u2019s assertion that the Russian troops heading into the separatist regions of Ukraine would take on a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d role. At a fiery emergency meeting of the security council in New York she said: \u201cHe calls them peacekeepers. This is nonsense. We know what they really are.\u201d Putin\u2019s allegations about Ukrainian aggression in a speech on Monday amounted to a \u201cseries of outrageous, false claims\u201d that were aimed at \u201ccreating a pretext for war.\u201d Putin wants to travel back to a time when empires ruled the world. This is not 1919. Speaking after the meeting she said the US would announce new sanctions against Russia on Tuesday. The Australian government has also announced it has moved all diplomatic officials out of Ukraine to eastern Poland and Romania. Foreign minister Marise Payne confirmed the move \u201cdue to the increased risk\u201d amid rising concerns of conflict. \u201cAustralia stands in solidarity with Ukraine and continues to call on Russia to cease and reverse its unprovoked assault on its democratic neighbour,\u201d Payne said. News of Russia\u2019s recognition of the breakaway territories of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent is filtering through the streets of Kyiv. Maria Levchyshchyna, a 48-year-old painter in the Ukrainian capital, told Associated Press: Why should Russia recognise (the rebel-held regions)? If neighbours come to you and say, This room will be ours,\u2019 would you care about their opinion or not? It\u2019s your flat, and it will be always your flat. Let them recognise whatever they want. But in my view, it can also provoke a war, because normal people will fight for their country.\u201d Artem Ivaschenko, a 22-year-old cook originally from Donetsk, told AFP the recognition was the \u201cscariest news\u201d he had heard since he fled the region to Kyiv eight years ago. He said: I am very shocked...I live here, I already lost a part of my homeland, it was taken away, so I will protect it.\u201d US secretary of state Antony Blinken has reiterated the United States\u2019 \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Ukraine in a statement after he spoke to Ukraine foreign ministyer Dmytro Kuleba by phone on Monday. A spokesperson for the US secretary of state said: The secretary noted our swift response to Russia\u2019s decision to recognize the purported \u2018independence\u2019 of the so-called republics controlled by Russian proxy authorities in eastern Ukraine. They discussed the strong measures we announced today in response and reiterated that additional steps would be forthcoming. The pair are due to meet in Washington on Tuesday. Russia\u2019s representative to the United Nations has reiterated its combative stance, saying Ukraine \u201cis on the verge of a new military adventure\u201d in a tweet on Tuesday morning local time. \u201cWe cannot allow this,\u201d the representative added. Ukraine\u2019s president used a televised address in the early hours of Tuesday to accuse Russia of wrecking peace talks and has ruled out making any territorial concessions. Zelenskiy added Ukraine was committed to peace and diplomacy after Russia formally recognised two Russian-backed separatist regions as independent on Monday evening. Zelenskiy said \u201cwe are not afraid\u201d after Russia officially recognised two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine as independent. The president said Ukraine was expecting \u201cclear and effective\u201d steps from its allies to act against Russia and called for an emergency summit of the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. Welcome to our rolling updates of developments in the Ukraine-Russia crisis. I\u2019m Samantha Lock and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest updates in what promises to be another very busy day ahead. Here are the main developments so far: The United States and allies such as the UK and France will announce new sanctions against Russia on Tuesday, the US ambassador to the UN has said. it was not clear what the extent of the sanctions would be. Earlier on Monday Joe Biden banned trade between the US and breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. The move follows Russia\u2019s decision to recognise the breakaway regions of Ukraine, Luhansk and Donetsk, as independent states and send \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d troops into the areas. Russian president Vladimir Putin said Ukraine has nuclear weapons and is being heavily influenced by the west. A fiery emergency meeting of the UN security council on Monday night in New York saw western governments line up to condemn Russia for \u201cescalating\u201d the crisis. US envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield described Putin\u2019s claim that the troops were \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d as \u201cnonsense\u201d. Britain\u2019s representative said Russia\u2019s actions showed \u201cblatant contempt to international law\u201d. Russia\u2019s representative responded by accusing Ukraine of being \u201con the verge of a new military adventure\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy used a televised address in the early hours of Tuesday to accuse Russia of wrecking peace talks and has ruled out making any territorial concessions. He said Ukraine was \u201cnot afraid of anything or anyone\u201d. British prime minister Boris Johnson is set to chair a meeting of the UK\u2019s emergency committee Cobra on Tuesday morning to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine. Russia has acquired the right to build military bases in Ukraine\u2019s two breakaway regions under treaties signed by Putin with their separatist leaders, Reuters is reporting. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said Russia\u2019s move was a breach of international law and fundamental OSCE principles and runs counter to the Minsk agreements. All US state department personnel are now out of Ukraine, having relocated to a hotel in Poland, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has announced."

            "content": "Time to wrap up for the week... here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories: Goodnight, and have a good weekend. GW UK exports of goods to the EU have fallen by \u00a320bn compared with the last period of stable trade with Europe, according to official figures marking the first full year since Brexit. Numbers released on Friday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the combined impact of the pandemic and Britain\u2019s exit from the single market caused a 12% fall in exports between January and December last year compared with 2018. Highlighting the disproportionate impact from leaving the EU, exports to the rest of the world \u2013 excluding the 27-nation bloc \u2013 dropped by a much smaller \u00a310bn, or about 6% compared with 2018 levels. The ONS compares trade performance against figures from three years ago because this was the last year before distortions caused by firms stockpiling ahead of Brexit deadlines and the spread of Covid-19. Despite the disruption, the EU remains the UK\u2019s largest trading partner. However, for the first time since comparable records began in 1997, the UK now spends more importing goods from the rest of the world than it does from the EU (see earlier post). For shipments sent the other way UK goods imported from the EU were down almost 17%, or about \u00a345bn, compared with 2018. In comparison imports from the rest of the world increased by almost 13%, or about \u00a328bn. With the EU accounting for just over half of UK exports worldwide, economists said Brexit was serving as an extra headwind for Britain, compounding the disruption from Covid being felt across advanced economies. \u201cUK exporters are continuing to lose market share,\u201d said Gabriella Dickens, an economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. More here: European stock market have closed for the week, with the FTSE 100 index finishing 11 points lower at 7661. That 0.15% dip is a recovery from its earlier weakness. Consumer goods giant Unilever led the risers, up 3.5%, a day after it pledged not to make any major acquisitions for the foreseeable future following the backlash over its tilt at GSK\u2019s consumer healthcare arm. British American Tobacco rose 3%, after reporting rising revenues from its vapes and heated tobacco division and announcing a \u00a32bn share buyback. European markets had a weaker day, with Germany\u2019s DAX down around 0.5% at the close and France\u2019s CAC off 1.3%. But it\u2019s been a good week for European travel and leisure stocks - the sector gained around 7% this week, on optimism for a recovery this summer as Covid-19 cases fall. Here\u2019s some reaction to the drop in US consumer sentiment to a decade low: It is the kind of news that calls for a stiff drink: the cost of a home-poured G&amp;T is bubbling up due to a jump in tonic prices at UK supermarkets. Shop price data from the research firm Assosia suggests that the price of mixers made by major tonic brands such as Schweppes and Fever-Tree has risen sharply this month. In Morrisons, the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket chain, a number of Schweppes mixers, including bestsellers such as Indian tonic water, have increased by 10p to \u00a31.75 for a litre. The cost of some Schweppes drinks sold in Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco has also increased. The data also reveals widespread price increases for Fever-Tree\u2019s upmarket tonics. Since the start of 2022 Assosia has tracked 15 price increases for the brand in Morrisons, 16 in Tesco and Asda, and 21 in Sainsbury\u2019s. A 500ml bottle of its Indian tonic water now costs \u00a31.95 in Morrisons, a 15p increase. It costs the same higher price in Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s. With inflation running at a near 30-year high, tonic is just one of many products going up in price on supermarket shelves as supply chain bottlenecks and soaring energy costs put upward pressure on prices. More here... US consumer confidence has hit its lowest level in a decade, as the jump in inflation causes rising anxiety among Americans. The University of Michigan\u2019s gauge of consumer sentiment hit its lowest level since late 2011, as people grow gloomier about their financial prospects, the economic outlook, and the government\u2019s economic policies. The measures of consumer expectations and current economic conditions both worsened this month, to 10-year lows. Surveys of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin, says. Sentiment continued its downward descent, reaching its worst level in a decade, falling a stunning 8.2% from last month and 19.7% from last February. The recent declines have been driven by weakening personal financial prospects, largely due to rising inflation, less confidence in the government\u2019s economic policies, and the least favorable long term economic outlook in a decade. Importantly, the entire February decline was among households with incomes of $100,000 or more; their Sentiment Index fell by 16.1% from last month, and 27.5% from last year. The impact of higher inflation on personal finances was spontaneously cited by one-third of all consumers, with nearly half of all consumers expecting declines in their inflation adjusted incomes during the year ahead. In addition, fewer households cited rising net household wealth since the pandemic low in May 2020, largely due to the falling likelihood of stock price increases in 2022. After yesterday\u2019s wobble, Wall Street has opened cautiously. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 58 points or 0.2% at 35,307, while the broader S&amp;P 500 is down 0.1%. Tech stocks are weaker, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.4% on expectations of sharp interest rate rises this year to bring US inflation down. Energy stocks are higher, with Chevron (+1.2%) and pharmaceuticals group Merck (+1.3%) in the Dow risers, followed by healthcare group Walgreen Boots (+1%). Nike (-1.3%) are leading the Dow fallers, followed by Salesforce.com (-1%), Microsoft (-1%) and Apple (-0.5%). On the trade data.....LSE associate professor Thomas Sampson says Brexit hit home last year, but surprisingly EU imports were more affected than exports: [even though the UK delayed checks on goods coming into the country, while the EU introduced those checks at the start of 2021] UK imports from non-EU countries outpaced imports from the EU every month last year. December\u2019s trade report shows that imports from non-EU countries remained higher than from EU countries for the 12th month in a row. The ONS says this divergence is linked to increasing imports of fuels, such as gas from Norway, where prices rose sharply through the year. Analysts say the Brexit free trade deal, and the pandemic, have also disrupted trade patterns. Global financial services firm Ebury reported that annual UK goods imports from outside the EU surpassed the value of those from within it for the first time since ONS records began in 1997. Cornelius Clark of Ebury explained: \u201cEvidently the end of the Brexit transition period has impacted trading relationships that many UK businesses have with their EU counterparts. Other factors at play were the restrictions faced by lorry drivers in response to the Alpha variant at the start of 2021 alongside global supply chain bottlenecks. \u201cFurther terms of the Brexit trade agreement are still to be implemented which could provide greater headwinds to EU imports and it may be several years before the full impact is evident. \u201cHowever, imports from China reached an all-time high in 2021 despite the rise in shipping costs indicating that UK businesses are already diversifying their supply chains. The ongoing free-trade negotiations with India could also present a significant opportunity for UK importers too in lowering costs and barriers to trade with a rapidly growing global economic superpower. Sophie Hale, principal trade economist at Resolution Foundation, has analysed the data too, and says it shows Brexit has contributed to a weaker recovery from the pandemic trade shock: Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has provisionally cleared Sony Music\u2019s $430m (\u00a3312m) deal to buy AWAL, the artist service company that has worked with musicians including Little Simz, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Billie Eilish\u2019s brother and collaborator Finneas, after initially raising concerns the takeover could potentially lead to worse deals for artists or an increase in prices. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that an in-depth investigation into the deal, which was prompted by concerns it could be bad for the music business, has concluded that it will not substantially lessen competition in the UK now or in the future. The CMA had been concerned that the takeover would mean the loss of another independent player in the sector, which is dominated by the big three \u2013 Sony Music, Warner Music and Universal Music. However, it has provisionally concluded that there are plenty of other independent \u201cartist and label\u201d service providers, companies that provide a cheaper \u201cDIY platform\u201d for artists offering promotion, marketing and distribution that offer better royalties and copyright ownership than working with traditional record labels. The major record labels have also developed their own A&amp;L services, and artists can also turn to independent record labels that offer better terms than the music industry giants. \u201cWe have carefully assessed whether this merger will lead to negative outcomes for the market, artists and, ultimately, music fans, now and in the future,\u201d said Margot Daly, chair of the CMA\u2019s inquiry group.\u201d \u201cOur provisional finding is that the deal is not likely to affect competition in a way that will reduce the choice or quality of recorded music available, or increase prices. We think that a combination of other major labels and independent providers will continue to closely rival Sony, so our provisional decision is to clear the merger.\u201d The CMA will publish its final report on the deal by 17 March. \u201cOur investment in AWAL will deliver real benefits for artists and consumers, amidst intense competition at every level of the music industry,\u201d said a spokesman for Sony Music Entertainment. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the CMA throughout the final stages of their review.\u201d SoftBank is facing a battle to float British chip designer Arm, as it remains mired in a legal fight with the head of its Chinese joint venture, while London Stock Exchange chiefs try to persuade the company to reconsider its snub of the UK for the public listing. The Cambridge-based company has been in dispute with Allen Wu, the head of joint venture Arm China, since 2020 when its board voted to remove him. Wu, who refused to stand down and retains control of the venture due to legal rights, has escalated the battle by launching a third legal action against Arm China, adding additional red tape that SoftBank will need to overcome before floating Arm. SoftBank, which bought Arm for \u00a324bn in 2016, has been forced to turn to its backup plan of floating the company after its sale to US-based Nvidia collapsed earlier this week on regulatory hurdles. Widespread political and industry opposition in the UK, Europe, US and China scuppered the deal. More here: Rosneft, Russia\u2019s leading oil producer, has posted record profits for last year as it benefitted from surging energy prices and the global economic recovery. Rosneft followed fellow oil majors BP, Shell, and Total in reporting bumper earnings for 2021, as it benefitted from the rise in wholesale gas and oil prices. Rosneft\u2019s net income jumped to 883 billion rubles (\u00a38.6bn) last year, the highest on record, up more than six times compared to 2020. Chief executive officer Igor Sechin said: \u201cAgainst the background of the recovery of the global economy, the company achieved new financial records in 2021.\u201d Rosneft will also pay out record dividends for 2021, Sechin added. BP owns a near 20-% stake in Rosneft. BP\u2019s results this week showed that Rosneft contributed $2.7bn in underlying profit to BP\u2019s bottom line last year, or just over 21% of its bumper $12.8bn profit for the year. Oil prices have risen today after the International Energy Agency warned that energy markets were tight, and pointed out that Opec and its allies are failing to meet their production targets. The IEA said that \u201cchronic underperformance\u201d by OPEC+ in meeting its output targets and rising geopolitical tensions have pushed oil prices to their highest in seven years. In its latest monthly report, it said: In January, producers outside the OPEC+ alliance were the ones driving world oil supply higher. Further increases are expected in the coming months as new projects start up and US shale continues to respond to higher prices. That has led us to raise our forecast for US oil supply growth for 2022 to 1.2 mb/d [million barrels per day]. Canada, Brazil and Guyana could add an additional 460 kb/d between them. By contrast, the gap between OPEC+ output and its target levels swelled to 900 kb/d in January. The bloc\u2019s prolonged underperformance has effectively taken 300 mb, or 800 kb/d, off the market since the start of 2021. That shortfall is expected to deepen as some OPEC+ members struggle with production constraints, exacerbating market tightness. Brent crude, the international benchmark, is up 1.3% at $92.58 per barrel. It had hit $94/barrel on Monday, for the first time since 2014, on rising Ukraine tensions. However, the possibility of progress in US-Iran nuclear deal talks did push oil down during the week. NIESR, the economic research institute, have predicted the UK economy will grow by 1% in the current quarter. That would match the expansion in both July-September and October-December, but much slower than the rebound in activity last spring when the winter lockdowns were lifted. NIESR say the economic impact of Omicron was far smaller than that of either of the two previous major waves of Covid-19, keeping December\u2019s contraction to just 0.2% Rory Macqueen, Principal Economist at NIESR, says the economy could have returned to growth in January (we\u2019ll find out next month). The economic impact of Omicron was far smaller than that of either of the two previous major waves of Covid-19: a mere 0.2% fall in December was even stronger than consensus forecasts, but in line with NIESR\u2019s January GDP tracker, suggesting the possibility of a positive reading in January. Unsurprisingly, retail and hospitality contributed the most to December\u2019s fall, with the healthcare sector providing the largest positive contribution.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy grew by 7.5% last year in the fastest annual growth rate since the second world war, despite falling back in December as the Omicron variant dented consumer spending. It comes after the UK suffered one of the largest annual economic contractions of any major economy when GDP fell by 9.4% in 2020 amid the fallout from the first wave of the pandemic. The Office for National Statistics said output fell by 0.2% in December \u2013 a stronger performance than expected \u2013 as shortages of goods in the shops in the run-up to Christmas and a record number of job vacancies also slowed the economy after a 0.7% increase in November. City economists expected a deeper fall of 0.6% in GDP but an increase in government spending on the vaccine booster programme and the test-and-trace system prevented an even larger slump. There was better news for the government from figures showing GDP growth in the final quarter of the year remained positive at 1% \u2013 the same as the previous quarter after the ONS revised down growth in the three months to September to 1%. Rishi Sunak credited the Treasury\u2019s \u00a3400bn package of support and \u201cmaking the right calls at the right time\u201d for the economy\u2019s resilience. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the resolve the whole country has demonstrated, and proud of our incredible vaccine programme, which has allowed the economy to stay open.\u201d. However, Labour and trade union leaders said there was little to celebrate as living standards come under the most sustained pressure for three decades amid Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis amid a faltering economic recovery. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said real wages were plummeting as household energy prices and the cost of the weekly shop soared. \u201cThis toxic combination is hitting economic demand and weakening our recovery from the pandemic.\u201d More here: European stock markets lost ground this morning as investors ponder how aggressively America\u2019s central bank will react to soaring inflation. In the City, the FTSE 100 index is down 60 points today at 7612, a drop of 0.75%. France\u2019s CAC has lost 1.2%, while Germany\u2019s DAX is 0.45% lower. Wall Street economists have been revising their interest rate forecasts higher, after US inflation soared to a 40-year high of 7.5% in January. Core inflation was also higher than forecast, dashing hopes that US inflation could have peaked in December. Goldman Sachs now expects seven 25-basis point interest rate rises from the U.S. Federal Reserve this year, up from its previous forecast of five. The markets are betting on \u2018shock and awe\u2019 from the Federal Reserve, says Raffi Boyadjian of XM: The big question now is whether there will be some kind of a knee-jerk reaction from the Fed itself amid the ever-worrying rise in inflation. The formerly dovish, now hawkish president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, James Bullard, has made his views known on what the Fed should do next. Commenting soon after yesterday\u2019s data, Bullard, who is a voting member this year, called for a 100-basis-point increase in rates over the next three meetings. This would mean at least one double hike of 50-basis points, but Bullard didn\u2019t stop there as he raised the prospect of the Fed holding an unscheduled meeting before March to get an early start on liftoff. However, it\u2019s doubtful whether enough voting FOMC members would support such an aggressive move, with Barkin and Daly not in favour of raising rates more quickly. Over in Moscow, Russia\u2019s central bank has raised its key interest rate sharply to 9.5% as it tries to tackle inflation. The Bank of Russia lifted rates from 8.5%, and said inflation was rising appreciably above its forecasts last October. Annual inflation in Russia climbed to 8.7% in January, more than double the Bank\u2019s 4% target. It warned that the balance of risks had tipped towards higher inflation, citing higher energy prices and \u2018geopolitical events\u2019: Due to the active growth of demand in the global economy, proinflationary risks associated with price trends in global commodity markets increased. This primarily concerns energy commodities and food markets. Short-term proinflationary risks associated with volatility in global financial markets caused by, among other factors, various geopolitical events, intensified, which may affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. [The Ukraine crisis has caused volatility in energy markets, and pushed the ruble to a 14-month low in January, which lifts import costs] The central bank had already raised interest rates seven times in 2021, up from a record low of 4.25%. Today, it warns that further increases are possible: If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate increase at its upcoming meetings. Policy makers also revised their year-end inflation forecast higher, to 5%-6%, compared with the bank\u2019s earlier forecast for 4%-4.5%. Despite the dip in GDP in December, the Bank of England is likely to continue raising interest rates this year, predicts Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity International. Monk also warns that wages may lag inflation for some time [inflation is likely to exceed 7% by April, creating the worst squeeze on disposable incomes in at least 30 years]. \u201cWhile today\u2019s growth data suggest the UK has broadly recovered the ground lost to the pandemic, it\u2019s also clear some momentum has been lost in the past few months. A dip in growth in December was forecast and is understandable given the emergence of Omicron, which led many to restrict their activity in the run-up to Christmas. The question now is whether a fully open UK economy can step up a gear. Consumer sentiment will be tested by the rising cost of living and with tax rises on the way that will squeeze monthly budgets further. Wages are rising but may lag inflation for some time. The Bank of England is worried enough about inflation that it is now raising interest rates and is likely to continue tightening this year. Very weak growth could alter that plan but for now the fact the economy is growing means rate-setters will remain hawkish.\u201d Heathrow airport has said more than 1.3 million passengers cancelled their travel plans over the Christmas and new year period because of Omicron, with hopes for a summer recovery after a weak start to the year. The airport said travel was down 56% in January compared with 2019 levels, a worse start to the year than it had forecast, as the hangover from the Omicron variant affected traveller confidence. \u201cAfter a tough Christmas, Omicron has continued to bite, and this has been a weak start to the year,\u201d said John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport. \u201cAs short-lived as the additional travel restrictions were, they ruined the travel plans of more than 1.3 million passengers in the last two months.\u201d Benjamin Disraeli famously warned against putting too much store in statistics, and the latest growth figures are a perfect example of why the former prime minister was right, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes. On the face of it, 2021 was an absolutely corking year for the economy. Britain has had some boom years in the postwar period \u2013 1973 and 1988, for example \u2013 but the 7.5% growth last year was the fastest of the lot. Yet 2021 can\u2019t be seen in isolation. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are correct when they say the UK had the fastest growth in the G7 last year, yet what they normally omit to add is that it came after the UK had the biggest contraction of any G7 nation a year earlier. The real story is that the economy collapsed by almost 10% in 2020 and then recovered most of the lost ground last year. Activity in the final three months of 2021 was 0.4% lower than in the final three months of 2019 \u2013 the period immediately before the pandemic struck. By way of comparison, the eurozone is back to where it was pre-Covid while the US is operating more than 3% above its level in late 2019. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full analysis: Charles Hepworth, investment director, GAM Investments also puts 2021\u2019s recovery into context: \u201cThe UK economy grew at its fastest pace in 81 years over the course of 2021, growing 7.5% over the full year. But before we get out the bunting, let\u2019s not forget that 2020 saw a record contraction of 9.4% [the worst since 1921], so the economy is still below pre-pandemic levels unlike some other G7 members. The Omicron variant impacted output in December, as was to be expected, with consumers reigning in activity and this will no doubt effect January\u2019s numbers too. As the cost of living crisis builds, it hardly heralds as rosy an outlook\u2013 this year the UK economy\u2019s growth will inevitably slow to its post Brexit sub-optimal level.\u201d Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC UK, agrees. He says the UK\u2019s position is \u201cless flattering\u201d when you compare its level of output since the pandemic began to its G7 peers, with the US and France having grown more over the same period. (PwC\u2019s chart uses OECD forecasts for Canada and Japan, as they haven\u2019t published Q4 GDP yet) Kitty Ussher, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors, is hopeful the UK economy returned to growth in January, after Omicron led to a 0.2% drop in GDP in December. \u201cThe story of December was one of cancellations and caution, as consumers jettisoned their plans to avoid bringing Covid home for Christmas. Today\u2019s data shows the impact of this screeching halt to festive cheer, with consumer-facing services down 3% in December compared to the previous month. Possibly ironically, one of the most buoyant contributions to economic activity was the vaccination and Test and Trace programmes. \u201cWe know from our own data, however, that caution over Omicron among business leaders eased in January, so we are hopeful that next month\u2019s data will see growth rising again.\u201d Sebastian Mackay, Invesco multi-asset fund manager, warns that the UK economy faces many challenges this year. Energy bills are set to soar in April, taxes on workers are going up, and the Bank of England is expected to keep raising interest rates (on top of last week\u2019s rise to 0.5%). Mackay says: \u201cA decent final quarter confirmed a strong growth rebound of 7.5% in 2021 from the 9.4% decline in 2020, albeit real GDP remains below its pre-pandemic level. Looking ahead, UK households face a triple whammy of higher energy prices, an increase in the rate on National Insurance contributions and higher interest rates. Accumulated savings will provide a cushion for wealthier households but little comfort for lower income families. These domestic headwinds, combined with a backdrop of decelerating global growth indicate a more challenging outlook for the UK economy.\u201d The UK experienced \u2018a taste of stagflation\u2019 in December, says Capital Economics\u2019 Paul Dales, with Omicron pushing GDP down by 0.2% and inflation hitting a 30-year high. When combined with the CPI inflation rate of 5.4%, the 0.2% m/m fall in GDP in December meant that the economy experienced a taste of stagflation at the end of last year. As it was driven by the Omicron COVID-19 wave which has now faded, the fall in GDP will soon be reversed. But high inflation will be with us for longer and, together with the rise in taxes in April, will restrain GDP growth this year. Much of the UK\u2019s growth in 2021 came in the spring, after the winter lockdown hit the economy hard. GDP shrank by 1.2% in Q1 2021, as England entered its toughest lockdown since the start of the pandemic. Activity fell sharply in January, but then recovered in March as schools reopened, and manufacturing and construction picked up. GDP then jumped by 5.6% in April-June as restrictions were relaxed and people flocked back to shops, offices and hospitality venues. But after that bounceback faded, growth slipped back to 1% in both Q3 and Q4 (as we learned this morning). Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon points out that UK growth was \u201cmid-range\u201d in the second half of last year. Resolution\u2019s James Smith also highlights that the economy was bouncing back from a weak 2020: Pat McFadden MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has warned that the UK recovery is expected to slow this year: \u201cThe reality is the way the Government runs our economy is trapping us in a high tax, low growth cycle. \u201cDespite government bluster, with their current plans our position is not expected to improve. The latest Bank of England forecast suggests that growth will slow to a crawl next year. That would be the slowest growth of any G7 economy. \u201cRising taxes, rising prices, and a squeeze on wages and living standards sit squarely on the shoulders of the Conservatives. \u201cLabour has a plan to build a stronger economy, based on an understanding that Britain\u2019s prosperity is found in the effort and talent of tens of millions of ordinary people, as well as backing the sectors that will help drive the industries of the future.\u201d Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak says the UK economy has been \u2018remarkably resilient\u2019: \u201cThanks to our \u00a3400bn package of support and making the right calls at the right time, the economy has been remarkably resilient; with the UK seeing the fastest growth in the G7 last year and GDP remaining at pre-pandemic levels in December. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the resolve the whole country has demonstrated, and proud of our incredible vaccine programme which has allowed the economy to stay open. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to help the economy rebuild through our Plan for Jobs, boost for business investment and support for households with the cost of living.\u201d The UK recorded the fastest growth in the G7 last year, as the economy rebounded from the 2020 slump. The 7.5% increase in GDP during 2021 is the fastest growth seen among the G7 countries. It beats the US (5.7% growth), France (+7%), Germany (+2.7%), and Italy (+6.5%) as well as the EU (+5.2%), and likely to beat Canada and Japan who have yet to release 2021 GDP data. But, the UK is recovering from a lower base, having contracted 9.4% in 2020. That was a steeper downturn than other G7 members (although Spain, not in the G7, shrank over 10%). As this chart shows: Overall, the UK is in the \u2018middle of the pack\u2019 in the race to recover from the pandemic, says Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics. Morgan told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: If you look at how the UK economy grew in 2021, compared with 2020, then yes, the 7.5% we published this morning means the UK is the fastest growing economy in the G7. But it\u2019s important to put that into a little bit of context, Morgan added: The growth in 2021 comes from a low base in 2020 when the UK economy fell sharply. If you look at where the UK economy is now, compared to its pre-pandemic level, which I know a lot of people do for a broader picture of the economy, the UK is middle of the pack compared with the G7. With the US, Canadian and French economies above the UK\u2019s, but the UK is above Italy, Germany and Japan. The United States, France and Canada are all above their pre-coronavirus level of GDP on a quarterly basis, while the UK was still 0.4% below its level of Q4 2019 in Q4 2021 (but level with February\u2019s GDP level in December). The UK economy grew by 7.5% during 2021 as it recovered from the 2020 slump caused by the pandemic. That\u2019s the fastest growth since the second world war, led by a strong rebound last spring when lockdown restrictions were lifted, despite the disruption caused by Omicron in December. But, it follows a 9.4% fall in GDP in 2020, when Covid-19 drove the economy into a steep slump. Paul Dales of Capital Economics says: In 2021 as a whole, GDP rose by an impressive 7.5%, but that needs to be put in context against the 9.4% fall in 2020. It\u2019s possible that GDP fell in January as that\u2019s when Omicron caused the most people to stay off work and self-isolate. But equally, the timely indicators suggest that activity began to recover from the middle of the month. Either way, a 2% fall in real household disposable incomes this year (due to higher inflation and taxes) will restrain GDP growth from April. With inflation soaring, we doubt this will prevent the Bank of England from raising interest rates from 0.50% to 1.25% this year and perhaps to 2.00% next year. Darren Morgan, director of Economic Statistics at the ONS, says GDP fell back slightly in December as the Omicron wave hit. Despite December\u2019s setback, GDP grew robustly across the fourth quarter as a whole with the NHS (National Health Service), couriers and employment agencies all helping to support the economy. Despite the disruption caused by Omicron in December, the UK economy kept growing in the final quarter of 2021. UK gross domestic product rose by 1.0% in October-December, the Office for National Statistics reports, following a downwardly revised 1.0% increase in Q3. The ONS says: The largest contributors to this quarterly increase were from human health and social work activities driven by increased GP visits at the start of the quarter, and a large increase in coronavirus (COVID-19) testing and tracing activities and the extension of the vaccination programme. On a quarterly basis, that leaves UK GDP 0.4% below its level in Q4 2019 before the pandemic (although it is level on a monthly basis). This chart shows how UK GDP dipped by 0.2% in December, after 0.7% growth in November (revised down from 0.9% growth first reported). The UK\u2019s service sector bore the brunt of the Omicron hit, with output falling by 0.5% in December. Output in consumer-facing services fell by 3.0% in the month, mainly driven by a 3.7% fall in retail trade as consumers avoided the shops. Production rose by 0.3% during the month, and construction increased by 2.0%. That leaves services and construction both above their pre-coronavirus levels, by 0.5% and 0.3% respectively, while production has yet to recover (still 2.6% below) Newsflash: The UK economy shrank by 0.2% in December as the Omicron variant weighed on the recovery. That leaves the economy back at its level in February 2020, before the pandemic, after it had exceeded its pre-Covid levels in November. It\u2019s a smaller contraction than economists had feared, though. Q4 had been shaping up to be a reasonably decent quarter until the Omicron wave broke over the UK economy in December, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. The big question is how much of the November rebound in manufacturing and construction carried over into December, and whether it was enough to offset the collapse in retail sales which fell by -3.6%, more than wiping out the collective 2.7% gain seen in October and November. Expectations for the UK economy come in slightly below the 1.1% gain seen in Q3, with a rebound in exports and imports also likely to be seen, as consumers here in the UK and across Europe shop early for Christmas. Industrial and manufacturing production is expected to slow from the strong performance seen in November, with forecasts of about 0.1%. We\u2019ll find out at 7am.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we learn how the UK economy fared in December, as Omicron put the brakes on the recovery. Economists predict that UK GDP could have fallen during the month, perhaps by 0.6%, after ministers introduced restrictions to slow the highly infectious variant. Hospitality firms were hit by cancellations, and retail sales fell as people avoided the shops. Millions of employees worked from home, and many were off work due to sickness, or self-isolating, causing staff shortages. Before Omicron hit, the UK economy had just recovered to its pre-pandemic levels in November. For the full quarter of October-December, gross domestic product for the fourth quarter is expected to grow a little over 1%, similar to the 1.1% growth in July-September. We\u2019ll also find out how fast the UK economy grew during the full year, as it recovered from its 2020 slump which saw GDP shrink almost 10%. Elsewhere today, financial markets are heading for losses, after US inflation surged to a 40-year high of 7.5%. Wall Street fell after one Federal Reserve policymaker, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, said he has become \u201cdramatically\u201d more hawkish. He wants a full percentage point of interest rate hikes over the next three policy meetings to tame inflation - which has fuelled expectations that the Fed could hike rates by 50 basis points in March. The FTSE 100 is seen dropping around 1%, after hitting a two-year high last night.

            "date": "2022-02-24T12:13:38Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson has said that \u201ca vast invasion is under way, by land, by sea and by air\u201d in Ukraine, as he promised to impose \u201cmassive\u201d sanctions that would \u201chobble\u201d the Russian economy. Speaking as world leaders scrambled to respond to the attacks that began early on Thursday, the UK prime minister said Russia had \u201cattacked a friendly country without any provocation and without any credible excuse\u201d. He said Russia must not be allowed to succeed. \u201cDiplomatically, politically, economically, and eventually militarily, this hideous and barbaric adventure of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,\u201d he said. Johnson said Ukraine had for decades been a free country, able to determine its own destiny. \u201cWe and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away. \u201cThis act of wanton and reckless aggression is an attack not just on Ukraine. It is an attack on democracy and freedom in eastern Europe and around the world,\u201d he said. In a deliberate reference to Neville Chamberlain, the prime minister remembered for underestimating Hitler\u2019s murderous intentions in the 1930s, Johnson said Ukraine was \u201cnot in the infamous phrase some faraway country of which we know little\u201d. Chamberlain used those words when Germany was allowed to annex the Sudetenland \u2013 then part of Czechoslovakia \u2013 in 1938, in exchange for a promise of peace. In contrast, Johnson said \u201cwe have Ukrainian friends in this country; neighbours, co-workers\u201d, telling the Ukrainian people: \u201cWe are with you, we are praying for you and your families and we are on your side.\u201d Johnson also made a direct appeal to the Russian people, saying: \u201cI cannot believe this is being done in your name or that you really want the pariah status it will bring to the Putin regime.\u201d The prime minister said the details of financial sanctions would be coordinated with the UK\u2019s international allies. He called for the west to end its dependence on Russian oil and gas as part of its response to the crisis. Oil and gas prices have rocketed in response to the attacks, auguring a sharp increase in fuel and domestic energy prices in the UK. Johnson gave the televised statement after a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee at 7.30am. He is expected to join a meeting of G7 leaders later, before addressing MPs at 5pm to set out details of the sanctions package. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said the sanctions should leave the Putin regime isolated, \u201cits finances frozen, its ability to function crippled\u201d. He called for Johnson to \u201cmake a clean break with the failed approach\u201d to handling the Russian leader, saying that Nato responses to past incursions into Georgia, Crimea and Donbas had \u201cfed his belief that the benefits of aggression outweigh the cost\u201d. Starmer also called for the UK to stop being \u201ca safe haven for the money that Putin and his fellow bandits gained by stealing from the Russian people\u201d. He added: \u201cThis must be a turning point in our history. We must look back and say that this terrible day was actually when Putin doomed himself to defeat.\u201d Meanwhile, an acrimonious meeting was held in Whitehall after the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, summoned Russia\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin. A UK Foreign Office source said Kelin \u201cspouted the usual propaganda\u201d but that Truss was \u201chaving none of it\u201d and told him he \u201cshould be ashamed of himself\u201d. The source added the foreign secretary had told Kelin the international community would \u201crally around Ukraine\u201d and that Russia had turned itself into \u201can international pariah\u201d. Johnson faced criticism from across the political spectrum earlier this week for introducing a package of sanctions many MPs, including in his own party, felt were too weak. Tom Tugendhat suggested the limited sanctions announced on Monday may have encouraged the Russian president. \u201cWhat that did, I\u2019m afraid, was it didn\u2019t deter, but encouraged, because it gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren\u2019t wiling to do anything serious,\u201d the chair of the foreign affairs select committee told the BBC\u2019s Today programme."

            "date": "2022-02-20T18:30:10Z",
            "content": "In the lead-up to Cop26 in November, Boris Johnson was at his most panglossian as he extolled the economic benefits of the country\u2019s transition to net zero. \u201cThe UK\u2019s path to ending our contribution to climate change,\u201d the prime minister forecast, \u201cwill be paved with well-paid jobs, billions in investment and thriving green industries \u2026 by moving first and taking bold action, we will build a defining competitive edge in electric vehicles, offshore wind, carbon capture technology and more.\u201d Back in the real world, matters stand rather differently. Far from forging ahead of the rest, Britain risks falling behind in the new industrial revolution, as latest figures from the Office for National Statistics make depressingly clear. The green economy more or less flatlined between 2014 and 2020, the ONS found. Employment in the low-carbon and renewable energy sectors \u2013 which include manufacturing, energy supply and construction \u2013 actually fell. This dismal state of affairs predated the Covid pandemic and the accompanying recession. The present administration cannot be blamed for the poor performance of its Tory predecessors, but it is signally failing to learn from their mistakes. Windy rhetoric is not enough. To a far greater extent, the state must play a strategic role in shaping and investing in the green economy. In the renewable energy sector, a reliance on importing turbines and other components means that too many of the well-paid \u201cgreen-collar\u201d jobs to which Mr Johnson refers are located abroad. Similarly, the government\u2019s instinctive aversion to state intervention has led to a failure to properly invest in a green future for the steel industry. Green steel will be fundamental to a net zero economy, but as Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Port Talbot, has pointed out, other countries are leaving the UK behind in the race to modernise. A national retrofit programme is urgently needed to increase energy efficiency in people\u2019s homes. But the government\u2019s reluctance to adequately pump-prime a nascent market means another chance to secure good jobs linked to the green transition is being squandered. Sadly, the government\u2019s ideological direction of travel is towards less, not more, intervention. As Mr Johnson attempts merely to survive in office following partygate, influential sections of his party are determined to force his administration to adopt a still more laissez-faire approach. Last week, the prime minister\u2019s new chief of staff, Stephen Barclay, suggested that in the wake of the pandemic, it was time to for the government to \u201cstep back\u201d from people\u2019s lives. The Treasury\u2019s determination to rein in public spending post-Covid signals that necessary green subsidies and investment will not be forthcoming, and the cost-of-living crisis is being used by Conservative backbenchers such as Steve Baker to present the green agenda as an expensive imposition on the less well-off. Welcome developments, such as \u00a3100m of government money for a car battery manufacturing startup in Blyth, are too small-scale and too ad hoc. Last week\u2019s ONS report must be a wake-up call. An enormous opportunity risks being wasted through a combination of misplaced ideology, blinkered short-termism and lack of strategic imagination and ambition in Whitehall. In the parts of the country that suffered most from ruthless and precipitate deindustrialisation in the 1980s, the path to net zero can be a catalyst for renewal. The state, the private sector, trade unions and local communities can deliver this by working together. But only if the scale of Johnsonian rhetoric is matched by deeds."

            "content": "The average wage of the top 1% in Britain rose to \u00a313,770 a month in December. Jeevun Sandher, an economist at King\u2019s College London, points out the very richest saw their incomes rise the fastest during the pandemic. This group were also likely to have been able to save the most while Covid raged. Where do the very wealthiest spend their cash? One place is housing, for which there is a low level of stock being released on to the market. The result is rising house prices. Over the past 12 months, asking prices have gone up by 9.5%. This has a knock-on effect for renters. UK rents rose by 8.3% in the last three months of 2021. For would-be first-time buyers, the situation is as bad if not worse, with the current average price of \u00a3277,000 nearly \u00a325,000 higher than just a year ago. Those looking to have a roof to live under will find little solace in official figures. These record an 11% drop in the number of total homes added in 2021 compared with the year before. The number of new affordable houses that began being built dropped 16% year-on-year. Shortages of labour and materials, as well as planning delays, will make it harder for the 11th Tory housing minister since 2010 to meet government targets for new homes. Britain\u2019s housing stock is being turned into an asset class as a consequence of the excessive financialisation of the UK economy. For those who own their homes, these buildings serve a dual purpose: they provide shelter, and function as investments. For around 2.5 million landlords, who between them accounted for 18% of all property purchases in 2019, they are only investments. If the underlying problem is a lack of homes, then one solution may be to build more. But if the problem is landlords, and the fact that property owners are incentivised by rising prices, as well as their desire for more space (a desire that may have been augmented by the switch to home working), to buy as much of it as they can, then building more homes won\u2019t help. It could even make matters worse, by creating more opportunities to extract exorbitant rents from those who have an income but lack the capital for a deposit, or the confidence to take on a huge debt. Over recent decades, ballooning property prices have served home owners well, especially in the south of England. The form of inequality this has created currently appears to be generational. Older people are more likely to own their homes than younger ones. City firms are ploughing billions of pension savings in \u201cbuild-to-rent\u201d developments that could see a transfer of wealth as younger people end up paying the pensions of older people. The Labour party could be bolder in dealing with the property haves and have-nots. Its housing policy is for first-time buyers to get priority in new housing developments and to ban foreign owners buying up new properties. But hoarding by commercial landlords that hurts young renters and many homeowners needs tackling. One suggestion by housing barrister David Renton is for \u201cright to buy\u201d to be extended to the private sector \u2013 say to where landlords own a minimum of five properties. There may be outrage from those who regard rent as economic growth. This surely must change. While Korea makes consumer electronics and Germany makes cars, Britain churns out buy-to-let landlords. There\u2019s little to envy in such \u201csuccess\u201d."

            "date": "2022-02-24T23:50:54Z",
            "content": "That\u2019s it from us today in the nation\u2019s capital. Here\u2019s how the day unfolded in Washington, as the world offered its prayers to Ukraine in the face of a full-scale Russian invasion: Biden denounced Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to move forward with the invasion. In a speech at the White House this afternoon, Biden told the nation:\u201cPutin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.\u201d Biden announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russian financial institutions and elite families. The sanctions call for Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest bank, to be severed from the US financial system, restricting the bank\u2019s access to transactions made in the American dollar. Full sanctions will also be imposed on four other financial institutions, including Russia\u2019s second-largest bank of VTB, freezing all of their US-based assets. But Biden did not call for Russia to be banned from the Swift banking system, and he is not issuing direct sanctions on Putin, as some lawmakers have called for. Biden said some European leaders do not support cutting off Russia\u2019s access to Swift, and he claimed direct sanctions on Putin were still possible, although he did not explain why he is not taking that step now. The US is deploying additional troops to Germany, although Biden made clear that he would not send service members to Ukraine. \u201cOur forces are not, and will not be, engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,\u201d Biden said. \u201cOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our Nato allies and reassure those allies in the east.\u201d During her evening press briefing, Jen Psaki said the US was prepared to take Ukrainian refugees, though she expected the vast majority would prefer to remain in Europe. Asked about Putin\u2019s references to Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal, Psaki said: \u201cWe don\u2019t see any increased threat in that regard at the present time.\u201d For more updates on the situation in Ukraine, make sure to follow the Guardian\u2019s other live blog, which is still going: Asked when Biden would impose more severe sanctions, the president told reporters earlier that the penalties they had already announced were severe and were having an impact, but would take time. \u201cLet\u2019s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they\u2019re working,\u201d he said. Assuming Ukraine doesn\u2019t have a month, is the US effectively conceding Ukraine to Russia, a reporter asked? Psaki roundly rejected that notion. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about the president\u2019s strategy or approach or leadership in the world ... that suggests that he is ceding anything,\u201d she said. At the end of the briefing, after she signaled it was over by putting on her mask, a reporter asked if the US believed Russia was preparing to invade other countries beyond Ukraine. \u201cWe certainly think he has grander ambitions,\u201d Psaki said of Putin. Asked in real time to respond to comments from Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who reportedly called Psaki \u201cpeppermint patty\u201d during a speech at CPAC, the White House press secretary laughed and said she did not view that as an insult. \u201cSenator Cruz, I like peppermint patty,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a little tougher than that.\u201d Psaki said Biden is still planning to announce his nominee for the supreme court before the end of the month. It\u2019s the 24th, the month ends on the 28th. \u201cWe are still on track to make an announcement before the end of the month,\u201d she said. She added that \u201cno job offer has been made\u201d. In the midst of coordinating a response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and interviewing potential supreme court nominees, Psaki said Biden is also preparing to give his State of the Union address on 1 March. She said he is working with his Covid team to offer an update to the American people on the state of the pandemic. Psaki also said the US was \u201coutraged\u201d by reports that Russian troops have taken some staff hostage at the Chernobyl nuclear site. She called for their immediate release. Pressed on when sanctions may start to take effect, Psaki said they already are. \u201cLook at where the ruble\u2019s at,\u201d she said. Psaki is speaking now, and began by outlining Biden\u2019s movements over the last several hours since Russia launched its pre-dawn invasion of Ukraine. She said he \u201cclosely monitored\u201d the events on the ground from the Oval Office and later from the residence into the \u201cwee hours\u201d of the morning. Last night, he spoke repeatedly with his national security advisor, Jake Sullivan and also to UN ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, before she delivered a rousing call-to-arms at the UN security council emergency meeting on Ukraine. He also spoke to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, his only phone call with the leader since the Russian invasion. After a round of meetings with Nato leaders and his security council, Biden also spent time briefing Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress by phone. Psaki wouldn\u2019t comment on a question about Zelenskiy\u2019s whereabouts but said administration officials continues to be in touch with him. She said the US is working with European countries to prepare for an influx of Ukrainian refugees, but said the US is also prepared to welcome them here. Asked whether the US interpreted Putin\u2019s verbal warning to adversaries as a threat of nuclear war, Psaki said she wasn\u2019t sure what he intended to convey, but added, \u201cwe don\u2019t see any increased threat in that regard at this time\u201d. \u201cToday was a demonstration that we mean what we say,\u201d Singh said when asked why the US didn\u2019t take even more severe actions such as removing Russia from the Swift international banking system. With the measures, he said the US wanted to be careful not to target the average Russian citizen and mitigate the economic consequences for Americans. He stressed that energy is the \u201cone area\u201d where Russia has a strategic advantage, and that it wouldn\u2019t be wise to do disrupt the flow of energy. Singh is acknowledging that the measures will take time to take hold. Asked about a comment Biden made earlier, that \u201cno one\u201d expected sanctions to deter an invasion, Singh defended the administration\u2019s course of action and said imposing steeper penalties could have pre-empted diplomatic efforts or signaled to Putin that he had little left to lose. \u201cThe goal of our sanctions is to make this a strategic failure for Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when we say all options are on the table ... it would be a mistake to doubt that resolve,\u201d he said. Psaki has arrived, joined by Daleep Singh, the deputy national security advisor for international economics and the deputy national economic council director. \u201cThis is a briefing I never wanted to give,\u201d Singh said. \u201cPutin has made his choice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe rejected diplomacy and chose war.\u201d Singh said the US had followed through on its threat to impose the \u201cmost severe\u201d sanctions ever levied against Russia. He is outlining in details the economic penalties and export restrictions now being placed on Russia\u2019s largest banks, companies and oligarchs. \u201cWorking in tandem, these financial sanctions and export controls will undercut Putin\u2019s aspirations,\u201d he said. He said the impacts would be felt across Russia over time, resulting in \u201chigher inflation, higher interest rates, lower purchasing power ... lower living standards\u201d. He added that the intentionally exempted Russia\u2019s energy sector to avoid disruptions to the current flow of energy from Russia to the world. Hello. I\u2019m Lauren Gambino in Washington, specifically, in the back row of the James Brady press room at the White House, where we\u2019re expecting Jen Psaki to take questions shortly. While we wait, the Department of Defense confirmed earlier today that the US is sending 7,000 troops to Germany to \u201creassure Nato allies\u201d. \u201cWe expect them to depart in the coming days,\u201d according to a senior defense official, as reported by Task and Purpose. Joe Biden briefed the top four congressional leaders on the situation in Ukraine earlier today, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in Kentucky. All four leaders -- McConnell, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy -- attended the classified discussion. Pelosi has said that members of Congress will also receive a classified, in-person briefing from the administration next week. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, spoke to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken today to discuss the latest round of US sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion. \u201cCall with @SecBlinken on ways to stop Russia\u2019s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine,\u201d Kuleba said on Twitter. \u201cSecretary informed me on the new U.S. sanctions on Russia, as well as plans to deliver new defensive weapons to help Ukraine defend itself. Ukraine holds ground. We need the world to help us.\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, sharply criticized Joe Biden for not issuing direct sanctions on Vladimir Putin in response to his invasion of Ukraine. \u201cWe should not be seeking permission from allies to go after Putin and his cronies. We should move ahead forcefully against Putin, a war criminal, and demand our allies join us,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWhen it comes to sanctions against Putin: If we are not doing everything possible, we are not doing enough. Time is not on our side.\u201d Biden said today that his administration is not eliminating the possibility of issuing direct sanctions against Putin, but he ignored questions about why he was not taking that step now. Graham also reiterated that he would work with his congressional colleagues in both parties to quickly pass a bill providing emergency supplemental aid to Ukraine in response to the invasion. \u201cHow we deal with Putin determines what happens in other regions like Asia and the Middle East,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe need to get this done in the Senate next week.\u201d Barack Obama has released a new statement condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, arguing that Vladimir Putin\u2019s military actions represent a threat to democracies around the world. \u201cLast night, Russia launched a brazen attack on the people of Ukraine, in violation of international law and basic principles of human decency,\u201d the former president said. \u201cFor exercising rights that should be available to all people and nations, Ukrainians now face a brutal onslaught that is killing innocents and displacing untold numbers of men, women and children.\u201d Obama warned that the invasion of Ukraine \u201cthreatens the foundation of the international order and security,\u201d underscoring how the \u201cforces of division and authoritarianism\u201d are mounting an assault on global democratic values. \u201cRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine shows where these dangerous trends can lead -- and why they cannot be left unchallenged,\u201d Obama said. \u201cPeople of conscience around the world need to loudly and clearly condemn Russia\u2019s actions and offer support for the Ukrainian people.\u201d Obama called on \u201cevery American, regardless of party\u201d to support Joe Biden\u2019s latest sanctions against Russia, which target some of the country\u2019s largest banks and more elite Russian families. \u201cThere may be some economic consequences to such sanctions, given Russia\u2019s significant role in world energy markets,\u201d Obama acknowledged. \u201cBut that\u2019s a price we should be willing to pay to take a stand on the side of freedom.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi applauded Joe Biden\u2019s latest round of sanctions against Russia in response to Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, expressing support for the Ukrainian people. \u201cThe leadership of President Biden and our allies to demonstrate overwhelming resolve is crucial in this moment of heartbreak and suffering for the Ukrainian people,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cWe are united with unprecedented strength and coordination in our commitment to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d Pelosi noted that House members received a briefing from the Biden administration on the Ukraine crisis today and will receive a classified, in-person briefing next week. \u201cPresident Biden has made clear throughout Russia\u2019s escalation that we will continue to impose costs on Russia that will leave it weakened in every way,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe United States Congress joins President Biden and all Americans in praying for the Ukrainian people.\u201d Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, said the US sanctions against Russia need to go even further than those announced by Joe Biden today. \u201cI think the package of sanctions that the president announced is the most severe we\u2019ve ever levied against Russia and many times more devastating than anything that was implemented after their last invasion in 2014,\u201d Schiff told MSNBC. \u201cNevertheless, I favor going further. I favor expelling them from Swift. I favor imposing sanctions directly on Vladimir Putin. This is an unprecedent situation, and even though we don\u2019t generally sanction heads of state, on occasion we do, and I think it\u2019s merited here.\u201d Biden said during his event this afternoon that direct sanctions on Putin were one possibility the US may explore, but he ignored a question about why he is not authorizing those sanctions now. After his speech on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Joe Biden was asked by a reporter why the US and its allies are not moving to block Russia out of Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication). \u201cThe sanctions that we have proposed on all of their banks are of equal consequence, maybe more consequence, than Swift,\u201d Biden said. He added, \u201cIt is always an option, but right now that\u2019s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.\u201d The West\u2019s refusal to crack down on Russia\u2019s use of Swift has outraged the Ukrainian government. The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Boffey and Jessica Elgot report: Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, voiced his anger as EU heads of state and government appeared likely to decide against blocking Russia from an international payments system through which it receives foreign currency. With casualties mounting, Kuleba warned that European and US politicians would have \u2018blood on their hands\u2019 if they failed to impose the heaviest toll on Moscow by cutting Russia from the so-called Swift payments system. \u2018I will not be diplomatic on this,\u2019 he tweeted. \u2018Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from Swift has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too. BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT.\u2019 The US Treasury noted that the latest sanctions against Russia will impact nearly 80% of all banking assets in the country, fundamentally threatening the Russian economy and weakening the Kremlin\u2019s geopolitical posture. \u201cTreasury is taking serious and unprecedented action to deliver swift and severe consequences to the Kremlin and significantly impair their ability to use the Russian economy and financial system to further their malign activity,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. \u201cOur actions, taken in coordination with partners and allies, will degrade Russia\u2019s ability to project power and threaten the peace and stability of Europe.\u201d Yellen said the US is also \u201cprepared to impose further costs on Russia in response to its egregious actions\u201d if Vladimir Putin pursues further aggression against Ukraine. \u201cWe are united in our efforts to hold Russia accountable for its further invasion of Ukraine while mitigating impacts to Americans and our partners,\u201d Yellen said. The White House has released a fact sheet on the latest round of sanctions against Russia in response to Vladimir Putin launching a fuller-scale invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions call for Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest bank, to be severed from the US financial system, restricting the bank\u2019s access to transactions made in the American dollar. Meanwhile, full sanctions will be imposed on four other financial institutions, including Russia\u2019s second-largest bank of VTB. That measure will freeze any of the banks\u2019 assets touching the US financial system and prohibit Americans from dealing with them. Joe Biden was asked whether Vladimir Putin\u2019s latest military actions in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russia represent a complete rupture in US-Russian relations. \u201cThere is a complete rupture right now in US-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they\u2019re on,\u201d Biden said. Addressing the possibility of another Cold War starting, Biden said the vast majority of the world does not support Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be a cold day for Russia,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense.\u201d After taking several questions from reporters, Biden concluded the event and walked away from his podium in the East Room. Another reporter pressed Joe Biden on the fact that Vladimir Putin has so far been undeterred by the threat of sanctions, asking what might be effective at stopping the Russian leader. \u201cNo one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. This could take time, and we have to show resolve so he knows what\u2019s coming, and so the people of Russia know what he\u2019s brought on them. That\u2019s what this is all about,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together, and we will. We will, and it will impose significant costs on him.\u201d Joe Biden warned that Vladimir Putin is likely looking far beyond Ukraine as Russia launches a full-scale invasion of its neighboring country. \u201cHe has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I think that his ambitions are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.\u201d Joe Biden took several questions from reporters after finishing his prepared remarks on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which included an announcement of additional sanctions on Russia. Asked whether he intends to speak to Vladimir Putin in the near future, Biden said, \u201cI have no plans to talk with Putin.\u201d Another reporter asked Biden whether the US is urging China, which has traditionally aligned itself with Russia, to help the West isolate Putin. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to comment on that at the moment,\u201d Biden said. Joe Biden pledged that Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine would cost Russia \u201cdearly, economically and strategically,\u201d as the US and its allies announce new sanctions against the country. \u201cPutin will be a pariah on the international stage,\u201d Biden said, warning that any countries affiliating themselves with Russia would be \u201cstained by association\u201d. \u201cWhen the history of this era is written, Putin\u2019s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger,\u201d Biden said. Joe Biden emphasized the importance of the US and its allies standing up to Russian aggression, arguing that Vladimir Putin\u2019s military maneuvers in Ukraine threaten freedom everywhere. \u201cThis aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAmerica stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.\u201d Joe Biden said he was deploying more US troops to Germany in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but he emphasized that US troops would not be sent to Ukraine itself. \u201cOur forces are not, and will not be, engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,\u201d Biden said. \u201cOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our Nato allies and reassure those allies in the east.\u201d Biden reiterated that the US will fight to protect every inch of Nato territory and live up to its Article 5 commitments to defend its allies in the face of escalating Russian aggression. Joe Biden said US oil and gas companies \u201cshould not exploit this moment,\u201d amid concerns that the Russian invasion of Ukraine will cause sharply higher gas prices. The president said he would release additional barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve if necessary, as his administration closely monitors the energy industry. \u201cI will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut this aggression cannot go unanswered.\u201d Joe Biden said Vladimir Putin bears sole responsibility for the attack on Ukraine, and he announced his administration will impose more severe sanctions on Russia in response to the expanded invasion. \u201cPutin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,\u201d Biden said. The US president said the sanctions will target four more Russian banks that were not included in the first tranche of sanctions, including VTB, the country\u2019s second-largest bank. \u201cThis will impose severe costs on the Russian economy both immediately and over time,\u201d Biden said of the new sanctions. Joe Biden has now appeared in the East Room of the White House to deliver a national address on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The US president condemned Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cbrutal assault on the people of Ukraine,\u201d accusing the Russian leader of rejecting every diplomatic opportunity presented to him. \u201cThis is a premeditated attack,\u201d Biden said. \u201cVladimir Putin has been planning this for months.\u201d As we await Joe Biden\u2019s remarks on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the secretary-general of the United Nations has weighed in on the crisis. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres reiterated that Vladimir Putin\u2019s military actions in Ukraine directly violate the UN charter, which prohibits members from using force to threaten the territorial integrity or political independence of another country. \u201cIt is wrong. It is against the charter. It is unacceptable, but it is not irreversible,\u201d Guterres said, repeating his plea to Putin to withdraw his troops from Ukraine. \u201cThe decisions of the coming days will shape our world,\u201d Guterres added. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to save this generation from the scourge of war. We need peace.\u201d My colleague Leyland Cecco is talking to the huge Ukrainian diaspora community in Canada. I have a knot in my stomach. I can only imagine what it\u2019s like for people in Ukraine who are living with the shelling,\u201d said Taras Kulish, a Toronto-based charity lawyer and member of the Ukrainian-Canadian Congress and Ukrainian Canadian Social Services. \u201cWe\u2019re all concerned and there\u2019s a definitely a shock factor in processing it.\u201d A number of organizations across Canada are quickly raising funds for relief projects. Kulish, who works closely with humanitarian organizations in Ukraine, says colleagues on the ground have described the surreal experience of shelling near their homes and the constant worry of loved ones: I\u2019ve been checking in with colleagues telling them we\u2019re here. We\u2019re praying for you. We\u2019re looking to see what we can do in response. We\u2019re trying to give them that knowledge that people are concerned about them and who love them. But you can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like. It\u2019s almost unfathomable.\u201d He adds that since 2014 he has worked for trauma therapy clinics in the country\u2019s eastern region. \u201cWe\u2019ve been living this for the last seven years, so in one way, we\u2019re terribly prepared for it.\u201d Cecco adds: In addition to solidarity rallies across Canada condemning the invasion by Russia, the prairie province of Alberta announced it would donate C$1m to the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, a recognition of the large diaspora population in the region \u2013 and the long history Ukrainian residents have farming the area. Is Putin unwell? My colleagues Julian Borger in Washington and Angelique Chrisafis in Paris have reported on new questions being raised about the mental status of the leader of a country with 6,000 nuclear warheads. His decision to voluntarily start a land war, and the \u201csheer weirdness\u201d of his recent public appearances, has worried leaders and Russia watchers in western capitals, they say: They worry about a 70 year-old man whose tendency towards insularity has been amplified by his precautions against Covid, leaving him surrounded by an ever-shrinking coterie of fearful obedient courtiers. He appears increasingly uncoupled from the contemporary world, preferring to burrow deep into history and a personal quest for greatness. The French president Emmanuel Macron is well-placed to analyse changes to Putin\u2019s demeanour. Macron once drove a cooperative, if self-conscious, Putin round the gardens of the palace of Versailles in a tiny electric golf cart in the summer of 2017 and welcomed him to his holiday residence at a fortress on the Mediterranean coast the following summer, where Putin descended from a helicopter carrying a bunch of flowers and complemented the Macrons on their tans. After Macron held five hours of talks with the Russian leader in Moscow at opposite ends of a 15-metre table, he told reporters on the return flight that \u201cthe tension was palpable\u201d. This was not the same Putin he had last met at the Elys\u00e9e palace in December 2019, Macron said. He was \u201cmore rigid, more isolated\u201d and was off on an \u201cideological and security drift\u201d. Following Putin\u2019s speech on Monday, an Elys\u00e9e official made an unusually bold assessment that the speech was \u201cparanoid\u201d. Bernard Guetta, a member of the European parliament for Macron\u2019s grouping, told France Inter radio on Thursday morning, after military invasion began: \u201cI think this man is losing his sense of reality, to say it politely.\u201d Asked by the interviewer if that meant he thought Putin had gone mad, he said \u201cyes\u201d. Stay tuned for their full report. Bernie Sanders has responded to the recent praise of Vladimir Putin\u2019s naked aggression toward Ukraine expressed by a former US president. The Democratic senator said: It is outrageous, if unsurprising, that Trump would praise Putin\u2019s murderous invasion of Ukraine as an act of \u201cgenius.\u201d It should concern us all that Putin is exactly the kind of leader Trump would like to be, and that so few Republicans have the courage to say this out loud. The former president in question had described the supposed \u201cpeacekeeping force\u201d entering eastern Ukraine as \u201cthe strongest peace force I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, adding: \u201cThere were more army tanks than I\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019re gonna keep peace all right.\u201d He had also become confused on the Laura Ingraham show last night, appearing to believe that US troops were landing in Ukraine (rather than Russian ones) \u2013 and saying he thought that that news should be kept secret. Congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said after a National Security Council briefing on Capitol Hill that he wanted to see Russia removed from the SWIFT international banking system in response to its invasion of Ukraine. \u201cRussia has begun an unprovoked, unjustified and brutal campaign against Ukraine,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe must provide Ukraine with support to defend itself. We are also going to need to dramatically escalate the sanctions we place on Russia for this act of naked aggression.\u201d The chairman of the House intelligence committee said he believed the US needed to cut off Russia from the international banking system and its ability to access western capital, its ability to gather technology for weapons systems, and sanction the country\u2019s oligarchs. Schiff said the US needed to take additional steps to end Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian oil and gas to prevent Putin from using energy as a geopolitical weapon. He added that Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine \u201cought to spell, at a minimum, the final death of Nord Stream 2.\u201d The unclassified NSC briefing that took place shortly before midday on Thursday indicated that Russia had the military capability to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s forces, Schiff told reporters, and that he anticipated Russia would very quickly overrun the country. Schiff said that NSC officials were concerned about the possibility of a Russian cyber attack against not only Ukraine, but US and NATO allies. He added that he had not seen evidence of a cyber attack directed at the US, but noted it was still early in the conflict. NBC reports that Joe Biden has been given various options for American cyberattacks to disrupt Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine. According to the news network: Two US intelligence officials, one Western intelligence official and another person briefed on the matter say no final decisions have been made, but they say U.S. intelligence and military cyber warriors are proposing the use of American cyber weapons on a scale never before contemplated. Among the options: Disrupting internet connectivity across Russia, shutting off electric power, and tampering with railroad switches to hamper Russia\u2019s ability to re-supply its forces, three of the sources said. \u201cYou could do everything from slow the trains down to have them fall off the tracks,\u201d one person briefed on the matter said. A cyberattack would be something of a turning point for the US, given its cyber efforts have prioritised counterterrorism \u2013 mainly information and intelligence gathering \u2013 though it did also attack the Iranian nuclear program a little over a decade ago. Russia and China have used much more extensive cyberattacks against American infrastructure, however, and experts say the US has been quietly preparing to fight fire with fire. The White House has released a statement from Joe Biden saying the G7 leaders have agreed to move forward on \u201cdevastating packages of sanctions\u201d. The tweeted statement from the president said: This morning, I met with my G7 counterparts to discuss President Putin\u2019s unjustified attack on Ukraine and we agreed to move forward on devastating packages of sanctions and other economic measures to hold Russia to account. We stand with the brave people of Ukraine. Biden will be delivering an address to the American people from the White House in less than an hour, at 1:30pm ET. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell weighed in on the Ukraine invasion with some criticism for Joe Biden. \u201cWhat we have in Europe now is the first shooting war since world war 2,\u201d the Republican from Kentucky said, continuing: \u201cI have earlier criticised the president and I will repeat some of that. I think the precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan in August was a signal, to Putin and maybe to Chinese president Xi as well, that America was in retreat - that America could not be depended upon - and was an invitation to the autocrats of the world that maybe this was a good time to make a move.\u201d Despite his words, McConnell nevertheless claimed to be united with Biden in response. \u201cWe are where we are. The president will be addressing this issue again shortly. We\u2019re all together at this point and we need to be together about what should be done. \u201cBut I have some advice. Ratchet the sanctions all the way up, don\u2019t hold any back. Every single available tough sanction should be employed and should be employed now. There\u2019s no such thing as a little invasion.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden will deliver a national address on the Russian invasion of Ukraine in about an hour. The US president\u2019s speech comes as Russian forces launched a fuller-scale invasion of Ukraine, attacking major cities, including the capital of Kyiv. Biden held a virtual meeting with other G7 leaders this morning to discuss the invasion. The president also met with his National Security Council in the Situation Room to assess the Russian attack and outline potential responses to the invasion. The House intelligence committee chairman is calling for tougher US sanctions against Russia in response to the latest developments. Two days after Biden announced the first tranche of sanctions against Russia, Democrat Adam Schiff called on the US to sanction the largest Russian banks and cut off the country from the international financing system to deprive it of access to Western capital. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Schedule update: Joe Biden\u2019s speech on the Russian invasion of Ukraine is now expected to start at 1.30pm ET, instead of 12.30pm ET, so it will get underway in about an hour. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, is also scheduled to hold a briefing with reporters at 3pm ET and will take questions about the likely escalation of US sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion. Stay tuned. Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US, delivered a defiant message on behalf of her country in response to the Russian invasion. \u201cUkraine has activated our right to self-defense in accordance with international law,\u201d Markarova told reporters at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington. \u201cThe combat spirit of Ukrainian military is high. We are fighting, we will be fighting -- not only our brave and motivated military but all Ukrainians. We are protecting our home, and we will not stop.\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said US sanctions on Russia need to be \u201cdramatically\u201d escalated in response to the invasion of Ukraine. \u201cRussia has begun an unprovoked, unjustified campaign against Ukraine with a full-on invasion,\u201d Schiff told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cCivilians are being killed. Ukraine is mobilizing its opposition to the Russian invasion, and we must provide Ukraine with support to defend itself.\u201d Attacking Vladimir Putin as a \u201cKremlin dictator,\u201d Schiff called on the US to sanction the largest Russian banks and cut off Russia from the international financing system, depriving the country of access to Western capital. \u201cWe need to attack its ability to gather sophisticated technology for its weapons systems,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe have to go after more of its oligarchs, and we need to continue to strengthen our Nato defenses in the region to protect our Nato allies.\u201d Joe Biden is scheduled to deliver a speech on the invasion in about 30 minutes, and he is expected to outline tougher sanctions against Russia. Stay tuned. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, said he just spoke to Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, about the US response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Graham, who criticized Joe Biden\u2019s first tranche of sanctions against Russia as insufficient, told Sherman there is \u201cbroad bipartisan support for an emergency supplemental to include aid to the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian military\u201d. \u201cIt is important Congress unite to punish and crush Putin and his cronies. Not only will this help prevent further damage in Europe, but it will discourage other bad actors from going down the same road,\u201d Graham said on Twitter. \u201cIf we do not treat Putin and his cronies as the war criminals they are, we will be making a huge mistake and sending the wrong message to other bad actors around the world.\u201d Marco Rubio, the Republican vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, has been sending tweets about Vladimir Putin\u2019s expected strategy in Ukraine. Rubio said that Russian forces plan to encircle the capital city of Kyiv, forcing the legitimate Ukrainian government to flee, and then install a pro-Putin puppet government in its place. Airstrikes are expected to be a crucial part of that plan, and Russia may begin to follow through on that strategy \u201cwithin a matter of hours,\u201d Rubio said. The White House has shared a photo of Joe Biden\u2019s meeting with his National Security Council in the Situation Room this morning to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Biden\u2019s meeting with his national security team came just before the president participated in a virtual discussion about the invasion with other G7 leaders. The US president is scheduled to deliver a national address about the invasion in about an hour, so stay tuned. Joe Biden\u2019s virtual meeting with other G7 leaders to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine concluded after an hour and 10 minutes, the White House said. The leaders who participated in the meeting were German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The White House will likely soon release a readout of the meeting, so stay tuned. Some congressional Republicans have attempted to blame Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy for enabling Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThese developments were not inevitable,\u201d congressman Andy Barr said. \u201cThe Biden Administration\u2019s weak and feckless foreign policy not only failed to deter this aggression, it invited this outcome.\u201d \u201cBiden allowed Putin to cross his red line without severe consequences. This weak foreign policy has emboldened Putin to act aggressively,\u201d congressman Dan Meuser added. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the full force of sanctions from the U.S. and our allies.\u201d But a number of commentators have noted that Republicans were generally quiet as Donald Trump praised Putin and threatened to withhold security assistance from Ukraine during his presidency. \u201cLord, the gaslighting by Republicans this morning with hawkish BS after literally enabling a pro-Putin President for four years and refusing to stop him even when he literally blackmailed Ukraine with millions in security aid to help Ukraine fight Russia,\u201d said Susan Glasser, a New Yorker writer who co-wrote a book about Putin\u2019s rise to power. A dark, sombre mood filled the Moscow air on Thursday morning as Russians were coming to terms with the fact that their president had launched a broad military offensive targeting Ukraine. \u201cI am embarrassed for my country. To be honest with you, I am speechless. War is always scary. We don\u2019t want this,\u201d said Nikita Golubev, a 30-year old teacher. \u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d he added, expressing a sentiment of anger and hopelessness that was shared by many commuting to work down central Arbat Street. At the Ukrainian culture centre just down the road, the mood was even grimmer. The Ukrainian administrator said the centre, which aims to promote the language, traditions and identity of a country Vladimir Putin denied the legitimacy of as a modern state in his speech on Monday, would be shut for the \u201ccoming period\u201d. \u201cWe are being bombed as we speak. Of course we are closed! Jesus, what is happening?\u201d the administrator, who did not want to give his name, shouted. Read the Guardian\u2019s full report: House minority leader Kevin McCarthy attacked Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as \u201creckless and evil,\u201d saying Vladimir Putin must be held accountable for his actions. \u201cThe United States stands with the people of Ukraine and prays for their safety and resolve,\u201d the Republican leader said in a new statement. \u201cPutin\u2019s actions must be met with serious consequence. This act of war is intended to rewrite history and more concerning, upend the balance of power in Europe. Putin must be held accountable for his actions.\u201d Interestingly, McCarthy did not criticize Joe Biden\u2019s response to the Ukraine crisis in his statement, although many other Republicans have been doing so this morning. The invasion is causing turmoil in financial markets. The oil price has soared to over $100 a barrel and US stock markets opened sharply lower this morning. In Europe, all the major stock markets are falling. Gas prices have jumped 40% today in the UK and Europe and the price of gold - seen as a safe haven in times of trouble - is rising. As we await Joe Biden\u2019s speech this afternoon, you can follow all the latest financial developments on our business live blog here. Joe Biden will deliver a national address this afternoon, as Russia invades Ukraine and attacks some of the country\u2019s major cities, including Kyiv. According to the updated schedule just released by the White House, Biden will speak about \u201cRussia\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine\u201d at 12.30pm ET. Earlier this week, Biden outlined his administration\u2019s first tranche of sanctions against Russia in response to its attacks on Ukraine, and the White House has warned that more severe sanctions would be issued if Vladimir Putin moved forward with a fuller-scale invasion. However, Biden has remained adamant that he will not send US troops to Ukraine, despite Russia\u2019s escalating aggression. \u201cThe president has been crystal clear and consistent: he is not sending US troops to fight in Ukraine. That has not changed,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said yesterday. Joe Biden\u2019s virtual meeting with other G7 leaders, which was scheduled to begin at 9am ET, is underway, the White House confirmed. The White House said the meeting began about 45 minutes ago, and the leaders are \u201cdiscussing their joint response to President Putin\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine\u201d. The White House will likely release a readout of the meeting after it concludes, so stay tuned. As the world reacts with horror to Russia\u2019s massive attack on Ukraine, Donald Trump once again praised the strategy of Vladimir Putin. \u201cHe\u2019s taking over a country for $2 worth of sanctions. I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty smart,\u201d Trump said last night, according to footage captured at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Earlier this week, Trump similarly described Putin\u2019s widely criticized decision to recognize two self-proclaimed republics in east Ukraine as \u201cgenius\u201d. Trump\u2019s latest comments were swiftly condemned by many, including deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates, who attacked the former president as anti-American. \u201cTwo nauseating, fearful pigs who hate what America stands for and whose every action is driven by their their own weakness and insecurity, rubbing their snouts together and celebrating as innocent people lose their lives,\u201d Bates said in a tweet. The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Boffey and Elias Visontay report: Western leaders have responded with fury to Russia\u2019s \u201cbarbaric\u201d military attacks on Ukrainian cities and vowed to hold the Kremlin to account for the invasion with a barrage of crippling sanctions. A joint statement issued by the 27 heads of state and government of the EU warned Russia that they would later on Thursday agree on \u201cfurther restrictive measures that will impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its action, in close coordination with our transatlantic partners.\u201d The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, told the House of Commons that the UK and its allies would respond with \u201ca massive package of sanctions\u201d that will \u201chobble the Russian economy\u201d. He said: \u201cUkraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny. We and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away.\u201d France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, who had made a last ditch effort to broker peace through a summit between Putin and Biden, was in contact with Zelenskiy on his mobile phone early on Thursday. He said: \u201cFrance strongly condemns Russia\u2019s decision to wage war on Ukraine. Russia must end its military operations immediately.\u201d Joe Biden convened a meeting of the National Security Council this morning in the Situation Room, a White House official told the press pool. The US president spoke to his top national security advisers just before the virtual meeting with other G7 leaders to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine. Biden also spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy overnight, as explosions went off near Kyiv and other major cities in the country. \u201cI condemned this unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,\u201d Biden said in a statement about the call. \u201cHe asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin\u2019s flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine.\u201d Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden is holding a virtual meeting with other G7 leaders this morning to discuss the latest alarming developments in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d this morning, days after ordering troops into east Ukraine. The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding, Emma Graham-Harrison, Andrew Roth, Pjotr Sauer and Julian Borger report: Within minutes of Putin\u2019s short televised address, at about 5am Ukrainian time, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. The scope of the Russian attack appears to be massive. Ukraine\u2019s interior ministry reported that the country was under attack from cruise and ballistic missiles, with Russia appearing to target infrastructure near major cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Dnipro. Explosions from artillery rockets lit up the night sky as shelling began near Mariupol, video showed. A senior adviser to Ukraine\u2019s interior ministry said that it appeared Russian troops may soon move on Kharkiv, which is about 20 miles from the border. Locals in Kyiv sought safety in bomb shelters as explosions were heard outside the city. The blog will be following all the latest developments out of Washington today, so stay tuned."

            "date": "2022-02-15T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "Another week, another sewage outflow of corruption into the polluted river of Tory politics. Are voters so profoundly cynical that no political bribery or MPs touting for contracts shocks them? Polling suggests the country is not losing its sense of smell. The time may soon be here to take up John Major\u2019s call in the Guardian to clean up party funding and stop dirty donations from distorting democracy. For that, the public has to swallow what it deplores: state funding for political parties. Every inquiry has concluded there is no alternative. Here\u2019s the latest filth: the Tories direct their biggest donors to apply for public posts controlled by a Downing Street unit hidden from public scrutiny. The Sunday Times reports \u201cofficials offering behind-the-scenes support and directing applicants to a secretive Number 10 unit\u201d. That\u2019s their win-win: collecting cash for the party while trying to pack Tories into appointments to public and arts bodies. This comes on top of openDemocracy revealing that donors giving \u00a33m or more to the Tories are virtually guaranteed to be offered a peerage. The stink surrounding Tory fundraising leaks out in an email from its treasurer\u2019s office telling their big donors: \u201cWe thought you may be interested in the latest list of public appointments. It is important Conservatives rebalance the representation at the head of these important public bodies.\u201d The party\u2019s donor club the Leaders\u2019 Group charges a minimum of \u00a350,000 a year for access to ministers. The Tory party co-chairman, Ben Elliot, the Duchess of Cornwall\u2019s nephew, is founder of Quintessentially, a luxury concierge service offering \u201clifestyle management\u201d for the ultra-wealthy. It boasts it can do anything: they once told me of delivering bongo drums to the bored teenage son of a billionaire on a yacht mid-Pacific; and paying a top Manchester United footballer to play with a plutocrat\u2019s seven-year-old. That\u2019s the world Elliot fishes in while he also guides donors to public appointments. The Times reports that Elliot told senior advisers at No 10 that one major donor would be an \u201cexcellent candidate\u201d to oversee emergency Covid-19 loans. His staff lobbied for Mohamed Amersi, the telecoms millionaire and \u00a3750,000 Tory donor, to chair the National Lottery Community Fund; he made it to the last round of selection. This week Elliot\u2019s fundraising comes under scrutiny when Amersi takes his feud with the Tory party to the high court in a libel claim against former Tory MP Charlotte Leslie for questioning the origins of his wealth. In all this murk, no one knows a donor\u2019s true influence, but sometimes they break to the surface. Jonathan Leavesley, the chair of the secretive Midlands Industrial Council bankrolling the Tories and the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, threatens their cash in the Daily Telegraph: \u201cI have been a party donor through bad times as well as good, but my enthusiasm can ebb and flow.\u201d Castigating the rise in national insurance contributions and corporation tax, Leavesley writes: \u201cHave they never heard of the Laffer curve? It is time for the government to act as a free enterprise champion and act Conservative. Get a grip Boris, or go.\u201d Other donors are on the rampage over Johnson\u2019s failings, but it\u2019s not for them to ordain his fate. Colossal power is wielded by dangerously few donors, says Brunel University\u2019s Prof Justin Fisher, with just 10 people donating a quarter of Tory funds \u2013 more than \u00a310m \u2013 since Johnson became prime minister. Particularly pernicious is Johnson\u2019s elections bill abolishing the Electoral Commission\u2019s power to prosecute illegal donations. Labour was always over-reliant on power-wielding union leaders. Unite\u2019s leader, Sharon Graham, last week rattled her money bags in a crude threat over a dispute with bin lorry drivers in Labour-run Coventry. \u201cLet me be very clear \u2013 the remaining financial support of the Labour party is now under review,\u201d she said. Keir Starmer would have none of it: \u201cThe Labour party I lead is not going to be influenced by threats from anybody, whoever they are, and that is just an absolute matter of principle.\u201d Fisher points to the 2019 general election, when Unite donated \u00a34.6m of Labour\u2019s \u00a38.3m; the union has already cut funding after Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s departure. This politicking ignores union members\u2019 interests, since Labour\u2019s strongest policies include fair pay deals in every sector, ending zero hours insecurity and guaranteeing every workplace access to union recruiters. Unlike secret Tory influencers, at least Unite\u2019s attempt at cash-for-influence is rudely transparent. John Major rose to a tremendous philippic against Boris Johnson\u2019s corruptions, though as prime minister he was no Cicero. As ever with former prime ministers, you sigh at their retrospective wisdom, regretting radical reforms they never dared, such as party funding. \u201cThe system needs cleansing,\u201d he writes, to stop politics being \u201cthe plaything of the rich or of pressure groups\u201d. Limit donations by individuals and unions so donors no longer \u201csway policy through an open cheque book\u201d. The last review in 2011, by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, called for capped donations, with state funding at 50p a year per voter. But Nick Clegg slaughtered it at birth in the Commons, saying austerity spending couldn\u2019t afford it. Deep public mistrust means politicians fear asking taxpayers to foot the bill, though political parties are essential to a functioning democracy: less than 2% of the electorate ever join a party. The best idea for distributing state cash came from the Power Inquiry, chaired by Helena Kennedy: voters at elections should allocate a \u00a33 state voucher to any party. That too was killed stone dead. Plummeting polls show the limit to how much voters \u201cpriced in\u201d corruption with Johnson. Enough is enough, the country hasn\u2019t run out of outrage. Whoever inherits Johnson\u2019s filthy stables can only make a clean break by purging political funding. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

            "content": "A clear majority of Americans think Vladimir Putin would not have ordered the Russian invasion of Ukraine had Donald Trump still been in the White House, according to a new poll. The poll, by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies (Caps)-Harris, found that 62% of those surveyed believed Putin would not have sent troops into Ukraine with Trump in the White House. In partisan terms, the survey found that 85% of Republicans and 38% of Democrats held the view. The poll, conducted on Wednesday and Thursday this week among 2,026 registered voters, found that 59% said Putin only ordered the invasion because he saw weakness in Joe Biden. Forty-one percent said the US president was not a factor in Putin\u2019s decision. Republicans in Congress have attacked Biden for perceived weakness in the face of autocratic leaders abroad. Party figures have been less keen to discuss Trump\u2019s expressions of admiration for Putin during the Ukraine crisis. The Harvard study\u2019s findings broadly buttressed a Fox News poll, carried out before Russia invaded, that found more Republicans had a negative view of Biden than of Putin and more Democrats had a negative view of Trump than of the Russian leader. That study said 92% of Republicans had a negative view of Biden while 81% had a negative view of Putin. Among Democrats, 87% had a negative view of Trump and 85% a negative view of Putin. A third poll, released by NPR/PBS/Marist College, will add concern for a Biden administration battling low approval ratings generated by public dissatisfaction on fronts including handling of the pandemic, the Afghanistan withdrawal, a stalled legislative agenda and inflation. The NPR-Marist poll found that 56% of Americans said Biden\u2019s first year in office was a \u201cfailure\u201d. Just 39% called it a success. Two-thirds of independents said Biden\u2019s first year was a failure, while 91% of Republicans said so. Among Democrats, 80% called Biden\u2019s first year a success \u2013 but 15% said it had been a failure."

            "date": "2022-02-15T21:07:43Z",
            "content": "Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez has been arrested, a day after the US Department of Justice requested his extradition over drug trafficking and weapons charges, culminating a spectacular fall from grace for a man who was once considered one of Washington\u2019s top allies in Central America. On Tuesday afternoon Hern\u00e1ndez left his home in a wealthy neighborhood in the country\u2019s capital, Tegucigalpa, where he was cuffed at the hands and feet and provided a bullet-proof vest before being taken away in a police caravan to a special forces base. He will appear before a judge for his first hearing within 24 hours. According to the extradition request submitted to Honduras, Hern\u00e1ndez was part of a \u201cviolent drug-trafficking\u201d conspiracy that trafficked roughly 500,000 kilos of cocaine since 2004. The long-rumored indictment comes just over two weeks after Hern\u00e1ndez, 53, left office and strikes a critical blow to the reputation of a former president who had been praised early in his presidency by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for his government\u2019s efforts to extradite drug traffickers. About 100 police officers had surrounded Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s home late on Monday, pending the decision by the supreme court to issue an arrest warrant. Hern\u00e1ndez has previously described the allegations against him as lies made up by violent drug traffickers who are seeking revenge and to reduce their sentences. \u201cThey found the magic key to go unpunished, surrender and negotiate and accuse the institutions for putting them behind bars,\u201d said Hern\u00e1ndez in a February 2021 address. He has also pointed to a constitutional reform allowing Hondurans to be extradited to the US \u2013 passed while president of Congress in 2012 \u2013 as evidence of his innocence. \u201cA person who has colluded with drug traffickers would never approve extradition,\u201d he said. But evidence presented by US prosecutors in recent trials of Honduran drug traffickers suggests that Hern\u00e1ndez believed he could control who was extradited \u2013and therefore avoid repercussions for him and close allies. Formal accusations of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s alleged involvement in drug trafficking first came to light in August 2019 when he was named in a court filing as a co-conspirator of his brother Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, who was arrested while visiting the United States. During the subsequent trial, prosecutors accused the brothers of overseeing a scheme that they described as \u201cstate-sponsored drug trafficking\u201d. Tony Hern\u00e1ndez was convicted on drug trafficking conspiracy and related weapons charges. He was sentenced last year to life in prison. In April 2020, Hern\u00e1ndez was named again as a co-conspirator when US prosecutors indicted former national police chief Juan Carlos \u201cEl Tigre\u201d Bonilla Valladares with drug trafficking and related weapons charges. According to the indictment, Hern\u00e1ndez entrusted Bonilla \u201cwith special assignments, including murder\u201d. In a third case less than a year later, a court heard that Hern\u00e1ndez had allegedly plotted with another Honduran drug trafficker, Geovanny Fuentes, to \u201cshove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos\u201d. Fuentes was convicted of drug trafficking conspiracy and related weapons charges. His sentencing is scheduled for February. Bucking tradition, Hern\u00e1ndez did not attend the inauguration of his successor, Xiomara Castro, on 27 January \u2013 the same day that an arrest warrant was issued in the United States. Hern\u00e1ndez began his political career in 1998 when he won a seat in congress to represent his home department of Lempira \u2013 located within a key drug trafficking corridor in western Honduras. In 2010, he became president of congress and then four years later, president of the republic. According to prosecutors, his rise in politics is owed in part to millions in bribes from drug traffickers. The drug trafficking conspiracy charge carries a sentence of 10 years to life."

            "date": "2022-02-24T22:42:56Z",
            "content": "For weeks, Joe Biden has issued urgent warnings that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any moment. The moment came overnight, when Russian troops began attacking Ukraine by land, air and sea. For the US president \u2013 increasingly embattled at home by a resurgent Republican party \u2013 it was evidence that the White House had largely assessed the Ukraine crisis correctly, even though their preference would have been to be wrong about their predictions of a disastrous war in Europe. Now the conflict has dumped a huge foreign policy crisis into an already difficult second year in office for Biden, with a likely backlash looming in November\u2019s midterm elections. With few exceptions, though, he largely has the Democratic party behind him and the Republicans are split, with many backing Biden even as others take various potshots at his presidency. But, for the moment, there is the immediate invasion to deal with. On Thursday morning, Biden met in the Situation Room with his National Security Council to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine. He then met virtually with the leaders of the G7, where they agreed to move forward on \u201cdevastating packages of sanctions\u201d. Biden was preparing to deliver remarks from the East Room of the White House this afternoon. \u201cPresident Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cRussia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.\u201d Biden has pledged that the US would not send troops to Ukraine, warning that to do so would risk a wider war in Europe. But the US has provided arms supplies and sent additional troops to the Baltic states as part of his promise to \u201cdefend every inch of Nato territory\u201d. \u201cSacred\u201d was how the US president described the US commitment to Nato\u2019s article 5, in which an attack on any member nation triggers an allied military response. Domestically, the Biden administration has so far been praised for its decision to quickly declassify intelligence, revealing Putin\u2019s secret plans in real time. Though it was not enough to deter Putin, it helped Washington forge a united front against Moscow in the shadow of the administration\u2019s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan last year that left the US weaker in the eyes of many allies and foes around the world. But after multiple high-profile intelligence failures, the US\u2019s assessment proved largely correct. And when Biden said he believed that Putin had already made the decision to attack, it appears he was right. The accuracy of the intelligence shared by the US, and the unity of the transatlantic alliance, may help give the US renewed credibility on the world stage, where Biden has repeatedly warned that democracies are under threat. In Congress, members have broadly condemned Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine and urged the Biden administration to implement the long-promised paralyzing sanctions. Many Republicans have criticized the administration\u2019s response so far as too little too late, even though senators failed to agree to a bipartisan sanctions package against Russia before leaving Washington for a week-long recess. They settled instead for issuing a strongly worded statement. Underscoring the deep polarization Biden faces at home, a number of Republicans tried to blame him for enabling Putin, including many of the same officials who remained silent as Trump praised and flattered the Russian president. \u201cI have earlier criticized the president and I will repeat some of that,\u201d Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday. \u201cI think the precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan in August \u2026 was an invitation to the autocrats of the world that maybe this was a good time to make a move.\u201d McConnell nevertheless claimed to be united with Biden. \u201cWe are where we are\u2026 We\u2019re all together at this point and we need to be together about what should be done.\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, however, made no mention of the US president in a statement condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as \u201creckless and evil\u201d. \u201cPutin\u2019s actions must be met with serious consequence. This act of war is intended to rewrite history and more concerning, upend the balance of power in Europe. Putin must be held accountable for his actions,\u201d he said. In a bizarre interview on Fox News, Donald Trump mistakenly stated that it was the US, not Russia, invading Ukraine. He was quickly corrected, but spent much of the appearance airing old grievances and attacking his successor. Repeating the baseless claim that the election was stolen, Trump concluded: \u201cIt all happened because of a rigged election.\u201d US stock markets dropped sharply on Thursday as investors waited to hear more about what sanctions Biden would impose on Russia. After the assault began, the price of oil passed $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, a rise that will drive up fuel prices even as the US wrestles with the worst inflation in decades. Investors were reassured by Biden\u2019s comments that sanctions would not affect the oil and gas markets and stocks recovered their losses as the oil price fell. US trade with Russia is relatively small but the conflict\u2019s impact on oil prices was driving up gas prices even before the invasion and there will \u2013 no doubt \u2013 be more troubling days ahead. In a press conference last week, Biden warned Americans that war in Europe would have consequences for US consumers, already suffering from soaring inflation. \u201cI will not pretend this will be painless,\u201d he said. The federal government has also warned government agencies and operators of critical infrastructure to take proactive security measures against potential cyberthreats from Russia. Biden said he would do everything to alleviate the economic pinch, including to tap the US national oil reserves, which he has already done in his effort to combat the fastest increase in US inflation in three decades. Higher prices pose an immediate political and economic challenge for the president, whose approval ratings have slumped amid rising gas and food prices. Republicans have blamed Democrats for inflation, which is top of mind for voters ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections in November. Additional reporting by Dominic Rushe"

            "date": "2022-02-16T17:21:09Z",
            "content": "This piece first appeared in Down to Earth, the Guardian\u2019s climate crisis newsletter. Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week\u2019s biggest environment stories every Thursday Below is a photo of me in 2017, crowded around the TV at the climate publication I worked for, looking resigned as then president Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement. I couldn\u2019t have imagined the wild ride I was in for. Over four years, Trump agencies gutted more than 100 environmental protections for air and water pollution, biodiversity and climate change. And they did so with dramatic flair. The interior secretary rode into his first day on a horse. The head of the Environmental Protection Agency spent exorbitantly on sound-proof telephone booths and private planes. By the end of Trump\u2019s chaotic presidency, I was exhausted. The incoming Biden administration felt like a much-needed reprieve. Biden vowed to reinstate the regulations Trump gutted and make the climate crisis a top priority. I was skeptical of what he could achieve, but I tried to muster some hope. Now, a year into Biden\u2019s presidency, it\u2019s clear that what little optimism I had was misguided. Biden\u2019s climate legacy is starting to take shape, and it doesn\u2019t look good. So far, his administration has: 1. Held the biggest-ever offshore oil drilling lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico In November, Biden offered up 80m acres of water to oil drillers. For years, the US government has regularly leased portions of the Gulf of Mexico for offshore exploration and drilling. But environmental and public health advocates had hoped that the president who campaigned on climate action would at least scale back the practice. Last month, a judge struck down the auction \u2013 ruling that the administration didn\u2019t properly disclose and consider how the leases would contribute to the climate crisis. That court decision is one of the biggest climate victories of Biden\u2019s administration. And it came in spite of the administration\u2019s efforts \u2013 not because of them. Now more than 300 groups have signed on to an emergency petition to halt all new drilling in the Gulf. 2. Permitted more drilling on public lands in the West and in Alaska than Trump did in his first year Biden has approved nearly 900 more permits to drill on public land in 2021 than Trump did in 2017, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. That\u2019s despite his campaign pledges to end new oil and gas leasing on federal lands. In November, Biden also urged drillers to produce more oil, in an effort to lower gasoline prices. 3. Failed to advance a climate legislative agenda On the campaign trail, Biden promised to cut US climate emissions in half by 2030, including by investing significantly in renewable power. But his legislative package to do so \u2013 Build Back Better \u2013 has stalled. Two Democrats \u2013 Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema \u2013 may be the main culprits for this failure, but convincing them to get on board with his agenda was always going to be one of Biden\u2019s biggest challenges, and he hasn\u2019t managed to do it. 4. Faltered in quickly reinstating rules Under Biden, even minor regulations that mandate more energy efficient furnaces, freezers, and lightbulbs are stuck in regulatory limbo. And he could face a significant blow this month if the conservative-tilted supreme court decides the federal government can\u2019t write rules to curb climate pollution from power plants. Biden hasn\u2019t followed through on the basics. And he certainly hasn\u2019t brought the kind of sweeping and aggressive action the world\u2019s scientists say is necessary to avoid catastrophic global heating. As the US gears up for midterm elections in November, it remains to be seen whether Biden will go any harder on environmental efforts. This isn\u2019t the first massive failure of climate efforts at the federal level, and it won\u2019t be the last. The lesson: policymakers and industries won\u2019t do the right thing unless they are forced, by our decisions with our ballots and our wallets.

            "date": "2022-02-18T07:34:51Z",
            "content": "The way 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva was treated by her coach after her two falls in her figure skating routine on Thursday evening was \u201cchilling\u201d and does not inspire any confidence in her entourage, the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach has said. In an unusually strong intervention, Bach admitted that he was shocked to see the controversial Russian Olympic Committee coach Eteri Tutberidze berate Valieva as she came off the ice, barking at her \u201cwhy did you stop fighting?\u201d even though she had been under enormous mental stress ever since her positive drugs test was revealed last week. \u201cI must say I was very disturbed yesterday when I watched the competition on television,\u201d said Bach. \u201cFirst in her performance, how high the pressure must have been on her. I know from my athlete time a little bit about pressure. But this pressure is beyond my imagination, in particular for a girl of 15 years old. \u201cTo see her struggling on the ice, seeing how she tries to compose herself again and finish her programme, you could see in every movement in the body language, you could feel this was an immense mental stress. \u201cBut this was not all,\u201d Bach added. \u201cWhen afterwards I saw how she was received by her closest entourage, with what appeared to be a tremendous coldness, it was chilling to see this. \u201cRather than giving her comfort, rather than trying to help her, you could feel this chilling atmosphere, this distance. And if you were interpreting the body language, it got even worse because there were even some dismissive gestures I saw on TV.\u201d The gold medal was won by world champion Anna Shcherbakova, who narrowly pipped her Russian compatriot Alexandra Trusova despite a more conservative free skate routine. Both are 17 years old and also coached by Tutberidze. Afterwards, Trusova was visibly upset by the judging but appeared to get little support from Tutberidze \u2013 something Bach also spotted. \u201cI am pondering whether you could really be this cold to your athlete,\u201d Bach said. \u201cAll of this does not give me much confidence in this closest entourage in Kamila, neither with regard in the past nor in the future.\u201d The World Anti-Doping Agency is now investigating Valieva\u2019s coaches, doctors and other adults around her but Bach admitted that the IOC\u2019s options were \u201cextremely limited\u201d. \u201cWe are not the police,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can not interrogate. We can not have a formal prosecution procedure and therefore we need the support of governments. We need to reinforce our efforts to speak to governments so they take disciplinary measures regarding entourages.\u201d Valieva was allowed to compete in the women\u2019s event after the court of arbitration for sport ruled against re-imposing a provisional suspension on her. That decision came after a week of media scrutiny that followed the news that she had tested positive for angina drug trimetazidine on 8 February, a day after she helped the ROC win the team event. However Bach accepted that Valieva was unlikely to have taken the banned drug in isolation and stressed it was of \u201cextreme importance\u201d that those around her be properly investigated given her age. On Saturday Tutberidze insisted that her skater was clean but accepted that the situation was \u201cvery controversial and difficult\u201d. When asked if Tutberidze had any place in the Olympics, Bach said: \u201cThis is why we have asked for the inquiry to shed light on all this. We trust this will come to light and we will not hesitate to implement the appropriate measures. And these will be tough measures.\u201d Bach also signalled that the IOC would look into rules regarding age limits for adult competition, as well as whether minors should face the same doping penalties as senior athletes. But he added \u201cthis needs careful deliberation\u201d. The IOC president\u2019s comments provoked an angry response from Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Dmitry Chernyshenko, who told Inside The Games: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed to see an IOC president weave his own fictional narrative on the feelings of our athletes, and then present these publicly as the voice of the IOC. This is frankly inappropriate and wrong.\u201d"
