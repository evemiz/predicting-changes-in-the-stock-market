            "date": "2023-06-18T07:00:37Z",
            "content": "Tory MPs in marginal seats are already sounding the alarm over an \u201cinterest rate catastrophe\u201d, amid claims that the party has not understood the impact of spiralling mortgages. With the Bank of England likely to increase interest rates again this week and major mortgage lenders raising their own rates in the last few days, there is a growing nervousness among Tories about the impact this will have later in the year as the main parties begin to shape their campaigns for the next election. In the most direct intervention to date, Lucy Allan, the Tory MP in the traditionally marginal constituency of Telford, questioned her party\u2019s attitude to the issue. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have quite understood the interest rate catastrophe,\u201d she said shortly after announcing she would not run again at the next election. \u201cPeople [are] telling me their monthly mortgage payment is exceeding their salary. That is unsustainable. \u201cConstituents do ask about \u2018support for unaffordable mortgages\u2019. I say \u2018talk to your lender,\u2019 but the reality is they need to sell sooner rather than later and that\u2019s a hard message to hear.\u201d Other Tories said they had not had many cases so far, but were on alert for the issue to become more serious later in the year. While ministers are acutely aware of the problem, Rishi Sunak and chancellor Jeremy Hunt primarily want to tackle inflation \u2013 making any package designed to help those struggling with their mortgage difficult. Another Tory in a marginal seat said: \u201cIt is very hard because there aren\u2019t many levers we can pull.\u201d Allies of Boris Johnson are already seeing the coming mortgage crisis as the issue that will sink Sunak\u2019s attempts to recover in the polls before the next election. \u201cWhen you look at what is happening to mortgages, it\u2019s really killing our own people,\u201d said one Tory. \u201cIt feels like this is the end of a cycle \u2013 13 years coming to an end.\u201d An alarming report from the Resolution Foundation thinktank found that UK households coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals next year will face an average \u00a32,900 increase in their annual payments. It estimated the average two-year fixed mortgage rate will be 6.25% this year. A slew of new data backing up the concerns is expected this week. How best to respond to rising mortgage costs is also a challenge for Labour, which has opted to prioritise fiscal discipline over all other demands. It recently scaled down a pledge to spend \u00a328bn a year on green investment, opting to instead build up to that figure over time. So far, only the Liberal Democrats have backed a special package aimed at mortgage distress in the form of a \u00a33bn \u201cmortgage protection fund\u201d for people facing repossession. In response to the Resolution Foundation report, the Treasury said: \u201cWe know this is a concerning time for mortgage holders, which is why the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] requires lenders to offer tailored support to borrowers struggling to make their payments, and we continue to support mortgage holders through the Support for Mortgage Interest scheme. \u201cBehind this, though, is global inflation, continuing to eat away at incomes around the world, which is why the single biggest thing we can do to help families is to halve the rate this year.\u201d"

            "content": "Sarah McBride, the highest-ranked openly transgender elected official in the US, announced she is running for the US House of Representatives this week. If elected, she will be the first openly transgender member of Congress. \u201cThis campaign isn\u2019t just about making history \u2013 it\u2019s about moving forward,\u201d said McBride in a press release on Monday. \u201cTo strengthen our democracy, we need effective leaders who believe in taking bold action and building bridges for lasting progress.\u201d McBride is the only openly transgender person serving at the state senator level in the country, but there are seven other state lawmakers who identify as transgender, according to a national tracker by LGBTQ+ Victory Institute. Her candidacy comes amid an increase in state laws restricting the rights and lifestyles of people who identify as transgender. So far in 2023, state legislatures have signed into law nearly 80 measures targeting the LGBTQ+ community, \u201cespecially transgender youth\u201d, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The bills include limiting access to gender-affirming care, prohibiting transgender kids from competing in sports and restricting students from using their preferred pronouns. \u201cToo many politicians want to divide us, to tell us that teachers, doctors, even our own neighbors are the enemy,\u201d McBride said in her announcement video released on Monday. The video included short clips of Republicans Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado \u2013 all of whom have supported legislation advocates have labeled as anti-transgender. Before running for office, McBride was the national press secretary for the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign. McBride, now 32, was first elected to Delaware\u2019s state legislature in 2020, winning by a landslide in a heavily Democratic district, securing 73% of the vote. She was re-elected in 2022. She is now running for Delaware\u2019s sole seat in the US House of Representatives. (Alaska, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont also each have one at-large representative.) The at-large seat is being vacated by the incumbent Lisa Blunt Rochester, also a Democrat, who has held the post since 2017. Blunt Rochester is running for Senate this election cycle to replace Senator Tom Carper, who is retiring. Blunt Rochester supported McBride in her first campaign for state senate and called her a \u201ctireless advocate and trailblazer\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of all Sarah has already achieved and am excited to watch the next chapters in her career unfold,\u201d Blunt Rochester told CBS at the time. In addition to Blunt Rochester, McBride has previously received support from other prominent Delaware lawmakers, including President Joe Biden. Biden\u2019s late son, Beau Biden, had met McBride during his campaign for Delaware attorney general and described her as a sharp teenager who was \u201cgoing to change the world\u201d, according to Joe Biden\u2019s foreword in McBride\u2019s 2018 memoir. As a college student, McBride lobbied for the passage of a Delaware law that ensures equal protections for transgender individuals. She also interned at the White House during the Obama administration. In the foreword for McBride\u2019s memoir, which was written in 2017, Biden said he was \u201cproud to have been a part of an administration that spoke out and stood up for transgender Americans\u201d. \u201cBut despite that progress, I left the vice-presidency knowing that much of the hardest work remains ahead of us in building a more perfect union for all Americans, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe history of civil rights in America reminds us that progress is precious and can never be taken for granted.\u201d If elected, McBride said she will focus on legislation that \u201caddresses gun violence, protects access to abortion and tackles climate change\u201d, according to the campaign announcement. This article was amended on 28 June 2023. An earlier version incorrectly listed Montana among states with a single at-large congressperson."

            "date": "2023-06-09T22:50:54Z",
            "content": "A Canadian official appointed to investigate allegations that China attempted to subvert the country\u2019s federal elections has abruptly resigned, blaming the \u201chighly partisan atmosphere\u201d surrounding his work. David Johnston was appointed in March amid concerns that Justin Trudeau\u2019s government had failed to respond adequately to the threat of foreign interference in the last two elections. But in a letter to the prime minister on Friday, he announced his resignation. \u201cWhen I undertook the task of Independent Special Rapporteur on Foreign Interference, my objective was to help build trust in our democratic institutions,\u201d Johnston wrote. But, the former governor general wrote, a mounting wave of political attacks meant his nomination had the \u201copposite effect\u201d. \u201cI am therefore tendering my resignation, effective no later than the end June 2023, or as soon as I deliver a brief final report, which I hope to be earlier,\u201d he wrote. The surprise development follows testimony before MPs this week, in which the former governor general called rumours questioning his objectivity \u201cquite simply false\u201d. Johnston released his first highly anticipated report in late May. \u201cForeign governments are undoubtedly attempting to influence candidates and voters in Canada,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMuch has been done already, but considerably more remains to be done to strengthen our capacity to resist foreign interference.\u201d But he elicited widespread frustration among pundits and political leaders after he suggested a public inquiry would not be useful because much of the relevant material needed to conduct the inquiry would remain secret. At the time, he said any public inquiry would be an \u201ceasy choice, it would not be the correct one\u201d. Ever since his appointment he has faced fierce criticism from opposition parties over allegations of bias. The Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre cited Johnston\u2019s longstanding familiarity with the Trudeau family. He also pointed to Johnston\u2019s membership with the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, which grants educational scholarships, but was also the recipient of donations from Beijing, as evidence of bias. In late May, a majority of lawmakers in the House of Commons passed a motion calling for Johnston to \u201cstep aside\u201d as rapporteur citing \u201cserious questions\u201d over possible conflicts of interest. In response, Johnston said that while he \u201cdeeply\u201d respects the right of the House of Commons to \u201cexpress its opinion about my work going forward\u201d he refused to step down, saying his mandate was from the government and he felt that he had a \u201cduty to pursue that work until my mandate is completed\u201d. But the political attacks continued, culminating in a tense three-hour showdown with lawmakers on a parliamentary committee, who questioned his impartiality \u201cI don\u2019t believe I have a conflict of interest and I would not have undertaken this responsibility, had I had a conflict of interest,\u201d Johnston said. In his resignation, Johnston called on the prime minister to appoint a new rapporteur. \u201cI encourage you to appoint a respected person, with national security experience, to complete the work that I recommended in my first report,\u201d he wrote."

            "date": "2023-06-07T17:01:11Z",
            "content": "Keir Starmer is on course to clinch a landslide majority of 140 for Labour at the next UK general election, the first modelling based on a megapoll of new constituency boundaries suggests. With the Conservatives still suffering from a large polling deficit, Labour\u2019s support was found to be at about 35% \u2013 12% ahead of Rishi Sunak\u2019s party. However, Labour\u2019s support was said to remain \u201cquite soft\u201d, with a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d model showing it could end up the biggest party in a hung parliament. The results were revealed in an analysis of polling known as multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP), and will boost Starmer\u2019s hopes of victory as the long campaign in the run-up to the next election progresses. Prof Sir John Curtice said since the sleaze scandals that engulfed Boris Johnson and Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget, there had been a \u201cvery substantial\u201d drop in support for the Tories. Though Sunak had sought to steady the party, Curtice said there had been only \u201ca bit of a narrowing\u201d of Labour\u2019s lead. The general election poses a headache to pollsters and campaign strategists, as constituency boundaries are being redrawn for the first time in several election cycles. In the first MRP based on the new boundaries \u2013 conducted by FocalData and commissioned by the Best For Britain campaign group \u2013 Labour\u2019s potential success was said to be under varying degrees of risk. If the Reform party \u2013 the reincarnation of the Brexit party \u2013 repeats the tactic used in 2019 of standing aside in Tory marginals, Labour\u2019s seats would still be at a healthy 401, leaving the Conservatives on 202. Another scenario has Labour winning 370 seats to the Tories\u2019 232, based on redistributing undecided voters by their education profile. If both were combined, under what was billed as Labour\u2019s \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d, the model predicts a hung parliament \u2013 with the party about a dozen seats short of a majority, with 316, leaving the Tories at 286. The poll of 10,140 voters was undertaken between 20 April and 9 May. Labour is projected to be on course for a major comeback in Scotland. Best for Britain said the poll showed the SNP was \u201cbleeding voters\u201d to \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d, meaning Labour was likely to pick up as many as 31 seats. Sunak was more popular than the Conservatives and therefore \u201cmight be able to turn his party around\u201d, said Curtice. But he added that the Tories \u201care a long way behind\u201d. Stories about Sunak previously possessing a US green card and his wife\u2019s non-dom status \u201cdid a damage to him from which he has, frankly, personally never recovered\u201d, said Curtice. Luke Tryl, the UK director of the More in Common group, said there was \u201cthe potential for quite a large\u201d Labour victory \u2013 but cautioned the party should not be complacent because it could merely be \u201cwinning by default\u201d. He added Labour\u2019s support remained \u201cquite soft\u201d and that the party that would win the next election was the one that could \u201cbest convince people that it\u2019s OK to turn on the six o\u2019clock news and not be worried\u201d. In focus groups, Tryl said voters found Sunak to be competent and credited him for the furlough scheme, adding that he was outperforming his party. \u201cAn emerging theme from the focus groups is \u2018is he strong enough?\u2019 And that\u2019s exacerbated by the constant returns to the stage of Boris Johnson.\u201d In the event of a Tory leadership contest, Tryl said Kemi Badenoch and Penny Mordaunt were potential frontrunners, but said of the home secretary, Suella Braverman: \u201cI do know from testing in both focus groups and polling that Suella would be a \u2018longest suicide note in history\u2019 type candidate for the Conservative party, simply because she is so polarising.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-27T13:00:29Z",
            "content": "A woman who arrived in Canada as a 13-year-old immigrant has been elected as the first Chinese-Canadian mayor of Toronto, vowing to pursue a more progressive approach in Canada\u2019s largest city after ending more than a decade of conservative rule. Olivia Chow, 66, emerged victorious from a record field of 102 candidates after promising to raise the city\u2019s low property taxes and do more to support tenants facing a housing affordability crisis. She takes office facing strong opposition from the premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, whose brother Rob was the mayor of Toronto until a video of him smoking crack cocaine drew global attention and a cancer diagnosis saw him drop out of the 2014 race. The premier had warned during the race that a Chow victory would be an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d. The previous mayor, John Tory, also left office in disgrace in February after admitting he had an affair with a staffer. Despite pledging not to get involved in the race, at the last minute he endorsed Ana Bail\u00e3o, his protege. Chow had previously run for mayor in 2014, placing third behind Tory and Ford. In her acceptance speech on Monday evening, Chow highlighted \u201cthe mandate for change\u201d voters in Canada\u2019s economic capital had given her. \u201cIf you ever doubted what\u2019s possible together, if you ever questioned your faith in a better future and what we can do with each other, for each other, tonight is your answer,\u201d she told supporters. Chow won with 37.2% of the vote, ahead of Bail\u00e3o with 32.5%. The former city police chief Mark Saunders came in third with 8.6%. The newly elected mayor\u2019s previous roles include serving as a member of parliament for the New Democratic party, a city councillor in Toronto and as a school board trustee. As well as her second time running for mayor, she had also campaigned alongside her late husband, Jack Layton, who ran for the office in 1991 and who later became Canada\u2019s leader of the opposition before his death. Layton remains a beloved figure for many Canadian progressives, with a statue of him on the Toronto waterfront. Chow takes charge of Toronto at a time when the city of 2.7 million people, the core of a wider metropolitan area of nearly 7 million, is struggling with surging rents and a budget deficit of approximately $1.5bn (\u00a3895m). There are also growing concerns around public safety, particularly after a spate of violent attacks on people using the public transit system, which has itself come under fire for overcrowding and deteriorating service. Chow is expected to be a champion for transit, as well as for walking and cycling \u2013 she does not have a driving licence \u2013 and has promised to turn the tide on years of low-tax austerity politics enacted by her conservative predecessors. The city has struggled to advance progressive policies for its downtown core since its 1998 amalgamation with five neighbouring boroughs that tend to vote for more conservative candidates. Chow said she would raise Toronto\u2019s notably low property taxes, currently less than 0.6% on residential properties, to help fund investment, which Tory had promised to do in the 2023 budget with a pledge to raise property taxes by 5.5%. Despite his fervent opposition to Chow\u2019s candidacy, Premier Ford congratulated her on Monday evening. \u201cThroughout Olivia\u2019s life, she has proven her desire and dedication to serving the city that many of us call home,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not always going to agree on everything, what we can agree on is our shared commitment to making Toronto a place where businesses, families, and workers can thrive.\u201d The city\u2019s last progressive mayor, David Miller, tweeted his congratulations: \u201cYou earned this. People overwhelmingly voted for change. And that\u2019s a powerful mandate indeed.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-21T09:45:06Z",
            "content": "Parents of toddlers in Taiwan have accused teachers at a preschool of drugging their children, in a scandal that threatens to dent the opposition party\u2019s chances at the upcoming presidential election. Teachers at Baoren kindergarten, a private preschool in New Taipei City, have been accused of sedating children with addictive cough syrups. Police launched an investigation this month after parents raised concerns about children showing unusual symptoms such as mood swings and cramps. Eight pupils reportedly tested positive for trace amounts of the psychoactive drugs phenobarbital and benzodiazepines. The children\u2019s symptoms are thought to be withdrawal symptoms from the highly addictive drugs. Phenobarbital is used in the treatment of epilepsy, while benzodiazepines are a strong type of sleeping drug. It is not clear why the drugs, which are not easily available, were given to the children, although it is thought to have been because of their sedative properties. One teacher is also accused of using corporal punishment on the preschoolers. The principal of Baoren kindergarten, and five teachers, have been arrested pending a criminal investigation. The school was ordered to close and pay a fine of 150,000 Taiwanese dollars (\u00a33,793). When the Guardian visited the preschool on Wednesday the office was still open, but staff declined to comment on the situation. A spokesperson for Baoren said by telephone: \u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d In a statement to parents, Jidibao Education Group, the parent company of Baoren, apologised and said, \u201cthe truth has yet to be clarified\u201d, but acknowledged that families were \u201cdeeply affected\u201d by the incident. The group said it would work with the education bureau to help transfer children to alternative preschools. Parents have complained that the authorities were slow to react to their initial complaints in April and May. On Sunday, hundreds of people protested outside government buildings in New Taipei City, criticising the mayor, Hou You-yi, for his administration\u2019s handling of the scandal. In particular, parents are angry that children were not tested until 22 days after concerns were first raised. Taipei City hospital is offering free blood tests to preschool children, according to the BBC, but many parents fear it is too late to check if their children were affected by the alleged drugging. Hou is the presidential candidate for the KMT, the main opposition party, in next year\u2019s election. On 9 June, legislators from the ruling DPP accused Hou of focusing on his campaign rather than the drugging scandal, calling him a \u201cpart-time mayor\u201d. Hou saidthe incident should not be made into a \u201cpolitical issue\u201d. A poll by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation on 17 June found more than half of people were not satisfied with Hou\u2019s handling of the scandal. The anger cut across social groups such as gender, age, class and party affiliation. A spokesperson from the New Taipei City government said: \u201cThe New Taipei City government urges the public not to use the kindergarten incident for political gain.\u201d It said that the municipal authorities launched an investigation \u201cimmediately\u201d after receiving reports and accused DPP politicians of spreading \u201cfalse rumours\u201d. The Education Bureau issued a statement saying that although medical tests for the children weren\u2019t arranged until 6 June, investigators were sent to the kindergarten on the same day that they were notified of complaints on 15 May. One commenter on a Facebook group set up as a \u201cvictims\u2019 alliance\u201d wrote that the government\u2019s response was \u201cridiculous\u201d and that the city was \u201cnot well managed\u201d. The kindergarten\u2019s Google listing has also been the subject of negative reviews. One commenter wrote: \u201cThis is the kindergarten where they drug toddlers \u2026 the New Taipei City government has been dragging its feet for a month without addressing the case \u2026 the drug feeding incident will not be forgotten by the people.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-12T09:45:16Z",
            "content": "It begins as a presidential convention complete with Mexican waves, spangled stars and mascots. It then turns to murder \u2013 specifically, nine attempts at presidential assassination. The surreal carnival of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman\u2019s 1990 musical is replaced by the modern circus of politics and rolling news. The Proprietor is a presidential figure, the Balladeers news anchors. The assassins lounge in what looks to be the Oval office. Along the stage\u2019s central flank is a red carpet and these personalities are the stars, with screens on either side that update us on their crimes. This is a thoroughly accomplished reconceptualisation by director Polly Findlay, with an inspired set design by Lizzie Clachan. It underlines the way in which these oddballs, left-behinds and psychopaths invert the American dream, turning their failures into righteous fury, and getting their 15 minutes of fame through infamy. There is confetti as guns are shot into presidents\u2019 chests and even the executions contain the pizzazz of a showbiz death: lights around the gallows as James Garfield\u2019s assassin, Charles Guiteau (Harry Hepple), is hanged and around the electric chair of Giuseppe Zangara (Luke Brady) for Roosevelt\u2019s attempted murder. While there is much in the production that dazzles, the musical in itself does not shock, enlighten or provoke as much as it seeks to in its narrative around the American dream and those it leaves behind. It is gloriously performed and strong on dark comedy though. Danny Mac leads the pack as Abraham Lincoln\u2019s murderer, John Wilkes Booth, proving himself a strong singer. Sam Oladeinde, as William McKinley\u2019s assassin, Leon Czolgosz, bears the justified rage of a ground-down factory worker. Nick Holder\u2019s stalker-like Samuel Byck resembles the Joker in a soiled Santa Claus suit, tape recorder in hand, as he sends off angry missives to Richard Nixon. Hepple\u2019s Guiteau is an impish psychopath while Lynette Fromme (Carly Mercedes Dyer) and Sara Jane Moore (Amy Booth-Steel), the duo behind the attempted murder of Gerald Ford, make a music-hall style double act. Fromme is in love with Charles Manson and starts every sentence with \u201cCharlie says \u2026. \u201d; Moore is a wisecracker and terrible shot. The satire, bathos and beauty of numbers such as How I Saved Roosevelt and Gun Song are well evoked while Weidman\u2019s book slides between vaudevillian comedy and farce but never quite reaches tragedy. Samuel Thomas gives the most affecting performance as Lee Harvey Oswald. His assassination of John F Kennedy is accompanied by original footage of the cavalcade, just as Kennedy is shot, and it is the one moment that feels truly shocking. Still, if there were ever an argument against the US\u2019s gun laws in musical form, this would be it. At Chichester Festival theatre until 24 June"

            "date": "2023-06-07T12:23:36Z",
            "content": "Doug Burgum, the Republican governor of North Dakota, has announced his candidacy for the party\u2019s presidential nomination next year. Burgum made the announcement in the the Wall Street Journal newspaper. A campaign event is scheduled for later on Wednesday in the city of Fargo. \u201cWe need a change in the White House. We need a new leader for a changing economy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m announcing my run for president,\u201d he said in a commentary on the Journal\u2019s website. The 66-year-old was a software entrepreneur, Microsoft executive and venture capitalist before becoming governor in 2016. He will be a rank outsider in a race dominated by two candidates: former US president Donald Trump and rightwing Florida governor Ron DeSantis. Trump enjoys commanding polling leads, having parlayed unparalleled legal jeopardy, including possible indictments over his election subversion and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress, into a surge of support. DeSantis, a hardline self-styled culture warrior, is a distant second but still well clear of a raft of other candidates including former vice-president Mike Pence, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the South Carolina senator Tim Scott, the former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson and Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur. Burgum has rarely made national headlines but he did so in May 2020, pleading emotionally for North Dakotans to \u201ctry to dial up your empathy and your understanding\u201d over the need to wear masks in public during the Covid pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together and there\u2019s only one battle we\u2019re fighting,\u201d Burgum said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the battle of the virus.\u201d In that appearance in Bismarck, the state capital, Burgum also said he \u201cwould really love to see in North Dakota that we could just skip this thing that other parts of the nation are going through, that they\u2019re creating a divide. Either it\u2019s ideological or political or something around mask versus no mask. \u201cThis is, I would say, a senseless dividing line \u2026 If someone is wearing a mask, they\u2019re not doing it to represent what political party they\u2019re in or what candidates they support.\u201d In Trump\u2019s culture war-stoked Republican party, however, masks and other public health measures against Covid quickly became a key political issue. Only recently, Trump and DeSantis swapped campaign-trail barbs about what each said or did not say about Anthony Fauci, then Trump\u2019s chief Covid adviser, in the early stages of the pandemic. Should Burgum pull off a political miracle and win the Republican nomination, another culture war issue would be likely to hurt his chances with the US public. In April, Burgum signed a law banning abortion at six weeks of gestation, when many women do not know they are pregnant, with few exceptions. Burgum said the bill \u201creaffirms North Dakota as a pro-life state\u201d. In the year since the US supreme court removed the right to abortion, other Republican governors have signed strict abortion bans. DeSantis is among them, having signed a six-week ban in Florida. US public opinion is consistently in favor of abortion rights. Burgum has also signed numerous laws curtailing the rights of transgender North Dakotans and a law banning the teaching of critical race theory in public schools. Last year, Burgum approved a new electoral map which Indigenous leaders said was gerrymandered to reduce their political voice, already challenged by a voter ID law. Though Burgum\u2019s policies include the goal of making North Dakota carbon neutral by 2030, a rare environmental commitment from a Republican governor, he has also been a backer of fossil fuel projects including the Dakota Access pipeline, which has fueled widespread protests."

            "title": "Mayor of Miami Francis Suarez enters 2024 Republican presidential race",
            "date": "2023-06-15T15:08:54Z",
            "content": "The mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, has entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination. On Thursday morning, he tweeted: \u201cMy dad taught me that you get to choose your battles, and I am choosing the biggest one of my life. I\u2019m running for president.\u201d The tweet was accompanied by a video of Suarez out for a run. Ahead of a speech at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California, the Cuban American mayor, 45, also spoke to ABC News. \u201cI think I have a different message,\u201d he said, claiming to have \u201cimplemented generational change\u201d, touting his experience leading a major city and winning election and re-election by large margins. Suarez will be an outsider in a crowded field dominated by two other Florida men: Donald Trump, the twice indicted former president, and Ron DeSantis, the hard-right governor. Trump leads most polling averages by more than 30 points. The former vice-president Mike Pence leads the rest of the pack, way back. Asked what he thought of Trump\u2019s indictment in Miami this week on 37 federal charges relating to his handling of classified materials, Suarez tried to dodge the question, saying the city had avoided \u201canarchy\u201d around Trump\u2019s court appearance. Pressed, Suarez said Republicans thought there \u201cisn\u2019t an equal administration of justice\u201d. Quizzed again to say what he thought of Trump\u2019s behaviour, Suarez said he would have turned over documents, as Trump refused to do, but also tried to link the case to an investigation of documents retained by Joe Biden. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on these kinds of matters,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cBut I do want to say this, that this conversation is not a healthy conversation. We should be talking about the issues the Americans care about.\u201d Suarez insisted he was not running against Trump, but \u201cagainst Joe Biden\u2019s America\u201d. The New York Times noted an ad buy in early voting states charging Biden with failing to control crime. The paper also referenced an FBI investigation that could damage Suarez\u2019s run. \u201cMr Suarez is little known outside his state, and he is facing emerging allegations of influence-peddling on behalf of a real estate development company,\u201d the Times said. The editorial board of the Miami Herald said \u201c$10,000 monthly payments [Suarez] received from a developer for consulting work \u2013 while serving as mayor\u201d, while \u201csmall potatoes compared to Trump\u2019s legal problems \u2026 look like a conflict of interest\u201d. The board also asked: \u201cIs being president really Suarez\u2019s goal?\u201d In two terms, the paper said, the mayor had \u201cturned himself into a tech-bro hero, cryptocurrency cheerleader and conservative cable news staple. \u201cHe likes the glitz and star power that come with running a city that\u2019s transforming into a technology and financial hub. That attention seems to have convinced him he can run for president.\u201d The Herald also noted Suarez\u2019s history of departing from Republican orthodoxy \u2013 he voted against Trump twice \u2013 and his ability to represent the Hispanics Republicans need to attract. Suarez told ABC he would pledge to support Trump if he won the nomination, adding: \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate who\u2019s Hispanic in both parties. I think that\u2019s incredibly important because 20% of the country is made up of Hispanics that are trending Republican.\u201d Citing the case of Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who ran for the Democratic nomination in 2020, showed strongly and is now US transportation secretary, the Herald said Suarez might really be aiming to win a cabinet post. The paper said: \u201cSuarez will have to define himself on the national stage and show Republican voters \u2013 many already smitten with Trump or, to a lesser degree, DeSantis \u2013 who he really is. Is he the hip moderate or the rightwing Biden baiter? \u201cIf Suarez truly is seeking the biggest political prize in the free world, he\u2019ll first have to make a powerful case that he\u2019s the better choice for the nomination. That said, he might end up with a really neat consolation prize.\u201d Suarez was elected mayor in 2017 with 86% of the vote, and re-elected four years later with a still healthy 78%. With his city at ground zero of the climate emergency, he has broken with many Republicans\u2019 views and considers rising seas and global temperatures \u201ca real crisis\u201d facing the planet. He has championed the Miami Forever bond, investing $400m of taxpayers\u2019 money in projects to counter sea level rise and other consequences of the climate crisis, including increasingly prevalent flooding. The whiff of scandal, however, is likely to cling as primary season approaches. On Wednesday, the Republican US congressman Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, a former mayor of Miami-Dade county, said Suarez \u201chad a snowball\u2019s chance in hell\u201d of winning. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has any business running for president. He has never established himself as having the capacity to run anything in his life,\u201d Gim\u00e9nez told the Miami New Times. This article was amended on 15 June 2023 to correct the date of Carlos Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s statement."

            "date": "2023-06-07T01:09:09Z",
            "content": "The former New Jersey governor Chris Christie announced his bid for for the Republican presidential nomination at a New Hampshire town hall. In an unconventionally contrite speech, Christie said: \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you success in what I\u2019m about to do. But I guarantee you that at the end of it you will have no doubt in your mind, who I am and what I stand for and whether I deserve it.\u201d Christie filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday afternoon. He announced his presidential run hours later in a town hall hosted at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, New Hampshire. The pugilistic politician joins the primary as a rank outsider but promises a campaign with a singular focus: to take the fight to Donald Trump, the former president who left office in disgrace after the January 6 attack on Congress but who is the clear frontrunner to face Joe Biden again at the polls. Such is Trump\u2019s dominance of Republican polling \u2013 in which he leads his closest challenger, Florida governor Ron DeSantis, by wide margins \u2013 others in the field have been slow to turn their fire Trump\u2019s way. Declared but low-polling candidates include the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the South Carolina senator Tim Scott, the former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson and Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur. While Christie has insisted he is \u201cnot a paid assassin\u201d, the 60-year-old is certainly a seasoned brawler. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m going after Trump is twofold. One, he deserves it. And two, it\u2019s the way to win,\u201d Christie said at the town hall. He also compared Trump to Voldemort from the Harry Potter books. Christie\u2019s claims to fame include leaving office in New Jersey amid a scandal about political payback involving traffic on the George Washington Bridge to New York, then leaving the Florida senator Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign in pieces after a debate-stage clash for the ages. Christie was quick to drop out of that campaign, then equally quick to endorse the clear frontrunner. He stayed loyal despite a brutal firing as Trump\u2019s transition coordinator, fueled by old enmities with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and only broke from Trump after the Capitol attack. In New Hampshire, Christie led up to his announcement with apologies. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect,\u201d he said \u201cI\u2019ve made mistakes.\u201d Recently, Christie has worked for ABC News as a political analyst, honing his turn of phrase. Speaking to Politico, he insisted he was serious about winning the primary. \u201cI\u2019m not a paid assassin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re waking up for your 45th morning at the Hilton Garden Inn in Manchester [New Hampshire], you better think you can win, because that walk from the bed to the shower, if you don\u2019t think you can win, it\u2019s hard.\u201d He also said Trump \u201cneeds to be called out and \u2026 needs to be called out by somebody who knows him. Nobody knows Donald Trump better than I do.\u201d Trump has taken practice swings of his own. \u201cI hear Chris Christie\u2019s coming in,\u201d Trump told Fox News at an Iowa town hall. \u201cHe was at 6% in New Jersey \u2026 I love New Jersey, but 6% approval rating in New Jersey. What\u2019s the purpose? And he\u2019s polling at zero.\u201d Most observers think Christie\u2019s second presidential campaign will struggle to last even as long as his first. But not all think he will drop out without leaving his mark. In the Washington Post, the columnist Jennifer Rubin said Christie, having followed Trump then abandoned him, \u201ccan help create a rationale (what psychologists call a \u2018permission structure\u2019) that allows Republicans who voted for Trump to move on\u201d. Rubin also said Christie could be a \u201ctruth-teller who can force Republicans to confront reality \u2026 and, as a bonus, Christie might be just the right person to take down the other bully in the race: DeSantis.\u201d"

When I chaired the Soham inquiry I included a recommendation that the government should report back to parliament six months after publication on progress made. That was agreed by the then home secretary. As a result, ministers and the civil service were more diligent in ensuring that action was taken as they knew they would be held to account. Since then, select committees have become much more effective and could usefully take on the task of revisiting inquiry recommendations after six months.

            "date": "2023-06-20T18:50:19Z",
            "content": "US Coast Guard officials said on Tuesday afternoon that the crew of the submersible Titan, which went missing in the Atlantic during a dive to the wreck of the Titanic, had about 40 hours of breathable air remaining, if they are still alive. Capt Jamie Frederick also told reporters at a media briefing that a massive sea and air search that began on Sunday night for the vessel and five men aboard, and which has so far covered 7,600 sq miles of a remote area of the ocean, had \u201cnot yielded any results\u201d. Rescue teams were racing against time to locate the 22ft-long (6.7-metre-long) vessel, which had a 96-hour supply of oxygen when contact was lost on Sunday at one hour and 45 minutes into its descent to the wreck site 12,500ft (3,800 metres) beneath the ocean\u2019s surface, about 370 miles (600km) from the coast of Newfoundland. \u201cWe know from the data that we were using as a starting point, [their available air] was 96 hours. We know at this point we\u2019re approximately about 40, 41 hours,\u201d Frederick said. Aircraft from the US Coast Guard, US navy and Canadian military were scouring the surface by sight and radar, he added, and were able to drop sonar buoys to monitor under water earlier today. \u201cSearch efforts have continued through last night and today. Those search efforts have not yielded any results,\u201d Frederick said, announcing that a \u201cunified command\u201d had been set up between the agencies to coordinate the effort. Private companies have offered vessels with deep ocean capabilities, he said: \u201cThis is a complex search effort, which requires multiple agencies with subject matter expertise and specialized equipment.\u201d On Tuesday morning, military authorities said the search was expanding to under the water, using sonar and other hi-tech equipment, enhancing surface operations that had continued through the night. US Coast Guard C-130 rescue planes joined the air force national guard, Canadian aircraft and vessels, and a research ship belonging to OceanGate Expeditions, the organizers of the dive mission, on Monday in the search for the five crew members aboard the carbon fiber and titanium submersible Titan. They include Hamish Harding, 58, a British explorer and pilot who has previously taken a suborbital spaceflight; British Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48; and Dawood\u2019s son Suleman, 19. Also aboard are Paul Henri Nargeolet, a former French navy commander, deep diver and submersible pilot widely considered the leading authority on the Titanic wreck site, and Stockton Rush, the founder of OceanGate, the company confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. On Tuesday morning, Rear Adm John Mauger, commander of the US Coast Guard\u2019s first district, said search crews had flown over an area \u201cabout the size of Connecticut\u201d trying to establish if Titan had surfaced anywhere. \u201cWe have a commercial vessel that\u2019s on scene now, that has remote operated vehicles, that will give us the ability to search under the water as well,\u201d he told ABC News. He said a Canadian aircraft had dropped sonar buoys to listen for the submersible while surface crews were expanding the search area. Also on Tuesday, the New Republic published a report claiming that a former OceanGate employee was fired after raising safety concerns about the submersible, including that it was \u201cnot capable\u201d of descending to the depth of the Titanic wreck. The ex-employee, former marine operations director David Lochridge, was countersued by the company for leaking proprietary information, according to documents seen by the outlet. The case was eventually settled out of court. A veteran Titanic expert who was a member of the 1985 expedition that located the wreck told the Guardian that the deep sea exploration community was \u201cshattered\u201d by the episode. \u201cThis is the day that we have been fearing for a long, long time \u2013 when you lose a sub in really deep water,\u201d said Joe MacInnis, a Canadian adventurer who has made several dives to the wreck. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d A statement sent to the Guardian on OceanGate\u2019s behalf by a crisis communications company on Tuesday said it was \u201cpraying\u201d for the safe return of Titan\u2019s crew and passengers. \u201cOur entire focus is on the wellbeing of the crew and every step possible is being taken to bring the five crew members back safely,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are deeply grateful for the urgent and extensive assistance we are receiving from multiple government agencies and deep-sea companies as we seek to reestablish contact with the submersible.\u201d Mark Butler, managing director of Harding\u2019s company Action Aviation, told the Associated Press that he remained hopeful. \u201cThere is still plenty of time to facilitate a rescue mission \u2013 there is equipment on board for survival in this event,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all hoping and praying he comes back safe and sound.\u201d Others were less confident. \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic just because I know the logistics of it. And I know how vast the ocean is, and how very tiny the craft is,\u201d American television writer Mike Reiss, who dived to the Titanic last year, told BBC Breakfast. \u201cIf it\u2019s down at the bottom, I don\u2019t know how anyone\u2019s going to be able to access it, much less bring it back up. There is a hope that it\u2019s at, or near, the surface.\u201d Relatives of Dawood \u2013 a billionaire entrepreneur with a home in Surrey, UK, who is a director for the Prince\u2019s Trust and the Seti Institute, which explores the possibility of extraterrestrial life \u2013 released a statement thanking well-wishers. \u201cWe are very grateful for the concern being shown by our colleagues and friends and would like to request everyone to pray for their safety while granting the family privacy at this time,\u201d it said. \u201cThe family is well looked after and are praying to Allah for the safe return of their family members.\u201d The Dawoods are believed to have paid OceanGate up to $250,000 (\u00a3196,500) each for their places as \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d aboard the submersible. Their dive was scheduled to begin at about 4am local time on Sunday as the first crewed exploration of the company\u2019s two-month expedition to the wreck of the famous ocean liner that sank in 1912 with the loss of more than 1,500 passengers and crew. Harding, who holds a Guinness world record for the longest duration dive at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel \u2013 because of his 2021 dive to the lowest depth of the Mariana Trench with explorer Victor Vescovo \u2013 posted on Instagram at the weekend he was \u201cproud\u201d to join the expedition as a mission specialist. \u201cDue to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023,\u201d he wrote. Action Aviation\u2019s Instagram account posted on Sunday that the submersible\u2019s launch was \u201csuccessful\u201d and that Harding was \u201ccurrently diving\u201d. In a further statement posted on Tuesday morning requesting privacy for his family, the company described Harding as \u201ca living legend\u201d of aviation. \u201c[We] are extremely proud of Hamish and look forward to welcoming him home,\u201d it said. Experts say that even if the vessel is found, retrieving it could prove almost impossible, especially if it has become entangled in the Titanic\u2019s wreckage. Alistair Greig, a professor of marine engineering at University College London, said: \u201cIf it has gone down to the seabed and can\u2019t get back up under its own power, options are very limited. \u201cWhile the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf [more than 200m] there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers.\u201d Edward Helmore contributed reporting.

            "date": "2023-06-09T22:50:54Z",
            "content": "A Canadian official appointed to investigate allegations that China attempted to subvert the country\u2019s federal elections has abruptly resigned, blaming the \u201chighly partisan atmosphere\u201d surrounding his work. David Johnston was appointed in March amid concerns that Justin Trudeau\u2019s government had failed to respond adequately to the threat of foreign interference in the last two elections. But in a letter to the prime minister on Friday, he announced his resignation. \u201cWhen I undertook the task of Independent Special Rapporteur on Foreign Interference, my objective was to help build trust in our democratic institutions,\u201d Johnston wrote. But, the former governor general wrote, a mounting wave of political attacks meant his nomination had the \u201copposite effect\u201d. \u201cI am therefore tendering my resignation, effective no later than the end June 2023, or as soon as I deliver a brief final report, which I hope to be earlier,\u201d he wrote. The surprise development follows testimony before MPs this week, in which the former governor general called rumours questioning his objectivity \u201cquite simply false\u201d. Johnston released his first highly anticipated report in late May. \u201cForeign governments are undoubtedly attempting to influence candidates and voters in Canada,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMuch has been done already, but considerably more remains to be done to strengthen our capacity to resist foreign interference.\u201d But he elicited widespread frustration among pundits and political leaders after he suggested a public inquiry would not be useful because much of the relevant material needed to conduct the inquiry would remain secret. At the time, he said any public inquiry would be an \u201ceasy choice, it would not be the correct one\u201d. Ever since his appointment he has faced fierce criticism from opposition parties over allegations of bias. The Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre cited Johnston\u2019s longstanding familiarity with the Trudeau family. He also pointed to Johnston\u2019s membership with the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, which grants educational scholarships, but was also the recipient of donations from Beijing, as evidence of bias. In late May, a majority of lawmakers in the House of Commons passed a motion calling for Johnston to \u201cstep aside\u201d as rapporteur citing \u201cserious questions\u201d over possible conflicts of interest. In response, Johnston said that while he \u201cdeeply\u201d respects the right of the House of Commons to \u201cexpress its opinion about my work going forward\u201d he refused to step down, saying his mandate was from the government and he felt that he had a \u201cduty to pursue that work until my mandate is completed\u201d. But the political attacks continued, culminating in a tense three-hour showdown with lawmakers on a parliamentary committee, who questioned his impartiality \u201cI don\u2019t believe I have a conflict of interest and I would not have undertaken this responsibility, had I had a conflict of interest,\u201d Johnston said. In his resignation, Johnston called on the prime minister to appoint a new rapporteur. \u201cI encourage you to appoint a respected person, with national security experience, to complete the work that I recommended in my first report,\u201d he wrote."

            "content": "The pubs group Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner has hailed a rebound in activity at City bars, saying workers in the Square Mile are making the most of afterwork drinks during the warm weather and \u201cenjoying being back\u201d in the office. The fillip in trade came after tube and train strikes cost Fuller\u2019s more than \u00a35m of sales, the company said as it released full-year results. Strike action in recent months and the Christmas period prompted a profits warning in January. On Thursday, Fuller\u2019s said the hit had been worse than expected and further strikes looked probable. \u201cThis has been a very challenging period for the industry,\u201d said its chief executive, Simon Emeny. However, he added that he was upbeat about the coming months. \u201cI am more optimistic about the future than I have been since before the pandemic. There\u2019s no doubt in London that people are enjoying being back in offices. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that employers are keen to get them back, they [people] are actually enjoying being back, working together, and not working from their bedrooms. You can see the happiness around the place, people mixing outside pubs, companies booking spaces in our pubs so they can hold events again to have the camaraderie back in the office.\u201d Emeny said tourists from North America had started coming back last year, as had domestic travellers. Tourists from east Asia were also returning, since China dropped its strict zero-Covid policy, he added. Fuller\u2019s total revenues grew 33% to \u00a3337m in the year to 1 April. Like-for-like sales rose 17.5%, with its central London business reporting a 40% jump as it recovered from the impact of Covid restrictions on trade. Like-for-like sales have been up 13.9% in the 10 weeks since. Emeny said said the group\u2019s energy costs doubled last year after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but were down 20% this year. He added that Fuller\u2019s had reduced its energy consumption by 12%, by investing in new kitchen kit and technology, and educating staff on how to use energy more carefully. Food price inflation remained \u201cstubbornly high\u201d, Emeny continued, and said he hoped they would come down this year. Fuller\u2019s opened three new pubs during the year including the Queen\u2019s Arms at Heathrow Terminal 2, its second airport pub. It also has pubs in railway stations, such as King\u2019s Cross in London. It is investing in other pubs, including the Counting House in the City, where it will add six bedrooms to the 15 above the bar. Fuller\u2019s has more than 1,000 boutique bedrooms across its pubs. The company made a pretax profit of \u00a312.7m, up 76% on \u00a37.2m the year before, excluding one-off items. Statutory pretax profit, including the strike impact, fell to \u00a310.3m from \u00a311.5m. The group, which sold its brewery business including its London Pride ale to the Japanese firm Asahi for \u00a3250m in 2019, said staff vacancies were at a low level, and that it had plugged recruitment gaps by hiring more workers over 50, as well as 16- to 18-year-olds with no previous pub experience. A fifth of its workforce is now made up by people under 18. Emeny said: \u201cWe no longer have the recruitment challenges that we had a year ago.\u201d Last summer, the company had to limit trading hours because of labour shortages caused by the Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cBrexit was always going to be an enormous challenge for the sector and that hasn\u2019t gone away,\u201d Emeny said."

Prof Sir John Curtice said since the sleaze scandals that engulfed Boris Johnson and Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget, there had been a \u201cvery substantial\u201d drop in support for the Tories. Though Sunak had sought to steady the party, Curtice said there had been only \u201ca bit of a narrowing\u201d of Labour\u2019s lead. The general election poses a headache to pollsters and campaign strategists, as constituency boundaries are being redrawn for the first time in several election cycles. In the first MRP based on the new boundaries \u2013 conducted by FocalData and commissioned by the Best For Britain campaign group \u2013 Labour\u2019s potential success was said to be under varying degrees of risk. If the Reform party \u2013 the reincarnation of the Brexit party \u2013 repeats the tactic used in 2019 of standing aside in Tory marginals, Labour\u2019s seats would still be at a healthy 401, leaving the Conservatives on 202. Another scenario has Labour winning 370 seats to the Tories\u2019 232, based on redistributing undecided voters by their education profile. If both were combined, under what was billed as Labour\u2019s \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d, the model predicts a hung parliament \u2013 with the party about a dozen seats short of a majority, with 316, leaving the Tories at 286. The poll of 10,140 voters was undertaken between 20 April and 9 May. Labour is projected to be on course for a major comeback in Scotland. Best for Britain said the poll showed the SNP was \u201cbleeding voters\u201d to \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d, meaning Labour was likely to pick up as many as 31 seats. Sunak was more popular than the Conservatives and therefore \u201cmight be able to turn his party around\u201d, said Curtice. But he added that the Tories \u201care a long way behind\u201d. Stories about Sunak previously possessing a US green card and his wife\u2019s non-dom status \u201cdid a damage to him from which he has, frankly, personally never recovered\u201d, said Curtice. Luke Tryl, the UK director of the More in Common group, said there was \u201cthe potential for quite a large\u201d Labour victory \u2013 but cautioned the party should not be complacent because it could merely be \u201cwinning by default\u201d. He added Labour\u2019s support remained \u201cquite soft\u201d and that the party that would win the next election was the one that could \u201cbest convince people that it\u2019s OK to turn on the six o\u2019clock news and not be worried\u201d. In focus groups, Tryl said voters found Sunak to be competent and credited him for the furlough scheme, adding that he was outperforming his party. \u201cAn emerging theme from the focus groups is \u2018is he strong enough?\u2019 And that\u2019s exacerbated by the constant returns to the stage of Boris Johnson.\u201d In the event of a Tory leadership contest, Tryl said Kemi Badenoch and Penny Mordaunt were potential frontrunners, but said of the home secretary, Suella Braverman: \u201cI do know from testing in both focus groups and polling that Suella would be a \u2018longest suicide note in history\u2019 type candidate for the Conservative party, simply because she is so polarising.\u201d"

            "content": "A Guardian Australia analysis of polling shows support has declined for the Indigenous voice to parliament, but it\u2019s impossible to tell by exactly how much due to differences in how surveys are carried out. The level of support in some states is also difficult to measure accurately and will remain so without an increased focus from pollsters on states that are underrepresented in polling. Guardian Australia\u2019s new voice poll tracker, an analysis that aggregates polls to determine the trend in support at the national level, shows overall support for the voice to parliament has declined since August 2022. Polling experts and political scientists say measuring the specific level of support is tricky due to a number of issues, including polling companies asking different questions, polling companies allowing different types of responses, opaque methods, and low polling numbers in states such as Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. These issues create uncertainty around the polling figures, says Simon Jackman, a political science professor at the University of Sydney. \u201cPoll averaging is difficult here, as unlike vote intention for a federal election \u2013 which has a bog standard question wording that everybody uses \u2013 here, even though we\u2019ve got a very simple proposition, it varies in the way that pollsters have been asking it or giving people an undecided option,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the one thing I look at is pretty clear, I think that [the yes vote] has shed some support and [the no vote] has gained some support since the start of the year. But again, because of those variations in question wording and whatnot, I would hesitate to put a precise number on it.\u201d In a detailed analysis of question type and response choice in polls on the voice, Prof Murray Goot from Macquarie University identified the difficulty of measuring support across multiple polls. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cMore important than sampling error is non-sampling error \u2013 the error that flows from sources other than the variance inherent in sampling \u2013 including poorly worded questions, the effects of asking questions in a particular order, and inappropriate response options,\u201d he wrote. Even within polling companies, survey questions and methods have changed over time, such as a recent Newspoll survey which changed the wording of the question asked and the choices that respondents were offered. The change in approach coincided with an increase in the number of people responding \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d \u2013 from 8% in April to 11% in June \u2013 and a drop in the percentage of people intending to vote yes \u2013 from 53% down to 46%. Question order can also produce different responses. The lowest level of support for the voice so far was in a poll commissioned by the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) in December 2022, which put the percentage of respondents voting yes at only 28%. However, Goot identified some key differences between the question asked in the IPA poll and others. \u201cThe IPA (opposed to a voice) asked about \u2018a separate entity of federal parliament, solely comprised of Indigenous Australians, to advise on laws for every Australian\u2019, without mentioning a \u2018voice\u2019,\u201d Goot wrote. The question itself was preceded by another question asking whether it was \u201cracist for someone to oppose the Indigenous-only voice to parliament\u201d. An earlier poll by the same polling company showed a yes vote of 65% and asked about a \u201crepresentative First Nation\u2019s body to advise the parliament on laws and policies affecting First Nations people, and referred to a First Nations voice.\u201d The headline level of support for the voice will also vary depending on whether a pollster allows respondents to answer with a response like yes, no and don\u2019t know, or forces people to simply make a choice between yes and no. A majority of majorities: the state issue One of the unique features of a constitutional referendum is the requirement for a double majority. For the referendum to succeed, a majority of voters nationally need to vote yes. It also requires a majority in a majority of states, so four out of the six states must have a majority yes vote. This presents another difficulty in tracking the likelihood of success of the voice. Few national polls so far have surveyed enough people to get a decently sized sample of voters from all of the six states, with South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania in particular having low numbers. Having a lower sample size from a state means pollsters will either not report the result at all, or the result will have a larger margin of error, meaning the precise level of support or opposition is harder to determine. This is particularly clear in our chart tracking state support from the Essential poll, which shows the margin of error for each state \u2013 information that polling companies rarely publish: Despite these issues, experts are hopeful that polling companies will rise to the occasion and increase polling in the smaller states. \u201cIf it is business as usual in terms of polling, the outcome of the referendum will be hard to predict, because we\u2019re all going to want to know what\u2019s happening state by state,\u201d Jackman said. \u201cMajorities in four states are a necessary condition for this thing to pass or fail. And so there are seven horse races going on, one national and six states. \u201cAnd I think some of those horse races aren\u2019t going to be as close as others, and it\u2019s the close ones that we want to keep an eye on. And that\u2019s a bit of a challenge for the way polling was traditionally done by and for media organisations.\u201d As the referendum approaches, Jackman said interest in the outcome will increase, and so pollsters, and their media clients, may change their approaches. \u201cI would argue that this is a time for polling resources \u2026 to really think about a strategy whereby you\u2019re extracting more sample than you ordinarily would out of smaller states like Tasmania and South Australia,\u201d he said. Social desirability bias? Another issue in measuring support for the voice is that people may be reluctant to express opinions they see as controversial. William Bowe, an election analyst and publisher of poll-tracking website The Poll Bludger, said there were other issues beyond survey methods and state numbers. \u201cI think the bigger imponderable is how accurate the polling is going to be, full stop \u2013 could there be social desirability bias going on here?\u201d he said. Bowe says in the same-sex marriage survey polling overestimated the margin of support, and that this may in part be due to people being reluctant to provide politically incorrect answers to these sorts of questions. Polling consistently shows a divide along party voting lines, with Labor and Greens supporters more likely to say they will support the voice, while Coalition voters are more likely to be opposed. A similar divide emerges in age groups, with younger people far more likely to say they will vote yes, and support dropping as the age of groups increases: Guardian Australia will be regularly updating the voice poll tracking page throughout the referendum campaign.

Prof Marcia Langton, a key member of the government\u2019s referendum working group, said the yes campaign was a people\u2019s movement that had mobilised thousands of supporters. \u201cWe have a job to do,\u201d Langton told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe need to keep going, to reach those who are undecided. We are thinking deeply about the consequences of losing, imagining how emboldened the racists will become, but we are nowhere near considering a loss. \u201cThis genuinely is a people\u2019s movement. Thousands of people are involved. It\u2019s not a political partisan movement,\u201d Langton said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Uluru Dialogue leaders, Pat Anderson and Megan Davis, said they had held \u201ccountless meetings and conversations\u201d with First Nations people and non-Indigenous Australians. \u201cJust in the past few weeks we\u2019ve been in Atherton, Barunga, Brisbane, Cooktown, Dubbo, Gilgandra, Innisfail, Kuranda, Melbourne, Mossman, Mudgee, Narromine, Nyngan, Perth, Port Douglas, Sydney, Townsville, Trangie, Wellington, Warren, Weilwan (Gulargambone), and the West Kimberley,\u201d Anderson and Davis said in a joint statement. \u201cOur faith in the Australian people remains as strong as ever. \u201cWe are finding that when we sit down with people and explain the difference that the voice will make \u2013 where so many other initiatives and ideas devised within the Canberra bubble have failed \u2013 they are more than ready to vote yes.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, the Yes23 campaign director Dean Parkin said campaigners \u201cknew the numbers were going to tighten over time\u201d. Parkin said the voice debate has been \u201cstuck in the Canberra bubble, with politicians and lawyers having their say\u201d. \u201cNow thankfully that process is almost due to end,\u201d he told Sky News. The referendum bill is expected to pass the Senate by mid next week, at which point yes campaigners say they are looking forward to moving the conversation out of Canberra \u201cand into back yards across the country where this campaign belongs\u201d, Parkin said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get too caught up on analysing individual polls. There will be plenty of them between now and the referendum. They\u2019ll say different things,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is very much on making sure that Australians are involved in this conversation and taking it to the community where it belongs. \u201cThat\u2019s where this referendum will be won and that\u2019s where it belongs. It belongs with the people of Australia, it doesn\u2019t actually belong with the politicians.\u201d Published polls show a diverse range of results. Guardian\u2019s Essential poll recorded 60% support for the voice this week, compared with 49% in the Nine newspapers\u2019 Resolve. Privately, yes campaigners say their internal numbers are closer to the Essential poll, and also claim the spread of results is attributable to pollsters not having surveyed a referendum since 1999. The psephologist Kevin Bonham calculates average support to be in the mid-50s. He told Guardian Australia that pollsters are \u201cout of practice in polling referendums\u201d. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been one for so long. There was the marriage postal survey, but that wasn\u2019t quite the same thing. Pollsters don\u2019t have established methods for polling referendums that they update regularly like elections,\u201d Bonham said. \u201cThere are a range of approaches being seen. While pollsters seem to be coming to an agreement you should use the actual referendum question, there\u2019s variation in the surrounding wording being asked.\u201d The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has again asked the government to radically reshape the referendum and reduce the proposal to simple constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians, and scrapping the voice to parliament entirely. This approach will not be entertained by the government. \u201cThe polls have suggested the best case is the voice gets up by a slim majority and the country is divided,\u201d Dutton said, according to a party spokesperson. \u201cThere is an opportunity now for the prime minister to unify the country, through constitutional recognition without a constitutionally enshrined voice.\u201d The Uluru statement from the heart specifically calls for recognition through the voice, after years of rejection of symbolic constitutional recognition by Indigenous communities. Dutton, speaking later at the Committee for Economic Development\u2019s 2023 conference, said: \u201cI don\u2019t care how many people come out in support of voice, from sporting codes, public listed companies, churches or anything else. The Australian public wants the detail.\u201d The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told the Labor party room he remained positive about the referendum, citing support from the business, sports, arts and entertainment sectors, and that he was looking forward to passing the bill and fixing a date for the vote. Albanese noted there was \u201cno division\u201d within Labor on the question, unlike the Coalition, and the government was determined to give the voice the best chance to pass. Government sources say the PM is expected to announce the referendum date in early August, at this year\u2019s Garma festival. The date of the vote is anticipated to be mid-October. That would allow for two months of intense, election-style campaigning in the lead up to the referendum."

            "date": "2023-06-13T05:00:43Z",
            "content": "The UK is home to millions more conspiracy theorists than most people realise, with almost a quarter of the population believing Covid-19 was probably or definitely a hoax, polling has revealed. About a third of the population are convinced that the cost of living crisis is a government plot to control the public, and similar numbers think \u201c15-minute cities\u201d \u2013 an attempt to increase walking in neighbourhoods \u2013 are a government surveillance ruse, and that the \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d \u2013 the idea that white people are being replaced by non-white immigrants \u2013 is happening. The findings, on the eve of the first evidence session of the UK\u2019s public inquiry into the pandemic, which killed more than 227,000 people in the UK, come from an April survey by Savanta for King\u2019s College London (KCL) and the BBC. It found beliefs were shared through social media \u2013 most commonly YouTube and Facebook \u2013 and fuelled by websites including 21st Century Wire, The Light, The Expos\u00e9 and Breitbart, the last of which was run by Donald Trump\u2019s former adviser Steve Bannon. One in seven people \u2013 about 6 million adults \u2013 believe violence is a fair response to some alleged conspiracies. The general public underestimates the number of conspiracy theorists by approximately 4 million adults, according to the researchers who uncovered what they described as \u201cshocking\u201d attitudes. \u201cProtest is a key part of a healthy democracy and people will have sometimes legitimate concerns about the motivations behind government and others\u2019 actions, but it\u2019s worrying that around one in seven say that violence would be acceptable in protests against, for example, government digital currencies or 15-minute cities,\u201d said Prof Bobby Duffy, the director of the Policy Institute at KCL. Social media are the most likely places for people to first encounter conspiracy theories but people who read publications such as The Light were much more likely to believe in conspiracies than the wider population. Headlines in a recent edition of the UK-based publication include \u201cClimate CO2 hoax \u2013 how bankers hijacked the real environment movement\u201d and \u201cControl over money will end in total slavery\u201d. Conspiracy theories often develop out of real-world problems and anxieties. For example, rising interest rates and inflation, which reduce affluence and leave families struggling, can fuel a belief that powerful forces are plotting to deliberately impoverish certain sections of society. \u201cThese findings underline the importance of conspiracy theories in explaining how many people understand politics and the events which shape their lives,\u201d said Dr Rod Dacombe, a reader in politics in the department of political economy at KCL. \u201cFor some people, conspiracy theories provide the main focus of political participation and the primary means through which they understand what is going on in the world.\u201d Nineteen per cent of people in the survey said it was true or probably true that \u201cthe UK government carried out the 2005 attacks on the underground in London to encourage support for war in the Middle East\u201d, and 18% said it was definitely or probably true that \u201cthe Manchester Arena attack involved \u2018crisis actors\u2019 who pretended to be injured or killed \u2013 people weren\u2019t really killed or injured\u201d. Three out of 10 people thought the \u201cGreat Reset\u201d initiative announced by the World Economic Forum in 2020 was a conspiracy to impose a totalitarian world government. Between a fifth and a quarter of people \u2013 8 million to 10 million adults \u2013 said they would protest against the introduction of central bank digital currencies, a \u201cdeep state\u201d of military, intelligence and government officials who try to secretly manipulate government policy, \u201c15-minute cities\u201d and against vaccines. Men were about twice as likely as women to say they would participate in direct action."

            "date": "2023-06-10T07:00:17Z",
            "content": "In Germany it seems to be pretty much automatic, pretty much all the time. In France and Spain it all depends \u2013 presumably on social subtleties that you have to be French or Spanish to understand. In Italy, why would you even bother? When, and how much, to tip is a question that has been vexing visitors to Europe for as long as people have been travelling around the continent. Outside their own country, it seems even Europeans don\u2019t know the answer. According to new polling by YouGov in six EU countries, Britain and the US (where, as most visitors know but may be reluctant to acknowledge, gratuities may make up more than half your waitperson\u2019s income), Europeans are deeply divided on tipping. In restaurants, for example, 72% of respondents in Germany told the pollster they \u201ctypically\u201d tipped: almost the same as the US. In the UK, where an optional service charge of about 12.5% is usually included, 55% said they left a gratuity. The figure in Spain, where service is often included in restaurant bills but diners can leave optional tips, was 46%, while in France, where every price on a restaurant menu already includes 15% for service, 34% of people said they generally tipped on top. Even in Sweden, where tips are generally not expected, the figure was 31%. But only 24% of Italians said they would typically leave a gratuity after a meal out \u2013 with a rather greater proportion (29%) admitting they never left a cent. The divide was equally plain where service charges, optional or otherwise, were less common. At the hairdresser\u2019s, for example, 56% of Germans said they usually tipped, against 32% of Britons, 25% of Spaniards, 21% of French people \u2013 and just 8% of Italians. Hotels and taxis showed a similar pattern: 37% of Germans said they usually tipped concierges and 40% tipped taxi drivers \u2013 more, even, than Americans. For Italians, however, the figures were 14% and 3%, with other Europeans somewhere in between. Bar staff in Germany, likewise, could expect half of their customers to be regular tippers, compared with 47%, 24% and 16% in the US, France and Spain. Only 9% of Italians said they routinely left coins on the counter when paying for their drink. In terms of amounts, Britons and Germans were most likely to leave 10%; Italians, Spaniards and French 5%; and Americans 20%. By far the most common reason for tipping was \u201cto reward good service\u201d, followed by \u201cI feel I have to\u201d \u2013 although other reasons, notably in Germany, included: \u201cThat\u2019s just how it should be.\u201d A startling 42% of respondents in the US, however, and 17% of Germans \u2013 by far the most in Europe \u2013 confessed they would tip sometimes or often even if the service was \u201cterrible\u201d, indicating that for some, tipping is not about quality of service at all. The findings of the survey will come as a surprise in Germany, a country that does not generally think of itself as a nation of happy distributors of Trinkgeld (the word, in a similar vein to pourboire in French, means \u201cdrinking money\u201d). Nor is Germany a country whose service staff are particularly customer friendly: in Berlin, a glass of beer or a plate of food is often served in a huff rather than with a smile. Not for nothing is Servicew\u00fcste Deutschland (\u201cGermany is a service desert\u201d) a thing. Yet the data reflects a clear trend: Germans tend to hand over a few extra coins, irrespective of how they have been treated. They are the nation in Europe least likely to not tip even for poor service, and the most willing to pay extra for average service. A continuing fondness for cash may be a factor, with many taxi drivers and bars still refusing payment by card. A growing awareness of labour shortages in the catering sector could also explain a change in attitude. With many bars and cafes, even in big cities, reducing their opening hours due to a post-pandemic lack of staff, some barkeepers say their customers have recently become more generous tippers. But if German tipping habits seem ingrained, they are not always observed. Adding 10% is a generally accepted rule, but not always followed. \u201cMost customers pay me \u20ac2-3 extra,\u201d said Mehmet Dogan, a Berlin taxi driver. \u201cBut the 10% rule doesn\u2019t apply to longer journeys. I don\u2019t think I have been given a \u20ac5 tip in 20 years of doing my job. If someone slipped me a fiver, I\u2019d assume they made a mistake.\u201d Matthew Smith, YouGov\u2019s head of data journalism, said some may be surprised by the revelation that \u201cGermans are just as likely [as Americans] to tip service workers \u2013 not least because service attitudes in Germany have previously been so bad that the government felt the need to address it before the country hosted the 2006 World Cup.\u201d In Italy, Tiziana Nicolosi, who manages Quirino, a bar and restaurant in central Rome, said the country simply \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a culture for tipping. We\u2019re not like Americans or the British. We might do it occasionally, but it\u2019s not something that is expected.\u201d It is rare to see a tip box by the till in a bar or restaurant in Italy, with some owners deeming such a display unbecoming. Instead, they appreciate the loyalty of regular clientele, who may occasionally leave a little extra after their drink or meal in recognition of quality and service, rather than out of obligation. Many Italians, however, leave the change after paying a bill. \u201cIf a coffee costs 90 cents, then a customer will usually give \u20ac1 and let us keep the change,\u201d said Riccardo Conti, 34, a waiter in Rome. For some customers, leaving the small change is simply a matter of not wanting to hang around, he added. Personally, Conti said, he bucks the trend of non-tipping Italians. \u201cI always leave a tip, mainly in bars and restaurants,\u201d he said, adding it was \u201cvery subjective\u201d. \u201cIt all depends on the individual. It\u2019s a gesture you might see more from people in the south, who are generally more warm and generous than in the north.\u201d"

I hope, in time, to be around a little more; both for them but also for Susie [his wife] who has supported me every step of the way and without whom I could never have done any of this. According to a tally by the Spectator, Brine is the 42nd Conservative MP to say they are standing down. Brine and the others account for more than 10% of the 352-strong parliamentary party in the Commons. And these are from Keiran Pedley from Ipsos on the firm\u2019s latest polling. (See 2pm.) These are from Luke Tryl, the UK director of More in Commons, on the latest Ipsos polling. (See 2pm.) More in Common is a non-profit organisation that promotes in initiatives to bring society together and it commissions a great deal of opinion research, which means Tryl can comment on polling with authority. David Warburton, the former Conservative MP who resigned from the Commons over an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use, has claimed the MeToo movement has \u201cswung too far\u201d. Warburton, the former MP for Somerton and Frome has recently admitted to taking cocaine but denies claims of harassment. He had been accused of taking drugs and making unwanted advances towards two women, after they and another woman spoke to the Sunday Times about his conduct last year. In his first broadcast interview since parliament\u2019s independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS) launched its inquiry, the 57-year-old said he has quit parliament because he is now finally able to \u201csay what a shambles (the investigation) has been\u201d. Speaking to BBC Politics West, Warburton said he wanted the pendulum to \u201cswing back\u201d to a \u201cfair place\u201d in the wake of the MeToo movement. He said: The Me Too movement came about for a good reason. But, like many of these things, that pendulum can swing too far and I think in my case, I think it maybe, it\u2019s a demonstration that it has swung too far. It wasn\u2019t in a fair place years ago and now it\u2019s in another unfair place. I think we need to be balanced and fair about all of these things. You can\u2019t suddenly decide that everybody\u2019s guilty because it\u2019s better than deciding that no-one\u2019s guilty. You have to look at facts and figures and reality. I have never done before and never will do again and for that I paid a very high price. Here is our story about what was agreed at the mortgage summit Jeremy Hunt held with bank chiefs this morning. It\u2019s by Alex Lawson, Rowena Mason and Anna Isaac. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has described this response as \u201cweak\u201d. In a statement she said: Today\u2019s weak response from the government on a mortgage crisis they created shows just how little they understand what families are facing. Questions remain on how voluntary these measures are. The government must offer clarity and confidence to homeowners by putting in place requirements now to reassure households. Dissatisfaction with the the government is close to record levels, Ipsos, the polling firm, says. In its latest political monitor, it highlights figures showing that 80% of people are dissatisfied with the way the government is running the country (up from 76% in May) and only 12% are satisfied (down from 15% in May). That makes a net satisfaction score of -68 (down from -61 in May). Ipsos says this in effect puts Sunak in the same league as Liz Truss. Truss\u2019s government achieved a net satisfaction rating of -69 shortly before she resigned. Since 1979 the only governments that have performed worse on this measure have been John Major\u2019s between 1992 and 1995, and Theresa May\u2019s in 2019 \u2013 also shortly before she resigned. On voting intention, Ipsos has Labour on 47% (up 3 points from May), and the Conservatives on 25% (down three points), making a lead of 22 points (up 6). The banks have also agreed that people should be given a 12-month grace period before repossession proceedings start, Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said. Julia Kollewe has more details on the business live blog. Boris Johnson claims Brexit has delivered \u201call kinds of benefits\u201d. (See 12.16pm.) But most economists argue that its economic impact has been negative, and there are three charts in today\u2019s report from the Tony Blair Institute highlighting this. The report says the economic damage done by Brexit is \u201cundeniable\u201d. Growth Since Brexit, growth has slowed compared to other G7 countries, the report says. It says: When assessing the performance of the UK economy since the 2016 referendum, it is evident that it has done worse than any other G7 economy, including the EU27. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the UK has grown the slowest among G7 economies since 2016. While this grim performance cannot be fully attributed to the decision to leave the EU, Brexit is the only major factor that distinguishes the UK from other countries in this comparative set. Trade openness Trade has also suffered, the report says. It evaluates this by looking at \u201ctrade openness\u201d \u2013 the ratio of trade relative to GDP. It says: Before Brexit, the UK had one of the most open economies among G7 countries but is now at the bottom of this group, having experienced a more significant drop in trade openness and recovered more slowly than other economies. As was the case in other countries, the Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected trade and supply chains, but the magnitude of the UK\u2019s drop suggests that higher trade barriers caused by the departure from the single market have been one of the main drivers of this underperformance. Investment And investment has also been hit, the report says. It says: Although business investment had been growing steadily since the 2008 financial crisis, this was abruptly knocked off course at the time of the 2016 referendum. Today, business investment in the UK is estimated to be 31 per cent below the pre-referendum trend. In the EU, by contrast, business investment is currently 2 per cent above its pre-2016 trend. However, the different ways in which investment has been hit in the UK and the EU cannot be solely attributed to Brexit, not least because the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic varied in severity. The banks have agreed that people who renegotiate the terms of their mortgage on a temporary basis will not have to worry about having their credit scores downgraded, Jeremy Hunt has said. Speaking about the outcome of his meeting this morning with lenders, the chancellor told broadcasters: We agreed some very important things for people who are worried about their rates going up, not just people who are in an extreme situations. The most significant thing is that they can pick up the phone to their bank or their mortgage lender and talk about their situation without any worry that it will impact their credit score. And if they decide to make their payments easier by extending the period of their mortgage, or by going to an interest-only package, they can go back to their original package without any questions, without any impact on their credit score, within six months. That\u2019s the reassurance that people like Martin Lewis [the consumer champion] had been saying will make a big difference for families in those situations. Keir Starmer has said people want \u201caction, not words\u201d from ministers on rising mortgage rates. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, Starmer said there were going to be \u201cmany mortgage holders, many families, across the country who are now even more worried about paying their mortgage\u201d. He went on: They know that the government\u2019s been about for 13 years, they know the Government crashed the economy last year. What they want, I think, is a much stronger sense that the government is gripping this; action, not words. Labour says lenders should be forced to offer customers the option of temporarily switching to interest-only payments, or extending the repayment period, if they struggling to meet their monthly payments. At the morning lobby briefing Downing Street also said that the announcement of a five-day strike by junior doctors in England was \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d. Asked if Rishi Sunak was concerned about the development, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: Yes. It puts patient safety and our efforts to cut the waiting lists at risk. It\u2019s obviously extremely disappointing. In the meeting government had with junior doctors we made a fair and reasonable opening offer, and we were discussing both pay and non-pay issues. But they chose to end the talks by announcing new strike dates. Obviously, if they cancel the damaging and disruptive strikes and show willingness to move away from their starting positions and find a way forward, then will be able to proceed with those discussions. Downing Street has defended the Bank of England\u2019s independence but declined to criticise the Tory MPs who have been condemning its handling of inflation, PA Media reports. Speaking at the lobby briefing this morning, the PM\u2019s spokesperson said: They are rightly independent. Obviously, people are able to express their view, that\u2019s right in a free society. For our part, we recognise it is rightly the independent Bank of England that sets monetary policy and the monetary policy committee are responsible for that. We will work in lockstep with them where appropriate so that we work in the interest of the public by bringing inflation down. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the GB News presenter and former business secretary, is one of the Tories most critical of the Bank. He posted this on Twitter this morning. Boris Johnson has chosen to mark the anniversary of the Brexit vote by posting a message on Twitter claiming it has delivered \u201call kinds of benefits\u201d and dismissing its critics as \u201cthe prophets of doom\u201d. As usual, much of what he is saying is misleading or downright false. Brexit was not the reason for the UK having the fastest initial vaccine rollout in the EU. Being in the EU never stopped the UK having an independent foreign policy (Johnson has forgotten the Iraq war). And, while remain campaigners did argue that Brexit would lead to job losses, they never seriously predicted that \u201cmillions would be thrown out of work\u201d. To mark the anniversary of the Brexit vote, the Scottish government has published a short paper on the impact of leaving the EU on Scotland. Scotland voted remain by 62% to 38%, making it the most pro-remain of the four nations of the UK, and the SNP, which wants an independent Scotland to rejoin the EU, has criticised Brexit more strongly than any other party in the UK. In its paper, the Scottish government does not identify any advantages from Brexit at all. The section headings give a good sense of the overall verdict. Democratic impact A poorer nation A cost of living crisis Increased costs to business and damaged trade Additional costs and red tape for our fishing and agriculture industries Freedom of movement has gone Travel is more difficult and costly Missed youth opportunities Lost funding Cutting-edge research halted Commenting on the report, Angus Robertson, the Scottish government\u2019s constitution secretary, said Brexit had \u201climited economic growth, restricted trade, increased food costs and diminished opportunities for young people\u201d. He said: Brexit means Scotland has now left the world\u2019s biggest single market and no longer enjoys freedom of movement, resulting in labour shortages across the NHS, agriculture, and our hospitality sector. Consumers and businesses continue to face a cost of living crisis driven by rampant food inflation, while produce rots in the ground, and obstructive trade barriers that are making it harder to import and export goods from the EU. Scotland\u2019s rural and research sectors have lost out on hundreds of millions of pounds worth of EU funding, which the UK government has been unable to match. A generation of young Scots have been deprived of life-changing exchange opportunities to study abroad. While we will continue to do all we can to mitigate this damage through our long-standing ties with European neighbours, the fact remains that the only way to meaningfully reverse this damage and restore the benefits Scotland previously enjoyed, is for an independent Scotland to re-join the European Union. On the subject of health strikes, Chris Smyth in the Times reports that next week the Royal College of Nursing is likely to announce that its strike action over pay in England is coming to an end. The RCN has been balloting members on further strike action. Although most of those voting are backing further strikes, Smyth has been told that the union won\u2019t meet the 50% turnout threshold required for a union strike ballot to be legally valid. Smyth reports: \u201cWe believe that the majority of those voting are voting for strikes but we expect [the vote] not to clear the turnout hurdle,\u201d one senior health source said. This week, [Pat Cullen, the RCN general secretary] blamed rules requiring a postal vote for struggles to reach the threshold, urging nurses to return their ballots or see the strikes reach \u201cthe end of the road\u201d. Previously when the RCN held a strike ballot, it organised ballots by individual employment unit. Strikes went ahead in the places where the 50% turnout threshold was reached, but in many hospitals there were no strikes because turnout in the ballot was too low. This time the RCN organised the ballot on an England-wide basis. As the process started Cullen denied suggestions that this format would make it harder for the ballot to succeed. In March the RCN leadership recommended that members should accept the revised pay offer from government. But members rejected the recommendation, leading to further strike action in the spring. Nurses received the pay rise anyway after the NHS staff council, which represents most health unions, voted to accept it. After the RCN strike in the spring a further ballot on strike action was needed because, under union law, the mandate for strike vote only remains legally valid for six months. Junior doctors in England will strike for five days from 13 July in their longest single period of industrial action in the history of the health service, the British Medical Association has said. The Commons liaison committee has announced that its next session with Rishi Sunak will take place on Tuesday 4 July. Sunak will take questions from the committee for 90 minutes. Banking bosses held a \u201cvery productive\u201d meeting with Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, after a shock interest rate hike deepened the mortgage crisis and threatened more pain for struggling households, PA Media reports. PA says: Hunt met with large lenders including HSBC, Santander and Barclays in Downing Street early on Friday morning, with the government being urged to relieve the pressure. \u201cWe had a very productive meeting. We\u2019re doing everything we can to help customers and help with the anxieties,\u201d NatWest boss Alison Rose said as she left the meeting. She added they were \u201cvery keen\u201d to help everyone. Chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group Charlie Nunn said that bosses had held a \u201cgood working discussion with the chancellor\u201d. Julia Kollewe has more coverage on our business live blog. The Tony Blair Institute report \u2013 Moving Forward: The Path to a Better Post-Brexit Relationship Between the UK and the EU \u2013 includes a series of recommendations for how Britain and the EU could develop a closer trading relationship. It does not explicitly propose rejoining the single market. Instead it highlights 10, mostly technical, recommendations, that would align the UK more closely with EU regulations. But does the EU want a closer relationship with the UK. As Anton Spisak, one of the authors of the report, highlighted on Twitter last week, the answer seems to be no. Spisak highlighted a Financial Times report quoting Stefan Fuehring, the European Commission official in charge of overseeing the trade and cooperation agreement (the post-Brexit trade deal with the UK). Fuehring told a conference recently: There\u2019s almost on a bi-weekly basis a report [on how to improve the existing Brexit deal] coming from the Tony Blair Institute, the UK in a Changing Europe, the House of Lords and so on. My job is to follow all these, of course, but I\u2019m not aware that in the last two years any such report has come out of the EU system. We have really moved on now with this debate [over Brexit] and I think the next decade is one where we\u2019ll deal with future member states, rather than a past member state. Fuehring also said the review of the TCA due to take place in 2026 was an \u201cimplementation\u201d review and not a moment for \u201crevising, revisiting or renewing, let alone amending\u201d the deal. In its report, the Tony Blair Institute says that, although there would be advantages in rejoining the single market, rejoining the EU as a proper member might be better and more straightforward. It says: Full membership of the EU single market could happen only in return for the UK accepting all four freedoms that are inherent to the EU \u2013 including free movement of persons \u2013 and ceding regulatory autonomy over parts of its economy, without having much decision-making power over those EU rules. If it was faced with this decision, the UK would have to consider the merits of going back into the single market versus rejoining the EU, the latter offering a similar balance of rights and obligations but with the UK given a direct seat at the table, where the rules are made and decided. The report also says that just rejoining the single market would involve a renegotiation of the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, which allows Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein to be in the single market but not in the EU. This might be complicated because \u201cthe UK\u2019s economy is approximately seven times greater than that of Norway\u2019s, the next largest country within the single market but outside the EU, and structurally, they have very different economies\u201d, it says. Keir Starmer has said a Labour government would not try to rejoining the single market and the fact that the report does not include this as a recommendation is is a sign of how keen it is to promote ideas that have a chance of being implemented. In a recent column, the FT\u2019s Robert Shrimsley said that, if Labour wins the election, the Tony Blair Institute could become the country\u2019s most influential thinktank. Blair has \u201cunfinished business\u201d in terms of shaping Britain, Shrimsley concluded. Good morning. Seven years ago today the United Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the European Union. Even leave voters don\u2019t believe it has been a success, and this morning the Tony Blair Institute has published a report that includes polling suggesting that four out of five people (78%) now want a closer relationship with the EU. Even amongst leave voters, 71% now favour a closer relationship with the EU. The poll also suggests that 56% of people want the UK to at least rejoin the single market (with 43% favouring rejoining the EU in full, and 13% favouring just returning to the single market). Remarkably, even among leave voters, 34% want the UK to at least rejoin the single market (with 13% favouring rejoining the EU in full, and 21% favouring just returning to the single market). Commenting on the findings, Anton Spisak, head of political leadership at the thinktank, said: Our polling shows that there is a large majority of the British public who recognise that Brexit in its current form isn\u2019t working and would like to see the UK moving closer to the EU. This creates a substantial political space to move the debate forward from refighting the old battles about whether Brexit was right or wrong, to discussing what an improved future relationship with the EU should look like. The EU will always remain a key strategic ally, and it is absurd that the bloc has deeper trading arrangements with Israel and Georgia, better regulatory recognition on food-safety standards with Canada and New Zealand, and deeper mechanisms for political cooperation with nations including Australia and Japan. Any future British government that wants to improve the relationship with the EU will need a carefully considered strategic plan \u2013 and make a clear-eyed offer to the other side. Asking the EU nicely cannot succeed as a negotiating strategy. To mark the anniversary, there is quite a lot of other Brexit news around, including polling showing that the proportion of Britons who want to rejoin the EU has climbed to its highest levels since 2016. Jon Henley and Michael Goodier have the details here. Otherwise, the political news fountain is running a bit dry today.

            "date": "2023-06-25T06:00:28Z",
            "content": "A senior Tory knighted in Boris Johnson\u2019s honours list has been accused of a fresh conflict of interest, after it emerged that he helped arrange a Tory fundraiser at the V&amp;A while he was both a trustee of the museum and the party\u2019s chair. Internal emails seen by the Observer reveal that Ben Elliot, who has previously faced accusations of blurring his business and political activities, had an early role in setting up the party\u2019s glitzy 2021 Winter Ball, introducing party officials to V&amp;A staff. The event saw the auctioning of prizes that included an hour playing cricket with Rishi Sunak, said to have sold for \u00a335,000, a karaoke session with Liz Truss, which raised \u00a322,000, and a \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d sign used by Johnson during the 2019 election campaign, which sold for \u00a330,000. It comes amid longstanding concerns about political appointments to public and cultural bodies, as well as anger over the allies that Johnson has recognised in his resignation honours list. Elliot, a nephew of the Queen, has also faced criticism over a concierge company he founded, Quintessentially, and its work with Russian clients. The V&amp;A has stated that Elliot had no role in arranging last year\u2019s Conservative summer party at the venue. However, emails released under the Freedom of Information Act show he was involved in arranging the party\u2019s winter ball a few months earlier in 2021. In internal emails from May 2022, staff state that there was \u201cearly involvement from Ben Elliot\u201d in a fundraising dinner in November 2021 at the \u201cinitial inquiry stage\u201d. Another states: \u201cBen Elliott [sic] introduced the Conservative party contact to us back for their event last year but for this year they have been in contact directly.\u201d The code of conduct for board members of public bodies states: \u201cIn your public role, you should be, and be seen to be, politically impartial. You should not occupy a paid party political post or hold a particularly sensitive or high-profile role in a political party. You should abstain from all controversial political activity \u2026 You must not use, or attempt to use, the opportunity of public service to promote your personal interests or those of any connected person, firm, business or other organisation.\u201d Quintessentially has also held events at the venue. Dr Alex May, the blogger and transparency campaigner who uncovered the details, said: \u201cWe already know Sir Ben blurred the separation between his role as a trustee and as a founding director of Quintessentially, the luxury lifestyle group and global concierge service. Now we discover he also blurred the separation between his role as a trustee and as Tory co-chair. This overlap risks undermining the political neutrality of the V&amp;A.\u201d Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, said: \u201cThe Conservatives simply don\u2019t care how their sleaze taints great British institutions and undermines public trust in public appointments. Despite denials it is clear that Ben Elliot has tarnished the reputation of the V&amp;A by association. Ministers should investigate this matter and rule on whether he has breached the code of conduct for board members of public bodies.\u201d Insiders at the museum said that while it was partially publicly funded, it relied on corporate events and other forms of generating income to sustain its wider work. A spokesperson for the V&amp;A said: \u201cThe Conservative party events held at the V&amp;A were both standard corporate venue hires of V&amp;A spaces and were contracted and managed by our corporate events team. The V&amp;A did not host the events \u2013 we were the venue. \u201cBen Elliot made the initial introduction to the V&amp;A corporate events team but had no further involvement in the process of contracting either event. All rates charged for the events were in line with those advertised publicly online, with no special discounts or dispensations.\u201d The Observer attempted to contact Elliot and Quintessentially, but neither responded. Quintessentially has previously said Elliot no longer has day-to-day control over the business with a role similar to a non-executive director. Elliot stood down as Tory co-chair in September. A spokesperson for the Conservative party said: \u201cWhen the party has used the V&amp;A to host events, we have paid full commercial rates.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2023 to correct the surname of Dr Alex May."

            "date": "2023-06-27T06:06:08Z",
            "content": "The consultancy firm KPMG has launched an internal review to address concerns about potential conflicts of interest after sustained criticism from senators, unions and transparency advocates. The federal government has paid KPMG to conduct safety and quality audits of aged care facilities, while a separate division within the firm simultaneously charges providers for advice on audits and accreditation. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup KPMG says all potential conflicts of interest are carefully managed but Greens senator Barbara Pocock has raised concerns during a parliamentary hearing into the government\u2019s use of consultants. \u201cIn aged care, you are both an auditor of aged care residential services and you are a consultant to those services,\u201d Pocock said. \u201cThe conflict of interest is very clear. It\u2019s repetitive. Chinese walls will not protect against it. It is a real concern that this very important separation is not under way.\u201d KPMG chief executive Andrew Yates told the inquiry he was aware of public commentary and concern about the arrangements. \u201cI need to listen to what we are hearing and make sure that we are doing the right thing,\u201d Yates said. \u201cWe feel we are doing the right thing. Our clients are telling us that we are doing the right thing. We are hearing the comments you have been making. I have asked our risk team to review this to make sure that we are actually doing the right thing.\u201d The scope of the review and its duration are not known. KPMG was contacted for comment but did not respond before deadline. Government consultancy firms have faced intense scrutiny after the misuse of confidential tax policy information at PwC, which has damaged the firm\u2019s revenue and reputation. It now plans to divest its government work \u2013 worth about 20% of revenue \u2013 for just $1 to save more than 1,000 jobs. The Community and Public Sector Union has warned KPMG\u2019s work as an auditor and an adviser could expose taxpayers and residents to potential conflicts of interest, as consultants could be asked to audit clients that are not disclosed to or detected by government. \u201cWhat we have here is a consultancy assisting the aged care regulator to audit aged care facilities, while at the same time, it seems that same consultancy is also advising aged care providers,\u201d CPSU assistant national secretary, Michael Tull, told the inquiry. \u201cAt face value, that looks like a potential conflict of interest.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about aged care regulation, an area of serious public concern, where many people think profit motives stand in the way of quality care. There cannot be even the slightest room for people to doubt the independence of the aged care regulator.\u201d The aged care safety and quality commission has previously told a parliamentary inquiry that it prompts KPMG to declare any conflicts of interest every month and that when conflicts are identified, work is not awarded. KPMG executive Paul Low told the inquiry the firm would welcome additional transparency over the movement of staff from government to consultancy firms. \u201cIf there is ambiguity around the separation from government and there are opportunities to make that clearer for other employers, that is something that KPMG would support,\u201d Low said. \u201cIf we have a senior executive who is moving into our business formerly from government or from a political role in the last two years, we engage with our national managing risk partner and the client lead partner for that client in our business.\u201d Another parliamentary inquiry has been launched into ethics and professional accountability in the government consulting industry. Labor senator Deborah O\u2019Neill said continued scrutiny was required to ensure accountability. \u201cI think we have opened the lid on a set of practices that this sector has tried to keep quiet and just considered business as usual for a very, very long period of time,\u201d O\u2019Neill said."

            "date": "2023-06-01T01:18:43Z",
            "content": "Federal prosecutors obtained audio recording of a summer 2021 meeting where Donald Trump suggested he should have declassified a military document about Iran he admitted retaining, according to people familiar with the criminal investigation into his retention of national security papers. The recording was made at Trump\u2019s Bedminster golf club in July 2021, when the former president met with people helping his former chief of staff Mark Meadows write a book, by his aide Margo Martin who regularly taped conversations with authors to ensure they accurately recounted his remarks. For several minutes of the audio recording, the sources said, Trump talks about how he cannot discuss the document because he no longer possesses the sweeping presidential power to declassify now out of office, but suggests that he should have done so when he was still in the White House. The previously unreported suggestion that he should have declassified the document presents a potentially perilous moment for Trump, as it indicates he knew he had retained material that was sensitive to national security \u2013 as well as the limitations about discussing it. CNN earlier reported that prosecutors had the recording. The exact nature of the document Trump was referring to in the recording is unclear, though Trump\u2019s lawyers believe a document classified at the \u201cSecret\u201d level, which referenced military action concerning Iran, had been returned to the National Archives months later, according to a person briefed on the matter. Prosecutors in the office of special counsel Jack Smith appear to have obtained the recording around March, as the criminal investigation targeting Trump intensified and numerous Trump aides were subpoenaed to testify before the federal grand jury hearing evidence in the case in Washington. The tape was played to multiple witnesses, including Martin, when she testified in mid-March after having her laptop and phones imaged by prosecutors, the sources said. The first time the Trump lawyers learned about the tape was after Martin testified, one of the sources said. In his book titled A Chief\u2019s Chief, Meadows recounts how Trump once recalled a four-page report produced by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley that contained his plan to attack Iran, though it is unclear if that was the same meeting attended by his writers. But the July 2021 meeting that was recorded came shortly after Trump was incensed about news reports that Milley had urged him not to attack Iran in the final weeks of his presidency. Trump believed that the document outlining the report to attack Iran would undercut Milley\u2019s reported assertions, though the report was actually written earlier in the Trump administration when Joseph Dunford was chairman of the joint chiefs, a person familiar with the document said. A Trump spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cLeaks from radical partisans behind this political persecution are designed to inflame tensions and continue the media\u2019s harassment of President Trump and his supporters. It\u2019s just more proof that when it comes to President Trump, there are absolutely no depths to which they will not sink as they pursue their witch hunts.\u201d"

            "content": "An audio clip has emerged of Donald Trump discussing secret documents that he had not declassified at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club in July 2021, providing new evidence that the former president knew of proper declassification procedures. The recording, obtained by CNN, includes new details from a conversation that is a critical piece of evidence in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment of Trump over the mishandling of classified information. It includes a moment when Trump seems to indicate he was holding a secret Pentagon document with plans to attack Iran. The episode is one of two referenced in the indictment where prosecutors allege that Trump showed classified information to others who did not have security clearances, CNN reported. In the conversation, Trump is talking with people helping his former chief of staff Mark Meadows write a book. His aide, Margo Martin, regularly taped conversations with authors to ensure they accurately recounted his remarks. According to the recording aired on CNN, Trump refers to the document and its classified status. \u201cThese are the papers,\u201d Trump says in the audio recording, while he\u2019s discussing the Pentagon attack plans, a quote that was not included in the indictment. \u201cThis was done by the military and given to me,\u201d Trump continues, before noting that the document remained classified. \u201cSee as president I could have declassified it,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I can\u2019t, you know, but this is still a secret.\u201d Trump and his aides also joked about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cHillary would print that out all the time, you know. Her private emails,\u201d Trump\u2019s staffer said. \u201cNo, she\u2019d send it to Anthony Weiner,\u201d Trump responded, referring to the former Democratic congressman, prompting laughter in the room. The audio recording obtained by CNN included more lines from the conversation: Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s so cool. I mean, it\u2019s so, look, her and I, and you probably almost didn\u2019t believe me, but now you believe me.\u201d Writer: \u201cNo, I believed you.\u201d Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, right?\u201d Writer: \u201cNo, they never met a war they didn\u2019t want.\u201d Trump: \u201cHey, bring some, uh, bring some Cokes in please.\u201d The July 2021 meeting that was recorded came shortly after Trump was incensed about news reports that Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had urged him not to attack Iran in the final weeks of his presidency. Trump believed that the document outlining the report to attack Iran would undercut Milley\u2019s reported assertions, though the report was actually written earlier in the Trump administration when Joseph Dunford was chairman of the joint chiefs, a person familiar with the document said. Trump pleaded not guilty earlier this month to 37 counts related to the alleged mishandling of classified documents kept at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

            "date": "2023-06-14T17:29:59Z",
            "content": "After a destructive feud between his top military chiefs and the mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, Vladimir Putin has appeared to side with his top brass, calling for Russia\u2019s \u201cvolunteer detachments\u201d fighting in Ukraine to be placed under the direct control of the defence ministry. The decision severely undermines Prigozhin, who has turned Wagner\u2019s role in the capture of Bakhmut into an outsized public profile in Russia that he uses to berate Putin\u2019s generals and promote himself. Speaking to a group of pro-war bloggers on Tuesday, the Russian president said he welcomed the defence minister Sergei Shoigu\u2019s initiative to force mercenary groups to sign contracts with the ministry \u2013 an order Prigozhin has refused to follow. \u201cThis has to be done and it has to be done as quickly as possible,\u201d Putin said of the military contracts, saying it was \u201cin line with common sense, with established practice and the law\u201d. Earlier, Shoigu had ordered all volunteer detachments to sign contracts with his ministry by the end of the month, a step seen as an attempt to rein in Prigozhin by integrating Wagner into the army. \u201cWagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,\u201d Prigozhin said in response, criticising Shoigu for failing to \u201cproperly manage military formations\u201d. When asked to comment on Putin\u2019s statements on Wednesday, a defiant Prigozhin doubled down. \u201cWhen we started participating in this war, no one said that we would be obliged to conclude agreements with the Ministry of Defence,\u201d he said in a rare direct rebuke of the president. \u201cNone of the Wagner fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again. And so no one will sign contracts,\u201d he said, adding that he believed the Russian president would find a \u201ccompromise\u201d for Wagner. The feud between Prigozhin and the military reached new heights this month when a Russian commander accused Wagner of kidnapping and torturing his soldiers. Putin\u2019s intervention is seen as a big boost for Shoigu, a longtime ally of the president who has faced political pressure for Moscow\u2019s faltering efforts in Ukraine. It has also put Prigozhin in his most precarious position since the invasion began. \u201cShoigu has Prigozhin in more or less a checkmate. If Wagner does not sign a [defence ministry] contract in a few weeks, the state could have grounds to stop supporting Wagner, or even make legal moves against them,\u201d said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation. Some analysts suggested that Putin probably made the decision to limit Wagner\u2019s influence in Ukraine months earlier. \u201cThe decision was made in January, but they were waiting for Wagner to take Bakhmut,\u201d said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of the political analysis firm R Politik. \u201cIt was decided that at least on Ukraine\u2019s territory, everyone should be subjugated to the general staff.\u201d Prigozhin announced earlier this month that his troops had largely pulled back from Bakhmut, most of which they captured after taking heavy casualties. Prigozhin\u2019s exclusion from Ukraine would sideline one of Russia\u2019s most recognisable war figures. Through the daily use of social media, he has cultivated a populist, anti-elite persona that has resonated with Russians unhappy with the foundering invasion. The warlord\u2019s public standing peaked as his troops gradually captured Bakhmut, delivering Moscow its first tangible military victory since last summer. \u201cPrigozhin understands that his publicity is his protection,\u201d said a former defence official who worked with him. \u201cHe has no official status, but he knows that Putin prefers stability and wouldn\u2019t want to cause chaos by letting others go after such a public figure.\u201d With his troubles mounting, Prigozhin embarked on a publicity tour across Russia, addressing audiences alongside hardliners such as the ex-arms dealer Viktor Bout. Questions remain about whether he can maintain his standing through a publicity tour alone. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it will have the same effect as his battle for Bakhmut,\u201d said Stanovaya. \u201cPrigozhin is pushed into a corner a bit and is trying to figure out how to realise his goals.\u201d The mercenary boss has continued his public attacks against Russia\u2019s military leadership. Speaking in the central Ulyanovsk region on Tuesday, he directly contradicted Putin, who claimed earlier that day that Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive had failed on all fronts. \u201cThey [Ukraine] are fighting correctly,\u201d Prigozhin said, claiming that Moscow was not doing enough to \u201ccounter the adversary\u201d. Still, some believe it is too soon to speculate about Prigozhin\u2019s downfall. \u201cPeople have wrongly written off Prigozhin many times,\u201d said the former defence official. \u201cShoigu currently has the upper hand, but if Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive fails, Prigozhin will likely be called upon again,\u201d they added, saying that Putin traditionally played off different factions against one another. The former official also noted that Putin hinted on Tuesday that some of Prigozhin\u2019s criticism of the military was justified. \u201cAt the start of the special military operation, we quickly realised that the \u2018carpet generals\u2019 [\u2026] are not effective, to put it mildly,\u201d Putin said. \u201cPeople started to come out of the shadows who we hadn\u2019t heard or seen before, and they turned out to be very effective and made themselves useful.\u201d Prigozhin\u2019s future could depend on the success or failure of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive, Stanovaya argued. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for them to see that without his abilities and skills, the Russian army will lose territory and Putin or Shoigu will come to him for help \u2026 He dreams about that.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-14T08:00:07Z",
            "content": "Regis Prograis would never look past an opponent. But few in the world of men\u2019s professional boxing would blame him for making plans beyond his junior welterweight title defense Saturday in his hometown of New Orleans. In Prograis\u2019s first fight since he knocked out Jose Zepeda in Los Angeles in November to win the World Boxing Council\u2019s 140lb belt, Danielito Zorrilla stands in his way. Zorrilla (17-1, 13 KOs) only landed the shot to face Prograis after an injury forced the originally programmed challenger, Liam Paro, to withdraw. He\u2019s entering his second fight since losing a fairly wide unanimous decision last July to Arnold Barboza \u2013 who was the Prograis camp\u2019s first choice to replace Paro \u2013 and is considered a relatively sizable underdog by the bettors. All of which has left Prograis (28-1, 24 KOs) willing to publicly contemplate things other than the Miguel Cotto-promoted pugilist in the corner across from him as he geared up for the first of three contracted contests for promoter Eddie Hearn\u2019s Matchroom Boxing stable. After a recent workout, Prograis spoke frankly with the Guardian about three fights he covets assuming he takes care of business Saturday: a unification with fellow 140lb strap holder Subriel Matias, a challenge from undisputed lightweight champion Devin Haney, or a rematch with the only man who beat him, Josh Taylor, the terms of which he may better control after the Scot lost his lineal and WBO junior welter titles Saturday to Te\u00f3fimo L\u00f3pez. Matias\u2019s appeal centers on the IBF title he holds, which \u2013 if he could wrest it away \u2013 would get Prograis one step closer to the division\u2019s undisputed championship. It has the added bonus of drawing interest from fans who want to see two skilled beltholders with knockout-laden resumes compete against each other. \u201cHe has something I want,\u201d Prograis said of Matias. \u201cAnd that fight would make a lot of money, too.\u201d However, Prograis acknowledged that the UK-based Hearn has held preliminary talks with Haney\u2019s team. Haney has been openly exploring campaigning at junior welterweight after he outpointed Vasiliy Lomachenko last month to retain the undisputed lightweight championship, and for Prograis, a showdown with him would be as lucrative and competitive \u2013 if not moreso \u2013 than one with Matias. Yet Prograis made clear that he has not given up on one day avenging his majority decision defeat to Taylor in London in 2019, in which he lost the WBA belt as well as the chance to claim both Taylor\u2019s IBF strap and the Ring magazine title. Though that night Prograis magnanimously declared that \u201cthe best man won\u201d, he\u2019s since reconsidered, arguing that the judges spurned him despite landing 45 more punches than Taylor, outlanding him in seven rounds (including the final two), punching more accurately and throwing more punches. \u201cI feel like I won the first time,\u201d Prograis said of his fight against Taylor, who went on to beat Jose Ramirez and become the undisputed champion at junior welterweight for a time. \u201cI have to get it back.\u201d He said he would do everything possible to avoid having that fight in the UK, where the initial excitement about fighting in a boxing-crazed nation so far away from home gave way to gloominess over dreary weather and distance from his family, including his son, whose birthday he had to miss. \u201cI was really, really miserable,\u201d Prograis said of his extended visit to London. \u201cAfter the fight, I just didn\u2019t have the same energy \u2013 I was just like, \u2018Whatever, he won, I\u2019m ready to go home, bro\u2019.\u201d Prograis\u2019s ability to control where a theoretical Taylor rematch might take place could be easier after the Tartan Tornado\u2019s defeat to Lopez leaves him facing a decision to pursue another title reign in the junior welterweight division or to move up to the welterweight class. But Prograis knows other factors might influence his ability to have a say about where he might face other potential future opponents that have been cited for him \u2013 including L\u00f3pez himself, 140lb WBA titleholder Rolly Romero, the comeback-minded Adrien Broner, lightweight star Gervonta Davis, the unsuccessful Davis challenger Ryan Garcia and Jack Catterall, who pushed Taylor to the limit last year before coming out on the wrong end of a decision. One of the calling cards of Prograis\u2019s career has been a commitment to bring big-time boxing back to New Orleans, where he grew up before Hurricane Katrina in 2005 displaced him to Houston. Prograis\u2019s parents and other loved ones still live in and around New Orleans, whose residents once turned out in droves to support locally-raised world champions such as Pete Herman, Tony Canzoneri, Joe Brown, Ralph Dupas and Willie Pastrano. But crowds were underwhelming when Prograis, as an established contender, defeated Juan Jose Velasco and Terry Flanagan at the University of New Orleans\u2019s 10,000-seat Lakefront Arena months apart in 2018. The same was true when he went a couple of hours away to Lafayette, Louisiana, the following year to knock Kiryl Relikh out and win the WBA belt that he later lost to Taylor. Prograis\u2019s four victories since have been in San Antonio, Atlanta, Dubai and Los Angeles. His return to New Orleans sees him in possession of a world title. Yet his challenger is being given little chance and has hardly any mainstream recognition, which could make a strong crowd at the 18,000-seat Smoothie King Center on Saturday a tall order. Nonetheless, among his promotional ploys this time around has been to go on training runs through New Orleans\u2019s streets alongside local supporters, calling to mind famous scenes from the Rocky and Creed boxing film series. He wants to give the city to which he\u2019s been steadfastly loyal every chance to help him show that, in addition to being a worthy champion, he\u2019s a ticket seller. \u201cThis is home to me \u2013 I feel the most comfortable here,\u201d Prograis said when asked about giving New Orleans another shot to pack the stands for him. \u201cAll these people are my people, and I want to be around.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-19T12:00:11Z",
            "content": "From the same family as cucumbers, squashes and melons, courgettes are very versatile, and are at their best and most affordable between June and September. Go for smaller, firmer ones for salads, marinades or grilling, while larger specimens work best roasted, fried or braised. If you have the space to grow some yourself, you will already know how well they can crop, and if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll always be on the lookout for new things to do with them, which is how today\u2019s first recipe came about. Slow-cooked garlic courgettes with bulgur pilaf Slow cooking turns courgettes wonderfully rich, and once you\u2019ve mastered the approach, there are many variations on the theme. My friend, the fabulous chef Laura Jackson, who co-owns the lovely canal-side Towpath cafe in east London, makes an especially delicious stew with braised courgettes, white beans and saffron that she serves with minty creme fraiche. The pilaf, meanwhile, is loosely based on a recipe from one of the gorgeous Moro cookbooks that I\u2019ve been making for years. I like to serve this with a bowl of seasoned yoghurt. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 15 min Serves 4 3 tbsp light olive oil 30g butter 4 courgettes (500g), washed, trimmed and cut into 1cm-thick coins (if they are fat, cut them in half lengthwise first) Sea salt and black pepper 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed or finely grated A few soft herb leaves \u2013 mint, basil or oregano (optional) Seasoned yoghurt, to serve (optional) For the pilaf 20g butter 2 tbsp light olive oil 4 spring onions, lightly trimmed and sliced 1 tsp chilli flakes 200g bulgur wheat 300ml vegetable stock A squeeze of lemon 1 small handful parsley, roughly chopped In a large pan for which you have a lid, heat the light olive oil and butter, add the courgettes and a generous dose of salt, and leave them to come up to a good heat, shaking the pan from time to time. When they start sizzling, turn down the heat, stir in the garlic, cover and leave to cook gently for 20-30 minutes, until the courgettes are collapsing \u2013 check on them every now and again, and give them a stir and a squish. Take off the lid, turn up the heat a little and cook to reduce the liquid that will have accumulated in the pan \u2013 you\u2019re after a thick, spoonable consistency. Season to taste, cover again and leave to sit on a very low heat until the pilaf is ready \u2013 the courgettes will sit happily for ages. For the pilaf, melt the butter and oil on a medium heat, add the spring onions and chilli flakes, and soften, stirring regularly, for five minutes. Add the bulgur and a generous pinch of salt, stir to coat, then add the stock and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan, leave to simmer for five minutes, then stir thoroughly to make sure nothing\u2019s sticking to the bottom of the pan. Turn down the heat to low, cover and cook for five minutes more. Stir in the lemon juice and parsley, season to taste, then take off the heat and leave to rest for five minutes. Stir the soft herbs into the courgettes. Spoon the pilaf on to warmed plates, top with the courgettes and serve with some seasoned yoghurt, if using. Courgette-stuffed bread These very simple breads can be cooked in a frying pan as well as in the oven, as here \u2013 I usually bake them, though, so I can go and do other things while they\u2019re cooking. Serve with a salad and some chutney to cut through the cheesy goodness. Prep 10 min Steep 1 hr Cook 50 min Serves 4 2 large courgettes, trimmed and coarsely grated (about 380g) 1 large red onion, peeled and finely sliced Sea salt and black pepper About 150g yoghurt 360g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed or finely grated 1 fresh red chilli, deseeded and finely diced (optional) 150g hard cheese, coarsely grated \u2013 whatever suits your tastes and pocket 1 tbsp light olive oil Put the courgettes and onion in a bowl, add a good pinch of salt and toss to combine. Set a colander over another bowl, tip in the courgette mix and press it down to squeeze out some of the liquid. Cover the courgettes with a clean cloth, weigh down with some tins or a heavy pan, then leave to drip away for an hour or so \u2013 this liquid will later be used in the flatbreads. Measure out the liquid in the bowl \u2013 you should have about 100ml or so. Add water to top it up to 200ml, then stir in the yoghurt and set aside. Put the flour in a bowl, make a well in the centre, add most of the courgette liquid and yoghurt mix, and use your hands to work the mix until it comes together into a shaggy dough; if need be, add the rest of the liquid. Turn out on to a lightly floured surface, knead until smooth, divide into four and roll into balls. Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)/450F/gas 8 and put in two large oven trays. Meanwhile, mix the grated courgette mixture with the garlic, chilli and cheese, and season to taste. Using your hands or a rolling pin, roll out one ball on a floured worktop into a 1cm-thick circle and spoon a quarter of the courgette mix into the centre. Gently gather the edges, bring them up and over the filling to cover it completely, then pinch all around to seal very well. Flour the worktop and your hands, then press out each bread into a flat, 2\u00bdcm-deep disc: the top will be thinner than the bottom, so don\u2019t worry if any small holes appear or there is a little seepage. Drizzle some olive oil on to the heated baking sheets and lay two breads on each tray. Drizzle each bread with some more oil and bake for about 25-30 minutes, until golden.

            "title": "Rosie Sykes\u2019 budget recipes with raspberries",
            "date": "2023-06-05T12:00:38Z",
            "content": "Raspberries are a top-drawer summer fruit that are at their best (and cheapest) between June and October. Part of the rose family, they have a fragrant, bittersweet flavour and soft texture, with the crunch of the pips right at the end. (My very clever ice-cream-making friend Kitty Travers even makes a delicious, refreshing summer drink from the pips that she sieves out of her raspberry creations.) They can, of course, be eaten raw with cream, and work well in a multitude of puddings, but they\u2019re also fantastic in baking, because, when cooked, they take on a lovely floral note. Frozen raspberries are good value and readily available all year round, and will work just as well in most recipes. Raspberry oat crumble slice (pictured top) This is one of my most-baked recipes. It\u2019s versatile, too, so you can change the fruit to almost anything you fancy; use gluten-free flour, if need be, and a nut or vegetable oil or a plant-based spread to make it vegan. I like a slice with a cup of tea, or reheated and served warm with cream or custard for a quick pudding; they\u2019re also handy for taking to the park. Prep 5 min Cook 50 min Serves 8-10 180g butter 200g oats 200g flour 150g soft light brown sugar 100g flaked almonds, or any other nut or seed of your choice and/or to suit your budget 250g raspberries Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and melt the butter in a 25cm x 30cm baking tin. Mix the oats, flour and sugar in a bowl, make a well in the centre, then pour in the melted butter and mix until it all comes together. Line the baking tin with greaseproof paper, then press in two-thirds of the oat mixture \u2013 make sure you push it down well, so it holds together like pastry. Bake for about 15 minutes, until golden. In the meantime, mix the almonds into the remaining oat mixture. Once the base is cooked, strew the raspberries over the top, push them down a bit with a fork, then scatter over the remaining oat mixture and spread it out to cover \u2013 it\u2019s OK if the odd raspberry peeps out here and there. Bake for another 20-25 minutes, until the top is golden and the raspberries soft. Remove, transfer the tin to a wire rack and leave to cool. Once it\u2019s completely cold, lift the cake out of the tin and cut into squares \u2013 it will keep in a sealed container for three to four days. Raspberry, lime and coconut poke cake Poke cake, an American invention of the 1960s to promote jello sales, is a brilliant way to combine several flavours. A simple cake is \u201cpoked\u201d with a spoon handle to create holes into which another flavour is poured and eventually infuses the cake. Coconut, raspberry and lime are an especially happy trinity. To make this vegan, replace the milk with a plant-based alternative. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 8 For the cake 120g desiccated coconut, plus 1 tbsp extra for the icing 200ml tinned coconut milk 100ml whole milk (or a plant-based alternative) Juice of \u00bd lime 300g self-raising flour 250g caster sugar 75ml oil For the \u2018poke\u2019 200g raspberries 1 tbsp sugar For the icing Juice and finely grated zest of \u00bd lime 15ml tinned coconut milk 100g icing sugar Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and line a 900g loaf tin or 20cm square or round tin with greaseproof paper. While the oven is heating up, put the extra tablespoon of desiccated coconut for the icing in a small oven dish and toast in the oven \u2013 keep a careful eye on it, though, because it will change colour quite quickly. Once golden, mix the toasted coconut with the grated lime zest and set aside. Shake the coconut milk thoroughly in its tin, measure 200ml into a bowl and whisk in the whole milk and lime juice \u2013 it will thicken slightly. Whisk the flour, 120g desiccated coconut and caster sugar in a large bowl to get rid of any lumps and to introduce some air. Mix the oil into the coconut milk mixture. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, then pour in the wet and fold in to combine \u2013 don\u2019t overmix. Pour the batter into the lined tin and bake for about 45 minutes, until a skewer or toothpick comes out clean. While the cake is cooking, make the raspberry poke: put the raspberries, sugar and a couple tablespoons of water in a small pan, cover and cook until the berries collapse and their consistency is like a runny jam. Take off the heat and leave to cool. When the cake is baked, transfer the tin to a rack and, once it\u2019s cooled, prod it all over with the handle of a wooden spoon so it goes halfway through the cake. Pour the raspberry mix evenly over the cake, spreading it out so it goes into all the holes, then leave to sit until it\u2019s all been absorbed. Meanwhile, make the icing: put 15ml coconut milk and the juice of half a lime in a bowl, whisk until the mixture thickens a little, then stir in the icing sugar bit by bit, until the icing takes on a thick, drizzling consistency. Lift the cooled cake out of its tin, zigzag the icing over the top, so the raspberries are still visible, and finish with a scattering of lime zest and the toasted coconut.

            "content": "Cooked as soon as they are picked and frozen soon after, frozen peas retain all the vegetable\u2019s sweet, fresh flavour. They are very comforting and easy to transform into all sorts: pea soup, for instance, takes mere minutes, while crushed peas with a good dose of butter or olive oil go well with anything from fish fingers to poached eggs, or even stirred through pasta \u2013 the possibilities are endless. Frozen peas are an essential when you\u2019re cooking on a budget, so even if you have just an ice box, make sure you keep a small bag of peas in there at all times. Pea and potato pav bhaji (pictured top) This deliciously spoonable/spreadable curry eaten on bread rolls (pav) is one of Mumbai\u2019s most popular street foods. I was introduced to it by my baker friend, Adam, though this version is simpler than his, mainly to keep costs down. If you can get hold of pav bhaji masala powder, so much the better \u2013 its defining trait is mango powder, for which I\u2019ve substituted lemon zest and juice. Prep 15 min Cook 35 min Serves 4 3 potatoes, peeled and chopped into 3cm cubes Sea salt and black pepper \u00bd tsp ground turmeric 300g frozen peas 35g butter 1 tbsp oil 2 medium onions, peeled and finely diced 1 fresh red chilli 1 red, yellow or green pepper, stalk, pith and seeds discarded, flesh finely diced (or 120g frozen sliced peppers, defrosted and chopped up a bit) 4 tomatoes, chopped into small dice Zest and juice of \u00bd lemon 20g fresh coriander, stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly chopped 1 tbsp garlic and ginger paste 1 tbsp garam masala, or pav bhaji masala A pinch of chilli powder 4 white rolls, split in half Put the potatoes in a pan, pour in enough cold water just to cover, then add a generous dose of salt, some black pepper and the turmeric. Bring to a boil, then simmer until soft \u2013 keep an eye on the water in the pan, because you don\u2019t want it to boil dry; equally, you don\u2019t want to strain off at lot of water at the end. When the potatoes are collapsing, add the peas and, if it\u2019s looking dry, a dash more water, cook for five minutes more, then strain the cooking liquor into a bowl and reserve it. Roughly mash the potatoes and peas. Meanwhile, heat 15g butter and the oil in a second medium-sized pan, then add all but a heaped tablespoon of the onions and some salt. Once they start to sizzle, turn the heat right down, cover and leave to cook for six to eight minutes, to soften. Check on them from time to time: if they are taking on a lot of colour (a little is OK), stir in a splash of water. Once the onions are soft, add the chilli, sliced pepper, tomato, lemon zest and coriander stalks, turn up the heat and cook, stirring regularly, for a few minutes. Once the tomatoes have softened right down, add the ginger and garlic paste, stir for a minute, then stir in three-quarters of a tablespoon of garam masala and cook for a minute or two longer. Add the reserved cooking liquor, then stir in the mash and cook, stirring constantly, until the mix has a loose, spreadable consistency that will smear nicely on bread. Add a few tablespoons of water to loosen, if need be, simmer for a few minutes, so all the flavours intensify, then stir in the lemon juice and season to taste. Leave the curry to sit on a low heat while you melt the remaining butter in a large frying pan. Set aside a third of the melted butter, stir the remaining quarter-tablespoon of garam masala and the chilli powder into the rest, then lay in the bread rolls cut down in the spicy butter, to absorb it, and heat up. Stir the chopped coriander into the curry and pour the reserved melted butter on top. Spoon some curry on to the base of a roll, top with some of the reserved raw onion, coriander, an optional squeeze of lemon and the roll\u2019s lid, then tuck in. Green eggs This is a lovely, soupy, seasonal veg stew that you can add to or subtract from, depending on what you have to hand or on what\u2019s looking good. Frozen peas hold the key to the sweet, light summer vibes, though. You could also use frozen spinach and beans, which make it an economical year-round dish. Prep 10 min Infuse 5 min+ Cook 25 min Serves 4 1 vegetable or chicken stock cube 3 sprigs fresh mint, leaves picked, stalks reserved Sea salt and black pepper 200g greens, finely shredded 4 spring onions, trimmed as little as possible, then finely sliced 300g frozen peas 100g french beans, topped and chopped into 2cm pieces 80g orzo or pastina 80g creme fraiche 1 medium garlic clove, peeled and finely grated or crushed 4 eggs Boil the kettle, then pour 700ml boiling water into a medium casserole dish for which you have a lid and that can fit under the grill. Crumble in the stock cube, throw in the mint stalks, a good pinch of salt and a grind of pepper, then bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the stock cube. Turn off the heat, then leave to infuse for at least five minutes, and ideally up to 30 if you have the time. Lift out and discard the mint stalks, then add the shredded greens and spring onions, bring to a simmer and cook for three minutes. Add the peas, beans and pasta, bring back to a simmer and cook for eight to 10 minutes, until soft. While the vegetables are cooking, finely chop the mint leaves, then stir into the creme fraiche with the garlic and season. Heat the grill to high, or turn on the oven to the highest it can go. One at a time, break the eggs into a small cup, then gently slide each of them into a different corner of the pan. Give the broth around each egg a little stir, so the whites start to set, then cover and simmer for three or so minutes, until the whites are well on their way to being set. Blob some of the creme fraiche mixture on each egg, drop the rest all around the top of the stew, then grill or bake for three or four minutes, until the cream turns golden brown. Serve warm in shallow bowls. Rosie Sykes is a chef and food writer. Her next book, Every Last Bite: 70 Recipes to Save Time, Money and Resources, will be published by Quadrille next year."

            "date": "2023-06-26T12:00:19Z",
            "content": "Short-grain rice is the squat, stubby cousin of the rice family, and it tends to be starchier than its bigger siblings, which means it can clump and stick together, especially when cooked by the absorption method. That makes it great for turning into a crisp stir-fry or rice balls or sushi; the starch also helps if you want to make creamy dishes such as rice pudding and risotto. However you use it, though, short-grain rice is a hugely handy store-cupboard staple because of its sheer versatility, taking you from savoury to sweet. Rice pancakes with stir-fried vegetables and peanut sauce These simple rice pancakes are a great standby supper, not least because you can fill them with whatever you fancy; they also freeze well. The idea is to use the starchy rice-cooking liquid in the pancakes, to give them a slightly glutinous quality. I\u2019ve used a ready-made stir-fry mix, because it works out well economically, but use your own favourite vegetable combination. If you wish, add some chicken, prawns or tofu, too, though that would obviously increase the cost of the dish. Prep 10 min Cool 40 min Cook 45 min Serves 4 For the pancakes Sea salt and black pepper 80g jasmine rice 1 tbsp vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing 125g plain flour For the peanut sauce 80g crunchy peanut butter 1 tbsp garlic and ginger paste 1 tbsp soy sauce \u00bd tbsp sweet or hot chilli sauce, to taste Juice of \u00bd lime (optional) For the stir-fry 2 tbsp vegetable oil 350g mixed stir-fry vegetables 1 small handful coriander To serve Lime wedges 2 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced 1 fresh chilli, finely chopped Bring a pan of salted water to a boil, add the rice, turn down the heat and simmer for 12 minutes. Drain the rice thoroughly, reserving the liquid, return the rice to the pan, leave to steam for three minutes, then set aside to cool down. Meanwhile, make the peanut dressing. Put the peanut butter in a bowl, stir in 30ml boiling water, or enough to loosen it to a stirrable consistency, then mix in the garlic and ginger paste, soy sauce and chilli sauce. Season to taste and squeeze in some lime juice, too, if you like. Once the rice liquid is cold, measure out 225ml (top up with water and/or milk,if need be), then whisk in the vegetable oil. Whisk the flour and a little salt in a bowl, make a well in the centre, pour in the liquid and mix to make a batter. Leave to sit for five minutes. Put a little oil in a medium-sized frying pan on a medium heat, then pour in enough batter to cover the base in a thin layer, a bit like a crepe. Once it\u2019s set underneath, flip it over and cook on the other side, then put on a tray, cover with foil and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining batter. Once all the pancakes are made, put a little vegetable oil in a large frying pan, then tip in the cooked rice and stir-fry on a high heat until it\u2019s crisp and brown in places. Add the vegetables, season generously with salt and stir-fry until wilted and slightly caramelised. Toss through two thirds of the peanut sauce and the chopped coriander. Serve the pancakes and stir-fry with the remaining peanut sauce, lime wedges, spring onions and chilli on the side, as well as any other accoutrements you fancy. I like to cover half a pancake with some of the stir-fry, scatter over some spring onions and chilli, squeeze over some lime and fold over the other half of the pancake. Oven-baked tomato rice with butter beans Cooking short-grain rice in the oven is a breeze. Once you\u2019ve got the hang of the very simple technique, adapt what you put into the mix \u2013 omit the tomatoes, say, and add a bit more stock and an array of other vegetables (peas would be top of my list, incidentally). Serve with a simple salad. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 15 min Serves 4 2 tbsp olive oil 30g butter 1 x 400g tin butter beans 2 medium red onions, peeled and finely diced 15g basil, leaves picked, stalks very finely chopped Sea salt and black pepper 250g cherry tomatoes, cut in half 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced 280g short-grain rice 200g feta \u2013 the good-value stuff is usually sold as \u2018Greek-style salad cheese\u2019 80g black olives Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the oil and butter in an ovenproof pan for which you have a lid and put it in the oven to heat up. Drain the liquid from the butter bean can into a large measuring jug, then add boiling water to bring it up to 840ml. Pour this into a saucepan on a medium heat, and keep it hot. Stir the onion, basil stalks and a good pinch of salt into the hot casserole, cover and return to the oven for 15 minutes, until the onions soften. Stir in the tomatoes, cover again and return to the oven for another 15 minutes, until they, too, soften and release some of their liquid; stir once halfway, to check how they\u2019re getting on and to give them a little mash up to encourage those juices to flow. Stir in the garlic and return to the oven uncovered for three minutes. Stir the rice into the pot, so it\u2019s all well coated in the tomato mixture. Pour in the hot bean liquid, give everything a good stir and return to the oven uncovered for 20 minutes. By this point, the rice should have absorbed two-thirds of the liquid, so add a little more boiling water if there\u2019s less than that left. Stir in the butter beans and return to the oven for 12 minutes, by which time the liquid should have all been absorbed and the rice should be cooked; it\u2019s not meant to be entirely dry, so add some more boiling water if you prefer it wetter. Take out of the oven, stir in the feta and olives, cover the pan with a clean cloth and leave to rest and settle for five minutes. Tear in most of the basil leaves, stir them through the rice, then spoon into warm bowls and serve with the remaining basil scattered on top. Rosie Sykes is a chef and food writer.

            "date": "2023-06-01T01:18:43Z",
            "content": "Federal prosecutors obtained audio recording of a summer 2021 meeting where Donald Trump suggested he should have declassified a military document about Iran he admitted retaining, according to people familiar with the criminal investigation into his retention of national security papers. The recording was made at Trump\u2019s Bedminster golf club in July 2021, when the former president met with people helping his former chief of staff Mark Meadows write a book, by his aide Margo Martin who regularly taped conversations with authors to ensure they accurately recounted his remarks. For several minutes of the audio recording, the sources said, Trump talks about how he cannot discuss the document because he no longer possesses the sweeping presidential power to declassify now out of office, but suggests that he should have done so when he was still in the White House. The previously unreported suggestion that he should have declassified the document presents a potentially perilous moment for Trump, as it indicates he knew he had retained material that was sensitive to national security \u2013 as well as the limitations about discussing it. CNN earlier reported that prosecutors had the recording. The exact nature of the document Trump was referring to in the recording is unclear, though Trump\u2019s lawyers believe a document classified at the \u201cSecret\u201d level, which referenced military action concerning Iran, had been returned to the National Archives months later, according to a person briefed on the matter. Prosecutors in the office of special counsel Jack Smith appear to have obtained the recording around March, as the criminal investigation targeting Trump intensified and numerous Trump aides were subpoenaed to testify before the federal grand jury hearing evidence in the case in Washington. The tape was played to multiple witnesses, including Martin, when she testified in mid-March after having her laptop and phones imaged by prosecutors, the sources said. The first time the Trump lawyers learned about the tape was after Martin testified, one of the sources said. In his book titled A Chief\u2019s Chief, Meadows recounts how Trump once recalled a four-page report produced by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley that contained his plan to attack Iran, though it is unclear if that was the same meeting attended by his writers. But the July 2021 meeting that was recorded came shortly after Trump was incensed about news reports that Milley had urged him not to attack Iran in the final weeks of his presidency. Trump believed that the document outlining the report to attack Iran would undercut Milley\u2019s reported assertions, though the report was actually written earlier in the Trump administration when Joseph Dunford was chairman of the joint chiefs, a person familiar with the document said. A Trump spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cLeaks from radical partisans behind this political persecution are designed to inflame tensions and continue the media\u2019s harassment of President Trump and his supporters. It\u2019s just more proof that when it comes to President Trump, there are absolutely no depths to which they will not sink as they pursue their witch hunts.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-27T02:15:38Z",
            "content": "An audio clip has emerged of Donald Trump discussing secret documents that he had not declassified at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club in July 2021, providing new evidence that the former president knew of proper declassification procedures. The recording, obtained by CNN, includes new details from a conversation that is a critical piece of evidence in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment of Trump over the mishandling of classified information. It includes a moment when Trump seems to indicate he was holding a secret Pentagon document with plans to attack Iran. The episode is one of two referenced in the indictment where prosecutors allege that Trump showed classified information to others who did not have security clearances, CNN reported. In the conversation, Trump is talking with people helping his former chief of staff Mark Meadows write a book. His aide, Margo Martin, regularly taped conversations with authors to ensure they accurately recounted his remarks. According to the recording aired on CNN, Trump refers to the document and its classified status. \u201cThese are the papers,\u201d Trump says in the audio recording, while he\u2019s discussing the Pentagon attack plans, a quote that was not included in the indictment. \u201cThis was done by the military and given to me,\u201d Trump continues, before noting that the document remained classified. \u201cSee as president I could have declassified it,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I can\u2019t, you know, but this is still a secret.\u201d Trump and his aides also joked about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cHillary would print that out all the time, you know. Her private emails,\u201d Trump\u2019s staffer said. \u201cNo, she\u2019d send it to Anthony Weiner,\u201d Trump responded, referring to the former Democratic congressman, prompting laughter in the room. The audio recording obtained by CNN included more lines from the conversation: Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s so cool. I mean, it\u2019s so, look, her and I, and you probably almost didn\u2019t believe me, but now you believe me.\u201d Writer: \u201cNo, I believed you.\u201d Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, right?\u201d Writer: \u201cNo, they never met a war they didn\u2019t want.\u201d Trump: \u201cHey, bring some, uh, bring some Cokes in please.\u201d The July 2021 meeting that was recorded came shortly after Trump was incensed about news reports that Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had urged him not to attack Iran in the final weeks of his presidency. Trump believed that the document outlining the report to attack Iran would undercut Milley\u2019s reported assertions, though the report was actually written earlier in the Trump administration when Joseph Dunford was chairman of the joint chiefs, a person familiar with the document said. Trump pleaded not guilty earlier this month to 37 counts related to the alleged mishandling of classified documents kept at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

            "title": "Putin sides with military chiefs over placing Wagner under direct control",
            "date": "2023-06-14T17:29:59Z",
            "content": "After a destructive feud between his top military chiefs and the mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, Vladimir Putin has appeared to side with his top brass, calling for Russia\u2019s \u201cvolunteer detachments\u201d fighting in Ukraine to be placed under the direct control of the defence ministry. The decision severely undermines Prigozhin, who has turned Wagner\u2019s role in the capture of Bakhmut into an outsized public profile in Russia that he uses to berate Putin\u2019s generals and promote himself. Speaking to a group of pro-war bloggers on Tuesday, the Russian president said he welcomed the defence minister Sergei Shoigu\u2019s initiative to force mercenary groups to sign contracts with the ministry \u2013 an order Prigozhin has refused to follow. \u201cThis has to be done and it has to be done as quickly as possible,\u201d Putin said of the military contracts, saying it was \u201cin line with common sense, with established practice and the law\u201d. Earlier, Shoigu had ordered all volunteer detachments to sign contracts with his ministry by the end of the month, a step seen as an attempt to rein in Prigozhin by integrating Wagner into the army. \u201cWagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,\u201d Prigozhin said in response, criticising Shoigu for failing to \u201cproperly manage military formations\u201d. When asked to comment on Putin\u2019s statements on Wednesday, a defiant Prigozhin doubled down. \u201cWhen we started participating in this war, no one said that we would be obliged to conclude agreements with the Ministry of Defence,\u201d he said in a rare direct rebuke of the president. \u201cNone of the Wagner fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again. And so no one will sign contracts,\u201d he said, adding that he believed the Russian president would find a \u201ccompromise\u201d for Wagner. The feud between Prigozhin and the military reached new heights this month when a Russian commander accused Wagner of kidnapping and torturing his soldiers. Putin\u2019s intervention is seen as a big boost for Shoigu, a longtime ally of the president who has faced political pressure for Moscow\u2019s faltering efforts in Ukraine. It has also put Prigozhin in his most precarious position since the invasion began. \u201cShoigu has Prigozhin in more or less a checkmate. If Wagner does not sign a [defence ministry] contract in a few weeks, the state could have grounds to stop supporting Wagner, or even make legal moves against them,\u201d said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation. Some analysts suggested that Putin probably made the decision to limit Wagner\u2019s influence in Ukraine months earlier. \u201cThe decision was made in January, but they were waiting for Wagner to take Bakhmut,\u201d said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of the political analysis firm R Politik. \u201cIt was decided that at least on Ukraine\u2019s territory, everyone should be subjugated to the general staff.\u201d Prigozhin announced earlier this month that his troops had largely pulled back from Bakhmut, most of which they captured after taking heavy casualties. Prigozhin\u2019s exclusion from Ukraine would sideline one of Russia\u2019s most recognisable war figures. Through the daily use of social media, he has cultivated a populist, anti-elite persona that has resonated with Russians unhappy with the foundering invasion. The warlord\u2019s public standing peaked as his troops gradually captured Bakhmut, delivering Moscow its first tangible military victory since last summer. \u201cPrigozhin understands that his publicity is his protection,\u201d said a former defence official who worked with him. \u201cHe has no official status, but he knows that Putin prefers stability and wouldn\u2019t want to cause chaos by letting others go after such a public figure.\u201d With his troubles mounting, Prigozhin embarked on a publicity tour across Russia, addressing audiences alongside hardliners such as the ex-arms dealer Viktor Bout. Questions remain about whether he can maintain his standing through a publicity tour alone. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it will have the same effect as his battle for Bakhmut,\u201d said Stanovaya. \u201cPrigozhin is pushed into a corner a bit and is trying to figure out how to realise his goals.\u201d The mercenary boss has continued his public attacks against Russia\u2019s military leadership. Speaking in the central Ulyanovsk region on Tuesday, he directly contradicted Putin, who claimed earlier that day that Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive had failed on all fronts. \u201cThey [Ukraine] are fighting correctly,\u201d Prigozhin said, claiming that Moscow was not doing enough to \u201ccounter the adversary\u201d. Still, some believe it is too soon to speculate about Prigozhin\u2019s downfall. \u201cPeople have wrongly written off Prigozhin many times,\u201d said the former defence official. \u201cShoigu currently has the upper hand, but if Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive fails, Prigozhin will likely be called upon again,\u201d they added, saying that Putin traditionally played off different factions against one another. The former official also noted that Putin hinted on Tuesday that some of Prigozhin\u2019s criticism of the military was justified. \u201cAt the start of the special military operation, we quickly realised that the \u2018carpet generals\u2019 [\u2026] are not effective, to put it mildly,\u201d Putin said. \u201cPeople started to come out of the shadows who we hadn\u2019t heard or seen before, and they turned out to be very effective and made themselves useful.\u201d Prigozhin\u2019s future could depend on the success or failure of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive, Stanovaya argued. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for them to see that without his abilities and skills, the Russian army will lose territory and Putin or Shoigu will come to him for help \u2026 He dreams about that.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-19T14:30:50Z",
            "content": "Ireland\u2019s president has rebuked the government for launching a debate about the country\u2019s longstanding military neutrality and the possibility of joining Nato, saying ministers were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d. Michael D Higgins accused the government of a dangerous \u201cdrift\u201d from a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy and said it risked \u201cburying\u201d Ireland in other people\u2019s agendas. The intervention, made in an interview with the Business Post newspaper on Sunday, puts a spotlight on a government-sponsored forum on international security, where Ireland\u2019s neutrality will be debated. It also raises questions on the role of the president, who occupies a largely ceremonial post. On Monday, Higgins apologised for a \u201cthrowaway remark\u201d in the interview about the forum\u2019s independent chair, Louise Richardson, who he said had \u201ca very large DBE \u2013 Dame of the British Empire\u201d \u2013 implying that she was biased towards the UK. He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s grand but, you know, I think there were a few candidates I could have come up with myself.\u201d Richardson, an Irish academic and counter-terrorism expert, is a former vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford who sits on the boards of the Booker Prize Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation philanthropic foundation. Several politicians had called the president\u2019s comments unfair. In a statement, his office said: \u201cHe apologises for any offence which he may have inadvertently caused to Prof Richardson by what was a throwaway remark.\u201d However, the president did not recant other views expressed in the interview, which sharpened the debate about Ireland\u2019s military neutrality in the era of Russian aggression under Vladimir Putin. The arrival of Ukrainian refugees, incursions by Russian ships that are suspected of mapping underwater cables and a 2021 ransomware attack by suspected Russian gangs on the health service have raised questions about Ireland\u2019s meagre security resources. The justice minister, Helen McEntee, defended holding the forum. \u201cThe president himself knows what the boundaries are here, and he expressed his views. Many would agree with him, there are many who would disagree, and that\u2019s why we need to have this forum,\u201d she told the Newstalk radio network. Neale Richmond, the junior enterprise minister, said the president had sailed \u201cclose to the line\u201d. Ireland has joined UN peacekeeping missions but shunned military alliances and invested little in defence compared with other countries. Critics accuse it of saving money and claiming the moral high ground while sheltering beneath a Nato umbrella. Miche\u00e1l Martin, the deputy prime minister, said the government did not intend to abandon military neutrality but that the forum would explore evolving security needs. Ireland has previously convened citizens\u2019 assemblies to debate constitutional changes such as ending an abortion ban. The upcoming consultative forum involves experts, academics and service personnel as well as citizens. They will meet on 22-27 June in Cork, Galway and Dublin. Anxiety about Russia prompted Finland to become Nato\u2019s 31st member in April. Sweden also abandoned decades of non-alignment this year but objections from Turkey and Hungary have delayed it joining Nato."

            "date": "2023-06-23T19:32:33Z",
            "content": "Russia\u2019s FSB security service has opened a criminal case for armed mutiny against Wagner\u2019s Yevgeny Prigozhin after the mercenary chief accused the Russian military of targeting his forces and vowed to \u201cdestroy\u201d his rivals. In an extraordinary series of audio clips released late on Friday, Prigozhin claimed that a Russian rocket attack had killed scores of his fighters, vowing to take \u201crevenge\u201d and \u201cstop the evil brought by the military leadership of the country\u201d. \u201cThose who destroyed today our guys, who destroyed tens, tens of thousands of lives of Russian soldiers will be punished. I\u2019m asking: no one resist,\u201d Prigozhin said. Prigozhin also published a video, which he claims shows the aftermath of the rocket attack on a Wagner camp in Russia\u2019s southern Rostov region. In a virtual declaration of war against his rivals in the Russian military, Prigozhin said he controlled 25,000 fighters and that together \u201cwe are going to figure out why the chaos is happening in the country\u201d. \u201cAnyone who wants should join. We need to end this mess,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone who will try to resist, we will consider them a danger and destroy them immediately, including any checkpoints on our way. And any aviation that we see above our heads,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m asking everyone to remain calm, do not succumb to provocations, and remain in their houses. Ideally, those along our way, do not go outside. After we finished what we started, we will return to the frontline to protect our motherland,\u201d Prigozhin said. The FSB said that Prigozhin\u2019s statements and actions constituted \u201ccalls for the start of an armed civil conflict on the territory of the Russian Federation\u201d. Russian state news agency Tass, citing law enforcement agencies, reported that security measures have been strengthened in Moscow, with critical facilities taken under increased protection. Unconfirmed footage also appeared to show military vehicles on the streets of the Russian capital. Amid rumours that columns of Wagner fighters were already on the move, General Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Ukraine campaign, released a video address ordering the mercenaries to remain loyal to Putin. \u201cI urge you to stop,\u201d said Surovikin, who was previously understood to be close to Prigozhin. \u201cThe enemy is just waiting for the internal political situation to worsen in our country.\u201d Early on Saturday, State-run Channel 1 broke into regular programming for a special news bulletin in which the country\u2019s best-known news anchor, Yekaterina Andreyeva, denied Prigozhin\u2019s claims of a Russian military attack against his fighters and repeated the FSB statement. The string of statements marked an unprecedented escalation of infighting among Russia\u2019s elite, which has pitted Prigozhin against defence minister Sergei Shoigu and senior military commanders. The FSB urged Wagner fighters \u201cnot to make irreparable mistakes, to stop any forceful actions against the Russian people, not to carry out the criminal and treacherous orders of Prigozhin, and to take measures to detain him\u201d. In a separate statement, prosecutors said that Prigozhin could face between 12 and 20 years in prison. Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the Russian president was \u201caware of the situation unfolding around Prigozhin\u201d. \u201cAll necessary measures are being taken,\u201d Russian state media quoted Peskov saying. Early on Saturday, Prigozhin released another voice message in which he claimed without offering any evidence that his forces had left Ukraine and were entering the southern Russian city of Rostov. \u201cRight now we have crossed all the border points... The border guards greeted us and hugged our fighters. Now we are entering Rostov,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone gets in our way, we will destroy everything... We extend our hand to everyone. We move forward, we are going all the way!\u201d According to several Telegram channels linked to security services, emergency protocols were earlier implemented in the city, involving the full mobilisation of the local security services. Pictures published by local media showed armoured vehicles appearing on the streets of the city. Baza, a Telegram channel linked to Russian security services, reported that helicopters were seen flying over Rostov. It was not immediately clear what Prigozhin\u2019s objectives were and whether his threats were directed at the Kremlin. \u201cThis is not a military coup, this is a march of justice. Our actions do not hinder the armed forces in any way,\u201d the Wagner chief said, adding that the \u201cmajority of soldiers\u201d were on his side. The warlord has been arguing with top military officials for months, singling out Shoigu, over battlefield failures. Earlier in the day, Prigozhin accused Moscow\u2019s leadership of lying to the public about the justifications for invading Ukraine, denying Moscow\u2019s claims that Kyiv was planning to launch an offensive on the Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine in February 2022. \u201cThe ministry of defence is trying to deceive the public and the president and spin the story that there was insane levels of aggression from the Ukrainian side and that they were going to attack us together with the whole Nato block,\u201d the Wagner head said. Prigozhin also said Russia\u2019s leadership could have avoided the war by negotiating with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Prigozhin\u2019s tirades on Friday marked a new escalation of his war of words with political rivals, directly contradicting Putin\u2019s rationale for the invasion, and implying it was based on lies in the harshest criticism by any prominent Russian war figure of the decision to attack Ukraine. \u201cWhat was the war for? The war needed for Shoigu to receive a hero star \u2026 The oligarchic clan that rules Russia needed the war,\u201d he said. While the warlord was careful not to directly attack the Russian president, Prigozhin did question several decisions made by Putin, including the Kremlin\u2019s decision to exchange more than 100 captured Azov fighters for Viktor Medvedchuk, a close ally of Putin. Prigozhin also accused the Russian military leadership of lying to the public about the scale of its losses and setbacks in Ukraine. \u201cThe Russian army is retreating in all directions and shedding a lot of blood \u2026 What they tell us is the deepest deception.\u201d Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of the political analysis firm R Politik, said that after months of testing the boundaries of his power, Prigozhin appeared to have reached a limit. \u201cThe termination of Prigozhin and Wagner is imminent. The only possibility now is absolute obliteration, with the degree of resistance from the Wagner group being the only variable,\u201d she wrote on Telegram. She added that while there was no immediate sign that Vladimir Putin\u2019s hold on power was under threat, the dramatic episode will likely damage his standing. \u201cMany within the elite will now personally fault Putin for letting the situation escalate to such extremes and for his lack of a timely adequate response.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-30T11:24:20Z",
            "content": "Russia is reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence directorate (GUR) has claimed, with staff told to relocate to Crimea and military patrols scaled back. The agency\u2019s chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has alleged Moscow has approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four out of six power units, as well as a cooling pond. Last week Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was plotting a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d. According to the GUR, several representatives of Russia\u2019s state nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, have already left. Ukrainian employees who stayed at the plant and signed contracts with Rosatom had been told to evacuate by Monday, preferably to Crimea, it said. The intelligence agency named three senior individuals \u2013 the plant\u2019s chief inspector, the head of the legal department and the deputy in charge of supplies \u2013 who had already departed. It said the number of Russian soldiers at the station and in the nearby town of Enerhodar had been reduced. Since seizing the plant last year, the Russian army has turned it into a military base. It moved hardware into the turbine halls, including armoured vehicles and ammunition. Soldiers used the territory to bombard Ukrainian towns across the Dnipro reservoir. This has mostly dried up after the Kakhovka dam downstream was blown up this month. Western governments and Kyiv say Russia deliberately sabotaged the dam to impede Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive. Former plant workers told the Guardian it would be difficult to damage the reactors, which were protected by thick steel and concrete. But they said the small cooling pond \u2013 which the Russians have allegedly mined \u2013 was more vulnerable, as was a dry storage area used for spent nuclear fuel. An explosion in the cooling pond could lead to a partial nuclear meltdown similar to the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the US state of Pennsylvania, Oleksiy Kovynyev, a former senior engineer, said. In this scenario, most radiation would be contained. But he added: \u201cOf course, if you are an absolute maniac and open the ventilation channels this would throw out radiation.\u201d Kovynyev said the dry storage area at the plant contained 24 spent \u201cfuel assemblies\u201d, sealed in 120 \u201chermetic\u201d steel casks. \u201cIn a normal situation, they are absolutely safe. If you wanted, you could destroy them. You could shell several times. This could cause a nuclear accident with radiation release.\u201d He said he remained optimistic no disaster would take place. Before the full-scale invasion, the plant employed 11,500 workers. An estimated 2,500 remain. Some, including the plant\u2019s Ukrainian director, have signed contracts with Rosatom. Others have refused and have had their security passes revoked. Staff currently receive salaries from both Russia and Ukraine. The GUR said on Friday that personnel remaining at the station had been instructed to \u201cblame Ukraine in case of any emergencies\u201d. Russia has claimed Kyiv has endangered the station by shelling it. Ukraine has urged the international community to pay attention to the situation at the plant and to put pressure on Moscow to step back from the brink. Officials point out that Zelenskiy warned last year the Kremlin was preparing to blow up the Kakhovka dam \u2013 something that happened seven months later. The chief rabbi of Ukraine, Moshe Azman, warned the \u201centire world community\u201d to do everything in its power to stop a possible catastrophe. This week Russia told the UN security council it had no plans to blow up the plant. It previously assured the council it would not invade Ukraine."

            "date": "2023-06-22T15:32:26Z",
            "content": "A legal challenge against the government\u2019s decision to build the Sizewell C nuclear power plant has been rejected. The campaign group Together Against Sizewell C (Tasc) had launched a judicial review against the government\u2019s decision to give the green light to the 3.2 gigawatt plant on the Suffolk coast, which is being built by French energy company EDF. The group said the government had failed to consider alternatives to nuclear power to meet its emissions targets when approving the project. It cited the threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water-stressed, the threats to coastal areas from the climate crisis, and environmental damage. Mr Justice Holgate rejected the group\u2019s challenge against the secretary of state for energy security and net zero in a written ruling at the high court on Thursday. Holgate ruled the government\u2019s decision was in keeping with energy policy intended to achieve \u201cdiversity of methods of generation and security of supply\u201d. He said the judicial review was an attempt to \u201crewrite the government\u2019s policy aims by pretending that the central policy objective is \u2026 to produce clean energy, without any regard to diversity of energy sources and security of supply\u201d. Tasc said it would continue its campaign and was examining options for how to do so. Sizewell got the go-ahead from government last year, when the then business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, overruled a verdict from the independent Planning Inspectorate. The planning body had said that \u201cunless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out\u201d. Kwarteng\u2019s decision to override these concerns came against the backdrop of plans to approve one new nuclear reactor a year, under an energy strategy drawn up under the former prime minister Boris Johnson. The strategy envisaged the UK sourcing up to 25% of its projected energy demand from nuclear by 2050. The Tasc chair, Jenny Kirtley, said: \u201cNaturally, Tasc is disappointed, but this verdict does not signal the end of our efforts. Together with our lawyers we are examining all possible options open to us and can promise our supporters that in one form or another, this campaign will continue. \u201cThe Suffolk Heritage Coast cannot be sacrificed for such an unnecessary and inappropriate development, and we will examine every avenue of opposition until all are exhausted.\u201d Sue Ferns, a senior deputy general secretary of the trade union Prospect, said the ruling \u201cremoves one of the blocks\u201d to getting Sizewell C started. \u201cNuclear must play an important role in our energy mix as we race to net zero. We now need to get on with building Sizewell C, and secure the jobs, economic benefits and clean reliable energy it will bring.\u201d A spokesperson for EDF\u2019s Sizewell C project said the judgment \u201cdismisses the challenge and underlines the confidence the people of east Suffolk can take in our plans for Sizewell C. \u201cWhile the project has strong local support, we will continue to listen to the views of all east Suffolk residents as we have done for more than a decade. We are as determined as ever that this project will deliver as much long-term benefit as possible to the local area. \u201cWork at our site will continue to prepare for full construction, which will unlock major benefits for Suffolk and the rest of Britain. As well as creating huge numbers of jobs, apprenticeships and investment, the project will lower energy costs for consumers and build a stronger homegrown low carbon electricity system.\u201d"

            "title": "AI poses national security threat, warns terror watchdog",
            "date": "2023-06-04T06:00:05Z",
            "content": "The creators of artificial intelligence need to abandon their \u201ctech utopian\u201d mindset, according to the terror watchdog, amid fears that the new technology could be used to groom vulnerable individuals. Jonathan Hall KC, whose role is to review the adequacy of terrorism legislation, said the national security threat from AI was becoming ever more apparent and the technology needed to be designed with the intentions of terrorists firmly in mind. He said too much AI development focused on the potential positives of the technology while neglecting to consider how terrorists might use it to carry out attacks. \u201cThey need to have some horrible little 15-year-old neo-Nazi in the room with them, working out what they might do. You\u2019ve got to hardwire the defences against what you know people will do with it,\u201d said Hall. The government\u2019s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation admitted he was increasingly concerned by the scope for artificial intelligence chatbots to persuade vulnerable or neurodivergent individuals to launch terrorist attacks. \u201cWhat worries me is the suggestibility of humans when immersed in this world and the computer is off the hook. Use of language, in the context of national security, matters because ultimately language persuades people to do things.\u201d The security services are understood to be particularly concerned with the ability of AI chatbots to groom children, who are already a growing part of MI5\u2019s terror caseload. As calls grow for regulation of the technology following warnings last week from AI pioneers that it could threaten the survival of the human race, it is expected that the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will raise the issue when he travels to the US on Wednesday to meet President Biden and senior congressional figures. Back in the UK, efforts are intensifying to confront national security challenges posed by AI with a partnership between MI5 and the Alan Turing Institute, the national body for data science and artificial intelligence, leading the way. Alexander Blanchard, a digital ethics research fellow in the institute\u2019s defence and security programme, said its work with the security services indicated the UK was treating the security challenges presented by AI extremely seriously. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of a willingness among defence and security policy makers to understand what\u2019s going on, how actors could be using AI, what the threats are. \u201cThere really is a sense of a need to keep abreast of what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s work on understanding what the risks are, what the long-term risks are [and] what the risks are for next-generation technology.\u201d Last week, Sunak said that Britain wanted to become a global centre for AI and its regulation, insisting it could deliver \u201cmassive benefits to the economy and society\u201d. Both Blanchard and Hall say the central issue is how humans retain \u201ccognitive autonomy\u201d \u2013 control \u2013 over AI and how this control is built into the technology. The potential for vulnerable individuals alone in their bedrooms to be quickly groomed by AI is increasingly evident, says Hall. On Friday, Matthew King, 19, was jailed for life for plotting a terror attack, with experts noting the speed at which he had been radicalised after watching extremist material online. Hall said tech companies need to learn from the errors of past complacency \u2013 social media has been a key platform for exchanging terrorist content in the past. Greater transparency from the firms behind AI technology was also needed, Hall added, primarily around how many staff and moderators they employed. \u201cWe need absolute clarity about how many people are working on these things and their moderation,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many are actually involved when they say they\u2019ve got guardrails in place? Who is checking the guardrails? If you\u2019ve got a two-man company, how much time are they devoting to public safety? Probably little or nothing.\u201d New laws to tackle the terrorism threat from AI might also be required, said Hall, to curb the growing danger of lethal autonomous weapons \u2013 devices that use AI to select their targets. Hall said: \u201cYou\u2019re talking about [This is] a type of terrorist who wants deniability, who wants to be able to \u2018fly and forget\u2019. They can literally throw a drone into the air and drive away. No one knows what its artificial intelligence is going to decide. It might just dive-bomb a crowd, for example. Do our criminal laws capture that sort of behaviour? Generally terrorism is about intent; intent by human rather than intent by machine.\u201d Lethal autonomous weaponry \u2013 or \u201cloitering munitions\u201d \u2013 have already been seen on the battlefields of Ukraine, raising morality questions over the implications of the airborne autonomous killing machine. \u201cAI can learn and adapt, interacting with the environment and upgrading its behaviour,\u201d Blanchard said."

            "date": "2023-06-14T08:00:08Z",
            "content": "EU plans to restore biodiversity on land and sea are hanging in the balance after the European parliament\u2019s biggest political group called for the proposals to be torn up and rewritten. On the eve of a vote on the nature restoration law (NRL) package, the chairman of the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP) said the vote was \u201c50-50\u201d with potential for others to join their opposition ranks on Thursday. On Wednesday evening the chair of the environment committee, Pascal Canfin, urged members to vote for the act accusing the EPP of \u201cfake news\u201d over food production. \u201cOur food security depends on protecting nature from collapsing. Yet, the right and the far right are joining forces against the nature restoration law that we\u2019re voting on Thursday. My answers to their fake news,\u201d he said. The proposals are aimed at protecting all endangered ecosystems ranging from rivers and seas to peat bogs and indigenous forests by 2050 through legally binding targets. The UN environment chief Inger Andersen urged MEPs to show leadership for future generations ahead of the vote and deliver on the promises the union made at Cop15 just 6 months ago. She condemned those that had turned restoring biodiversity into a culture war issue. EPP chairman Manfred Weber said his group of MPs supported goals on climate change but said the NRL was \u201ca bad proposal\u201d, which would reduce food production on the continent. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of farmers don\u2019t need any lesson about sustainability, they got their farms from previous generations so they know what sustainability means,\u201d he said. Irish Green party MEP Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe, who is stewarding parallel proposals on renovation of energy inefficient buildings through parliament, said he worried about a potential deeper EPP resistance on climate emergency measures. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that the EPP\u2019s commitment to climate and biodiversity is lukewarm. We have been told they have a kill list of laws they don\u2019t want to see passed. The climate and biodiversity crises have not gone away and if anything we need to step up efforts in the face of foreseen newspaper headlines about extreme temperatures and warming,\u201d he said. While Weber claimed the proposals would harm Europe\u2019s food production by sequestering land for rewilding and other projects, Cuffe said the 12-volume, 5,689-page impact assessment put the economic benefits of restoring nature at \u20ac180bn (\u00a3154bn) compared with the cost of the measures which have been put at \u20ac154bn. The World Wildlife Fund has also argued, along with the Greens, that increasing biodiversity including bees and other pollinators actually improves food production. German MEP Peter Liese, the environment spokesperson for the EPP, said on Wednesday the votes were now split 42:42 of the 84 strong committee with EPP representing 22 of those. \u201cWe have four undecided votes, it will be very tight,\u201d he said. He said one of the main concerns is that the European commission has not set in stone of definition of \u201cdegraded\u201d land or rivers. Under its present guise, it could require 25,000 kilometres of European rivers to be restored to wilderness, he said, impacting the development and existing hydro-electric plants. \u201cThe problem with the impact assessment report is that it was written before the outbreak of war,\u201d said Liese. On Monday, CEOs from 50 companies including Ikea, Nestle and H&amp;M published an open letter voicing their support for the law, warning protecting nature was key to a well-functioning economy. Andersen, the executive director of the UN environment programme, told the Guardian it was critical that the EU delivered on the promises it had made to the world on nature. \u201cTalk is easy. You have to follow through. I think if if the EU does not follow through with the targets that it has in the nature restoration law, it sends a detrimental signal to the global commitment to protect biodiversity and to the tears that we shared that night at 4am in Montreal. It would negate it all. \u201cThere\u2019s a real to do item here: for those folks that sit in the EU parliament to do the right thing by the next generation,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can nature become a culture wars issue? To me, it is absurd. Nature is what feeds us and sustains us. It\u2019s everything.\u201d Last month, EU environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius warned abandoning the law would send \u201ca dangerous, negative signal to the world\u201d. Alongside separate proposals to reduce pesticide use and climate laws, the NRL is part of the European Green Deal. Weber told reporters in Strasbourg: \u201cWe will not achieve our climate change goals, our goals on biodiversity [if we go] against the rural areas,\u201d he said. Under the proposals, 88 MEPs on the committee leading the passage of the act, will be asked to vote on a version of the European Commission\u2019s proposed laws which has been slightly watered down to try to secure the agreement of the European parliament. They will be asked to support measures to \u201cput in place, without delay, effective and area-based restoration measures which shall collectively cover, by 2030, at least 30% of the union\u2019s land, freshwater and sea areas in need of restoration\u201d. But Weber indicated his group would not be budging. \u201cWe have a lot of concerns which cannot be fixed with this concrete proposal. That\u2019s why we asked for a restart, for a new proposal from the European Commission.\u201d The EPP has already walked out of negotiations on the NRL and is hoping others will join them in opposition to the legislation during the vote on Thursday."

            "date": "2023-06-06T10:14:30Z",
            "content": "The collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam and the draining of the reservoir behind it does not pose an immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant further upstream, but will have long-term implications for its future, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. The Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, put out a statement on the Telegram social media platform saying the situation at the plant, the biggest nuclear power station in Europe, was \u201cunder control\u201d. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, said in a statement: \u201cour current assessment is that there is no immediate risk to the safety of the plant.\u201d But there are long-term concerns, both over safety and the possibility of the plant becoming operational again in the coming years. Oleksiy, a former reactor operator and shift supervisor at the plant, pointed out that all six reactors had been shut down since the plant found itself on the frontline after the Russian invasion. Five of the reactors are in \u201ccold shutdown\u201d, turned off completely and being cooled, and one is in \u201chot shutdown\u201d, kept at 200-250C so it would be easier to restart if conditions allowed, and to supply winter heating to the neighbouring town of Energodar. Oleksiy, who left after Russian forces occupied the plant in March last year and is now elsewhere in Ukraine, said the last reactor should be shut down and that the plant had sufficient resources to keep all reactor cores cool. \u201cI think that the damage of the dam doesn\u2019t impact the plant immediately, because they are being cooled by the safety systems located at the plant, which are spray systems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe plant has a cooling lake, about two or three kilometres in diameter.\u201d The Energoatom statement said the cooling lake was filled and was at 16.6 metres (54.5ft), \u201cwhich is sufficient for the power plant\u2019s needs\u201d. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian nuclear scientist, said: \u201cThe fact that there\u2019s an artificial pond next to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant] where water can be maintained above the reservoir level, and the fact that the reactors are in cold shutdown, offers some reassurance and increased time to respond if ZNPP starts getting affected.\u201d But Budjeryn, who is a senior research associate on the project on managing the atom at Harvard University, added: \u201cThe bigger problem \u2013 who is going to do it? ZNPP is already down-staffed to bare bones.\u201d Oleksiy said that over time water would evaporate from the cooling lake and if it could not be filled from the vast reservoir created upstream of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the turbines and the power plant could not be operated. In his statement, Grossi said that the cooling pond should last \u201cfor some months\u201d but it was imperative it was not damaged in fighting. The water is used to cool not just the reactor cores, but also the spent fuel and the diesel generators used for safety systems. \u201cAbsence of cooling water in the essential cooling water systems for an extended period of time would cause fuel melt and inoperability of the emergency diesel generators,\u201d he warned. Budjeryn pointed to another implication of the dam collapse regarding the future of the Russian occupied nuclear plant, which Russian occupying forces have allegedly mined. \u201cIf the Russians would do this with Kakhovka, there\u2019s no guarantee they won\u2019t blow up the reactor units at ZNPP that are also reportedly mined \u2013 three of the six,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t cause a Chornobyl, but massive disruption, local contamination and long-term damage to Ukraine.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-09T07:00:53Z",
            "content": "On Wednesday, the governor of Missouri, Mike Parson, signed legislation to restrict gender-affirming care for minors, becoming the 20th US state in a nationwide wave targeting transgender healthcare. To promote their legislation, Republican politicians have turned to a handful of controversial doctors, all of whom have ties to rightwing groups and little experience treating transgender patients. Every major medical association in the country has come out against such bans, stating that gender-affirming care should be available to those who need it, including minors. Drawing on existing reporting and investigations, as well as legislative and legal testimony, the Guardian identified a number of physicians who were repeatedly enlisted to craft and promote policies to limit youth access to gender-affirming care. Of the four doctors profiled below, all are serving as experts in lawsuits currently moving through the courts, including in Alabama and Arkansas, where advocates are challenging laws banning youth access to gender-affirming care. These doctors have collectively testified in dozens of lawsuits related to trans rights. All of these doctors have connections to organizations that oppose gender transition on religious or moral grounds. Experts say their views have contributed to the growing opposition across the US to youth access to such care, despite the medical consensus about its safety and efficacy. According to Heron Greenesmith, a senior research analyst at Political Research Associates who monitors anti-LGBTQ+ advocacy, these experts and the groups they are associated with have \u201cabsolutely contributed to the mis- and disinformation machine around gender-affirming care\u201d. Meanwhile, efforts to limit access to transition are being extended to adults. Last year, Florida\u2019s agency for health care administration implemented a healthcare regulation barring Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care for people of any age; that rule is being challenged in court. All of the doctors profiled here have played a role in crafting the policy or defending it. Dr Patrick W Lappert A plastic surgeon who teamed up with the Christian legal movement Patrick W Lappert has testified in litigation or advocated on behalf of legislation to limit trans rights in states across the country including Alabama, Arkansas, Utah and Florida. Lappert is a plastic surgeon who provides Botox and other cosmetic procedures at his office in an Alabama strip mall. In a 2022 deposition, he told the court that besides providing minor cosmetic procedures to trans patients, including laser hair surgery, he has never treated someone seeking gender-affirming care. During the deposition, he opined that identifying as transgender constitutes a kind of \u201cdelusional thinking\u201d and that pursuing virtually any aspect of medical transition, including taking hormones or hormone blockers, is a \u201cform of mutilation\u201d. He has publicly castigated physicians who do provide gender-affirming care, stating in a 2019 Catholic podcast that \u201cthe idea that you can change someone\u2019s sex is a lie\u201d and that providing gender-affirming surgeries is \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d on moral grounds. \u201cWill one day the medical profession look at support for transitioning youth in the same manner the eugenics movement is now regarded?\u201d he asked in a 2021 expert report. Lappert, a devout Catholic, is also one of several physicians who attended a 2017 conference for medical experts hosted by the Alliance Defending Freedom, the rightwing Christian legal advocacy group that has been at the forefront of filing anti-trans and anti-abortion litigation across the country. As he described it in a 2021 deposition, it was at this conference that he and a number of attendees were asked to begin testifying about the supposed harms of gender-affirming care. At least one judge has limited Lappert\u2019s expert testimony, finding that he was \u201cnot qualified to render opinions about the diagnosis of gender dysphoria, its possible causes, the efficacy of the DSM, the efficacy of puberty blocking medication or hormone treatments\u201d or a host of other topics. The judge also cited evidence offered to the court that called his \u201cbias and reliability into serious question\u201d. Lappert did not respond to request for comment from the Guardian. Dr Quentin Van Meter A pediatric endocrinologist who was discredited in court Dr Quentin Van Meter has served as an expert in litigation to limit transgender rights in Florida and Alabama and in support of legislation in Missouri, Pennsylvania and Texas. Van Meter is an Atlanta-based pediatric endocrinologist who has stated that since 1995, he has only taken on pediatric patients diagnosed with gender dysphoria with the understanding that he was opposed to providing medical interventions of any kind, including hormones or puberty blockers. In legal testimony he has described the online transgender community as a \u201ccult\u201d and \u201cindoctrinating society\u201d. In a 2023 expert report, he claimed that \u201cat least half of [his] patients were recruited by transgender or non-binary individuals\u201d and that social media presents troubled youth \u201cwith a one-size-fits-all solution which offers acceptance and celebrity instantly\u201d. He is the former president of the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds), a group that has been declared a hate organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. It was founded in 2002, after a small number of doctors broke away from the American Academy of Pediatrics for endorsing adoption by same-sex couples. Since then, the college has continued to promote anti-trans and anti-abortion agendas. In a 2020 Texas divorce and custody case, a judge declared Van Meter \u201cdiscredited as an expert\u201d and barred him from providing testimony on puberty blockers or the appropriateness of gender-affirming care. In response to request for comment from the Guardian, Van Meter said that his work is designed to protect \u201ctransgender children and adolescents from being harmed by social, medical and surgical interventions that are proven not to resolve their mental health morbidity and that are proven to do far more harm than good\u201d. He also denied that there were legitimate grounds to dismiss his testimony in the 2020 divorce case. Dr Paul Hruz A pediatrics professor who has never treated a trans patient Paul Hruz is an associate professor of pediatrics at Washington University School of Medicine, where he specializes in the study of diabetes. According to a 2022 CV, since 2016 he has testified in at least 10 lawsuits related to gender transition and trans rights, even though, according to a federal judge in North Carolina, he \u201chas never diagnosed a patient with gender dysphoria, treated gender dysphoria, treated a transgender patient, conducted any original research about gender dysphoria diagnosis or its causes, or published any scientific, peer-reviewed literature on gender dysphoria\u201d. Hruz is a fellow at the National Catholic Bioethics Center, and a member of the Catholic Medical Association, two groups that reject gender transition altogether. In a 2017 deposition, a parent recalled a conversation she\u2019d had with Hruz several years prior, when she was advocating for a children\u2019s gender clinic to open in St Louis. The mother, Kim Hutton, said she told Hruz about how much happier her son had been since transitioning; he responded that medical transition was against God\u2019s plan. When she reminded him of research indicating that children who are denied gender-affirming care are at a higher risk of suicide, he reportedly replied: \u201cSome children are born in this world to suffer and die.\u201d He also attended the 2017 conference organized by the ADF. The same North Carolina judge wrote that she was \u201coffered evidence that calls Hruz\u2019s motivations \u2013 and thereby, his reliability \u2013 into serious question\u201d. His testimony played a favorable role in the Keira Bell case, in which a UK court found that children under 16 were probably unable to give consent to receive gender-affirming care. This ruling was reversed on appeal. Hruz did not respond to request for comment from the Guardian. Dr Michael Laidlaw An adult endocrinologist who compared gender-affirming care to Nazi experimentation Dr Michael Laidlaw has testified in favor of bans on gender-affirming care for youth in Alabama as well as in Florida, where according to Forbes, he helped guide the state board of medicine\u2019s decision to implement a ban on doctors providing such care by citing \u201cwidely disputed research suggesting 50% to 90% of children who believe their gender identity does not match their biological sex eventually change their minds\u201d. He is an adult endocrinologist and former member of the American College of Pediatricians who operates a practice in Rocklin, California. In a 2022 deposition, he testified that he has never conducted any primary research related to gender identity, published any peer-reviewed studies about the efficacy of treatments or managed the care of a patient diagnosed with gender dysphoria. In March, Mother Jones reported on a batch of leaked emails showing that Laidlaw, along with members of the College and an affiliate of the Alliance Defending Freedom, worked with the South Dakota legislator Fred Deutsch to pass an anti-trans law. When he testified in the state legislature in support of the bill, Laidlaw compared the provision of gender-affirming care to youth to the Tuskegee experiment on Black men and human experimentation on children in Nazi Germany. Although that bill ultimately failed, the effort helped drive the introduction of similar legislation in other states. In February 2023, South Dakota successfully passed a similar bill, which was subsequently signed into law. In Arizona, Judge Scott Rash cited Laidlaw\u2019s testimony when he refused to block the state\u2019s policy to exclude gender-affirming surgeries from Medicaid coverage. Laidlaw did not respond to request for comment from the Guardian."

            "date": "2023-06-18T08:31:38Z",
            "content": "Judging by column inches alone, you might be forgiven for thinking that the thing keeping women awake at night is not femicide, sexual assault, plummeting rape convictions, stalking, unequal pay, the erosion of reproductive rights, workplace discrimination, rampant online misogyny, an institutionally sexist police force, healthcare inequality, insufficient childcare provisions, or never being allowed to age. While all these issues do get reported, a disproportionate amount of attention is given to another topic: men masquerading as trans women in order to gain access to single-sex spaces. Over the past few years this idea has become so pervasive it is now inescapable in the media, culture, higher education, politics and sports; Ipso research shows that reporting of trans issues increased by 400% between 2009 and 2019. It is worth noting that trans people make up roughly 0.5% of the UK population; instances of men infiltrating women-only spaces are few and far between (in Ireland, where self-identification has been legal since 2015, there has been no discernible adverse impact). Yet it is precisely because these cases are so unusual that they become newsworthy: journalism\u2019s \u201cman bites dog\u201d principle means that an event\u2019s rarity determines its priority in the news agenda. If every single reported sexual assault got this kind of coverage \u2013 199,021 sexual offences and 70,633 rapes last year \u2013 it would simply never end. With so many real threats to women\u2019s safety, it is confounding that this much time and attention is being lavished on a largely hypothetical risk. Every single case of someone being attacked is unacceptable, and everything must be done to protect women\u2019s safety. Many cisgender women who support trans rights, myself included, have personal experience of sexual assault and take the topic extremely seriously. But the main threat to women comes overwhelmingly from men, not from trans women, who should not be penalised for the actions of predatory men. As a result, trans women and non-binary people are being excluded from single-sex spaces, putting them at a greatly increased risk of violence. Transgender people are far more likely to be survivors of sexual assault than perpetrators. The US Department of Justice\u2019s Office for Victims of Crime reports that 50% of transgender individuals are sexually abused or assaulted at one point in their lives, with some reports estimating the figure at 66% and even higher for groups such as transgender people of colour or with disabilities. Office for National Statistics data shows that trans people are twice as likely as cisgender people to be victims of crime; and, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, they are four times more likely to be victims of violent crime, including rape and sexual assault. Home Office statistics reveal that hate crimes against transgender people in England and Wales increased by 56% last year. But if transgender people are excluded from safe spaces, where exactly are they supposed to go? As history has shown us, \u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities are not a viable option. Of course, some trans people commit crimes, as do individuals from all demographics, including cisgender women. This should not invalidate the claims of everyone else from that group. If a handful of individuals take advantage of a system they should be held accountable, but it does not mean the service ought to be dismantled altogether, or rights stripped away from a whole community. Just because a tiny minority of rape accusations are false, it doesn\u2019t mean all rape cases should be thrown out (although this does seem to be the way our penal system operates). Men continue to attack women and children at home, in the workplace and in public, often with no repercussions; they have no need to resort to impersonating trans women. Far from making women feel safer, controversies about single-sex bathrooms have led to increased harassment and hostility towards cis women who do not present in a traditionally feminine way. Much discussion around trans identity tends to focus insistently on genitalia. But where exactly does womanhood reside? In your ovaries, your cervix, your womb, your breasts? There are women who, for all sorts of reasons \u2013 illness, surgery, rare medical conditions \u2013 are missing one part or another of the female anatomy (Angelina Jolie, for example), and yet they do not cease to be women. Excluding anyone on the basis of biological difference demonstrates a spectacular failure of empathy; worse, it reduces women to their reproductive systems, which is surely something we should be trying to move on from. If women are united by anything \u2013 and there are 3.8 billion of us, so there is going to be little common ground \u2013 it is the risk of sexual violence, from which no woman is safe, especially not trans women. No rapist is going to stop to check whether you have fallopian tubes. The fact that we are all targets of this particular kind of violence should only increase cis women\u2019s solidarity towards our trans sisters. With gender and sexuality becoming increasingly fluid, feminism should aim to be more inclusive rather than less: welcoming trans men and women as well as non-binary, queer, intersex and gender-nonconforming people. While it may be true that trans women do not have the exact same lived experience as cis women growing up, cis women do not know what it is like to grow up as a trans woman, to be born in the wrong body and experience transphobia. Our increasingly polarised online discourse means that women often feel pitted against one another, based on age, size, education, wealth, politics, whether we are mothers or not. But there is no one correct way to be a woman: what we need to remember is that we are stronger together than when we are apart. \u2022 Kathryn Bromwich is a commissioning editor and writer on the Observer Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2023-06-07T08:23:12Z",
            "content": "The online business operated by weight-loss company Jenny Craig in Australia and New Zealand will be sold to an online healthcare start-up that rose to prominence prescribing weight-loss drugs, administrators announced on Wednesday. Administrators FTI Consulting recommended Jenny Craig be placed into liquidation but agreed to sell the online capability of the business to Eucalyptus, a healthcare technology company, which will continue to offer online weight loss solutions to customers. Administrators Vaughan Strawbridge, Kate Warwick and Joseph Hansell sought to sell the operations \u201cwith the intent of preserving as many jobs as possible\u201d and limiting losses for creditors by seeking offers from interested bidders. \u201cDespite best efforts, the administrators were unable to find a buyer for the physical stores and employees of the Australian and New Zealand business,\u201d said a statement issued by FTI Consulting on Wednesday. Administrators advised all employees in Australia and New Zealand that a sale of the business, with the 91 stores continuing to trade and staff continuing their employment, was not achievable. \u201cThis has resulted in a decision to immediately cease trading from stores and employees being made redundant,\u201d the statement added. FTI Consulting described the decision as an \u201cunfortunate outcome\u201d and one which the administrators \u201chad sought to avoid\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup There were reportedly 15 interested parties involved in the bidding process, four of which submitted non-binding indicative offers. The administrators said in Australia the company had 7,300 customers a week across the 73 stores and online, and employs approximately 306 staff in Australia and 71 in New Zealand. The administrators said Covid-19 pandemic supply chain issues, several non-performing stores and the lack of working capital to address the issues likely contributed to the company\u2019s demise. Last month, Strawbridge said the brand\u2019s management team were working to find a new owner and a number of parties were \u201cinterested in taking the businesses forward\u201d. Jenny Craig was founded in Melbourne in 1983 and grew to become a household name as one of the biggest weight management companies in the world. It has about 600 centres globally with more than 500 locations in North America. Jenny Craig\u2019s main services consist of one-on-one personalised support with nutrition and lifestyle planning. Various celebrities have featured as ambassadors over the years including the singer Mariah Carey and the former Spice Girl Melanie Brown, known as Mel B. Locally, the comedian Magda Szubanski and the late Barry Humphries and his alter ego Dame Edna Everage were also ambassadors. Private equity investment firm HIG Capital bought Jenny Craig in 2019 for an undisclosed sum. The next meeting of creditors for the Australian and New Zealand companies of the Jenny Craig group will be held on 14 June. The announcement comes a month after Jenny Craig\u2019s local operations had stressed it would continue operating despite its US global parent filing for bankruptcy. The administrator\u2019s report for the Australian business notes that it had loaned its global parent company $3.1m, which falls into the $200m owed to the parent company\u2019s creditors. In response to the rise in services like Eucalyptus where customers can often get a prescription over a text chat or questionnaire, the Medical Board of Australia last month issued guidelines for doctors stating that video chat or phone call is preferred as the method of consultations for telehealth.

            "title": "Our primary healthcare system is a mess. We have a plan to fix it | Bernie Sanders",
            "date": "2023-06-28T10:05:01Z",
            "content": "The bad news is that the US healthcare system is broken and dysfunctional. We spend twice as much per capita as almost any other country, nearly $13,000 per year, while 85 million Americans remain uninsured or underinsured. In addition, our health outcomes are often worse. In terms of life expectancy, for example, we live far shorter lives than the people of many other industrialized nations. The system is failing ordinary Americans. On the other hand, the insurance and drug companies that dominate it have sky-high profits and their CEOs receive exorbitant compensation packages. The thousands of lobbyists those companies have on Capitol Hill are also doing very well. It\u2019s time for a change. As disastrous as our overall healthcare system is, our primary care system is even worse. Tens of millions of Americans live in communities where they cannot find a doctor or dentist, even when they have insurance, while others have to wait months to get seen. Despite spending a huge amount of money on healthcare, the United States doesn\u2019t have enough doctors, dentists, nurses, mental health practitioners, pharmacists or home healthcare workers. And that workforce shortage is getting worse. Most countries spend between 10% and 15% of their healthcare budgets on primary care. Canada spends 13%, Germany spends 15%, Spain spends 17% and Australia spends 18%. We spend less than 7%. In other words, instead of investing in disease prevention and enabling people to gain easy and timely access to the medical care they need, we spend heavily on expensive hospital and tertiary care. Our \u201csystem\u201d is there big time when people end up in the hospital. We just don\u2019t do much to keep them from going there. Every major medical organization agrees that our investment in primary healthcare is woefully inadequate. They understand that focusing on disease prevention and providing Americans with a medical home will not only saves lives and ease human suffering, but save money. Providing primary care to all is not only good public policy, it is cost-effective. The major backbone of our current primary care system, especially for low- and moderate-income Americans, is the Federally Qualified Community Health Center program. Today, 30 million men, women and children receive high-quality primary healthcare at community health centers in 14,000 neighborhoods located in every state in America. Many of these centers also provide dental care, mental health counseling and low-cost prescription drugs. According to a recent study by an expert at the Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine, community health centers saved Medicare and Medicaid $25bn in 2021 alone. In fact, research has shown that it is about $2,300 less expensive for a Medicaid patient to receive care from a community health center than at a private clinic and it is roughly $1,200 less expensive for a Medicare patient to receive care at a community health center than at an outpatient clinic. At a time when millions of Americans have no option but to go to an emergency room for their basic healthcare needs, it turns out that an emergency room visit is about 10 times more expensive than going to a community health center. One thing is certain. We cannot address the primary healthcare crisis unless we also address the major shortages that we have in our healthcare workforce. According to the most recent estimates, over the next decade our country faces a shortage of over 120,000 doctors \u2013 including a major shortage of primary care doctors. The nursing shortage may even be worse. Over the next two years alone it is estimated that we will need between 200,000 and 450,000 more nurses. We also have a shortage of some 100,000 dentists in America. And, despite the very serious mental health crisis we are facing, there is a massive shortage of mental health service providers \u2013 psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, addiction specialists and many more. For many years members of Congress have talked about these crises. Now is the time to act. As chairman of the US Senate health, education, labor and pensions (Help) committee I am working hard to pass bipartisan legislation which will transform our primary healthcare system so that every American, no matter where they live or what their income might be, can get the care they need when they need it. If we increased funding for primary care by $130bn over five years, through a combination of increased federal funding and the elimination of some of the enormous waste and bureaucracy in the current healthcare system, we could double the number of people using community health centers and come close to providing primary healthcare to every person in America. Further, an investment of $40bn over five years could substantially increase the number of doctors, nurses, dentists and mental health care providers we desperately need. Is this $170bn, five-year investment in our primary care system and healthcare workforce a lot of money? Yes. It is. But let\u2019s be clear. This $34bn annual investment to improve our healthcare system would amount to less than half of the increase that Congress provided to the Pentagon last year alone. In my view, healthcare is a human right. The legislation that I am proposing would go a long way towards accomplishing that goal. Bernie Sanders is a US senator and chairman of the health, education, labor and pensions committee. He represents the state of Vermont, and is the longest-serving independent in the history of Congress"

            "date": "2023-06-26T09:00:01Z",
            "content": "From the soaring costs of US healthcare to the recurrent NHS crisis, it can often seem that effective and affordable healthcare is impossible. This will only get worse as chronic conditions grow in prevalence and we discover new ways to treat previously fatal diseases. These new treatments tend to be costly, while new approaches can be hard to introduce into healthcare systems that are either resistant to change or fatigued by too much of it. Meanwhile, growing demand for social care is compounding funding pressure and making the allocation of resources even more complicated. Artificial intelligence (AI) is often glibly posed as the answer for services that are already forced to do more with less. Yet the idea that intelligent computers could simply replace humans in medicine is a fantasy. AI tends not to work well in the real world. Complexity proves an obstacle. So far, AI technologies have had little impact on the messy, inherently human world of medicine. But what if AI tools were designed specifically for real-world medicine \u2013 with all its organisational, scientific, and economic complexity? This \u201creality-centric\u201d approach to AI is the focus of the lab I lead at Cambridge University. Working closely with clinicians and hospitals, we develop AI tools for researchers, doctors, nurses and patients. People often think the principal opportunities for AI in healthcare lie in analysing images, such as MRI scans, or finding new drug compounds. But there are many opportunities beyond. One of the things our lab studies is personalised or precision medicine. Rather than one-size-fits-all, we look to see how treatments can be customised to reflect an individual\u2019s unique medical and lifestyle profile. Using AI-powered personalised medicine could allow for more effective treatment of common conditions such as heart disease and cancer, or rare diseases such as cystic fibrosis. It could allow clinicians to optimise the timing and dosage of medication for individual patients, or screen patients using their individual health profiles, rather than the current blanket criteria of age and sex. This personalised approach could lead to earlier diagnosis, prevention and better treatment, saving lives and making better use of resources. Many of these same techniques can be applied in clinical trials. Trials sometimes falter because the average response to a drug fails to meet the trial\u2019s targets. If some people on the trial responded well to treatment, though, AI could help to find those groups within the existing trial data. Creating data models of individual patients, or \u201cdigital twins\u201d, could allow researchers to conduct preliminary trials before embarking on an expensive one involving real people. This would reduce the time and investment it takes to create a drug, making more life-enhancing interventions commercially viable and allowing treatments to be targeted at those they will help the most. In a complex organisation such as the NHS, AI could help to allocate resources efficiently. Our lab created a tool during Covid to help clinicians predict the use of ventilators and ICU beds. This could be extended across the health service to allocate healthcare staff and equipment. AI technologies could also support doctors, nurses and other health professionals to improve their knowledge and combine their expertise. It could also help with conundrums such as patient privacy. The latest AI technologies create what is called \u201csynthetic data\u201d, which reflects the patterns within data, allowing clinicians to draw insights from this, while replacing all identifiable information. Clinicians and AI specialists are already considering the potential for healthcare of large language models such as ChatGPT. These tools could help with the paperwork burden, recommend drug-trial protocols or propose diagnoses. But although they have immense potential, the risks and challenges are clear. We can\u2019t rely on a system that regularly fabricates information, or that is trained on biased data. ChatGPT is not capable of understanding complex conditions and nuances, which could lead to misinterpretations or inappropriate recommendations. It could have disastrous implications if it was used in fields such as mental health. If AI is used to diagnose someone and gets it wrong, it needs to be clear who is responsible: the AI developers, or the healthcare professionals who use it? Ethical guidelines and regulations have yet to catch up with these technologies. We need to address the safety issues around using large language models with real patients, and make sure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. To ensure this, our lab is working closely with clinicians to make sure that models are trained on reliably accurate and unbiased data. We\u2019re developing new ways to validate AI systems to ensure they\u2019re safe, reliable and effective, and techniques to make sure the predictions and recommendations generated by AI can be explained to clinicians and patients. We must not lose sight of the transformative potential of this technology. We need to make sure that we design and build AI to help healthcare professionals be better at what they do. This is part of what I call the human AI empowerment agenda \u2013 using AI to empower humans, not to replace them. The aim should not be to construct autonomous agents that can mimic and supplant humans, but to develop machine learning that allows humans to improve their cognitive and introspective abilities, enabling them to become better learners and decision-makers.

            "date": "2023-06-25T07:00:29Z",
            "content": "The head of NHS England was critical of the government\u2019s slogan urging people to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d at the start of the Covid pandemic, amid concerns it would stop people coming forward for much-needed treatment. Simon Stevens, who led the NHS until July 2021, was one of the slogan\u2019s \u201cgreatest critics\u201d and was not involved in the government discussion that led to the phrase being deployed. The revelation has emerged in a new book on the health service, which says that senior health figures were soon attempting to unpick the potential damage it caused. \u201cIt was a tremendously powerful slogan,\u201d writes journalist Isabel Hardman in Fighting for Life: The Twelve Battles That Made Our NHS, and the Struggle for Its Future. \u201cIt was popular in government \u2013 but not universally so. In fact, one of its greatest critics was Simon Stevens. Stevens wasn\u2019t on the calls where [government advisers] came up with \u2018Protect the NHS\u2019, and initially he complained in private that it gave the impression that the public was there for the health service \u2013 not the health service being there for the public. \u201cEither way, the focus quickly became about the importance of \u2018protecting the NHS\u2019. But there was never a clear definition of what it was being protected from.\u201d Later in 2020, Lord Stevens referred to his concerns about the slogan, writing: \u201cRather than say \u2018Protect the NHS\u2019, health service staff prefer to say: \u2018Help us help you\u2019.\u201d Senior NHS figures also attempted to battle against the slogan from the spring of 2020, urging patients to come forward as normal. In April, Sir Stephen Powis, the NHS national medical director, said at a press conference: \u201cIf you have any emergency condition, whether it\u2019s a sick child, whether it\u2019s a mother, or a mother in pregnancy who\u2019s worried about the movements of the baby, you should be seeking emergency services just as you always have done. \u201cThey are there for you and although we are focusing on coronavirus, it\u2019s important that we also continue to focus on other emergency conditions.\u201d The concerns of the former head of NHS England have emerged as former health secretary Matt Hancock prepares to be questioned by the UK Covid-19 public inquiry this week. He has already faced scrutiny over his response to the pandemic after the leak of about 100,000 WhatsApp messages earlier this year which he exchanged with ministers and aides. Hancock is likely to face questions on why the government had not adequately prepared for the stockpiling and distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the face of a non-influenza pandemic or for mass diagnostic testing. The hearing was told last week that some social care providers ran out of PPE despite Sir Christopher Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care, insisting that \u201cwe never nationally ran out of PPE\u201d. When challenged over the statement by Lady Hallett, the chairwoman of the inquiry, he responded: \u201cThere were huge pressures on PPE and we had, as I said, significant challenges getting PPE to the right place. That\u2019s different from it having run out nationally.\u201d Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England until September 2019, told the inquiry last week there was not sufficient resilience in the NHS to properly cope with the effect of a pandemic. She said: \u201cYou can\u2019t get a good outcome if you don\u2019t have resilience in the public\u2019s health, resilience in the public health system \u2013 it has been disinvested in. \u201cOn comparator data \u2026 we were at the bottom of the table on number of doctors, number of beds, number of ITUs [intensive therapy units], number of ventilators.\u201d Former prime minister David Cameron and ex-chancellor George Osborne gave evidence to the inquiry last week, defending the austerity drive they imposed on the country. Osborne said he \u201ccompletely\u201d rejected that a depleted health system was the consequence of austerity and argued the country would have been more exposed to a pandemic if the public finances had not been on a sustainable footing. Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister of Scotland, will also appear before the inquiry this week. Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer who resigned in April 2020 after breaking lockdown rules with two trips to her second home, will also give evidence."

            "content": "As with everything else involving Boris Johnson, theatricality looms large in the dispute over whether his WhatsApps, diaries and notebooks should be released without redaction to the official Covid-19 inquiry. The Cabinet Office had until 4pm on Thursday to comply with a demand from the inquiry chair, Lady Hallett, to hand them all over. After the deadline passed, the standoff soon morphed into a high-stakes court challenge by ministers. Apart from anything else, this means further delays to an already slow inquiry process. This dispute could have been seen coming. Ever since Lady Hallett was appointed in 2021 to conduct what Mr Johnson called \u201ca forensic and thoroughgoing\u201d inquiry into the UK\u2019s response to the pandemic, it was blindingly clear that she would need to see all the evidence about the government\u2019s handling. Since Lady Hallett was appointed under the Inquiries Act 2005, it was also clear that she had the powers to compel witnesses and evidence. Her moral position was strengthened further this week when Mr Johnson handed all his papers to the Cabinet Office and said they should be passed to the inquiry. That pulled a lot of rug from under the government\u2019s feet. For once, though, this dispute is not primarily about Mr Johnson. Instead it concerns, first, the public credibility of the way that British government does modern public inquiries and, second, the extent to which accountability of government is practicable in a digital and doubting world. Mr Johnson only moves centre stage over a third issue: the impact of all this on his own career. The main issue is whether the inquiry has the power to decide which documents it can study. Lady Hallett says that power is hers, given by law. The government, represented by the Cabinet Office, claims that it can decide some material is \u201cunambiguously irrelevant\u201d. Law and politics say Lady Hallett is right. The courts will now decide. There will be terrible reputational damage to the inquiry if the government succeeds. The way it tried to duck and weave about the material during May adds to this. An important second issue is how the inquiry should cope with the digital revolution. When communication was confined to spoken conversations, of which no verbatim record exists, or to paper, which tends to be more formal and considered, the government could control its own message. In the social media age, these ways have been swamped by digital messaging, where protocols and habits of expression are vastly different. As Rafael Behr argues in Politics: A Survivor\u2019s Guide: \u201cThere is an element of performance in digital interactions that has little equivalent in analogue communication.\u201d The Covid inquiry has to navigate the reality that much, even most, communication in government and politics is now digital. The medium changes the way that discussions of all kinds take place. This brings dangers, which Matt Hancock\u2019s Covid-era WhatsApps illustrated. Mr Johnson\u2019s are unlikely to be less performative or less embarrassing. But it is not Lady Hallett\u2019s job to protect him. Finally, there is Mr Johnson himself. He has now done a U-turn over demands for his papers, going from refusing outright, claiming security is at stake, to saying everything should be handed over. With his future prospects in politics at risk, he is posing for the moment as reasonable and open. But he may not be so forthcoming when he finally gives evidence to Lady Hallett at the end of this year."

            "date": "2023-06-04T12:23:32Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson will not be restricted by the government over what he can say to the Covid-19 inquiry, despite being warned he should ensure he is using public funding for legal advice \u201cappropriately\u201d, a senior minister has said. Robert Jenrick\u2019s comments on Sunday come after it was reported that Cabinet Office lawyers had told Johnson he could lose the funding if he tried to \u201cfrustrate or undermine\u201d the government\u2019s position on the inquiry. The former prime minister was informed that the money would \u201ccease to be available\u201d if he broke conditions such as releasing evidence without permission, according to the Sunday Times. Johnson has been at the centre of a row as ministers launched a high court bid to challenge the inquiry\u2019s demand for his unredacted WhatsApp messages and contemporaneous notebooks. He said he would send all his messages to the official investigation directly, circumventing the Cabinet Office. Jenrick told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that Johnson \u2013 in whose administration he served and who he backed for the Conservative leadership \u2013 was \u201cat liberty\u201d to send his documents or WhatsApp messages to the inquiry and make whatever statements he wishes. But the immigration minister added: \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no sense that the government will restrict what Boris Johnson wants to say, but if you use taxpayer funds, obviously you should make sure you\u2019re using them appropriately.\u201d He denied there were fears in No 10 that Rishi Sunak\u2019s messages could reveal a plot to try to bring down Johnson, insisting it would not be \u201csensible or reasonable\u201d to hand over ministers\u2019 documents or messages if they were deemed irrelevant to the pandemic. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a situation where a court would ask for documents or messages that have absolutely nothing to do with the purpose of the case or the inquiry. I mean, for example, things to do with a civil servant or a politician\u2019s private life that are wholly unrelated to the inquiry,\u201d he said. Jenrick, a former lawyer, said the \u201cnormal way to do this is to set reasonable parameters\u201d and not to ask for things \u201cwholly unrelated\u201d. He insisted the government had the \u201chighest regard\u201d for the inquiry chair, Heather Hallett, and was not asking for \u201cspecial treatment\u201d. \u201cI hope this can be resolved indeed even before the matter gets to court,\u201d he added. A former director of the Governments Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has called for rules over the use of WhatsApp in government and said ministers \u201cshould think twice before they express their views\u201d. David Omand told Times Radio \u201cWe do need some rules in this space. For example, classified material security classified material should not be discussed between ministers on social media in that way.\u201d Omand, who was the UK\u2019s first security and intelligence coordinator, also said the government \u201cought to make the material available\u201d to Lady Hallett. \u201cI don\u2019t buy the argument that she shouldn\u2019t see material that the government simply says is not relevant, because she has wide-ranging terms of reference,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group has taken an 18.9% stake in the online electricals retailer AO World in a \u00a375m deal involving buying out shares held by the crisis-hit Odey Asset Management. Frasers Group, the parent of brands from Sports Direct to Evans Cycles, said the deal was part of a strategic partnership that the two companies had been in talks about forming for two years. The Bolton-based AO World, founded in 2000 as Appliances Only by John Roberts, is the biggest seller of large domestic appliances in the UK. \u201cFrasers has long admired what John and the AO team have built, and we are delighted to have the opportunity to form a supportive, strategic partnership,\u201d said Michael Murray, the chief executive of Frasers Group. \u201cThrough this investment, Frasers will benefit from AO\u2019s valuable knowhow in electricals and two-man delivery, helping us to drive growth in our bulk equipment and homeware ranges.\u201d Frasers Group has acquired most of the shares from Odey Asset Management, as the business reels from the departure of its founder Crispin Odey after allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denies. Investors welcomed the deal, sending shares in AO World up more than 9% on Monday, which makes Frasers the second-largest shareholder in the business. The largest shareholder is Camelot Capital Partners, with a 20.4% stake, with Roberts now the third largest shareholder, at 18.3%, according to data from Refinitiv. Following the deal, Odey Asset Management retains a 5.2% stake in AO World. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Frasers Group has set its sights on AO World, which has recently benefited from a series of cost-cutting measures which have collectively made the business more efficient,\u201d said Sarah Riding, retail partner at law firm Gowling WLG. \u201cGiven the increased competitive nature in retail at present and the need to think more laterally about how to meet consumer needs, the logistical strength that the Frasers Group stake will lend to AO\u2019s future should help it remain in pole position.\u201d The deal comes a week after Frasers Group increased its stake in Asos to 9%, making it the third-largest shareholder, before a potential battle for control of the ailing online fashion business AO World, which has faced tough conditions as the cost of living crisis restrains household spending, said the investment was a vote of confidence in the business. \u201cThis is great news for AO and a fantastic endorsement for our business,\u201d said Roberts, the chief executive. \u201c[We]look forward to realising the significant potential that we see for this partnership. As we continue to build on our strategy of pivoting to profitable growth, it will be hugely exciting to have a range of compelling strategic opportunities to explore together.\u201d"

            "content": "News of plans for a Covid tapestry came as something of a shock (Bereaved families withdraw support for UK Covid tapestry, 22 May). During lockdown in February 2021, I decided to set about making a \u201cBayeux tapestry for the Covid pandemic\u201d. I had read of Mary, Queen of Scots, making tapestry during her years of incarceration: stitching felt like an appropriate response to lockdown. On social media I explained the project, now named The Covid Chronicle, to textile artists around the world. One hundred and forty textile artists from across the globe made panels. Each panel, following a defined template, tells the individual lived experience of each artist, using a multitude of techniques. The result was a giant installation measuring 36 x 1 metres \u2013 coincidentally, almost matching the scale of its historic inspiration. In 2022, it went on a highly successful tour of galleries across England and Wales. We know people have found the work inspiring and deeply moving. We are delighted that the work will soon be on permanent exhibition at Chelsea and Westminster hospital. Donating the work to an NHS hospital feels appropriate, as the work celebrates the heroic dedication of NHS staff across the pandemic and beyond. I told the Commission on Covid Commemoration about The Covid Chronicle but heard nothing back. An opportunity is being missed to build on an existing profound work \u2013 freely produced by artists donating their work and at no cost to the public purse. I await with great interest to see what form the Covid tapestry takes and hope that it proves to be as powerful a memorial as its precursor.

            "date": "2023-06-20T17:12:32Z",
            "content": "There were many unsung heroes during the Covid pandemic. The doctors, nurses and paramedics who went that extra mile to treat and comfort the sick and the dying. The care home staff who put themselves in harm\u2019s way knowing they were admitting patients who hadn\u2019t been tested for the coronavirus. The ordinary members of the public who went out of their way to follow the rules even though they knew they might never see relatives or loved ones again. But during his evidence to the Covid inquiry on Tuesday morning, George Osborne went out of his way to praise the efforts of one man without whom the country might never have survived the pandemic. Someone whose name had mysteriously slipped under the public\u2019s radar and yet was worthy of a nation\u2019s gratitude. The former chancellor was here to right that wrong. To allow that someone to be a hero. If only just for one day. And that someone was a certain George Osborne. Few people do conceit and self-regard quite as well as the former chancellor. So he was understandably rather hurt when Kate Blackwell KC, the counsel for the inquiry, dared to quote reports that had found the austerity economics of the coalition government contributed to the impact of the pandemic. Underinvestment in public services \u2013 and especially the NHS and social care \u2013 had led to a higher rate of mortality. \u201cI absolutely refute that,\u201d said a brittle Osborne. How dare anyone suggest that he might have blood on his hands. George doesn\u2019t do guilt. Or self-doubt. He\u2019s never lost a moment\u2019s sleep over the effect of his policies on the country. The only fault to which he will admit is excessive modesty. People should be thanking, not condemning him. Put it this way, he snapped. The reality was that the country would have been far worse off during the pandemic were it not for austerity. OK, so a whole load of people might have died unnecessarily but that was just unfortunate. The poor always croak first in a pandemic and it was a coincidence that his economics had increased health inequality. But look on the bright side. It was totally down to him that Rishi Sunak had been able to fund the furlough and bailout schemes. Thanks to Him, the country could afford a contingency plan. Weirdly, it didn\u2019t seem to have occurred to Osborne that other countries that hadn\u2019t made their people poorer or cut public services had also been able to afford bailouts. That rather got overlooked. A short-circuit of denial in George\u2019s psyche. But hey! He had given everything a lot of thought and had come to the conclusion there wasn\u2019t a single thing he could have done better. We had all been so, so lucky to have him. Blackwell didn\u2019t sound wholly convinced. Nor did the committee chair, Heather Hallett, who made a couple of well-timed interventions. After all, it couldn\u2019t be just a coincidence that the Institute for Government, the Office for Budget Responsibility and just about everyone else contradicted Osborne\u2019s version of events. But George was in a world of his own. Not prepared to accept even the slightest criticism. Or the slightest responsibility, for that matter. When things go wrong, it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault. Osborne hastily went on to list more of his magnificent achievements. OK, so many hospitals had fallen down around him on his watch but he had definitely ringfenced the NHS budget. And his sugar tax and smoking strategies had worked a treat on the nation\u2019s health. So he was basically a saint. Yes, it was unfortunate that he\u2019d let social care collapse, but people had to die of something. No one lives for ever, so they might as well die of neglect. After all, it wasn\u2019t his fault if people weren\u2019t prepared to pay more in tax to live longer. Nor was George willing to concede that he could have made better contingency plans for the pandemic. It was what it was. Even if he had given it a moment\u2019s thought, no one would have taken seriously the idea of locking down a country for months on end. So even if he had thought of it, nobody would have believed him. Besides, it all worked out quite well. Even down to Tory donors making loads of dosh on PPE. Osborne smiled. He had done enough. He could look himself in the eye and exonerate himself of all blame. That was all from Planet George. A place where everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. It had all been very different when Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister, had been cross-examined earlier in the morning. Then, Letwin is at heart a very decent bloke. Someone prone to self-criticism who could talk himself out of almost anything. A man for whom doubt is an article of faith. A man driven by the things he should have done. Who places demands on himself that he doesn\u2019t expect of others. Osborne and David Cameron would call him wet and indecisive. The rest of us would like to see more people like him in public life. Letwin couldn\u2019t think of anything he didn\u2019t wish he had done differently. He shouldn\u2019t have just accepted the advice he was given that all the contingency plans for pandemic flu were in place. Because if he hadn\u2019t, he might have given more thought to the possibility of other respiratory viruses. He should have asked better questions of the scientists. He should have given more thought to the implementation of contingency plans. He had lasting regrets about his time in office. He felt every death keenly. As if the victims had died at his hands. Contrast this approach with Osborne and Cameron. Tells you all you need to know about the three men really."

            "date": "2023-06-19T05:00:04Z",
            "content": "Riley had hoped university would be where they would meet likeminded people and form lasting, meaningful friendships, shedding the feelings of loneliness that had often surrounded them in their teens. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with degrees of loneliness for a large chunk of my life. I was often reassured by my family that uni would change all that,\u201d they say. Then the pandemic hit. As Riley was matriculating in Sheffield, the UK was preparing for its second lockdown. Instead of getting involved in societies and nights out at the student union, they spent day after day trapped in their room. \u201cMost of my studies have been online, so I don\u2019t know anyone on my course. Obviously most societies shut down or went online,\u201d they say. In their second term, as the UK went into its third lockdown, they moved back home for the rest of the year. Although events started running again in their second year, Riley didn\u2019t get involved. \u201cPart of it was nervousness, not knowing how to handle myself,\u201d they say. Riley says they feel \u201cstunted socially\u201d. \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t know enough about how to socialise in order to make friends properly. I find myself wondering if something\u2019s wrong with me or I give off a bad energy. \u201cI worry that, because I\u2019ve [finished] uni and school, I\u2019ve missed out on the best chances I\u2019ll ever have to make friends.\u201d It\u2019s hard to put it down to just one thing, Riley says. \u201cIt\u2019s this Gordian knot of my own personal issues, things like the pandemic, and the shape of society. I think people find the idea of in-person communities less important than in the past.\u201d Riley is one of many young people caught in a cycle of loneliness in the wake of the pandemic and amid the cost of living crisis. Just under one in 10 people aged 16 to 29 reported feeling lonely often or always, according to an analysis of recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) data by the Campaign to End Loneliness \u2013 the highest level of all age groups. This is set against a backdrop of chronic loneliness levels among all age groups, which rose during the pandemic and never really came down again. At the peak of lockdown in late 2020 and early 2021, levels reached 7.2%, and were still at 7.08% two years later. In 2018, the figure had been 5%. Prof Andrea Wigfield, the director of the centre for loneliness studies at Sheffield Hallam University, says that while social isolation is an objective measure, loneliness is a \u201csubjective, negative feeling\u201d. Comparison to others plays a part, Wigfield explains, suggesting a link to the role of social media. \u201cThe thing that influences loneliness is the social connection [people] desire and what they perceive their peers to have,\u201d she says. \u201cWith young people, there\u2019s an expectation that you have an active social life.\u201d Loneliness among teenagers worldwide, including in the UK, already appeared to be rising before the pandemic, research suggests. \u201cIn the past it was always argued older people are the most lonely,\u201d Wigfield says. But \u201cevidence has emerged that young people are as lonely, if not more. It\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019ll continue to be a longterm rise\u201d. But she also stresses that loneliness is a natural response, \u201cthe body telling you you need to find someone to talk to\u201d. \u201cTemporarily it\u2019s the equivalent of being hungry. When it becomes chronic, that\u2019s when it starts affecting health. \u201cThe way in which we live has changed\u201d since the pandemic, Wigfield says. \u201cOnline took off and hasn\u2019t gone back to how it was before. The figures for social isolation will definitely have fallen [since lockdown] but people aren\u2019t feeling less lonely. It comes back to the point that you could be in a crowd but still feel lonely.\u201d Marcus Johnston, 27, a video game artist, is feeling the impact of the way life has changed for many. He lives with his parents in a rural area of North Yorkshire, after moving out of his flatshare as UK society shut down in 2020. He has few friends nearby and works remotely. \u201cIt\u2019s great but means you never get that experience of being in an office environment and having that team feeling. I haven\u2019t had a proper job where I\u2019ve had that experience of making friends.\u201d Johnston says moving home was the right decision at the time, but that he feels isolated and is hoping to share a flat with friends again soon. \u201cIt\u2019s an almost constant murmuring at the back of my mind, telling you that you\u2019re lonely, and you need more fulfilling relationships in your life. I often think back on the times where I had more friends and acquaintances around me when I was younger, and it brings me down.\u201d Echoing Riley\u2019s concerns about a focus on online communities, he says: \u201cThe society we live in now seems catered to trap us in digital bubbles, now more so than ever due to working from home.\u201d The idea that time spent on social networks can leave people feeling more isolated is hardly new, with research suggesting that limiting engagement with social media can reduce feelings of loneliness and the fear of missing out. Kate, 26, often finds herself alone and scrolling at the weekend. \u201cOn a Friday night, I\u2019ll go on Instagram. I follow quite a lot of people who will be out doing stuff with friends and posting. And I\u2019ll feel like: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m on my own. Why am I on my own?\u201d Kate, who works at a university in Oxfordshire, has lived with her parents since finishing university, for both financial reasons and because most of her friends now live in London. She mostly works from home and her colleagues are rarely in the office, which is the main reason she doesn\u2019t go in, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to many people day-to-day and sometimes it can feel like I am disappearing.\u201d She says that being single is a big driver of her feelings. \u201cPeople I know from school and still have on social media all seem to be in longterm relationships and even getting married. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m the only person who isn\u2019t.\u201d Thinking back to the Covid lockdowns, Kate says she felt less isolated than she does now. \u201cObviously that was lonely, but not as lonely because everyone was [at home] and there was just more stuff going on like online chats with people and quizzes. \u201cEveryone was in the same position.\u201d"

            "title": "UK deferred pandemic planning as no-deal Brexit loomed, inquiry hears",
            "date": "2023-06-26T13:19:31Z",
            "content": "Ministers knew in 2016 that \u201ceven a moderate pandemic would overrun the system\u201d and the government\u2019s emergency response function would be \u201cvery rapidly overwhelmed\u201d by a major disease outbreak, the UK Covid-19 public inquiry has heard. A meeting of the Department of Health and Social Care board, which included the permanent secretary, Sir Chris Wormald, and the then chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, concluded that \u201cthere would be significant issues if it became necessary to track or quarantine thousands of people\u201d, newly disclosed documents revealed. But the civil servant who subsequently took charge of emergency preparedness and health protection at the DHSC, Emma Reed, said \u201cthere was no discussion with me about quarantining\u201d and \u201cthere was no discussion with me about track and trace\u201d. At the start of the third week of the inquiry\u2019s investigation into the UK\u2019s preparedness for a pandemic that claimed more than 220,000 lives, Reed, who took charge of the health system\u2019s emergency preparedness directorate in February 2018, said she had been aware of the risk of \u201csystem overload\u201d. But the inquiry heard how some attempts to strengthen the system were shelved: in 2016 a decision to fund high-end quarantine facilities was \u201cdeferred by ministers\u201d, documents revealed. Meanwhile, as a no-deal Brexit loomed in November 2019, the government deprioritised key projects to prepare for a pandemic that was just around the corner. The inquiry also heard how Matt Hancock, the health secretary from July 2018, requested a briefing note on emergency preparedness when he took office. He was told of plans to cope with \u201can additional 800,000 bodies\u201d in the event of a flu pandemic, the note showed. But there was no mention of the fact that the 2016 Exercise Cygnus, a major cross-government flu pandemic exercise, found that the UK\u2019s pandemic preparedness and response plans and capabilities were not sufficient to cope with a severe outbreak. Hancock is due to give evidence on Tuesday. By June 2020, only eight of the 22 work streams based on the Cygnus recommendations had been completed. DHSC\u2019s pandemic flu readiness board didn\u2019t sit at all between November 2018 and November 2019 as a result of the threat of a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, Dame Jenny Harries, a former senior official at Public Health England and now the chief executive of the UK Health and Security Agency, revealed that before the pandemic, PHE scientists had to do paid work that \u201cdid not focus on strengthening the wider health protection system\u201d because they needed to make up for 40% real-terms budgets cut between 2014 and 2020. \u201cRather than having a critical system for the UK founded on a substantial grant that could maintain it, it was trying to pedal fast to keep up generating income,\u201d she said. While many witnesses have criticised the \u201cgroupthink\u201d that led to the UK\u2019s pandemic plan being centred on flu, Harries defended the strategy. She said she would take the same path today, but conceded that it lacked planning for variations such as asymptomatic transmission. She also agreed with an assessment by the Institute of Government that the preparedness and resilience of social care at the start of the crisis were poor. She said that because it was \u201ca largely privately provided service\u201d, ensuring that people who run services understand infection control and have PPE ready for their staff \u201cis really challenging\u201d. She also supported the idea of the creation of a resilience minister, who should \u201cstay with it for the whole of the parliamentary session\u201d. In other evidence, the government was accused of sidelining nurses and other healthcare groups in the run-up to the pandemic, including those who had worked closely on outbreaks of Ebola in west Africa and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) in Saudi Arabia. Rosemary Gallagher, the Royal College of Nursing\u2019s professional lead in infection prevention and control, told the inquiry it had been \u201ca mistake\u201d not to include nurses in Exercise Cygnus. Before Covid the government made engagement with stakeholder organisations less of a priority, she said. During Reed\u2019s evidence the inquiry revealed internal DHSC documents relating to a November 2019 pandemic preparedness meeting that showed \u201careas of work not prioritised\u201d included boosting adult social care and community care during a pandemic, the public health communications strategy and refreshing the 2011 pandemic flu strategy to ensure it was \u201caccurate and up to date\u201d. The pandemic flu strategy was the UK\u2019s only pandemic plan and envisaged the possibility of 800,000 deaths. \u201cMy view at that time was preparing for a no-deal exit took precedent over completion of some of these pieces of work for a short period of time,\u201d Reed said. Hugo Keith KC, counsel to the inquiry, challenged Reed over the priorities. He said that given a significant number of care home residents would probably die in a flu pandemic, \u201cwhy did no one say we cannot afford to stop the pandemic preparedness?\u201d She said no-deal Brexit had been a \u201creal and present and credible threat\u201d while a pandemic was \u201cthe risk of a threat\u201d.

            "date": "2023-06-20T13:35:08Z",
            "content": "In the alternative universe in which I advise David Cameron, here\u2019s what I would have proffered in advance of his appearance at the Covid inquiry: offer a concession of failure on the part of your administration, presenting an image of humility without inviting public anger. Crucially, deflect attention away from the policies you pursued that stripped Britain of its defences when the pandemic hit. Nothing fits the bill better than expressing regret that, in discussions about possible pandemics, there was too much of a focus on influenza at the expense of coronaviruses. It\u2019s calibrated to steal headlines. Rather than say \u201cDavid Cameron denies austerity left Britain unprepared for Covid\u201d, there will be a sense of you looking reflective about how things could have been done differently. Who knows if any such conversations actually happened. But that appears to be the chosen strategy, and it has worked. It says something about our political culture that we have spent 20 months interrogating Boris Johnson\u2019s dishonesty and illicit partying \u2013 outrageous behaviour, to be sure \u2013 rather than a far graver pandemic scandal. That Cameron was subjected to just a two-hour interrogation at the inquiry is revealing of skewed priorities. In British politics, style is given heftier weight than substance: thus Johnson\u2019s vulgarity is considered a graver sin than, say, how Cameron and his sidekick, George Osborne, shredded the social fabric of the country and left us brutally exposed to an external shock like Covid. Sure, Cameron reeled off the well-honed lines of a former PR man. Interrogating him, Kate Blackwell KC made it clear she would not engage in political arguments surrounding austerity, but Flashman had other thoughts. Britain would have ended up like Greece without cuts, he claimed \u2013 a risible nonsense \u2013 and cuts returned the economy to health. The truth was that with interest rates then at nearly zero, \u201cextra borrowing had essentially no impact on long-term government bond (gilt) rates\u201d, as the economist Jonathan Portes put it. The government could have invested money without dire economic consequences, but it was more interested in an ideologically charged project of shrinking the state, and inventing a dividing line to torture the Labour party. Cameron\u2019s claim that the NHS budget was protected because \u2013 unlike other government departments \u2013 spending on it increased, is classic Tory smoke and mirrors too. As the King\u2019s Fund put it in 2015, under the Cameron-Osborne regime, the NHS suffered the lowest annual average real increase in spending since it was founded in 1948. As former health secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted last year, NHS staff shortages left the country exposed to a major health crisis. Cuts to social care also \u201cwent too far\u201d, he confessed, making it a \u201csilent killer\u201d. When you adjust for an ageing and growing population, as esteemed professor of epidemiology Sir Michael Marmot puts it, NHS spending actually went down. That\u2019s before you even discuss a chaotic top-down reorganisation and never-ending real-terms pay cut for burnt-out staff. The government \u201cground down and pulled apart public health systems until they were threadbare,\u201d as the chairman of the British Medical Association, Phil Banfield, puts it. Conceding even an inch to claims that this multipronged assault on the NHS did anything other than undermine pandemic preparedness is to indulge a politician lost in the murky no man\u2019s land separating fantasist and conman. Presented with evidence that health inequalities worsened under his government, Cameron swatted away any suggestion austerity was responsible. This \u201cflies in the face of scientific opinion\u201d, in Prof Marmot\u2019s words \u2013 a polite way of describing our former prime minister as a flat Earther. One striking indicator of this is that life expectancy for the poorest people actually fell. Why does this matter? Because Covid was a heat-seeking missile for health inequalities. Those with bad underlying health were more likely to become seriously ill, and to die: and they were disproportionately drawn from the ranks of the British poor, among whom minorities are overrepresented. We could go on: our already insultingly inadequate statutory sick pay \u2013 the lowest of the industrialised OECD countries \u2013 was allowed to fall in real terms, and millions weren\u2019t even eligible for that. Here was a deadly incentive for employees fearing for their ability to provide for their families to opt for work over self-isolation. While there has been much-needed discussion about Johnson\u2019s lockdown failures, there has yet been no reckoning on how the virus flourished amid economic insecurity. Yes, tales of No 10 staff drunkenly vomiting and bellowing karaoke songs while bereaved relatives couldn\u2019t hold the hands of dying loved ones is maddening. Yes, Johnson is powered by deceit, an obvious fact that should have been rather more politically salient earlier on. But is not leaving Britain desperately vulnerable to national catastrophe \u2013 through a series of ideologically driven policy decisions that cost many thousands of our fellow citizens their lives \u2013 not a greater scandal? Yes, Osborne has also been peeled away from his new vocation as sage political pundit to be interrogated, but \u2013 like Cameron \u2013 it was for an all too brief session. That austerity failed on its own terms \u2013 it delivered the worst squeeze in living standards in modern times and stagnant growth without eliminating the deficit \u2013 is one thing. But these men also left their own citizens gruesomely exposed to terrible danger. If we are to avoid future catastrophes, the Covid inquiry should spend weeks examining what they did, not hours. Partygate is the scandal that felled a prime minister, but Cameron and Osborne are the principal architects of our national ruin, and history should record that, even if this inquiry does not.

            "content": "David Cameron has admitted failures in his government\u2019s preparations for a pandemic but defended the austerity drive that he and his chancellor, George Osborne, imposed, saying \u201cyour health system is only as strong as your economy\u201d. The former prime minister repeatedly told the Covid inquiry it was a mistake that \u201cmore time and more questions\u201d were not focused on tackling what turned out to be a \u201chighly infectious, asymptomatic\u201d pandemic. He suggested a review of the swine flu epidemic could have been a good time to assess the risks of a wide range of pandemics, claiming Dame Deirdre Hine\u2019s independent review on swine flu did not make the recommendations that would have been necessary to prepare for a pandemic like coronavirus. But he strongly defended his government\u2019s austerity programme, which unions have said \u201cground down and pulled apart public health systems\u201d with cuts that meant the health service \u201cdidn\u2019t stand a fighting chance\u201d. As he became the first politician to give evidence to the UK-wide public inquiry, the PM from 2010 to 2016 accepted that his government was repeatedly warned about the pressures facing the NHS, but he insisted Britain had the financial capacity to roll out schemes such as furlough during Covid because of his government\u2019s ability to \u201cget control of the finances and increase funding for the health service at the same time\u201d. Prof Philip Banfield, the chair of the British Medical Association, has said there was \u201cno doubt that both staff and patients were put in harm\u2019s way\u201d because of underfunding in the decade running up to the arrival of Covid-19. The inquiry saw internal documents that revealed how in 2019, 16 separate pandemic preparation projects were \u201cstopped\u201d or reduced as a result of planning for a no-deal Brexit. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had to allocate 70 staff to no-deal planning, and projects dropped included a \u201cpandemic influenza strategy refresh\u201d \u2013 which was supposed to examine how countries in Asia, such as South Korea, had dealt with previous coronavirus pandemics \u2013 planning for a \u201chealthcare surge\u201d and benchmarking the NHS\u2019s preparedness internationally. As it entered its second week, the inquiry also heard that 14 of the 22 recommendations from the 2016 flu pandemic exercise Cygnus had not been completed by the time Covid hit. These included the need to \u201cdevelop plans for social care facilities to support clients who are discharged from hospital\u201d. An internal DHSC report after the first wave of Covid said the pandemic highlighted \u201cglaring omissions\u201d in preparedness, \u201cmeaning that the social care system was not able to respond to a major health emergency\u201d. Declassified documents, meanwhile, showed the government identified in 2019 that a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d outbreak of an emerging respiratory coronavirus infection in the UK was a reasonable worst-case scenario for a pandemic. But planners thought it would only kill 2,000 people on the basis that it would not spread. There was a \u201cflaw in the thinking\u201d, said Sir Chris Wormald, the permanent secretary at the DHSC, because they also knew that an emerging infection may \u201cdevelop the ability to transmit rapidly human to human\u201d. However, the plans were all about flu with the mantra \u201cready for flu, ready for anything\u201d, he said. Cameron said his government was \u201cvery concerned about potential pandemics \u2026 But it does still come back to this issue of why so much time spent on a flu pandemic and not so much on these others.\u201d He told the inquiry it was \u201cwrong to say we [were] preparing for the wrong pandemic\u201d. He said there \u201ccould still be pandemic flu, and it\u2019s good that we have been prepared for that but \u2026 a long time was spent preparing for a pandemic that didn\u2019t happen rather than the one that did happen\u201d. \u201cThe regret \u2026 is more questions weren\u2019t asked about the sort of pandemic that we faced,\u201d said Cameron. \u201cBut I think many other countries are in the same boat of not knowing what was coming.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary under Cameron who will also be cross-examined this week, has told the inquiry in a witness statement: \u201cOur preparations were affected by an element of groupthink. We knew that the spread of many distinct types of virus could create a pandemic, yet our shared belief was that the most likely scenario was a pandemic flu.\u201d The inquiry continues."

            "content": "Steve Barclay frustrated health officials by delaying the Treasury\u2019s signoff on the Covid vaccine programme, amid wider hold-ups by the department in approving the financing for the project, a new book about the NHS has claimed. Barclay, who is now the health secretary, has rejected the claim. But one senior figure in the vaccine programme told journalist Isabel Hardman that Barclay, who was then chief secretary to the Treasury and lead minister on the vaccine taskforce, was a block. \u201cHe was a total dick, a total control freak but also not very good at it,\u201d they told Hardman. \u201cHe refused to sign off the vaccine programme for ages, saying \u2018Is it value for money?\u2019\u201d Barclay has said this is incorrect, and that he took \u201csignificant risk and acted early\u201d. An ally of Barclay said a contemporaneous timeline of his meetings and correspondence showed he had moved swiftly. Hardman\u2019s book, Fighting for Life: The Twelve Battles That Made Our NHS, and the Struggle for Its Future, claims the wider culture in the Treasury was so slow that other officials allowed vaccinations to begin 10 days before the formal signoff for its business case. The decision by Chris Wormald, the permanent secretary at the health department, and Simon Stevens, the then chief executive of NHS England, meant that by the time the business case was approved nearly a million people had already been vaccinated. Another unnamed insider said of the Treasury: \u201cIt took months for them to sign off anything, and so they [the health department and NHS England] had to ignore them and get on with spending the money anyway.\u201d The book adds that Kate Bingham, who led the vaccine taskforce, was so unimpressed by the number of irrelevant forms that needed filling in that she complained to Boris Johnson. Johnson in turn questioned Rishi Sunak, Barclay\u2019s boss at the time, who was unaware of the delay as officials had not kept him up to date. \u201cVaccines had clearly not been high on the list of priorities for the chancellor\u2019s office,\u201d Bingham wrote in her own book about the project. Hardman\u2019s book goes on to say that Johnson was so enthused about the idea of rapid vaccination \u2013 in part for the potential political dividends \u2013 that he was keen for vaccine centres to be open 24 hours a day, even though officials warned it would be hard to fill slots in the middle of the night, especially with a first cohort of mainly older people. The book says Johnson was encouraged in this ambition by Tony Blair, with the former Labour PM saying he would happily queue at any time to get his vaccination. It adds: \u201cThis amused Blair\u2019s former colleagues, who pointed out that the former prime minister had probably last queued for anything in the mid-1990s.\u201d In the end, Stevens and others persuaded Johnson that all-night appointments were not the best way forward, although a handful of centres did offer a few 24-hour slots, \u201cwhich seemed to satisfy the prime minister\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 June 2023. An earlier version said that Chris Wormald was the permanent secretary at the health department \u201cat the time\u201d; in fact he is still in that position."

            "date": "2023-06-28T17:14:55Z",
            "content": "The first new tuberculosis vaccine in 100 years may be within reach, after the announcement that more than $500m (\u00a3395m) has been pledged by philanthropic institutions for final trials involving 26,000 people in Africa and south-east Asia. The M72/AS01E vaccine, developed by the giant pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, was shown to be 50% effective in phase 2b trials in 2018, but the company pulled out rather than invest in the large-scale trials needed for a licence, saying it did not see a market. In 2020, GSK passed the licence to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute, a biotech nonprofit spin-off from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation, which was already investing in the vaccine, will put up around $400m for the phase 3 trials, while the global charitable organisation Wellcome will provide up to $150m. \u201cTB remains one of the world\u2019s deadliest infectious diseases,\u201d said Julia Gillard, the chair of Wellcome. \u201cThe development of an affordable, accessible vaccine for adults and adolescents would be gamechanging in turning the tide against TB.\u201d Vaccines for Covid were developed from scratch in less than a year, yet there have been no new vaccines for TB, which kills 1.6 million people a year, since the BCG (Baccilus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) was introduced in 1921. All UK schoolchildren were once vaccinated with the BCG, but it is now recognised as effective only in the very young, and lasts only a few years. Up to a quarter of the world\u2019s population is infected with the TB bacteria, which can remain latent but be passed to other people, or cause active disease. TB predominantly affects impoverished populations in Africa and Asia, although there are serious problems in eastern Europe and cases of multi-drug resistant TB across the globe. Bill Gates, the co-chair of the Gates Foundation, said: \u201cWith TB cases and deaths on the rise, the need for new tools has never been more urgent. Greater investment in safe and effective TB vaccines, alongside a suite of new diagnostics and treatments, could transform TB care for millions of people, saving lives and lowering the burden of this devastating and costly disease.\u201d The five-year hiatus between the exciting 2018 results in 3,000 people with latent TB and Wednesday\u2019s announcement was spent in negotiating the licence handover and transfer of manufacturing from GSK to Gates, and in investigating the best 50 sites in TB-endemic regions for the final trials. \u201cWhen the results were really strong, there was a tremendous interest in the global health community in moving forward to phase 3,\u201d said Trevor Mundel, the president of global health at the Gates Foundation. \u201cGSK at that point indicated that this was not going to be a commercial vaccine for them. We negotiated a licence with GSK, which was executed in 2020. \u201cThen we had the discussions and negotiations with the Wellcome Trust around co-funding the project because it was an enormous enterprise for both our organisations.\u201d Governments need to come onboard such large projects, which are of crucial importance to health worldwide, say the organisations. \u201cWe hope that M72 is going to be the first of a number of progressive TB vaccines that will be extremely useful. And for that, I think we need this broader set of funders,\u201d said Mundel. \u201cWe would certainly look to governments, and as much as I\u2019ve said that TB is a disease of poverty, it remains rife in many middle-income countries, even in richer regions of the world. Covid has given us all the sense that there are no national barriers that you can hide behind for a global transmission problem like TB. Not paying attention to it, even if you may have a low incidence in your own geography, opens you up to transmission, with increasing migration and the like,\u201d he added. The phase 3 trial will start early next year, and last between four and six years. Researchers will track the numbers of people with latent TB who convert to active TB. If the vaccine is as successful as it showed itself five years ago in a smaller number, it will prevent half the cases of active disease that would have been expected. The World Health Organization says that a vaccine with 50% efficacy could prevent up to 76 million cases and 8.5 million deaths over 25 years. It would save billions in costs for families whose wage-earners are hit by the illness and often have to pay to travel for treatment. The Treatment Action Group (TAG) welcomed the \u201chistoric\u201d investment. \u201cWe hope this funding commitment sparks governments and other funders to substantially increase investments in the TB vaccine pipeline, which contains a number of promising candidates but faces a dire financial shortfall,\u201d said the TAG executive director, Mark Harrington, who urged all involved to improve access to the vaccine should it be approved."

            "date": "2023-06-19T08:09:55Z",
            "content": "Queensland\u2019s corruption watchdog will consider whether to investigate allegations raised in parliament that Liberal National Party MP Warren Entsch helped a political donor get a Covid vaccine in the middle of the pandemic when doses were in short supply. Queensland Health on Monday confirmed it had referred the matter to the state crime and corruption commission (CCC). Entsch labelled the claim \u201cnonsense\u201d. He denied \u201call allegations of wrongdoings or inappropriate actions\u201d. In question time on Monday, the federal health minister, Mark Butler, was asked whether he was aware of anyone getting preferential access to vaccines. In response, Butler referred to reports in the Australian that named Alex Sekler, a Queensland property developer. Butler told parliament there was understandable concern over reports that Entsch arranged for \u201ca local property developer, aged in his 60s, to travel to Thursday Island, to receive a Pfizer dose in that very month of July\u201d, in 2021 when Australia was short of doses. According to donor reports, Sekler\u2019s company Liral Holdings donated $304,000 to the LNP in 2021-22 and he personally donated $13,000 in 2019. Butler said the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) advice at the time was \u201cthat Pfizer not be administered to people over the age of 50\u201d. AstraZeneca was the preferred vaccine for those over 50 until June when Atagi updated its guidelines to those over 60. \u201c[There is] concern that he was taking a dose that was intended to protect the vulnerable members of that community on Thursday Island, and concern that unnecessary travel to First Nations communities exposed those communities to a risk of infection,\u201d Butler said in parliament. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cNow, the member for Leichhardt\u2019s own colleagues have reported on a large donation of $304,000 from this property developer, $4,000 for just one dinner attended by just five people, some dinner it must have been.\u201d The Australian reported the dinner was attended by then prime minister Scott Morrison. \u201cThe member has questions to answer, at a time when his own government was so concerned about protecting vulnerable communities, and other Australians were expected to queue patiently for short dose vaccines and not to charter a private plane to travel to Thursday Island to access one of theirs,\u201d Butler said. In parliament, Entsch vowed to \u201crespond to that nonsense\u201d. He said it was wrong to imply \u201csome sort of quid pro quo\u201d in relation to \u201ca fine gentleman who happened to have made a donation\u201d. Sekler had, the Queensland MP said, made donations to Queensland Health including one of $650,000 to help them prepare for Covid. He was then approached by a health department representative to see if he would donate an MRI machine to the Torres Strait hospital. \u201cThat is the reason why he approached me to know about protocols in travelling up to the Torres Strait, because he was invited up there to actually consider making a donation,\u201d Entsch said. \u201cHe mentioned he was wanting to get [a vaccine], I rang the hospital and asked if it was available, they said yes, I said what\u2019s the protocol, they said if you present we\u2019ve got plenty of it, in fact we\u2019ve got quite a bit that\u2019s going out of date.\u201d In a later statement, Entsch said that, as the member for Leichhardt, he was assisting a constituent. He blamed the Queensland state government for a \u201cpolitically motivated attack\u201d. \u201cI completely deny all allegations of wrongdoings or inappropriate actions,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t be making any further comment as this is now before [the crime and corruption commission].\u201d Comment was sought from Sekler and the CCC."

            "date": "2023-06-20T13:00:34Z",
            "content": "\u201cCancer is my game,\u201d says Prof Lindy Durrant, an immunologist, founder and chief executive of Scancell, which is developing vaccines that could offer a needle-free protection against Covid as well as novel treatments against cancer. Founded in 1997 on the back of her Nottingham University research, the Oxford-based company\u2019s work on treatments that stimulate the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer and infectious disease has put it in a cluster of promising British biotechnology firms. While most vaccines are taken preventively, there is no jab to avoid cancer (apart from the HPV one for the virus that triggers most cervical cancer). \u201cProbably 50% to 60% of people will get cancer and die of it,\u201d says Durrant. \u201cThere are probably 200 different types of cancer. Each of them has a very different signature. So to design a vaccine that covers them all is really hard.\u201d Instead Scancell developed therapeutic jabs that aim to halt or reverse its spread, earning Durrant the Waldenstr\u00f6m award from the Swedish Society of Oncology in 2019. After Covid-19 was declared a pandemic three years ago, she and her team \u201cfelt we should do something\u201d. One of their experimental cancer vaccines looked promising. \u201cWe thought, right, we can adapt this quite nicely to Covid. With the advantage that the vaccine was very much towards stimulating good T-cell responses.\u201d T-cells are white blood cells that form a vital part of the immune system. While the current Covid vaccines mainly generate antibodies that stick to the virus and stop it infecting the body, the new vaccines being developed by Scancell and others prime T-cells to find and kill infected or tumour cells. Scancell began testing its vaccine against Covid variants in October 2021. By that time, the UK had the AstraZeneca/Oxford University jab and because they, and Pfizer and BioNTech, \u201cmoved at lightning speed, the decision was made, we can\u2019t compete with big pharma,\u201d Durrant says. However, early clinical results were positive and Scancell is looking for a partner to take its vaccine forward as a booster, as the virus continues to mutate. An estimated 10% of people will experience symptoms of long Covid, with at least 65 million people worldwide estimated to have it. Unlike most other jabs, the Scancell vaccine is delivered via needle-free, spring-powered injectors that use a narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin. \u201cPeople loved it. I can\u2019t believe how many people are needle phobic even post-pandemic,\u201d says Durrant. She recalls how she always wanted to be a scientist, and loved experiments. Slightly dyslexic, she was \u201cnever particularly good in junior school,\u201d but was soon top of the class at a grammar school in Stockton-on-Tees. \u201cNobody cared how I wrote any more,\u201d she says. Instead they wanted to know: \u201cDid I understand the concepts?\u201d After completing a BA in biochemistry and her PhD in cancer chemotherapy at the University of Manchester, Durrant moved to Nottingham in the early 1980s, the centre of cancer immunotherapy in the UK. There she \u201cfell in love with immunology\u201d and the potential to harness the body\u2019s immune system to fight disease. Scancell\u2019s main focus remains cancer treatments. It is currently testing two therapies on patients, one in skin cancer, again given via a needle-free injector, and another, named Modi-1, for solid tumours in head and neck, breast, renal and ovarian cancers. Durrant learned from rheumatoid arthritis how \u201cstressed\u201d cells alert the immune system that they need to be killed. \u201cI thought, well, autoimmune disease is sort of what we\u2019re trying to do against cancer. We\u2019re trying to get you to recognise your own cancer and kill it \u2026 I was like, I wonder, if T-cells will attack cancer? Yes, that was the novelty basically.\u201d In 2011, when the firm started testing its vaccines in mice, \u201cthe tumours disappeared completely,\u201d she recalls. Initially she was so surprised, she assumed it was a mistake and asked the post-doctoral researcher to re-run the experiment: \u201cAnd she did it again, and there were no tumours. I was like, wow!\u201d The cancer vaccines are being trialled on their own, and in combination with other drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which help alert T-cells to kill tumours. In melanoma, checkpoint inhibitor drugs help cure about 55% of patients, but only 20% of people with head and neck cancer. In a presentation to a major cancer conference in Chicago in early June, Scancell said the Modi-1 vaccine was well tolerated by patients and the early data on its effectiveness when given alone was encouraging. It looks most promising as a treatment for head and neck cancer, where \u201csurgery is quite debilitating and \u2026 it\u2019s very disfiguring,\u201d though Durrant cautions: \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be for every patient.\u201d Immuno-oncology is a rapidly growing market, estimated to exceed $300bn by 2030, according to Allied Market Research. The US firms Moderna \u2013 whose Covid jab has been a huge commercial success \u2013 and MSD (known as Merck in the US and Canada) are also working on a melanoma vaccine and hope to start late-stage trials before the end of 2023. Durrant says her rival\u2019s vaccine is personalised, targeting the patient\u2019s specific mutations, whereas Scancell\u2019s one \u201cis for everyone\u201d. Germany\u2019s BioNTech is also developing a melanoma vaccine, based on mRNA like its Covid jab. Scancell, backed by US specialist healthcare investor Redmile which has injected \u00a340m, floated on London\u2019s junior AIM market in 2010 and has a market value of around \u00a3120m.

            "date": "2023-06-10T15:48:26Z",
            "content": "Ministers have \u201csystematically dismantled\u201d critical vaccine plans drawn up during the Covid crisis and left the country recklessly exposed to another pandemic, one of the most senior figures shaping Britain\u2019s scientific response to the virus has warned. In a damning verdict that comes just days before the official Covid inquiry starts publicly examining Britain\u2019s preparedness for pandemics, Dr Clive Dix, the former chairman of the UK\u2019s vaccine taskforce, said the abandonment of schemes developed during Covid now left Britain \u201cfraught with danger\u201d. In an interview with the Observer, Dix said there was a complacency that mRNA vaccine technology, which worked against Covid, would be a \u201cgolden bullet\u201d against future threats, despite warnings that it may not work against new viruses. He also warned that antibody manufacturing projects had been abandoned, which could have been used to help the immunosuppressed and vulnerable. \u201cIf we take what the UK government has done, they have sort of systematically dismantled many of the initiatives that we had, when they should have held their nerve and taken them forward,\u201d Dix said. \u201cWe helped Valneva build their capability up in Livingston. We encouraged Novavax to come here and use the Fujifilm site up in the northeast and do their vaccine there. \u201cWe had the vaccine manufacturing initiative. We worked with a lot of pharmaceutical companies to show them how good the UK was with our clinical trials network. Most of that has gone.\u201d He added: \u201cThe government has basically put all their money on mRNA vaccines. They\u2019ve gambled recklessly. They have basically assumed mRNA is going to solve the problem. \u2018Let\u2019s forget about all these other vaccine technologies. Let\u2019s forget about manufacturing. Let\u2019s just encourage the likes of Pfizer and Moderna to come to the UK, then we\u2019re covered.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s our pandemic preparedness. Quite frankly, it\u2019s not just reckless. It\u2019s fraught with danger.\u201d His warning comes as the official Covid inquiry, overseen by Baroness Heather Hallett, a former court of appeal judge, begins to take public testimony this week over how well-prepared Britain was heading into the pandemic. The mammoth investigation is set to roll on for years and expose decision-making at the top of government. The leader of the country\u2019s biggest union, Unison, which counts hundreds of thousands of NHS workers as members, said the health service was now less prepared for a pandemic than before Covid struck. Christina McAnea said: \u201cThe pressures were intense pre-pandemic \u2013 now they\u2019re through the roof. The staffing emergency won\u2019t ease in either sector without drastic government action.\u201d Last November, Kate Bingham, the former head of the vaccine taskforce, told a joint inquiry into pandemic preparedness by the House of Commons\u2019 health and social care and science and technology committees that many initiatives set up by the taskforce had been undone, and that key recommendations it had provided had not been acted upon. Chair of the committee, the former Tory cabinet minister Greg Clark, described Bingham\u2019s comments as a \u201cconcerning testimony\u201d. Dix said he was concerned the government had now put too much emphasis on mRNA vaccines that were not a \u201cgolden bullet\u201d to tackle future threats. \u201cWe\u2019ve thrown away and just ignored the other vaccines because they had a few glitches, and they were no better than mRNA,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were standardised technologies that we could rely on. They made some foolhardy decisions. \u201cThe one that vexes me is the Valneva vaccine. When it came out, it was superior to the AZ vaccine. The Valneva vaccine was a whole inactivated viral vaccine. As a technology, it\u2019s semi-foolproof. If a new virus comes along that we\u2019ve never seen before, we just get it to grow in cells. It\u2019s not sexy. It\u2019s not modern \u2013 it\u2019s pretty old-fashioned. But it works. \u201cAnd as a backstop, it is the perfect part of a pandemic preparedness plan. We\u2019re just thrown it all away. It\u2019s as if we\u2019ve ticked that box and we\u2019re moving on \u2013 yet the science doesn\u2019t tell you that.\u201d Rose Gallagher, professional lead for infection prevention and control at the Royal College of Nursing, said she welcomed the Covid inquiry and its findings, but added: \u201cWe cannot wait for the inquiry to conclude \u2013 we must be prepared now. \u201cWe could face another extraordinary pandemic in the near future \u2013 perhaps a new disease we know nothing about.\u201d The public is split on how well the pandemic was handled, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. Two in five (40%) think the pandemic was handled well, and half (53%) think it was handled badly. Opinion splits along party lines, with three in four Conservative voters saying it went well (76%), compared to 26% of Labour voters. Former health secretary Matt Hancock comes out worse in terms of how the public thought the cabinet dealt with the crisis, with a net approval rating of -44%. Boris Johnson is next on -28%. Two thirds of voters agree with Hallett that she should be able to decide what material is relevant to the inquiry - something the government is disputing. A government spokesperson said: \u201cOur pandemic response plans are continuously updated to reflect the latest scientific information, lessons learned from exercises and our response to emergencies, including Covid, and are kept under constant review to ensure preparedness. \u201cThe UK Health Security Agency was set up to combat future health threats, and the Vaccine Development and Evaluation Centre will speed up the development of new vaccines. \u201cWe are also playing a leading role in the 100 Days Mission \u2013 a global collaboration which aims to make diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines available within 100 days of the emergence of a new pandemic threat.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-13T09:10:45Z",
            "content": "This country faces a longstanding mental health crisis, exacerbated by the isolation, fears and uncertainties of the pandemic. This crisis affects all generations, but has been especially devastating for young people. In America today, 40% of parents report being either extremely or very worried that their child is struggling with anxiety or depression. And they are right to be worried. According to a recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one out of every three teenagers in America reported that the state of their mental health was poor. Two out of every five teenagers felt persistently sad or hopeless. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, suicide is the second-leading cause of death among people age 15 to 24 in the United States. Nearly 20% of high school students report serious thoughts of suicide and 9% have made an attempt to take their lives. In recent months I have had the opportunity to visit a number of schools throughout Vermont and have spoken with students, teachers, administrators and parents. As chairman of the US Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, I have spoken with national experts and recently held a hearing on this subject that featured Dr Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general, who has written extensively on this subject. What I have learned is that our young people today face challenges that no generation in modern history has ever been forced to deal with. The pandemic, the worst public health crisis in over 100 years, created fears in children about whether they or their loved ones would get sick or die. That\u2019s an anxiety not easily dealt with by young, developing minds. And let us not forget: over 200,000 children did lose one or both of their parents to Covid and millions more saw relatives and acquaintances become sick or hospitalized. That grief and fear remains long after any national emergency is declared over. The pandemic also brought about a massive disruption in the normal, day-to-day lives of our youth. For the first time in modern history our young people, by the millions, stopped attending school. Not only was their education severely impacted, but so were their social lives. No more getting together with friends after school or on weekends. No more dating. No more team sports. No more theater or chorus. No more doing the normal things that their parents and older brothers and sisters did. But it was not just the pandemic\u2019s impact on health that affected our young people. The pandemic also brought forth an unprecedented level of economic anxiety. It was only a few years ago that, as a result of Covid, millions of workers lost their jobs, lost their health insurance and were worried about being evicted from their homes and apartments. We can all remember the long lines of Americans lining up for emergency food boxes to feed their families. When parents lose their jobs, when they struggle to pay the rent, when they worry about putting food on the table and how to get the healthcare they need, their children are often struggling quietly beside them. And young people know something else. This economy is not working for them. Unless we bring about long-needed reforms, their generation will have a lower standard of living than their parents\u2019. How are they going to afford to go to college or pay off their student debts? Will they ever be able to buy their own home or afford healthcare? Young people are worrying about these things on a daily basis. And then there is the radical impact that screen time and social media have had on the younger generation, something that previous generations have never experienced. According to a recent survey, most kids are spending more than five hours a day on social media or playing video games. Thirty-two per cent of teens surveyed said they were online for five to six hours, 17% reported being online for seven to eight hours and 13% said they were online nine or more hours a day. What is the impact of all that screen time? Well, according to a recent study, 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse. More than 40% of Instagram users who reported feeling \u201cunattractive\u201d said the feeling began on Instagram. About 25% of teenagers who reported feeling \u201cnot good enough\u201d said it started on Instagram. But it\u2019s not just Instagram. The same can be said for Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and other social media platforms. And let\u2019s be clear. When it comes to social media, we are up against some of the most creative minds in the world, who keep coming up with new ways to get teenagers addicted to their sites in order to sell them more products and make more money. Clearly, the mental health damage they do to millions of young people is much less important to them than the huge profits they are reaping. Two other issues have also kept emerging in my discussions with young people. They are deeply concerned about climate change \u2013 and whether the planet that they and their children will be living on will be healthy or habitable. And they also question their government and the kind of political leadership in this country that has allowed this existential threat to occur. And then there is the issue of gun violence. Incredibly, there have been well over 200 mass shootings in the United States this year. They have taken place in virtually every state in the country. Almost all public schools in America now have active shooter drills. For many kids, obviously, the thought of such an attack is extremely frightening and can have a profound impact on their mental health. That is just some of the tragic reality affecting the mental health of tens of millions of young people in our country today. And what are we doing to address this crisis? The answer is: not much. Despite spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as almost any other major country on Earth, our broken and dysfunctional healthcare system allows 85 million Americans to be either uninsured or underinsured. The result: tens of millions of our people cannot afford the mental health treatments they may desperately need. This is just one more reason why we must move away from the horrific system we currently have, which is designed to bring massive profits to the insurance industry and drug companies, and pass the Medicare for All legislation I recently introduced. Unfortunately, as a result of a corrupt and rigged political system, that is not going to happen tomorrow. Further, even with decent insurance, it is hard for many to find the psychiatrists, psychologists, addiction counselors or social workers where they live. As a nation, our healthcare workforce, especially in mental health, is woefully inadequate. Right now, as chairman of the health, education, labor and pensions committee, I am working hard with my staff to address the mental health crisis within the current political realities we face. We are drafting legislation to greatly increase the number of mental health providers in the country and get them into the schools and communities where they are needed most. We are also fighting for a major increase in federally funded health care clinics so that anyone in this country, regardless of income, can get the healthcare they need - including mental health services. But, as important as increasing availability to mental health treatment is, we have got to do much more if we\u2019re going to address the root causes of this crisis. In my view, if we are truly going to resolve the mental health crisis that we face, we will need a political revolution that creates a society based on justice, compassion, human solidarity and a growing sense of community. We can no longer abide the grotesque level of corporate greed that pervades every aspect of our economy. We must move to a society in which people are treated as human beings, not commodities. Our goals are clear. We need to create an economy that works for all, not just the 1%. We need to give hope to those who have lost hope. We need to revitalize democracy, bring new people into the political process and end the corrupt campaign finance system we now have. We need to end all forms of bigotry. Is any of this easy? No. Those who own and control our economic and political systems have endless resources at their disposal to maintain the destructive status quo. But the simple truth is that we have no moral choice. If we truly care about our kids and grandchildren, if we care about the very future of our planet, we must stand up and fight back. Let\u2019s do it.

At 21, she belongs to a cohort who left sixth form in 2020 and have had an education plagued with setbacks. This was the first year to take newly reformatted GCSEs with a marking system that meant nothing to most people at the time. During the pandemic, they were abruptly told not to return to school, with no goodbyes and no prom. Their A-levels were cancelled and incorrect grades awarded on results day, which were later corrected. Most started university mid-pandemic. They were sent home for a good part of the first year, and they didn\u2019t start in-person teaching until partway through second year. The second and third years were blighted by significant striking.

Amid arguments that universities should become quasi-mental health service providers, university staff are already struggling under pressure to support mental health. My mother is a mental health professional. She had nine years of university and three years of on-the-job training. I had nine years of university and three years of on-the-job training to become a lecturer. My mother\u2019s training involved learning how to protect her own wellbeing while helping others. My training did not. Most university staff are not mental health professionals, and the few who are need more support. My colleagues are increasingly suffering as they try to support students in what is described as \u201cpastoral care\u201d, but in practice looks like counselling, therapy and crisis work. It is dangerous for both staff and students for us to provide such care. I\u2019m an economist \u2013 should I be assessing whether a student might be suicidal? Students need support, but the solution is not training university employees to act as mental health quasi-professionals. In addition to insulting actual mental health care professionals, adding such responsibilities to a workforce that is already striking over working conditions is not a realistic solution. Many of us are already seeking support personally; we shouldn\u2019t also be charged with providing it. We are in this situation because of the dire state of NHS mental health provision. The Metropolitan police have said that they will cease responding to mental health calls. Shifting the focus to universities is a distraction. The solution is to improve mental health provision across the community, including proper funding for NHS and university support services. I will resist making specific suggestions to support students\u2019 mental health because I am not a mental health professional. Name and address supplied \u2022 I welcome the news that the Metropolitan police have decided that they should stop regular attendance at mental health calls (Met police plan to stop attending most mental health calls prompts concern, 1 June). A similar scheme has already been tested in Humberside with success for patients, who get better treatment from health service staff rather than police. I used to be an approved social worker with mental health qualifications in the 1960s. We ran a system for dealing with patients who might have to be detained in mental hospitals, and very seldom called on the police. This was better for the patients. Bob Holland Cononley, North Yorkshire \u2022 My beloved late mother was mentally ill for 10 years during the 1970s, and was then diagnosed with schizophrenia. During that horrific decade, she was kept safe by kindly policemen when she went out roaming darkened streets. She once boarded a train travelling to London with a holdall stuffed full of notes. She said she was going to New York, where her sister lived. We hastily alerted the railway police at King\u2019s Cross. They apprehended her, then waited for my son to arrive, escorting them to hospital, where she was sectioned. Fifty years later, when poverty and knife crime are rife, my mother would need those guardian angels in blue even more.

            "date": "2023-06-26T23:01:32Z",
            "content": "A record 1.4 million children and young people sought NHS help for mental health problems last year, amid concern that under-18s are struggling with issues including about money and their education. The number of school-age children being referred to child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) has undergone an \u201cexplosion\u201d in the last three years, soaring by 76% since 2019, NHS figures show. That year 812,070 under-18s in England were referred to Camhs for treatment of anxiety, depression, eating disorders and other psychological problems. But far more \u2013 1,425,194, the highest number on record \u2013 were referred during 2022. That was the second year in a row in which referrals topped 1m, amid the continuing impact of Covid on young people\u2019s wellbeing. The disclosure sparked concern that mental health turmoil could be becoming \u201cthe new normal\u201d among under-18s. The figures came from an analysis of NHS Digital data by Young Minds. Separate data collected by the charity show that the main reasons parents call their helpline are that a child is struggling with anxiety, self-harm, anger or aggression, problems with school, including them refusing to attend, and behaviour management. \u201cYoung people today are facing a unique combination of challenges, including the consequences of the pandemic, the cost of living crisis and academic catch-up, which are taking a toll on their mental health,\u201d the charity said. Worries about money are the most common reason why young people (58%) suffer damage to their mental health, but 27% say Covid is still affecting them, it added. \u201cThese new figures paint a devastating picture of how sharply the crisis in young people\u2019s mental health is escalating. \u201cThis explosion in referral numbers has led to wait times being as long as two years in some parts of the country,\u201d said Tom Madders of Young Minds. It is concerned that the government has abandoned plans to publish a 10-year strategy to improve mental health and instead has included that alongside a number of physical health problems in its promised major conditions strategy. Victoria Tzortziou Brown, the vice-chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said that while the jump in referrals was \u201cclearly concerning \u2026 increasing rates of referrals to Camhs could also signify greater societal openness to discussing mental health and a reduced stigma in asking for help\u201d. She also said that young people do not always get the support they need from Camhs, with some being refused treatment altogether. \u201cCurrently, access can be patchy across the country, referrals are sometimes bounced back, and patients may have to wait too long to get the help they need.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to invest in mental health services for children and young people with an additional \u00a32.3bn a year on overall mental health services by 2024. \u201cThis investment means an additional 345,000 children and young people will be able to access NHS-funded mental health support, including through the vital mental health support teams we are rolling out to schools and colleges across the country.\u201d"

The Scottish-born singer cancelled all of his commitments earlier this month, saying he was \u201cstruggling\u201d following the release of his chart-topping second studio album, Broken By Desire to Be Heavenly Sent.

The Brit award-winning singer, 26, addressed his problems to warm cheers from the many thousands of people in attendance, who also chanted his name to the tune of the White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army. Towards the end of the set, Capaldi said he was losing his voice: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna play two more songs if that\u2019s okay, even if I can\u2019t sing properly. I\u2019m really sorry before I go any further. You\u2019ve all come out and I\u2019m really apologising. My voice is packing in.\u201d During a set that featured a surprise fly-past by the Red Arrows, Capaldi admitted his nerves at performing to such a huge audience at the world\u2019s biggest greenfield festival. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m quite literally shitting my pants right now. It\u2019s a lot of people, a lot of faces. This is quite a surreal thing.\u201d After playing through hits including Before You Go, Wish You The Best and Hold Me While You Wait, Capaldi told the crowd he would be taking another break from performing. \u201cI recently took three weeks off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a break for my mental health. I wanted to come back and do Glasto \u2019cause it\u2019s so incredible, so I just wanna thank you for watching us. I was shit scared but you\u2019ve really made me feel at ease.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I hope the Eavises will have me back on, even though it\u2019s been a bit of a shit show. I feel like I\u2019ll be taking another wee break for the next few weeks, you might not see me for the rest of the year. But when I do come back and I do see you I hope you\u2019re up for watching.\u201d The singer said that his mental health issues were a \u201cdirect symptom\u201d of his job. He said \u201ca few panic attacks\u201d and his recent Tourette\u2019s diagnosis were worth it for living the life of a pop star, but admitted that if his mental health worsened he would be forced to give up music."

            "content": "This Wednesday will mark the longest day of the year and not long after the sun comes up the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will publish its latest cost of living bulletin. To say the data is eagerly awaited is an understatement. There is unlikely to be a more significant piece of official data released in the current parliament. The reason is simple. Despite raising interest rates 12 times since December 2021 in an attempt to quell upward price pressures, inflation is proving harder to shift than the Bank of England imagined. Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet to decide what to do about interest rates on Thursday. For the past few months, inflation has come in higher than expected and another disappointing number would rattle financial markets. The Bank will not pay much attention to the headline rate of inflation as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), which currently stands at 8.7%. Instead, the two numbers to look out for are service-sector inflation and CPI inflation excluding energy, food, tobacco and alcohol (core inflation). Both are seen as indicators of price pressures being generated by the domestic economy and therefore not distorted by global factors or government decisions. When the MPC last met in early May, it raised official borrowing costs by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.5% and there was some hope that the peak of the interest-rate cycle had either arrived or was close. Such hopes have since been dashed. In the last published set of inflation figures, service sector inflation rose from 6.6% to 6.9% while core inflation jumped from 6.2% to 6.8%. Since the release of the latest labour market data last week showing a pickup in annual pay growth, the markets have been betting on the peak in rates being 5.75% not 4.5%. Mortgage rates soared as lenders re-priced their home loans. Government borrowing costs rose to levels not seen since the global financial crisis 15 years ago, exceeding levels seen during Liz Truss\u2019s brief and turbulent leadership. Any fresh evidence that inflation is proving \u201csticky\u201d will put immediate pressure on the Bank to toughen up its stance. George Buckley, a Nomura economist, thinks the MPC will be split three ways, with six members voting for a 0.25-percentage-point rise, two opting for no change and one plumping for a 0.5-percentage-point increase. A higher than expected inflation figure would increase the chances of a half-point jump. As a result, Wednesday is crunch time. It is crunch time for Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, who want voters to judge the government by the progress it makes in tackling inflation and calming the markets. Halving inflation during 2023 was one of the five new year pledges made by the prime minister in January, but the decline so far has been slower than expected. To have any hope of winning the next election, Sunak and Hunt need interest rates to come down fast. It is crunch time for the Bank, which has the job of hitting the government\u2019s 2% inflation target and is now facing mounting criticism. So far the brickbats have tended to come from those who say the Bank was too slow to respond to price pressures and has allowed inflation to become embedded. But there are also those who say because interest rates work with a lag, the Bank risks driving Britain into a deep recession. Wednesday is also crunch time for the UK\u2019s housing market and the millions of people paying mortgages. The ONS says 57% of those who took out fixed rate home loans did so when rates were below 2%. Those whose deals expire in the coming months will be refinancing at three times those rates. And because mortgage rates affect demand for housing and consumer confidence, Wednesday is crunch time for the economy. Britain just about avoided sliding into recession over the winter. There is no guarantee it will continue to do so."

            "date": "2023-06-16T04:00:35Z",
            "content": "Nigerians are feeling the strain as their new president pushes through a series of unpopular policies that have earned him praise from foreign investors. Bola Tinubu, who was sworn in on 29 May, has surprised many observers by taking a running start to his tenure of Africa\u2019s most populous country. In little over two weeks he has banished a longstanding petrol subsidy, ejected the country\u2019s central bank governor and ended restrictions on the rate of the naira, Nigeria\u2019s currency. The steps have fired up markets, sending stocks in what is also Africa\u2019s largest economy to their highest level in 15 years. But they have also increased living costs and drawn criticism from many Nigerians who have faced years of economic mismanagement. Joseph Essien, 47, a taxi driver in Lagos, said he had stopped working altogether because he was no longer making any profit after the rise in petrol prices. He said he used to spend about 5,000 naira (\u00a38.40) a day on fuel, which would last him for a day of eight hours and then into the next. Last week he was spending about 15,000 naira on fuel that barely lasted him a day. \u201cOver the weekend I just told myself it wasn\u2019t worth it; I\u2019m just working to pay Bolt [the ride-hailing company] their commission and I\u2019m left with nothing,\u201d he said. Tinubu, 71, who won as the ruling party candidate in February\u2019s election, last week suspended Godwin Emefiele, the controversial central bank governor, after criticising his botched replacement of naira notes in the lead-up to the election. Inflation hit an 18-year high and Nigeria\u2019s debt soared to more than $150bn (\u00a3118bn) under Emefiele\u2019s watch. On Saturday, the national domestic security agency arrested Emefiele \u201cfor some investigative reasons\u201d, without giving further details. Rid of its former governor, on Wednesday the central bank floated the naira to foreign exchange buyers, signalling the end of Nigeria\u2019s control of its official rate, which soon dropped by about 40% \u2013 the biggest fall in its history. Countries including the UK had lobbied for that move as essential to boosting foreign investment. A Whitehall source said it meant \u201cshort-term pain for long-term stability\u201d. Nigerians were already reeling from chaos triggered by Tinubu in the first minutes of his presidency when he declared in his inauguration speech, off-script, that Nigeria\u2019s costly fuel subsidy was \u201cgone\u201d. The move sparked panic-buying before pump prices tripled, leaving travellers stranded. Two states have announced three-day office weeks for their civil servants in response, while one has reduced school teaching to three days a week. Bolt increased its minimum fares earlier this month after the fuel subsidy was dropped but the union for drivers using ride-hailing apps said the increase goes nowhere near covering petrol prices that have roughly tripled. Drivers went on strike last week in protest, and this week suspended the strike while negotiating with Uber and Bolt. Nigeria\u2019s main workers\u2019 union has also threatened to strike. Dosunmu Oluwaseyi, 35, the floor manager of a restaurant in the Victoria Island commercial district of Lagos, said she like many had taken to \u201ctrekking\u201d to work, choosing shorter, cheaper bush taxi routes and making up the difference on foot. \u201cSome people stay at work,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will not be able to go home every day. By the grace of God they should reduce [the price].\u201d Ikemesit Effiong, head of research at analyst company SBM Intelligence, said Nigeria was in \u201cnational sacrifice mode\u201d. The devaluation of the naira combined with the dropping of the fuel subsidy was already causing inflation, he said. He added: \u201cThe hope is that the end of the subsidy regime frees up enough resources, political trust and transparency permitting, to be channelled towards desperately needed infrastructural and social investment.\u201d Some have urged Tinubu, an archetypal \u201cbig man\u201d with a reputation for lavish spending, to tighten his own belt in these times of need. They suggest shortening his convoys of blackout-windowed 4x4s, which can stretch to more than 60 cars, or getting rid of some of the seven aeroplanes in his presidential fleet. Charlie Robertson of the emerging markets investment firm FIM Partners praised Tinubu\u2019s policies, saying they had prevented Nigeria defaulting on its debts, which would have led to rampant inflation. \u201cWe were heading to [the situation of] Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cMillions of refugees pouring across the border desperate for jobs and stability.\u201d He said the fuel subsidy was \u201csimply unaffordable\u201d, and freeing up the naira would encourage investment in the country and could boost a stagnant private sector, potentially creating jobs. But he added: \u201cThis is the easy stuff to do. The hard stuff is to make the country ready for industrialisation and a boom.\u201d For now Essien, the taxi driver, sits at home with his family, desperately learning the coding language Python. \u201cBy the end of this month I hope to be able to get a grasp of an aspect of it, and look for remote jobs,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2023-06-03T00:30:13Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has finished briefing the nation on the bipartisan deal that pulled the nation back from the brink of its first default which would have led to \u201ceconomic collapse\u201d, Biden said. Biden described the bill\u2019s enactment as \u201cessential to the progress we\u2019ve made over the last few years\u201d in \u201ckeeping full faith and credit of the United States of America and passing a budget that continues to grow our economy and reflects our values as a nation\u201d. Biden said he would sign the bill Saturday, with just two days left before the 5 June default deadline. Once enacted, the law will suspend the government\u2019s borrowing limit until January 2025, ensuring the issue will not resurface before the next presidential election. As part of his negotiations with McCarthy, Biden agreed to some spending cuts and new work requirements for benefits programs. Those policies were denounced by progressives in Congress, many of whom opposed the debt ceiling bill in protest. Read the Guardian\u2019s full story on the address here. In a celebratory address, Joe Biden touted the benefits of bipartisanship and the ways that the debt ceiling bill will benefit veterans, improve the US\u2019s infrastructure, and lead to lower drug prices. \u201cUnity is hard but we can never stop trying because in moments like this, one where the American and world economy is at risk of collapsing, there\u2019s no other way,\u201d Biden said during the address. \u201cWe need to see each other not as adversaries but other Americans.\u201d His remarks mark the end of weeks of heated debate the ended with a number of concessions for democrats including modest cuts and changes to the work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs. This agreement shelves the volatile debt ceiling issue until 2025, after the next presidential election. To kick off his first oval office address, Joe Biden emphasizes number of bipartisan legislations he\u2019s signed and commends House speaker Kevin McCarthy for working to reach an agreement on the debt ceiling. \u201cThere were extreme voices taking America into default, nothing would have been more irresponsible, nothing would have been more catastrophic \u2026 eight million Americans would have lost their jobs,\u201d Biden said from the oval office. \u201cWe averted an economic crisis and economic collapse.\u201d Joe Biden is set to address the nation from the Oval Office in just a few minutes. He will be talking about the recent down-to-the-wire bipartisan vote that came on Thursday as the nation sat on the brink of default. Though the final version of the bill will not be signed until Saturday at the earliest, Biden will tell Americans about the negotiations that led to the dramatic night-time vote. \u201cNo one got everything they wanted but the American people got what they needed. We averted an economic crisis and an economic collapse,\u201d an excerpt of Biden\u2019s speech reads. \u201cNo one gets everything they want in a negotiation, but make no mistake: this bipartisan agreement is a big win for our economy and the American people,\u201d Biden tweeted after the Senate voted 63 to 36 to pass the deal. As part of the negotiations over the bill, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy successfully pushed for modest government spending cuts and changes to the work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs. \u201cThe fact remains that the House majority never should have put us at risk of a disastrous, self-inflicted default in the first place,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat. \u201cWe should prevent the debt ceiling from being used as a political hostage and stop allowing our country to be taken up to the edge of default.\u201d Hello, I\u2019m Aben\u00e9 Clayton, and I will be taking over the blog from the West Coast. Joe Biden is expected to address the nation from the Oval Office to discuss the debt ceiling deal at 7pm eastern time. I\u2019ll be sharing all of the updates from Biden\u2019s talk here. Stay tuned for all of the latest. It\u2019s nearly 6pm in Washington DC. Here\u2019s a wrap up of the day\u2019s key events: Lawmakers in Connecticut voted on Friday to prohibit anyone under 18-years old from being issued a marriage license. The legislation got passed in the Senate unanimously after a 98-45 bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives in May. A federal judge who was presiding over Disney\u2019s lawsuit against Florida governor Ron DeSantis has disqualified himself, citing a third-degree relative who has stock in the company \u201cwhich could be substantially affected by the outcome of this case\u201d, according to CNN. Walker had denied a motion from DeSantis\u2019 lawyers to disqualify him from the case, saying that questions in previous cases raised \u201csubstantial doubts\u201d about his impartiality. Youtube announced today that it will no longer remove videos that make false claims about the 2020 election, saying in a blog post that continuing to remove these videos could \u201chave the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.\u201d The video platform said that it has removed \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of videos since it implemented its policy against election misinformation in December 2020. Credit rating agency Fitch said on Friday that a downgrading of the US government credit rating is still possible, despite Congress passing a bipartisan bil to raise the debt ceiling. Fitch has put the US on a negative credit watch and said that while the passing of the bill is a \u201cpositive consideration\u201d, \u201crepeated political standoffs\u201d over the debt limit \u201clowers confidence in governance on fiscal and debt matters.\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Joe Biden won\u2019t be signing the debt ceiling bill that passed Congress until tomorrow at the earliest. \u201cIt won\u2019t be today. The House and the Senate have to do their business, so we\u2019re going to work very quickly to get this done to make sure we can sign it hopefully as soon as tomorrow,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that the debt ceiling must be raised by 5 June, which means that Biden must sign the bill by the weekend to avoid default. Jean-Pierre said the White House is confident they can get the bill signed before June 5. The Republican National Committee is tightening the requirements candidates will have to meet in order to get on the debate stage in August. There are nine Republican 2024 presidential candidates so far, and a handful more are expected to announce their runs in the coming weeks. A Florida man who stormed the US Capitol on January 6 was sentenced on Friday to three years in prison, the latest in a string of prison sentences for those who participated in the January 6 insurrection. 45-year-old David Moerschel, a neurophysiologist from Punta Gorda, Florida, was convicted in January with three other members of the Oath Keepers, reported the Associated Press. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has invited Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to speak to Congress during his visit to Washington DC on June 22. Modi will also meet with Joe Biden for a state dinner that night. In a letter to Modi, McCarthy said that Modi in his address \u201cwill have the opportunity to share your vision for India\u2019s future and speak to the global challenges our countries both face.\u201d The US is not yet out of the woods on a potential credit downgrade, even though Joe Biden is scheduled to sign the debt ceiling bill tonight to avert a federal default. Fitch Ratings said this afternoon that it will maintain its \u201cnegative watch\u201d on the US rating as the credit rating agency considers \u201cthe full implications of the most recent brinkmanship episode and the outlook for medium-term fiscal and debt trajectories.\u201d In a statement marking National Gun Violence Awareness Day, Joe Biden called on Congress to pass gun control legislation, with sharp words against Republicans on their passiveness on the issue. \u201cA broad majority of Americans want to see commonsense reforms that would curb our gun violence epidemic \u2013 like establishing universal background checks, requiring safe storage of firearms, and finally banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,\u201d he wrote. The justice department is closing its investigation into classified documents that were found at the home of the former vice-president Mike Pence, CNN is reporting, citing a letter from the justice department. The FBI \u201chave conducted an investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information\u201d, the letter said. \u201cBased on the results of that investigation, no criminal charges will be sought.\u201d House Republicans are looking into the FBI\u2019s investigation into the classified documents that were found in a raid of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home last year. The House judiciary committee chair, Jim Jordan, a Trump ally, sent a letter yesterday to the attorney general, Merrick Garland, demanding information about the FBI\u2019s involvement in a special counsel investigation into the documents. The US economy added 339,000 jobs in May, far surpassing economists\u2019 forecast for the month, which predicted about 190,000 jobs. This is all despite the fact that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to its highest levels in over a decade, in an attempt to cool inflation and gently slow the economy. That\u2019s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. Thank you for following along. An appeals court ruling has revived an anti-discrimination lawsuit accusing an Albuquerque teacher of cutting off one Native American girl\u2019s hair and asking another if she was dressed as a \u201cbloody Indian\u201d during class on Halloween. Associated Press reports: Outrage over the girls\u2019 treatment propelled legislation in New Mexico and beyond that prohibits discrimination based upon hairstyle and religious head garments. The American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s lawsuit accused Albuquerque Public Schools and a teacher of discrimination and fostering a hostile learning environment. ACLU of New Mexico Deputy Director Leon Howard said the ruling affirms that public schools are subject to antidiscrimination protections in the New Mexico Human Rights Act. The appellate ruling validates that all \u201cstudents must feel safe at school and confident that their culture, history, and personal dignity are valued and respected by the public schools they attend,\u201d Howard said in a statement. A lower court had determined that a public high school does not qualify as a \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d under the state\u2019s civil rights law. The appellate ruling returns the lawsuit to state district court for a hearing on its merits. \u201cIf a public secondary school official in their official capacity were to refuse services to an individual based on the individual\u2019s race, religion, or sexual orientation, then the New Mexico Human Right Act would surely apply,\u201d Appeals Court Judge J. Miles Hanissee wrote. Lawmakers in Connecticut voted on Friday to prohibit anyone under 18-years old from being issued a marriage license. The legislation got passed in the Senate unanimously after a 98-45 bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives in May. Currently, in the state, a 16 or 17-year old can obtain a marriage license of their local probate court judge approves a petition that gets filed on the minor\u2019s behalf by a parent or guardian, the Associated Press reports. According to a spokesperson from Democratic governor Ned Lamont office, the governor is planning sign the legislation into law. During the vote, senator Herron Gaston told his colleagues that his sister was married to a 50-year old man while she was 17-years old. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the devastating impact it has had on her physically, how it deprived her of her innocence and of her childhood,\u201d he said. \u201cShe bore five children from this marriage and eventually had to flee from the island of Saint Lucia and down to Florida in order to get away from her abuser,\u201d the Associated Press reports. A US air force colonel \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he said at a Royal Aeronautical Society conference last month that a drone killed its operator in a simulated test because the pilot was attempting to override its mission, according to the society. Guardian staff and agencies report: The confusion had started with the circulation of a blogpost from the society, in which it described a presentation by Col Tucker \u201cCinco\u201d Hamilton, the chief of AI test and operations with the US air force and an experimental fighter test pilot, at the Future Combat Air and Space Capabilities Summit in London in May. According to the blogpost, Hamilton had told the crowd that in a simulation to test a drone powered by artificial intelligence and trained and incentivized to kill its targets, an operator instructed the drone in some cases not to kill its targets and the drone had responded by killing the operator. The comments sparked deep concern over the use of AI in weaponry and extensive conversations online. But the US air force on Thursday evening denied the test was conducted. The Royal Aeronautical Society responded in a statement on Friday that Hamilton had retracted his comments and had clarified that the \u201crogue AI drone simulation\u201d was a hypothetical \u201cthought experiment\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve never run that experiment, nor would we need to in order to realise that this is a plausible outcome,\u201d Hamilton said. For more details, click here: A federal judge who was presiding over Disney\u2019s lawsuit against Florida governor Ron DeSantis has disqualified himself, citing a third-degree relative who has stock in the company \u201cwhich could be substantially affected by the outcome of this case\u201d, according to CNN. Walker had denied a motion from DeSantis\u2019 lawyers to disqualify him from the case, saying that questions in previous cases raised \u201csubstantial doubts\u201d about his impartiality. The judge criticized DeSantis\u2019 lawyers, who \u201ccherry-pick language from these cases to support their position without acknowledging the wholly distinguishable context underlying each decision\u201d. Disney filed a lawsuit against DeSantis in April saying that the governor violated the company\u2019s right to free speech after it spoke out against the state\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law that banned instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. DeSantis took over the special district that Disney ran at its massive theme park in Florida near Orlando. Here\u2019s quick summary of what\u2019s happened today: Though the debt ceiling bill has passed Congress, the bill won\u2019t be signed by the White House by Saturday at the earliest. The White House said that it is waiting for lawmakers to wrap up the bill and send it to Joe Biden\u2019s desk for signing. Meanwhile, credit agency Fitch said that it could still downgrade the US government\u2019s credit rating even though a deal has been passed. The agency said that the standoff over the limit \u201clowers confidence\u201d in the ability of the government to pay its bill. The Republican National Committee set its requirements for qualifying for its first presidential debate in August. Candidates will need at least 40,000 individual campaign donors and poll at 1% across multiple national polls. The Department of Justice closed its investigation into Mike Pence for his having classified documents in his Indiana home. Pence faces no charges. The closing of the investigation comes as Pence is gearing up to announce a run in the 2024 election. Joe Biden is set to sign the debt ceiling bill that passed the Senate last night. He will deliver remarks tonight on the bill at 7 pm. Stay tuned for more live updates. Youtube announced today that it will no longer remove videos that make false claims about the 2020 election, saying in a blog post that continuing to remove these videos could \u201chave the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm\u201d. The video platform said that it has removed \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of videos since it implemented its policy against election misinformation in December 2020. \u201cThe ability to openly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial or based on disproven assumptions, is core to a functioning democratic society \u2013 especially in the midst of election season,\u201d the company said. The company said it will continue to remove content that discourages people from voting or contains misinformation about how to vote. Credit rating agency Fitch said on Friday that a downgrading of the US government credit rating is still possible, despite Congress passing a bipartisan bil to raise the debt ceiling . Fitch has put the US on a negative credit watch and said that while the passing of the bill is a \u201cpositive consideration\u201d, \u201crepeated political standoffs\u201d over the debt limit \u201clowers confidence in governance on fiscal and debt matters\u201d. The country\u2019s credit rating has only been downgraded once in history. Credit rating agency S&amp;P downgraded the country\u2019s credit for the first time in 2011 after an impasse between Republicans in Congress and then-president Barack Obama. The downgrade occurred after the deal was made, as it was settled too close to the default date. A downgrading of the country\u2019s credit rating will be costly for the country as it will make it more expensive for the country to borrow money, along with lowering confidence in the American dollar. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Joe Biden won\u2019t be signing the debt ceiling bill that passed Congress until tomorrow at the earliest. \u201cIt won\u2019t be today. The House and the Senate have to do their business, so we\u2019re going to work very quickly to get this done to make sure we can sign it hopefully as soon as tomorrow,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that the debt ceiling must be raised by 5 June, which means that Biden must sign the bill by the weekend to avoid default. Jean-Pierre said the White House is confident they can get the bill signed before June 5. Jean-Pierre did not specify what Congress needs to do before getting it on Biden\u2019s desk. Biden is planning to address the deal in a speech tonight at 7pm. Jean-Pierre said that he will focus on the bipartisan nature of the deal and how it benefits Americans. \u201cWhen you think about what could have happened here, to our seniors, to our veterans, to American families,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cThat is something the president believes he has an opportunity to talk directly to the American people [about]. This could\u2019ve been, as we\u2019ve said over and over again, devastating.\u201d \u201cHe believes this is a good moment to lay that out and how we were able to come together to avert this crisis.\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is holding the daily press briefing right now and addressed a question on Joe Biden\u2019s fall last night. Biden was in Colorado Springs at the graduation ceremony of the US Air Force Academy. Biden tripped on a sandbag onstage, caught himself with his hands and was helped up by three people. \u201cHe tripped over a sandbag on the stage, briefly he tripped and got up, and continued what he was there to do,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cThere was no need for the doctor to see him.\u201d Biden addressed reporters upon returning to Washington Thursday night, joking that \u201cI got sandbagged\u201d. The Republican National Committee is tightening the requirements candidates will have to meet in order to get on the debate stage in August. There are nine Republican 2024 presidential candidates so far, and a handful more are expected to announce their runs in the coming weeks. Candidates will have to get at least 40,000 individual campaign donors and receive at least 1% of voters in multiple national polls, according to the Washington Post. The first debate will be held in Milwaukee and hosted by Fox News. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are currently the clear frontrunners, according to polls, with Trump ahead of the Florida governor by at least 30 points. Other candidates, like Nikki Haley and Tim Scott, have been polling well under 10%. Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys have been unable to find a classified document the former president said he had in a recording that was ultimately given to prosecutors, according to CNN. The recording, taken in July 2021 at a Trump golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, has the former president saying that he retained a document on a potential attack on Iran. Prosecutors have subpoenaed Trump for all classified materials and have recovered classified documents throughout 2022. Trump attorneys turned over more documents in March, but it did not include the document on Iran. A Florida man who stormed the US Capitol on January 6 was sentenced on Friday to three years in prison, the latest in a string of prison sentences for those who participated in the January 6 insurrection. 45-year-old David Moerschel, a neurophysiologist from Punta Gorda, Florida, was convicted in January with three other members of the Oath Keepers, reported the Associated Press. Several members of the antigovernment extremist group have been charged for their roles in a plot led by several far-right groups to stop Joe Biden from becoming president after the 2020 election results. In total, nine people associated with the Oath Keepers have been tried with seditious conspiracy, AP reported, including Moerschel. Six have been convicted on the charge. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has invited Indian prime minister Narendra Modi to speak to Congress during his visit to Washington DC on June 22. Modi will also meet with Joe Biden for a state dinner that night. In a letter to Modi, McCarthy said that Modi in his address \u201cwill have the opportunity to share your vision for India\u2019s future and speak to the global challenges our countries both face\u201d. Here\u2019s more on how the debt ceiling crisis will impact the US\u2019s credit rating, from the Guardian\u2019s Joan E Greve. The US is not yet out of the woods on a potential credit downgrade, even though Joe Biden is scheduled to sign the debt ceiling bill tonight to avert a federal default. Fitch Ratings said this afternoon that it will maintain its \u201cnegative watch\u201d on the US rating as the credit rating agency considers \u201cthe full implications of the most recent brinkmanship episode and the outlook for medium-term fiscal and debt trajectories\u201d. \u201cReaching an agreement despite heated political partisanship while reducing fiscal deficits modestly over the next two years are positive considerations,\u201d Fitch said in a statement posted to its website. \u201cHowever, Fitch believes that repeated political standoffs around the debt-limit and last-minute suspensions before the x-date (when the Treasury\u2019s cash position and extraordinary measures are exhausted) lowers confidence in governance on fiscal and debt matters.\u201d As a reminder, the US got its first credit downgrade from Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s in 2011 after another protracted fight over the debt ceiling during Barack Obama\u2019s first term. America was able to avoid default in that episode as well, but the near-miss rattled investors and shook confidence in US debt holdings. Joe Biden plans to give his first Oval office address on the averted debt ceiling crisis, using a setting typically used by presidents for the most significant events to highlight the bipartisan efforts made to avoid a default. Biden will be giving his Oval office address at 7pm ET, Reuters reports. His remarks come as Congress passed the controversial agreement on Wednesday. The deal will increase the country\u2019s debt limit, but comes with new work requirements for federal food assistance. Several progressives including New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, opposed the bill. Far-right Republicans were also against the deal, saying that it didn\u2019t go far enough to address spending. \u201cOur work is far from finished, but this agreement is a reminder of what\u2019s possible when we act in the best interests of our country,\u201d said Biden in a written statement earlier on Friday. Here\u2019s a quick summary of what\u2019s happened so far today: The Department of Justice closed its investigation into Mike Pence for his having classified documents in his Indiana home. Pence faces no charges. The closing of the investigation comes as Pence is gearing up to announce a run in the 2024 election. Meanwhile, Republicans are using their power of a House majority by probing the FBI about its investigation into the classified documents Donald Trump had at his Mar-a-Lago home. Republicans are citing the recent report from special counsel John Durham that criticized the FBI for its handling of inquiry as basis for the probe. The US economy added 339,000 jobs in May, much higher than what economists had expected. This makes the future of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which has shaken the economy, unclear. Joe Biden is set to sign the debt ceiling bill that passed the Senate last night. He will deliver remarks tonight on the bill at 7 pm. Stay tuned for more live updates. In a statement marking National Gun Violence Awareness Day, Joe Biden called on Congress to pass gun control legislation, with sharp words against Republicans on their passiveness on the issue. \u201cA broad majority of Americans want to see commonsense reforms that would curb our gun violence epidemic \u2013 like establishing universal background checks, requiring safe storage of firearms, and finally banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut instead of listening to their constituents, Republicans in Congress continue to do the bidding of the gun lobby. Instead of shielding our kids from gun violence in their classrooms, Republicans in Congress are focused on shielding gun manufacturers from liability.\u201d The Guardian has confirmed reports that the justice department closed its investigation into the classified documents found at Mike Pence\u2019s home. A Pence spokesperson told the Washington Post that he is \u201cpleased but not surprised\u201d that the investigation has been closed. Even though the closing of the investigation clears the air for Pence before his likely 2024 announcement next week, Pence faces a crowded field that is largely dominated by Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. Though Pence was Trump\u2019s vice-president during his term, Pence has since turned against Trump, testifying against him in front of a federal grand jury in April on efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Meanwhile, Trump has said that Pence did \u201csomething wrong\u201d by not standing by him and declaring the election rigged. The justice department is closing its investigation into classified documents that were found at the home of the former vice-president Mike Pence, CNN is reporting, citing a letter from the justice department. The FBI \u201chave conducted an investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information\u201d, the letter said. \u201cBased on the results of that investigation, no criminal charges will be sought.\u201d About a dozen classified documents were found at Pence\u2019s home in Indiana in February by the FBI. A lawyer for Pence disclosed to the agency in January that documents were found at his home after they were \u201cinadvertently boxed and transported\u201d at the end of his term. Pence cooperated with authorities and said that he was unaware the documents were at his home. The clearing of Pence\u2019s investigation comes right before the former vice-president prepares to launch his 2024 presidential campaign. Sources with the campaign say that he is set to kick off his bid next week in Iowa. House Republicans are looking into the FBI\u2019s investigation into the classified documents that were found in a raid of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home last year. The House judiciary committee chair, Jim Jordan, a Trump ally, sent a letter yesterday to the attorney general, Merrick Garland, demanding information about the FBI\u2019s involvement in a special counsel investigation into the documents. \u201cThe extent of the FBI\u2019s bias and reckless disregard for truth \u2026 is nothing short of scandalous,\u201d Jordan wrote in the letter, citing a separate special counsel investigation from John Durham that criticized the FBI\u2019s handling of the raid. The report, released in May, said that the agency relied on raw and uncorroborated information when conducting the inquiry. It also said the department of justice and FBI did not conspire to investigate Trump\u2019s ties to Russia in 2016, but Republicans are focusing on the report\u2019s criticism of the FBI. With their majority in the House, Republicans are now emboldened to prod investigations into the former president. Jordan\u2019s letter shows how Republicans are likely to use Durham\u2019s report to counter the FBI\u2019s investigation into the classified documents. The US economy added 339,000 jobs in May, far surpassing economists\u2019 forecast for the month, which predicted about 190,000 jobs. This is all despite the fact that the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to its highest levels in over a decade, in an attempt to cool inflation and gently slow the economy. In a statement on the jobs numbers, which was released this morning, Joe Biden said that \u201ctoday is a good day for the American economy and American workers\u201d. \u201cThe Biden economic plan is working. And due to the historic action taken by Congress this week, my economic plan will continue to deliver good jobs for the American people in communities across the country,\u201d Biden said, referring to the debt ceiling bill that he will sign today. Biden also touted the unemployment rate, which rose 0.3% to 3.7%, but has still been under 4% for the last 16 months, the longest stretch since the 1960s. Still, the jobs figures hold a bit more complexity for the economy than Biden\u2019s rosy picture paints it out to be. Fed officials have implied an interest rate hike pause could be coming, but it all depends on whether they are satisfied with how much the economy has slowed. And this new jobs report shows that things, in the job market at least, are still hot. Nine Republicans so far have declared their candidacy for the 2024 election, and a handful more will likely announce their runs over the next few weeks, but the election is already shaping out to be a \u201cRon v Don\u201d battle \u2013 and it is still very unclear who will come out on top. Florida governor Ron DeSantis has behind him a flood of cash from the conservative establishment, who find Donald Trump hard to control and a continued political liability with his various legal troubles. Within the first 24 hours of his official campaign launch, DeSantis raised $8.2m, his campaign says. And this was despite the embarrassing technical issues Twitter was experiencing when he made his announcement on the social media site. Trump, in comparison, raised about $9.5m in the first six weeks after he announced his campaign in November. Money doesn\u2019t always guarantee a win, but it does mean that DeSantis will have an arsenal to put up his best fight against Trump. Even with the cash, it may be an uphill battle. Trump has been leading DeSantis in the polls by about 30 points. Trump has consistently polled just above 50 points, while DeSantis has been around 20 points. Still, DeSantis is far above any of the other candidates who have announced their campaigns, which includes the former Trump UN ambassador Nikki Haley and the South Carolina senator Tim Scott. Other Republicans who are gearing up for campaign launches include former Trump VP Mike Pence and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie. Good morning, and welcome to the US politics live blog. With the debt ceiling standoff already in Washington\u2019s rearview mirror \u2013 the Senate passed a bill raising the limit until 2025, and Biden is expected to sign the bill today \u2013 the spotlight is now on the 2024 Republican primaries. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis gave a preview of what is to come over the next year and a half as the 2024 election rolls in. The two Republican candidates held dueling campaign events, one in Iowa and the other in New Hampshire, key states in the primaries. DeSantis in his speeches has been throwing soft punches at Trump, not mentioning the name of the former president, but instead trying to highlight his youth (DeSantis is 44 while Trump is 76) and saying that he can fully serve two terms unlike some people \u2013 who should not be named. But some sparring happened later in the day when Trump responded to this by saying that he could shape things up in six months, not eight years. \u201cWhen he says eight years, every time I hear it, I wince, because I say if it takes eight years to turn this around, then you don\u2019t want him. You don\u2019t want him as your president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019ll take me six months to have it totally the way it was, we\u2019ll have it fast.\u201d Off-stage, DeSantis responded to a reporter\u2019s question on Trump\u2019s comeback with: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he do it in his first four years?\u201d The dynamic that plays out between the two as the election gets closer will be interesting to watch. DeSantis used to be a staunch Trump supporter, which ultimately helped him build a national profile, making it hard for him to come out of the gate with attacks against him. But DeSantis appears to have much of the Republican establishment behind him, as donations to his campaign are showing. He\u2019s still trailing Trump in the polls, but there\u2019s still a year left to change things. Stay tuned for more live updates."

            "date": "2023-06-18T11:00:43Z",
            "content": "The morning light filters through the rooftops and into a slim sunlit alleyway in Istanbul\u2019s Grand Bazaar, and the currency traders who provide a bellwether for the Turkish economy arrive. Each is clutching at least two mobile phones, along with glasses of bitter Turkish tea and packs of cigarettes. There are stacks of mobile phones on a nearby ledge, ready for currency trades to be yelled into them at speed. The mood is palpably tense, cresting into a wave as trading opens and the entire crowd filling the alleyway swiftly transforms into a frantic bidding war. \u201cIs anyone buying dollars?\u201d yells a man in a Galatasaray sports jacket as he leans against the bazaar\u2019s 500-year-old stone wall. \u201cI\u2019ll buy, but only this evening,\u201d yells another. \u201cI\u2019m ready to buy dollars at 2pm \u2013 anyone want to buy? 2pm anyone?\u201d shouts a third trader. \u201cThere\u2019s a liquidity problem. People are trying to sell, but they can\u2019t so it\u2019s getting tense,\u201d mumbles a gold trader named Erdal as he passes by to observe the frantic crowd, before returning to the gold market in the next alleyway as it begins trading. In the three weeks since the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was re-elected to begin his third decade as leader, the value of the lira has tumbled, falling an estimated 16% against the dollar after the first round of the elections in mid-May, according to the Fitch ratings agency. The country is reeling from a profound economic crisis. The lira halved in value two years ago and inflation is officially at 39.59%, although unofficial estimates from Turkey\u2019s Inflation Research Group put it at more than 100%. Economists from Bloomberg estimated last month that Turkish authorities had spent $177bn (\u00a3138bn) on supporting the lira since it plummeted in December 2021. The investment bank Goldman Sachs noted shortly after the election that the lira fell further and faster than they had anticipated, surpassing record lows of 20 to the dollar. As the currency traders arrived at the Grand Bazaar, the lira was trading even lower. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s about 23.5 lira to the dollar, but there are firms trading it at 25-30 to the dollar as an investment in the future, and it\u2019s making things worse,\u201d said Erdal, leaning back on a torn leather office chair in a cloud of cigarette smoke as he waited for the gold market to open. Overhead, another trader leaned around the tangle of electrical wires obscuring the bazaar\u2019s painted stone arches to polish the metallic lettering above a shop. Things were frantic before the election, said Erdal, as crowds of people nervous about the economy flocked to the bazaar to change their money into dollars. According to the Turkish financial outlet Ekonomim, the Turkish central bank itself transported 5bn lira to the Grand Bazaar in order to exchange it for dollars, amid a biting foreign currency shortage that persists today. Now, in a strange state of suspended animation, the traders and the country are waiting to see how the new government might change course on the economy before a much-anticipated central bank meeting on 22 June. Erdal\u2019s dislike of currency speculators did not stop him or other traders deciding to privately invest using their knowledge of the market. \u201cA few weeks ago, we knew the price of the dollar would increase, so we prepared and invested accordingly,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it was worth 18 or 19 before the election, we bought dollars. When it hits 30, I\u2019ll sell. Right now I\u2019m just waiting.\u201d The traders all nod sagely at the mention of the finance minister, Mehmet \u015eim\u015fek, whose reappointment to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s cabinet was intended to signal a shift towards more orthodox economic policies, as well as an end to the government using reserves to support the lira. \u015eim\u015fek\u2019s main task, along with the new central bank governor, Hafize Gaye Erkan, appears to be convincing Erdo\u011fan of a desperate need to raise interest rates in order to combat inflation. \u201cI believe \u015eim\u015fek needs to raise interest rates \u2013 but it might not be enough. We need at least a five-percentage-point raise,\u201d says the trader Cafer Deniz. Others, notably economists from JPMorgan, say a far higher increase of 25% is \u201con the table for 22 June or earlier\u201d. However, Deniz believes the finance minister could raise interest rates gradually in order not to spook the president, who has long spoken of his eccentric belief that higher interest rates cause, rather than curb, inflation and described himself as \u201can economist\u201d in a recent pre-election interview with CNN. Speaking to reporters on his way back from Azerbaijan, Erdo\u011fan told of his willingness to help \u015eim\u015fek succeed, but paradoxically also stated that \u201cmy mind remains unchanged\u201d on issues of orthodox economic policy. He added: \u201cRegarding the present outlook of our minister of treasury and finance, however, we approved that he should take the steps he intends to take with the Central Bank as soon as possible, we wished him success, and we informed him of our resolve to reduce inflation to single digits.\u201d Like the myriad currency and gold traders that mention \u015eim\u015fek\u2019s name, Deniz takes comfort in the economist\u2019s reputation due to his previous stint as finance minister as well as time served at Merrill Lynch in London and at the investment bank UBS on Wall Street. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting good things in the mid to long term,\u201d he says. \u201cNot the short term, however.\u201d His colleague Haci Co\u00e7ak agrees: \u201cThings can change in the blink of an eye right now. It will take time to repair the economy.\u201d The difference between a shift in personnel and policy persists. Erkan is Turkey\u2019s fifth central bank governor to be installed since the economic crisis began in 2018, amid Erdo\u011fan\u2019s increasing influence over the role. Like \u015eim\u015fek, she has worked in the US. A former employee at Goldman Sachs, she was co-CEO of First Republic Bank, leaving the year before it collapsed, and is named in a class-action lawsuit related to the debacle. The ratings agency Fitch said: \u201cThe previous central bank governor remains in the economic management team as head of the financial regulator. Hence, it will take time to determine the durability of any policy shift.\u201d Other traders in the bazaar, desperately reliant on the annual influx of tourists to bring in foreign currency, are feeling less positive about the state of the economy. \u201cIn this period after the election I\u2019d say we\u2019re having the worst season in our history. There are days where we go the entire day without making any sales,\u201d says Hasan Karablut, standing with his arms crossed next to a pile of fake designer shoes. In addition, he says, wholesale prices of products imported from China are rising fast, as well as shipping costs. \u201cWhen the dollar is high, tourists should want to come here and buy things. But it\u2019s not happening right now. I\u2019ve been in this business 25 years, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. Three days ago I didn\u2019t make any sales; I closed my shop early and went home.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-06T13:30:09Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s poorest countries are the biggest losers from a global economy failing to cope with the combined impact of the Covid pandemic, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the tough anti-inflationary measures taken by central banks, the World Bank has said. In its half-yearly update, the Washington-based body said the international community was well off course to meet the UN\u2019s 2030 anti-poverty development goals and warned of the risk of a fresh debt crisis for the most vulnerable countries. The Bank said the global economy was struggling despite slightly revising up its 2023 growth forecasts and no longer fearing a second recession in the space of three years. It said the upbeat news was already in the past and predicted a slowdown in the second half of the year as the impact of higher interest rates in rich countries rippled out to emerging and developing nations. The global economic prospects report \u2013 which focuses primarily on the outlook for the less-advanced economies \u2013 forecast world growth of 2.1% in 2023, down from 3.1% in 2022 and 6% in 2021. Compared with forecasts made in January, growth is expected to be 0.4 percentage points higher this year but 0.3 points lower in 2024. Seven in 10 countries would have slower growth in 2023 than in 2022, the report says. \u201cThe world economy is in a precarious position,\u201d said Indermit Gill, the World Bank chief economist. \u201cOutside of east and south Asia, it is a long way from the dynamism needed to eliminate poverty, counter climate change, and replenish human capital. \u201cIn emerging markets and developing economies, debt pressures are growing due to higher interest rates. Fiscal weaknesses have already tipped many low-income countries into debt distress. Meanwhile, the financing needs to achieve the sustainable development goals are far greater than even the most optimistic projections of private investment.\u201d Gill said emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) were struggling to cope and the optimism that arose as China came out of lockdown proved to be fleeting. According to the Bank\u2019s forecasts, growth in EMDEs other than China will fall from 4.1% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2023. Battered by high inflation, rising interest rates and record debt levels many countries were growing poorer. Fourteen low-income countries are already in, or at high risk of, debt distress, up from just six in 2015. Gill said: \u201cBy the end of 2024, per-capita income growth in about a third of EMDEs will be lower than it was on the eve of the pandemic. In low-income countries \u2013 especially the poorest \u2013 the damage is even larger: in about one-third of these countries, per capita incomes in 2024 will remain below 2019 levels by an average of 6%.\u201d Wars and extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis were more likely to cause distress in low-income countries than elsewhere because of scanty social safety nets. On average, the poorest countries spend just 3% of GDP on their most vulnerable citizens \u2013 compared with an average of 26% average for developing economies. In advanced economies, the Bank expects growth to weaken from 2.6% in 2022 to 0.7% this year and increase only slightly to 1.2% in 2024. The US is forecast to expand by 0.8%, twice as fast the euro area, with both economies continuing to feel the impact of higher rates. The World Bank said it would be hard for central banks to hit their inflation targets and tight monetary policy would mean slower growth. Recent runs on US regional banks were likely to lead to tighter credit conditions. \u201cThe possibility of more widespread bank turmoil and tighter monetary policy could result in even weaker global growth. Rising borrowing costs in advanced economies could lead to financial dislocations in the more vulnerable EMDEs.\u201d"

            "content": "It felt as if I had uncovered a secret I was never meant to witness. Hidden from view, resting on scattered husks of beechmast within the dimly lit confines \u2013 two white eggs. Viewing any bird\u2019s nest always seems like prying, sharing in a confidence with which one has no business. But I reckoned I deserved a peek, having provided the shelter in the first place. Several years ago, I fastened a large wooden box to a tree at the end of my garden in the hope that it might one day provide a home for a kestrel or an owl. Instead a pair of unexpected visitors turned up this spring \u2013 stock doves. I had never recorded stock doves in my garden before, so was delighted when I first noticed their repetitive cooing, the rhythm similar to that of someone pumping up a lilo. A hole-nesting species of farmland and woodland habitats, the stock dove closely resembles an urban street pigeon. Yet it has a wild and wary nature and subtle beauty. Most notable is the spray-can blast of metallic green on its neck. The pair were so shy that I seldom saw them visiting the nest box. But with the aid of a ladder I was able to discreetly check on progress. For three weeks it was just the eggs, illuminated by slivers of light, their touching sides sharing the warmth that stirred life within. Then one morning I discovered two bleary-eyed chicks, fluffy and gormless as Easter cake decorations, squatting amid their shell fragments. As the days passed, the growing young began to bristle with the quills of growing wing feathers until, eventually, they became recognisable as stock doves, their contours smoothed by blue-grey plumage. This is a species that is faring well, much like the ubiquitous wood pigeon. Yet despite being relatively common, the stock dove is less conspicuous than its portly relative and easily overlooked. Perhaps surprisingly, the UK is home to at least a quarter of the world\u2019s population. My garden box, open-mouthed and empty-bellied for so long, had helped add two more doves to national numbers. I checked it again in late June and the fledglings had flown their refuge \u2013 splinters of shell all that remained of the secret I had shared. \u2022 Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

            "content": "AstraZeneca is considering spinning off its business in China and listing it in Hong Kong or Shanghai to shield the multinational drugmaker from geopolitical tensions. Britain\u2019s largest stock-market-listed company has drawn up the plans in attempt to protect its business from the fallout from increasing tensions between China and the US and its allies. Executives at the Anglo-Swedish company have been discussing the move with bankers for several months, although it could still be abandoned, the Financial Times first reported. The spin-out would mean Astra separates its division in China into a new legal entity and lists it on a stock market in Asia while retaining control of the business. If AstraZeneca, which is valued at about \u00a3180bn, presses ahead, it could shield the business from any potential crackdown on overseas businesses by Chinese authorities. Relations between Beijing and Washington have become strained but the visit of US secretary of state Antony Blinken to China this week is seen as a potential thawing in the relationship. Blinken was greeted by China\u2019s top diplomat on Monday, although it is unclear whether he will meet President Xi Jinping during the first visit by a US secretary of state to China in five years. China has become a big market for AstraZeneca, best known in Britain for its Covid-19 vaccine that was developed in conjunction with Oxford University during the pandemic. China made up 13% of AstraZeneca\u2019s global sales last year, bringing in revenues of nearly $6bn of a total $44bn, making it the biggest overseas pharmaceuticals company by sales. Revenues from the US, its largest market, were nearly \u00a318bn. Astra has targeted Chinese biotech firms for acquisitions and discussed strategies for growth in the country. On purchasing the rare disease specialist Alexion for $39bn (\u00a330bn) in 2020, it identified China as an important market to grow the company. A spokesperson said: \u201cAstraZeneca does not comment on rumours or speculations around future strategy or mergers and acquisitions.\u201d"

            "content": "Gold bars, new cars and mobile phones are among the incentives being offered to potential homebuyers by Chinese property developers as they grow increasingly desperate to boost sales. Huafa Tianfu, a developer in the eastern city of Hangzhou, has been offering up to a kilo of gold bullion to tempt people into buying its flats. According to local media reports, the amount of gold ranges from 700g of gold for an 89 sq metre flat, to just over 1kg for a 100 sq metre apartment. Property prices in the development range from 2.2m yuan (\u00a3245,500) to 2.5m yuan. The promotion does not state the purity of the gold, but if it were 24 carat the 1kg bar would be worth about 450,000 yuan, or 18% of the value of the accompanying flat. Another developer in the city has launched a similar promotion, offering free decoration services, parking spaces, up to five mobile phones and a 10-year stay on management fees to prospective buyers. The stunts come as developers struggle to rebuild confidence in a market that has been hammered by three years of economic pain. On Monday, the US bank Goldman Sachs said China\u2019s property sector was likely to experience \u201cpersistent weakness\u201d for years, especially in smaller cities. After signs of a moderate recovery earlier in the year, property has slumped. In a survey of 40 cities by China Index Holdings, an independent real estate company, new home sales during the five-day Labour Day holiday in May were 22% below their pre-pandemic average. In third- and fourth-tier cities, sales were down by 42%. Part of the reason that property developers are struggling to shift stock is that several cities, in an effort to stabilise the market, have banned developers from cutting prices. But investors do not expect such price floors to stay in place and predict property prices will fall, says Dan Wang, the chief economist in China for Hang Seng bank. \u201cThere is simply not enough demand to sustain high prices,\u201d Wang added. Young people, faced with a bleak jobs market, have been putting off home buying and other life milestones \u2013 such as marriage and children \u2013 that may necessitate moving out from their parents\u2019 homes. Another significant factor weighing down on the real estate sector, which makes up 20-25% of GDP, is the spectre of a property tax. In April the government announced that it had completed a national registration system for 790m properties, allowing it to figure out who really owns them. The registration system is the first step towards a proposed property tax that would provide much-needed cash for China\u2019s heavily indebted local governments. The policy has been piloted on mansions in Shanghai and Chongqing but technical \u2013 and political \u2013 barriers have previously prevented it from being rolled out more widely. A property tax is a \u201cnuclear weapon equivalent in housing markets\u201d, said Wang, adding that it could cause house prices to drop by 50%. In China there is the added complication that it would expose the number of homes owned by government officials. However, with the local government\u2019s revenue stream from land leases drying up, many analysts see the tax as inevitable, making property a less attractive investment in the near term. All this means that even the offer of solid gold is not enough to convince most would-be homebuyers. And several customers have complained that after buying a flat from Huafa Tianfu, their gold failed to materialise. A sales representative for the firm told Chinese media that fluctuating gold prices made the bars hard to come by."

            "content": "Rolls-Royce\u2019s new boss has said the British company is ready to rejoin the market for smaller jet engines once manufacturers build a new generation of planes. Tufan Erginbilgic told reporters at the Paris air show on Tuesday that the company was \u201cactually ready\u201d to re-enter the market for engines for single-aisle jets, although it would probably take a decade for a new opportunity to come up. The manufacturer is considering how to grow its business after Erginbilgic joined in January. Looking at opportunities to sell engines for single-aisle \u2013 or \u201cnarrowbody\u201d \u2013 planes is part of a review Erginbilgic has started. On taking over as chief executive of the FTSE 100 engine maker in Janaury, Erginbilgic issued a stark warning over the future of the company, one of Britain\u2019s key industrial players, but on Tuesday he said Rolls-Royce was \u201cmaking great progress\u201d. Rolls-Royce was hit harder than some of its aerospace rivals during the pandemic, cutting 7,000 jobs \u2013 out of a previous workforce of 19,000 \u2013 as revenues from maintaining engines collapsed. The collapse was particularly acute for the company because of its reliance on selling engines for larger \u201cwidebody\u201d planes with two aisles, such as the Airbus A350. However, the \u201cmarket is coming back strongly, definitely\u201d for widebody planes, Erginbilgic said. Rolls-Royce last month said that its engines were flying for 83% of the duration achieved in 2019. The recovery in Chinese travel has been \u201cstronger than we expected\u201d, while travel across the Atlantic has been slower, he said. Rolls-Royce left the market for the jet engines used on medium-sized, narrowbody jets in 2011 with the sale of its stake in a joint venture. However, some analysts have suggested that was the wrong move, as sales of Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 planes have boomed. Longer ranges have allowed airlines to offer more direct flights, rather than connections via regional hubs. Erginbilgic cautioned that a move back into the narrowbody jet engine market was for now \u201ca moot point\u201d, and that the company does not need to build narrowbody engines to survive or grow its business. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 years down the road,\u201d he said. However, the company last month tested its next-generation UltraFan engine at its plant in Derby. Erginbilgic said that experience \u201cand our well-recognised engineering capability will actually position us to enter in the next generation\u201d. The company would probably look for partners if it did decide to re-enter that market, he said. Erginbilgic insisted Rolls-Royce can compete with its rivals, which are working with their next generation of jet engines in the hopes of offering increased efficiency. CFM International, a joint venture between Rolls-Royce\u2019s American arch-rival General Electric and France\u2019s Safran, unveiled new details of its Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (Rise) engines, promising a 20% fuel saving. The engines would have an open fan, dispensing with the engine cover (known as a nacelle) in what would be one of the biggest changes in the appearance of passenger planes in decades. Rolls-Royce shares were up 2% on Tuesday, making it the top FTSE riser. Shares are up nearly 60% this year, since Erginbilgic took over as CEO."

            "date": "2023-06-08T11:16:47Z",
            "content": "The eurozone slipped into recession in the first three months of the year, after official figures were revised to show the bloc\u2019s economy shrank as the rising cost of living weighed on consumer spending. Figures from Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical agency, showed gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023 and the final three months of 2022 after revisions to earlier estimates. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Previous estimates suggested the single-currency bloc had narrowly avoided recession with zero growth in both quarters. The updated figures showed the wider EU swerved a recession after GDP rose by 0.1% in the first three months of the year, after a contraction of 0.2% in the final quarter of 2022. The UK avoided entering a recession at the start of the year, while growth in the US also remained positive. However, GDP volumes in the eurozone and the EU are more than 2% higher than the level recorded in the final quarter of 2019 before the Covid pandemic struck \u2013 unlike in the UK, where the economy remains 0.5% smaller. Households across the eurozone have come under pressure from rising living costs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a sharp increase in gas prices, fuelling the highest rates of inflation since the foundation of the single-currency bloc. With consumers under pressure from the higher energy and food prices, household final consumption dragged down GDP across the euro area by 0.1 percentage points, after a larger 1 percentage-point drop in the previous quarter. Several eurozone economies were in recession or came close to recording two consecutive quarters of decline, including Germany, the EU\u2019s largest economy. France recorded close to zero growth, with flatlining growth in the fourth quarter and a modest increase of 0.2% in the first three months of 2023. Growth across the 20-country single currency area was, however, also dragged down by Ireland, where GDP fell by 4.6% in the first quarter of this year. However, economists have questioned whether the country\u2019s GDP figures reflect the performance of the Irish economy. Inflation across the eurozone has fallen sharply in recent months, with the annual rate cooling from a peak of 10.6% last autumn to reach 6.1% in May \u2013 fuelling speculation that the European Central Bank could be near the end of its cycle of interest rate increases to tame rapid growth in prices. Diego Iscaro, the head of European economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said evidence of a technical recession was unlikely to dissuade the ECB from raising interest rates at its policy meeting next week. \u201cWe see rates rising by 25 basis points. However, the figures reinforce our view that, while policy rates will rise further in the short term, they are nearing their peak,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the effect of higher interest rates still to be fully felt, we project economic activity to remain sluggish during the rest of 2023.\u201d"

            "content": "How very apt to compare the rises in interest rates on mortgages with other European countries (Report, 20 June). In any other aspect of life, taking on a loan when you do not know what the future repayments will be would be very bad financial practice. Yet when homebuyers take on what is likely to be by far their biggest loan, the best they can hope for is a fixed term of two or, at best, five years \u2013 thereafter they are at the mercy of the financial markets and government policy. Why? The mortgage company does not need to raise more cash for their loan, so raising the interest rate during the term of a mortgage seems to be out-and-out profiteering. A fixed-term, 30-year mortgage seems to be far more sensible, and gives homeowners confidence and security. When will we start adopting a system that is fair to all? Tom Carr Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 One way to relieve the burden on those not on (or coming off) fixed-rate mortgages would be to cap the rates that a bank can charge at 1% above their best instant access savings rate. Most banks routinely make billions in profit from interest-bearing debt. They can afford a haircut for a while much more easily than homeowners can bear the costs of relentless rises. Like the energy price cap, the costs should be borne for a period by those best able to absorb them. Dave Hunter Bristol \u2022 I\u2019m no economist, but I\u2019m also not a complete fool. The idea that what we are seeing is an economy that\u2019s overheating and needs lassoing with brutal interest rate rises is simply nonsense. Prices here in the UK are soaring because companies, manufacturers, food producers and, crucially, banks themselves are gouging prices for all they\u2019re worth. This free-for-all is happening behind the dense smokescreen of Putin\u2019s war and the consequences of Brexit. In reality, banks that for a decade have seen their ability to coin it in curtailed by low interest rates are making hay. Paul Greer Southampton \u2022 If high inflation requires that money should be extracted from the public, raising the rate of interest is an irrational way to set about it. The logical way to do it is by raising the rate of income tax, so that the burden is shared across the community in a structured way rather than falling on a section only. Of course that would require a government being honest with the public, and facing the hostility that this would bring, both within parliament and beyond. Kevin McGrath Harlow, Essex \u2022 There is a strange Bank of England dogma that attacking inflation requires a continual increase in interest rates. Yet the rapid increase in mortgage costs and, by association, rents, is of itself inflationary. How much interest rates bear on energy and food costs, two of the major causes of inflation, is also doubtful. If higher interest rates put firms off borrowing for expansion or acquisitions, I cannot see how that helps either. Jerry Stuart London \u2022 The problem for the Bank of England is that it has only one tool to control inflation \u2013 and if the only tool you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail. Price controls were necessary to bring inflation down in the last century. Why are these not being discussed?

            "title": "Why are UK telecoms firms imposing inflation-busting bills?",
            "date": "2023-06-27T14:00:37Z",
            "content": "In the autumn of 2020, bosses at BT were faced with a problem. Britain\u2019s economy was reeling as the second deadly wave of the Covid pandemic took hold, and millions of Britons were still shut out from their offices, working from home. Demand had ballooned for BT\u2019s sprawling broadband network and its EE mobile phone service, as the nation Zoomed in to meetings and switched to shopping online. Its contracts, like those of other telecoms companies, allowed it to increase prices each year by linking them to inflation. But in the lockdowns, with the wider economy in freefall, inflation had collapsed close to zero, limiting the firm\u2019s ability to recoup costs. BT\u2019s bosses took action. In September 2020, the company added a supplementary charge of 3.9 percentage points on top of the usual inflation-linked rise. At the stroke of a pen, a measly increase of less than 1% became a chunky 4.5% rise. Executives at Vodafone appear to have taken note. Two months after BT, they made the same call, announcing contracts would rise by inflation plus 3.9 percentage points. One former Vodafone insider said the company considered how to respond to BT\u2019s pricing change. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be above BT, as this would bring undue attention. But they didn\u2019t want to go lower as it would be a missed revenue opportunity.\u201d In March 2021, other big telecoms companies followed BT and Vodafone\u2019s lead, moving to inflation plus a supplement. TalkTalk opted for a slightly lower 3.7 percentage points on broadband contracts, while Virgin Media O2 went for 3.9 percentage points. It also chose the higher retail prices index (RPI), as opposed to the more commonly used consumer prices index (CPI). By now, the Covid vaccine had arrived, allowing factories and offices to reopen and trade to resume. The rate of inflation ticked up. From a low point of 0.2% in August 2020, it jumped to 2.1% by May 2021, and continued to climb. The original problem with the old inflation-linked rises no longer applied. Nonetheless, in November 2022, iD Mobile (owned by the retailer Currys), and mobile operator Three introduced a 3.9 point supplement. By then, Russia\u2019s decision to throttle gas supplies to Europe had sent energy prices skywards, and propelled the rate of inflation above 10%. In early 2023, when it was clear the Bank of England was struggling to prevent inflation from becoming embedded in the economy, Tesco Mobile introduced the 3.9 supplement for out-of-contract customers. Virgin Media announced that its RPI-linked increases for broadband, landline and TV customers would also include a 3.9 percentage points from April 2024. In total, the Guardian has found the rate was adopted, and is still being used, by six companies across 11 of their mobile and broadband brands. The companies argue record levels of investment are required to upgrade their networks to the latest 5G technology, and to manage the flow of data as video meetings and streaming of TV, film and music become more popular. Virgin Media O2 alone invested \u00a32bn in its network last year. BT argues its price increases reflect the level of investment it needs to make across its networks and service. A spokesperson said the annual rise was contracted, transparent and clear. \u201cWe understand that price rises are never wanted nor welcomed, but recognise them as a necessary thing to do given the rising costs our business faces.\u201d Vodafone said its increase reflected \u201cindustry-specific costs beyond inflation \u2013 which include costly infrastructure projects and investments that help us anticipate and answer the ever-increasing demand for data\u201d. A spokesperson for Virgin Media O2, which uses the higher RPI measure, said \u201cthe suggestion that the industry has a uniform approach to pricing is demonstrably untrue\u201d, and highlighted how \u201ca quick Google\u201d showed TalkTalk added 3.7 percentage points on to inflation, Shell 3 percentage points, and Sky used discretionary rises not linked to inflation. Some smaller operators, including Hyperoptic, Cuckoo and Zen, did not raise prices at all this year. Virgin Media O2 said its price increase applies only to airtime contracts, and not handsets, adding: \u201cWe are facing higher costs ourselves at a time when demand for both mobile and broadband has never been higher.\u201d Sky used an average 8.1% increase across its broadband and TV service in April, below the RPI-linked increases applied by Virgin Media O2. \u201cWe don\u2019t think CPI or RPI should determine what people pay for broadband and mobile,\u201d a spokesperson for Sky said. \u201cNot only does it mean unfair prices for customers, but it also means they are locked into contracts without the ability to leave penalty-free.\u201d Several smaller providers \u2013 including budget brands owned by some of the larger firms \u2013 have kept their pricing competitive. Giffgaff, Smarty, Voxi and Sky Mobile did not increase prices by inflation this spring, and Lycamobile froze its prices for six months. A spokesperson for Three said it understood consumers were under pressure, but that its rising running costs and investment plans meant it had to pass costs to customers. They added: \u201cOur prices remain some of the most competitive in the market.\u201d The telecoms regulator, Ofcom does not regulate prices in the broadband and mobile retail markets, where it says the choice of providers offers enough competition. But it can intervene where a provider has significant market power. In February, it launched an investigation into transparency around mid-contract price rises after finding about one-third of customers did not know this could happen. But its current review will not consider limiting or banning them, and does not address why so many operators chose to add the same 3.9 percentage point supplement. The regulator said: \u201cOfcom has repeatedly called on providers to think very carefully about whether significant price rises are justified during an exceptional period of hardship for many people. However, in recent months, we\u2019ve seen more providers move to an inflation-based calculation, limiting customers\u2019 choice of contracts that are not subject to these price rises. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a close look at these issues to consider whether tougher protections are needed.\u201d Lack of intervention allowed extraordinary increases this spring, the time of year when most telecoms companies put up prices. With CPI above 10% and RPI above 13% in January \u2013 the reference month used for annual bill increases \u2013 consumers faced an increase on their bills of up to 17.3%. For the economy at large, the price hikes have added to the UK\u2019s overall inflation rate for all goods and services \u2013 just as the Bank of England battles to crush inflation by raising interest rates. Annual inflation in telecoms jumped from 3.5% in March to 7.9% in April, and rose further to 9.1% in May \u2013 the highest rate since 1991. Economists say that inflation-plus telecoms contracts risk adding to the persistence of inflation. Paul Donovan, the chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, said: \u201cAny process where you have an indexation of prices which is rigidly built in is going to potentially prolong inflation at least for that sector.\u201d The Unite union, which represents many workers in telecoms, is particularly worried about the proposed merger between Vodafone and Three. If approved by regulators, it will reduce the number of providers that run their own network from four to three in the UK. \u201cWe need the competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, to step in to prevent this damaging merger and stop this endless cycle of greedflation,\u201d said Gail Cartmail, executive head of operations for Unite. The CMA said it would review the impact of the merger. Vodafone and Three argue that by merging they would help to improve competition by acting as a larger challenger to BT and Virgin Media O2, the two largest companies in the mobile market. A spokesperson for Vodafone added: \u201cWe hope [the CMA] will find \u2013 as we strongly believe \u2013 that it will boost competition in the industry and benefit both customers and the country.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-16T09:47:41Z",
            "content": "Back in January, Rishi Sunak presumably thought it was a smart way to try to project an air of confidence and stability from Downing Street after the Liz Truss wildness. Promise something that, according to the collective wisdom of financial markets, was about 95% likely to happen anyway. Thus the first of the prime minister\u2019s five new year pledges to the British people was this: \u201cWe will halve inflation this year to ease the cost of living and give people financial security.\u201d Never mind the fact that the Bank of England \u2013 not the government \u2013 sets interest rates to tackle inflation. Sunak\u2019s calculation, one assumes, was that an easy win was on the cards and he could scoop the credit by being the person who had set the target. Less than six months later, the safe bet looks substantially less safe. Inflation was 8.7% in April, confounding the Bank\u2019s forecast that a faster fall would materialise as we passed the anniversary of higher energy costs. The City consensus for May\u2019s reading, which will come next week, is about 8.5%. Andrew Bailey, the governor, has conceded that inflation is \u201ctaking a lot longer\u201d than hoped to come down. An embarrassed Threadneedle Street is reviewing why its models have proved so wonky. The gilts market has taken a look at this mess and understandably decided that interest rates will be higher for longer because inflation in the UK is stickier than elsewhere. A halving of inflation this year is still possible but nobody appears to have a handle on the interplay between wage increases, a tight labour market, the second-round effects of energy costs and, possibly, corporate pricing power. In any case, a halving from what to what? When Sunak made his promise on 4 January, the latest published reading was the November 2022 inflation figure of 10.7%. The number for December was 10.5% and January 2023\u2019s turned out to be 10.1%. Which one did the prime minister mean to be used? Or perhaps he was referencing a quarterly rate, rather than a monthly one, which would have some logic. Or perhaps the vagueness was deliberately cunning. Whatever the truth, the odd half-percentage point may matter to the final reckoning of the \u201cpromise\u201d. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) last month forecast that year-end inflation will be 5.4%. The blurry nature of the pledge is one reason why Sunak should never have made it. The main reason, of course, is that the government should not be seen to compromise the operational independence of the Bank in any way. Parliament sets the target for inflation - 2% \u2013 and the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is accountable for delivering it. That\u2019s how the system works. The script is not meant to involve the prime minister confusing things by airing additional targets. Mervyn King, a former governor of the Bank of England, suggested in an interview with LBC this week that Sunak\u2019s inflation promise was \u201cnot wise\u201d. You bet. It was foolish and improper. Jagjit Chadha, the director of NIESR, went further last month and argued it was \u201ca complete mistake\u201d to set a target. \u201cThe government should not be stepping into that space. In my own view, it has provided a focal point for 5% inflation this year, and contributed to the persistence [of high inflation], by making people plan around that halving,\u201d he said. In the circumstances, Sunak is in no position to grumble if the promise returns to bite him \u2013 and if consumers, mortgage borrowers and businesses vent their anger in his direction. The prime minister set a target that was not in his power to deliver, and he ignored political convention to do so. The numbers may yet align for him as more rate hikes arrive, but the little political stunt will still have been seriously ill-advised."

            "date": "2023-06-30T12:46:51Z",
            "content": "The eurozone\u2019s annual inflation rate fell by more than expected in June to 5.5% amid sharp falls in the cost of energy, highlighting an increasingly stark divide with stubbornly high price growth in the UK. Consumer prices across the eurozone rose by 5.5% in the year to June, down from an annual rate of 6.1% in May and below forecasts for a reading of 5.6%, according to Eurostat. The EU\u2019s statistical agency said energy contributed the most to the falling headline rate, after a 5.6% fall in the average price in the year to June, compared with an annual decline of 1.8% in May. Food, alcohol and tobacco inflation slowed from 12.5% in May but remained in double digits at 11.7% as households continued to come under pressure from the rising cost of the weekly shop. The Eurostat figures contrast with the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate, which remained elevated in May at 8.7% \u2013 the highest level in the G7 \u2013 amid growing fears the Bank of England will be forced to drive interest rates above 6% to try to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. Separate figures published on Friday showed the UK economy grew at the slowest rate in the G7 in the first quarter of the year, apart from Germany, which is in recession. Neil Shah, the director of research at the investment research firm Edison Group, said \u201cBrexit was partly to blame\u201d as increasingly \u201cstark\u201d differences begin to emerge between the UK and the eurozone. \u201cBritain\u2019s toxic combination of the energy price crisis and deeply embedded labour shortages have resulted in UK inflation being far more stubborn than its fellow G7 economies. Brexit is partly to blame here, reshaping the labour market and putting pressure on employers to raise wages to attract talent. \u201cBritain\u2019s economy, which is heavily reliant on services rather than manufacturing, is another point of difference to the slightly more balanced economies of European countries like Germany. Progress remains slow, yet the EU\u2019s headline inflation figures are going in the right direction. Will we be able to say the same of UK inflation in July?\u201d Economists said most of the reason for the divergence between the UK and the EU was down to the UK government\u2019s energy price guarantee (EPG), which has capped the cost of gas and electricity bills to the equivalent of \u00a32,500 a year for a typical household until July. In the eurozone there have not been similar caps fixing the price over a lengthy time period, meaning their inflation rates better reflect the recent global decline in wholesale gas and electricity prices. After the EPG expires this Saturday, energy prices will be dictated by the newly lowered price cap set by the regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, equivalent to a typical annual bill of \u00a32,074. However, forecasters have said the cost of gas and electricity is likely to only fall slightly by the end of the winter and remain at historically high levels. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said energy prices as measured for the UK\u2019s inflation rate were expected to fall by almost 20% in July. \u201cWe have the cliff edge; some countries are doing different things,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, there was a much more rapid feed through on the way up from higher gas and electricity prices, they saw that earlier for consumers, but are subsequently seeing the falls as well. By the end of the summer the differential [with the eurozone] will be a bit less.\u201d Analysts said the UK was facing larger inflationary pressures owing to labour shortages, as companies across the country push up wages in an attempt to fill near record numbers of job vacancies. The UK remains an outlier for increasing employment levels since the Covid pandemic, amid record levels of long-term sickness among working-age adults. Post-Brexit migration rules have also been highlighted by employers as one of the reasons behind difficulties in recruiting staff. \u201cThat\u2019s the main difference,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere you would see the UK\u2019s specific longer-lasting increase in inactivity, and more acute worker shortages as part of the story.\u201d"

Nick Macpherson, who was permanent secretary to the Treasury under the last Labour government and during David Cameron\u2019s premiership, said the central bank\u2019s \u00a3895bn bond-buying stimulus programme had gone \u201ctoo far\u201d and made the inflation shock hitting Britain worse. \u201cI once compared it to heroin. The economy gets addicted to it and needs bigger and bigger fixes for it to have an impact,\u201d he told the Lords economic affairs committee on Tuesday. \u201cIt does leave money floating around, which I don\u2019t think caused inflation but it enabled inflation to take root.\u201d Macpherson was permanent secretary when the Bank first started buying UK government bonds during the 2008 financial crisis. He said he had not worried about that intervention, but was concerned about the side-effects of the central bank stepping up its programme after the 2016 Brexit vote and in 2020 as the Covid pandemic spread. \u201cI am worried that quantitative easing has given windfall gains to a section of society, who quite frankly don\u2019t need those windfall gains \u2013 potentially at the expense of poorer people who have suffered the effects of inflation because they spend more on food, energy and rents,\u201d he said. Although admitting \u201cwe\u2019re definitely applying hindsight here\u201d, given the unknown scale of the economic shock during the Covid pandemic, he argued that the Bank had gone \u201ctoo far\u201d with its attempts to drive down borrowing costs. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that all central banks perhaps loosened policy too much for fear that we were going into a period of deflation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now dealing with the consequences which largely arise from supply side shocks, but I would argue that excessively loose monetary policy kept in place for too long has probably facilitated higher inflation than there would otherwise have been across the western world.\u201d Macpherson said central banks around the world had \u201cdeluded themselves that inflation was bound to come back to target\u201d after decades of low and stable price growth in advanced economies. In the UK, inflation peaked at 11.1% in October, as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine exacerbated inflationary pressures triggered after advanced economies worldwide exited Covid lockdowns. Inflation has since fallen by less than expected to 8.7%, but is still the highest rate in the G7, putting pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates for the 13th time in a row since December 2021. It also began reversing its quantitative easing programme in November 2022 by selling the government bonds it had accumulated. The former top civil servant at the Treasury said he would have advised Rishi Sunak against setting a target to halve inflation this year. \u201cI was slightly confused by that,\u201d he said, suggesting it was the Bank\u2019s job, rather than the government\u2019s, to manage inflation. \u201cTo be fair to the prime minister I think he thought he was making a pledge he was very confident he would meet,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally if I\u2019d have been there, I would have advised him against it.

            "date": "2023-06-15T00:31:58Z",
            "content": "New Zealand has officially entered recession, with the economy shrinking 0.1% in the last quarter. The economic downturn was exacerbated by the effects of extreme weather that hit the country through February and March, devastating some of New Zealand\u2019s key fruit and vegetable-growing regions and causing extensive damage to the road network, analysts said. Over the last year, food prices have risen sharply, keeping household spending high. But spending on goods, including groceries, shrank in the last quarter, as households reigned in costs in response to rising interest rates. A country enters technical recession only when gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks for two consecutive quarters: New Zealand has only narrowly met this criteria, with GDP down 0.1% in the March 2023 quarter, after a 0.7% fall in the December 2022 quarter. According to Statistics New Zealand, the March 2023 quarter included the initial impacts of cyclones Hale and Gabrielle, as well as teachers\u2019 strikes. \u201cThe adverse weather events caused by the cyclones contributed to falls in horticulture and transport support services,\u201d said economic and environmental insights general manager Jason Attewell. Rolling teachers strikes also contributed to the downturn, as \u201cfewer teaching days led to falls in primary and secondary education services\u201d, Attewell said. Over the quarter there was a 2.4% increase in household consumption expenditure, driven by New Zealanders spending more on international travel. In contrast, households spent less on goods, particularly food, even as the costs of those foods rose further. According to price index data released on Wednesday, grocery food prices were up by 12.7% compared with the same period the year before, with fruit and vegetables prices increasing 18.4% The economic contraction has outpaced what New Zealand\u2019s Reserve Bank had anticipated earlier in the year. The bank had forecast 0.3% GDP growth for the March quarter, and for the economy to contract modestly afterwards. The bank had previously said it hoped to engineer a \u201csoft landing\u201d shallow recession as it repeatedly raised the official cash rate in an attempt to slow inflation. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued its latest assessment of New Zealand\u2019s financial health, saying it was \u201cin the midst of a necessary, policy-induced slowdown following the strong post-pandemic recovery\u201d. The IMF said that New Zealand had recovered faster than most other advanced economies thanks to \u201cexemplary management of the pandemic\u201d, but said \u201cgenerous\u201d government support and investment \u201ccame at the cost of overheating\u201d. It predicted the economy would continue slowing in the near future."

            "date": "2023-06-08T11:16:47Z",
            "content": "The eurozone slipped into recession in the first three months of the year, after official figures were revised to show the bloc\u2019s economy shrank as the rising cost of living weighed on consumer spending. Figures from Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical agency, showed gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023 and the final three months of 2022 after revisions to earlier estimates. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Previous estimates suggested the single-currency bloc had narrowly avoided recession with zero growth in both quarters. The updated figures showed the wider EU swerved a recession after GDP rose by 0.1% in the first three months of the year, after a contraction of 0.2% in the final quarter of 2022. The UK avoided entering a recession at the start of the year, while growth in the US also remained positive. However, GDP volumes in the eurozone and the EU are more than 2% higher than the level recorded in the final quarter of 2019 before the Covid pandemic struck \u2013 unlike in the UK, where the economy remains 0.5% smaller. Households across the eurozone have come under pressure from rising living costs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a sharp increase in gas prices, fuelling the highest rates of inflation since the foundation of the single-currency bloc. With consumers under pressure from the higher energy and food prices, household final consumption dragged down GDP across the euro area by 0.1 percentage points, after a larger 1 percentage-point drop in the previous quarter. Several eurozone economies were in recession or came close to recording two consecutive quarters of decline, including Germany, the EU\u2019s largest economy. France recorded close to zero growth, with flatlining growth in the fourth quarter and a modest increase of 0.2% in the first three months of 2023. Growth across the 20-country single currency area was, however, also dragged down by Ireland, where GDP fell by 4.6% in the first quarter of this year. However, economists have questioned whether the country\u2019s GDP figures reflect the performance of the Irish economy. Inflation across the eurozone has fallen sharply in recent months, with the annual rate cooling from a peak of 10.6% last autumn to reach 6.1% in May \u2013 fuelling speculation that the European Central Bank could be near the end of its cycle of interest rate increases to tame rapid growth in prices. Diego Iscaro, the head of European economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said evidence of a technical recession was unlikely to dissuade the ECB from raising interest rates at its policy meeting next week. \u201cWe see rates rising by 25 basis points. However, the figures reinforce our view that, while policy rates will rise further in the short term, they are nearing their peak,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the effect of higher interest rates still to be fully felt, we project economic activity to remain sluggish during the rest of 2023.\u201d"

            "content": "Time to recap\u2026 Apple\u2019s market valuation has jumped over the $3 trillion mark again as shares in the US tech giant hit a fresh record today. Inflation has cooled in the eurozone, and in the US, fuelling hopes that central bank interest rate increases could end this summer. Economists fear that the UK economy could slide into recession this year, despite GDP growing slightly over the winter. UK house prices have fallen at the fastest annual rate since 2009 this month, despite a small rise in June. John Lewis has defended a plan to build homes to rent as the group files planning applications for projects in west and south-east London. British Gas has said household energy bills are likely to remain high for the foreseeable future as wholesale market prices remain at more than double the normal level. Heathrow has appointed Thomas Woldbye as the new chief executive of Europe\u2019s busiest airport, tasking him with repairing relations with airlines and reviving controversial expansion plans. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 has ended June on the front foot. The blue-chip index has jumped by 0.8% today, or 60 points, to close at 7531 points. This means the FTSE 100 has gained just over 1% so far this year, as it missed out on the global stock market rally. Since the start of January, Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 16%, France\u2019s CAC is up 14.5%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has surged by over 30%. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, explains: Miners have fared worst on the FTSE 100 with Fresnillo, Anglo American and Glencore at the bottom of the leaderboard following China\u2019s bumpier than expected recovery out of Covid. Bucking the trend and stemming a steeper slide has been Rolls Royce which is this year\u2019s star performer so far, up over 50%. Last month its new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic said its turnaround plan is moving \u2018at pace.\u2019 US tech has enjoyed an incredible H1. The Nasdaq 100 is on track for best first half in its 52-year history. Nvidia was the star performer surging more than 180 percent thanks to this year\u2019s buzz around artificial intelligence. Meta and Tesla also sky-rocketed by over 100 percent. And Palo Alto, ADM and Amazon also logged impressive percentage gains, landing them among the top gainers. This marks a turnaround from last year\u2019s \u2018tech-wreck\u2019 when the sector was hit hard by rising inflation and interest rates. In the ballroom of the five star Savoy hotel on the Strand in central London, the super-rich and their advisers were this week advised that they may soon need to watch out for people with \u201cpitchforks and torches\u201d unless they do more to use their fortunes to help the millions struggling with the cost of living crisis. At an investment conference organised by Spear\u2019s wealth management magazine, members of the global elite and their financial teams were told by progressive advisers that there was a \u201creal risk of actual insurrection\u201d and \u201ccivil disruption\u201d if the yawning inequality gap between rich and poor was allowed to widen as a result of energy and food price hikes hitting squeezed households. Julia Davies, a founding member of Patriotic Millionaires UK, a group of super-rich people calling for the introduction of a wealth tax, warned that global poverty and the climate emergency were going to get \u201cso much worse\u201d unless the wealthy did more to help poorer citizens\u2026. In the UK water sector, the boss of FTSE 100 water giant Severn Trent is reportedly trying to bring a taskforce of utility bosses together with the Labour party in a bid to head off the threat of nationalisation, amid the crisis at Thames Water. The Evening Standard reports that Liv Garfield has emailed fellow utility CEOs, inviting them to join an \u201coff-the-record roundtable\u201d with Will Hutton, the Observer journalist, who has written several books analysing economics and politics including The State We\u2019re In. She writes: \u201cWhilst it is clear Labour will not include nationalisation in its next manifesto, they are also not keen on entering into the election race championing the status quo. The leadership thinks there is room for improvement and, politically, there is significant pressure to \u2018do something\u2019 about utilities.\u201d Shares in Apple have extended their earlier gains, and are now up 1.6% at $192.70, maintaining its $3 trillion valuation. Other tech stocks are also rallying, with Microsoft up 2.2% and Nvidia gaining 4%, as the markets hail the drop in PCE inflation reported earlier today (see earlier post). Wall Street is ending the first half of the year in good spirits, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 205 points or 0.6% at 34,328 points. In the energy sector, Shell\u2019s European renewable power boss Thomas Brostrom has decided to leave the company, just weeks after its new boss abandoned targets to cut oil production. Brostrom joined Shell from offshore wind giant Orsted in August 2021 to head offshore wind, and then became head of renewables in February 2022. Now, though, he has decided \u201cto leave Shell to pursue an external opportunity.\u201d Brostrom\u2019s departure comes two weeks after new CEO Wael Sawan abandoned plans to cut output by about 1-2% each year, and decided production would remain stable until 2030. Shell claimed that it had hit the target years early, through its sale of a project in the Permian Basin, Texas. But climate campaigners criticised the move, saying Shell was wrong to target more fossil fuel production. Bronstrom has declined to comment on where he\u2019s headed next or on his reason for leaving, Bloomberg reports. Apple shares have gained around 48% so far this year, as it recovered from a rough 2022 in which they fell almost 27%. 2023 began badly for Apple, with its market value falling below $2tn in early January, a year after hitting the $3trn mark for the first time in January 2022. But it has since rallied through this year: Shannon Cross, analyst at Credit Suisse, tells the FT that Apple\u2019s longer-term potential is lifting its shares: \u201cInvestors are positive on the margin expansion seen in the past couple of years, which is supported by increased sales of high-end iPhones and strength in services\u2026. \u201cApple\u2019s $3tn market cap reflects the company\u2019s long-term focus on continuing to develop and control the key elements of their IP \u2014 software, silicon, devices and services with a concentration on providing the best customer experience.\u201d Today\u2019s falling inflation measures in the eurozone, and in the US, could allow their central banks to end their cycle of interest rate increases in July. Former ECB vice-president Vitor Const\u00e2ncio predicts they will: Apple\u2019s investors have had quite the ride over the years: Newsflash: Tech giant Apple\u2019s market capitalisation has hit the $3 trillion mark, at the start of trading in New York. Shares in the world\u2019s most valuable listed company, have gained 1.1% in early trading to $191.80, taking its value over the $3trn mark. Apple first, briefly, hit the $3 trillion valuation in January 2022, before slipping back last year as tech stocks were hit by rising inflation. But the technology sector has been back in demand with investors, on hopes that central banks could be close to slowing their interest rate increases. Investors are betting on the iPhone maker\u2019s ability to grow its revenue even as it explores new markets such as virtual reality, says Reuters. Earlier this month, Apple unveiled its Vision Pro AR headset, priced at $3,500, along with new laptop and desktop computers, and updates to its iPhone, iPad and smartwatch software. Over in the US, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure shows price pressures in America have eased. The PCE price index rose by just 0.1% during May, and was 3.8% higher on an annual basis, down from 4.3% in the year to April. That fall could encourage Fed policymakers not to raise interest rates further, having left them on hold this month. Core PCE, which exclude food and energy, rose by 0.3% during the month, but the annual rate dipped to 4.6% from 4.7%. That suggests underlying inflation may be more stubborn. Andrew Hunter, deputy chief US economist at Capital Economics, says: The PCE inflation data also provides some support for the doves at the Fed, with the headline PCE deflator rising by only 0.1% m/m, and the core index up by 0.3%, helped by a softer increase in services prices. The eurozone will benefit from further disinflation this year, predicts Berenberg bank. Following today\u2019s drop in inflation, they predict CPI will drop below 3% by the end of the year, near to the 2% target. Berenberg economist Salomon Fiedler says: Eurozone inflation is now falling about as fast as it surged to its 10.6% peak in October 2022. In June, it dropped to 5.5% yoy, from 6.1% in May. Our Euro Inflation Monitor points to further disinflation over the remainder of 2023, with some month-to-month volatility. The data indicate that core inflation will likely decelerate towards c4% by the end of 2023, while the headline figure should fall below 3% by that time. Our calls are roughly unchanged since our previous Euro Inflation Monitor one month ago. Tesco has announced price cuts on more than 500 essential items, which could help nudge UK inflation down. Tesco said it had cut the price of certain packs of own-brand pasta, tinned tuna, milk, grapes, cheese and other goods by an average of 13%, saying that it was working with its suppliers to pass on reductions where it could. A 5 pence cut on fusilli pasta is the second in recent weeks, Tesco says, meaning shoppers will pay 20 pence less for a 500 gram pack than they would have paid in May. A four-pint bottle of milk is also 10 pence cheaper, a second price cut in as many months. This could strengthen hopes that the surge in grocery inflation will moderate this year (although supermarket are less vocal when they raise prices, so we\u2019ll see\u2026) Tesco chief product officer Ashwin Prasad said: \u201cWe know that more than ever our customers are looking for great value, and this huge round of price cuts on 500 key household essentials will help their budgets go a little further. \u201cWith price cuts on products like grapes, peppers, rice and tuna, customers will find it\u2019s even cheaper to eat healthily with Tesco this summer. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll continue to work closely with our suppliers to pass on price cuts to our customers whenever we can.\u201d Here\u2019s Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, on this morning\u2019s UK GDP National Accounts confirming growth of just 0.1% in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023. Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has updated its rulebook to allow mortgage lenders to help strugging customers. Following last week\u2019s meeting with chancellor Jeremy Hunt and UK banks, the Financial Conduct Authority has changed its rules to support the commitments made by lenders. The changes mean that lenders will be able to offer borrowers, without an affordability check: a switch to interest-only payments for 6 months an extension to their mortgage term to reduce their monthly payments, with the option to switch back within 6 months The FCA says: The measures are designed to provide relief for people dealing with higher interest rates, but borrowers should be aware that making changes, even temporary ones, will very likely result in higher monthly payments in the future or paying back more overall. Three eurozone countries have pulled their inflation rates below the ECB\u2019s 2% target: Britain\u2019s competition regulator has got another technology deal in its sights. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concluded that Adobe\u2019s $20bn deal to acquire cloud-based designer platform Figma could mean less choice for designers of digital apps, websites and other products. The CMA says its initial investigation into the deal has found Adobe\u2019s purchase of Figma could reduce innovation. Adobe has five working days to submit proposals to address the CMA\u2019s concerns. Otherwise, the investigation will proceed to an in-depth phase 2 review. The regulator says: The CMA found that Figma has established a substantial share of the market for screen design software and that Adobe has been continuously investing in and competing in this segment. The CMA found that competition between Figma and Adobe has driven investment in updating and developing screen design software, and this important rivalry could be lost if the deal goes ahead. \u201cThis morning\u2019s data suggest that the Eurozone is on the path to bringing inflation down into more sustainable territory, report Sam Miley, senior economist at the CEBR thinktank: Though the headline rate of price growth remains more than twice the ECB\u2019s target, the fact that inflation has now slowed for two consecutive months and stands well below the recent peak of 10.6% will be welcomed by policymakers. However, this is not sufficient for the central bank to halt its course of monetary tightening. Cebr expects the ECB to implement a further hike of 25 basis points to its key policy rates at its meeting next month, in an effort to put even further downward pressure on price growth in the medium term.\u201d - Home sales tumbled by a quarter in May compared with the same month a year earlier, new HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) figures show today. It\u2019s another sign that the property market is cooling this year, as high borrowing costs hit demand. HMRC reports that there were 74,360 residential transactions in May 2023 is 74,360, 25% lower than May 2022. But, that\u2019s 10% higher more than in April 2023 HMRC say the annual fall \u201cis partly due to higher number of bank holidays in May 2023, but also represents the decline in general market conditions in recent months\u201d. Andy Sommerville, director at property data and insight provider Search Acumen, says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show a continuation of the low transaction levels we have become accustomed to in 2023, with the property market facing significant challenges including rising inflation rates and the high cost of borrowing. The downturn feels especially acute from the market recovery we witnessed after the coronavirus pandemic, remaining 27% down from a year ago in May 2022 for residential, and a 16% decrease in the commercial sector from the same period. In financially challenging times, debt continues to be a key driver in transaction volumes. The industry needs a sharp end to sticky inflation to provide market stability across the rest of the year. Euro zone inflation is \u201con the way out\u201d, declares Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 senior economist Kamil Kovar. Following this morning\u2019s fall in headline inflation to 5.5%, Kovar says: \u201cEurozone inflation declined again in June, continuing on its long and gradual disinflationary path. The main good news in the report was hidden in the core inflation segment. While core inflation inched up to 5.4% on a year-ago basis, this was less than expected given the small base effect from last year. On a sequential month-to-month basis core inflation increased almost in line with the ECB\u2019s inflation target for the second month running. With a broad-based deceleration in inflation visible in this release, it is clear that euro zone inflation is on the way out. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to ensure that the ECB\u2019s last hike will be in July, or only in September.\u201d Here\u2019s ING\u2019s senior eurozone economist, Bert Colijn, on today\u2019s fall in Eurozone inflation: Headline eurozone inflation continues to drop quickly on energy price effects, but core inflation ticked back up in June. This is mainly related to base effects from government support and the underlying trend remains disinflationary. Concerns about persistent wage growth remain though as unemployment remained at historic lows in May. In another boost for Europe, eurozone unemployment rate remained at a record low of 6.5% in May. That matches April\u2019s reading, and is down from 6.7% a year ago. There were 11.014m unemployed people in the euro area in May, a drop of 57,000 during the month. The youth unemployment rate remained at 13.9% in the eurozone, with 2.226m young people out of work. June\u2019s \u201cflash\u201d figures are encouraging, despite the modest increase in core inflation, says Diego Iscaro, head of European economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. But, he suspects it won\u2019t stop the European Central Bank raising interest rates again in July (as the ECB has already signalled). Iscaro warns that the emerging El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern could prolong food inflation, by creating more extreme weather events, saying: We expect underlying inflation to continue its downward trend in July, supported by the now evident slowdown in service sector activity. Energy prices will continue to have a negative impact on headline inflation during the second half of the year, although energy markets remain tight. Similarly, the prospect of extreme weather, amplified by El Ni\u00f1o, poses risks of a more moderate decline in food prices. June\u2019s figures are unlikely to move the dial on the monetary policy front. A new rate increase in July is a done deal, and there is still a lot of data to be published before September\u2019s meeting. We still expect July to be the peak in rates as economic conditions weaken and inflationary pressures soften. The contrast between Eurozone and UK inflation is becoming starker, says Neil Shah, director of research at investment research and consultancy firm Edison Group. Inflation in the UK remained at 8.7% in May \u2013 we\u2019ll find out on 19 July how prices changed in June. But it has been running higher than in Europe this year. Shah explains: Britain\u2019s toxic combination of the energy price crisis and deeply embedded labour shortages have resulted in UK inflation being far more stubborn than its fellow G7 economies. Brexit is partly to blame here, re-shaping the labour market and putting pressure on employers to raise wages to attract talent. Britain\u2019s economy, which is heavily reliant on services rather than manufacturing is another point of difference to the slightly more balanced economies of European countries like Germany. Progress remains slow, yet the EU\u2019s headline inflation figures are going in the right direction. Will we be able to say the same of UK inflation in July?\u201d Newsflash: inflation across the eurozone has dropped again, and by more than expected, thanks to falling energy prices. Consumer prices across the euro area rose by 5.5% in the year to June, down from 6.1% in May. That\u2019s lower than the 5.6% which economists expected, but still some way over the European Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Statistics provider Eurostat says that food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual inflation rate in June \u2013 at 11.7%, down from 12.5% in May. Industrial goods inflation eased to 5.5%, from 5.8%. But service sector inflation rose to 5.4%, up from 5.0% in May. Energy prices fell at a faster rate than last month, with energy inflation dropping to -5.6% from -1.8% in May. Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, rose to 5.4% from 5.3% (economists had expected a larger increase to 5.5%). UK house prices have defied expectations by growing slightly in June but annual prices fell at the fastest rate since 2009 as soaring mortgage costs took a toll on the market, according to Nationwide building society. The surprise monthly rise of 0.1% reversed a 0.1% fall in May and confounded economist forecasts of a 0.3% fall. It pushed the average cost of a house in the UK up slightly to \u00a3262,239. Prices were 3.5% lower in June compared with a year earlier, the sharpest rate of decline since 2009 but a smaller annual drop than the 4% fall predicted by economists. More here: German unemployment rose more than expected in June, showing that difficult economic conditions are taking their toll in the jobs market, Reuters reports. The Federal Labour Office said the number of people out of work increased by 28,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.61 million. Analysts had expected the figure to rise by 13,000. Labour office head Andrea Nahles said: \u201cThe more difficult economic conditions are now also being felt in the labour market. \u201cUnemployment is rising and employment growth is losing momentum.\u201d The chronic shortage of housing supply in the UK is supporting house prices, points out Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, while the strong jobs market is also stopping prices falling faster. She adds: The housing market is suffering on the back of the Bank of England\u2019s aggressive rate hiking path which has sharply pushed up mortgage costs. Two-year and five-year fixed rate mortgages in the UK are at their highest level for seven months. Coupled with the pressures from inflation which are squeezing household budgets and landing real wage growth in negative territory, consumers are feeling the pinch, prompting many to turn to the rental market instead of trying to get onto the property ladder. Over in France, inflation has eased in a sign that the cost of living squeeze is easing. French consumer price inflation fell to an annual rate of 4.5% in June, statistics body INSEE estimates, down from 5.1% in the year to May. This is due to a drop in energy prices, with fuel cheaper than a year ago, and a slowdown in food prices. On an EU-harmonised basis, inflation dropped to 5.3% this month from 6.0% in May, INSEE estimates. An encouraging move, ahead of the eurozone-wide inflation report in 45 minutes. But, it still means headline inflation in France is running at over twice the European Central Bank\u2019s target of 2%. Just in: UK mortgage rates are continuing to rise, as the squeeze on borrowers tightens. The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 6.39%, up from 6.37% on Thursday, according to financial information website Moneyfacts. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.96%, up from 5.94% yesterday, as it approaches the 6% mark. Rates have been climbing higher over the last two months, as the UK\u2019s persistently stubborn inflation has raised expectations of further increases in interest rates. Bank of England base rate is expected to hit at least 6% by the end of this year, up from 5% today. Lenders have added two more deals to the market today, Moneyfacts reports, lifting the total residential mortgage products available to 4,432, up from 4,430 on Thursday. The big picture is that the UK and Germany are jointly at the back of the pack for G7 growth since the pandemic. Both economies were still 0.5% smaller than at the end of 2019, today\u2019s National Accounts report shows, while America\u2019s economy is over 5% larger. The UK was the second-worst performing major economy in the first quarter of this year but \u2013 unlike Germany \u2013 it avoided recession. Here\u2019s how the G7 fared in Q1 2023: Canada: grew by 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in January-March France: grew by 0.2% Germany: contracted by 0.3%, putting Europe\u2019s largest economy into recession Italy: grew by 0.6% Japan: grew by 0.7% United Kingdom: grew by 0.1% United States: grew by 0.5% (revised data yesterday showed) This morning\u2019s confirmation that the economy grew by 0.1% q/q in Q1 means there won\u2019t be a recession in the first half of this year. But the sharp rise in interest rates is putting the economy increasingly at risk of falling into one at the end of 2023 or the start of next year, fears Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK. Pugh adds: \u201cWe currently think the economy flatlined in Q2 and then will grow by around 0.2% q/q in Q3 and Q4 but further rises in interest rates could easily push that into the negative. In any case, the big picture is that the economy could be no larger in 2024 than it was pre-pandemic.\u201d Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC, predicts that the UK economy contracted in May, due to the additional bank holiday for King Charles\u2019 coronation. This chart shows how business investment jumped in the last quarter, as companies tried to take advantage of the super-deduction (which let them cut their tax bill by up to 25 pence for every \u00a31 invested) before it expired on 31st March. Here are the key points from today\u2019s UK National Accounts report: This morning\u2019s GDP quarterly national accounts have confirmed there was no growth in real household expenditure in Quarter 1 2023. That follows 0.2% growth in the previous quarter, as real household incomes were squeezed by high inflation. The ONS says: There were increases in expenditure on recreation and culture, clothing and footwear, communications, and housing in the latest quarter (Figure 6). These were offset by falls in transport, and alcohol and tobacco. A UK recession is still coming this year, fears Capital Economics, despite the economy managing some modest growth last autumn and winter. Ashley Webb, their UK economist, says: The final Q1 2023 GDP data confirms that the economy steered clear of a recession at the start of 2023. But with around 60% of the drag from higher interest rates yet to be felt, we still think the economy will tip into one in the second half of this year involving a peak-to-trough fall of around 0.5%. The 0.1% q/q rise in real GDP in Q1 was unchanged from the previous estimate. This follows 0.1% q/q growth in Q4 2022, leaving the economy 0.5% below its Q4 2019 pre-pandemic level (but on the more up-to-date monthly data in April it was 0.2% above its pre-pandemic level). This leaves the UK economy still lagging behind all G7 countries except Germany. The biggest revision was to business investment growth, which was revised up from +0.7% q/q to +3.3% q/q in Q1, Webb adds: That may have reflected the bringing forward of investment by businesses in response to the super-deduction allowance, which expired on 31st March. This chart shows that all regions of the UK, except Northern Ireland, saw annual price falls in the second quarter of this year: All English regions saw a slowing in the annual rate of change compared with last quarter. Nationwide says: London saw a 4.3% year-on-year decline, while the surrounding Outer Metropolitan region saw a 2.9% fall. \u201cAcross northern England overall (which comprises North, North West, Yorkshire &amp; The Humber, East Midlands and West Midlands), prices were down 2.7% compared with Q2 2022. The North West was the weakest performing northern region, with prices down 4.1% year-on-year. Meanwhile southern England (South West, Outer South East, Outer Metropolitan, London and East Anglia) saw a 3.8% decline. On an annual basis, UK house prices are falling at the fastest pace since the aftermath of the financial crisis, today\u2019s Nationwide house price data shows. Despite that 3.5% year-on-year fall in prices, a relatively soft landing is still possible, chief economist Robert Gardner predicts, \u201cproviding the broader economy performs\u201d as expected. Gardner explains: \u201cLabour market conditions are expected to remain relatively robust, with the unemployment rate remaining below 5%, while income growth is projected to remain solid. With Bank Rate likely to peak in the quarters ahead, longer term interest rates should also start to fall back. \u201cAs a result, a combination of healthy rates of income growth and modest price declines should improve affordability over time, especially if mortgage rates moderate. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, says annual house price growth was \u201cbroadly stable\u201d at -3.5% in June, little changed from the 3.4% decline recorded in May. Prices were also fairly stable over the month, rising by a modest 0.1%, after taking account of seasonal effects, reversing the 0.1% decline seen in May. Gardner adds that rising interest rates will cool the economy: \u201cThe sharp increase in borrowing costs is likely to exert a significant drag on housing market activity in the near term. For example, for a representative first-time buyer earning the average wage and buying the typical property with a 20% deposit, mortgage payments as a share of take-home pay are now well above the long-run average, as illustrated in the chart below. Also, house prices remain high relative to earnings, and as a result, deposit requirements are still a significant barrier for those looking to enter the market, Gardner adds: A 10% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is equal to around 55% of gross annual income \u2013 this is down from the all-time highs of 59% prevailing in late 2022, but still marginally above the levels prevailing before the financial crisis struck in 2007/8. UK house prices have risen, unexpectedly, in June \u2013 but are falling on an anual basis. Nationwide reports that house price inched up by 0.1% this month, on a seasonally-adjusted basis. The average price rose to \u00a3262,239 from \u00a3260,736. Economists predicted a fall of 0.3%. But on an annual basis, house prices are 3.5% lower than a year ago, a small acceleration on the 3.4% fall in May (which was the fastest drop since 2009). Nationwide reports that all regions except Northern Ireland recorded annual price falls in Q2. East Anglia was the weakest performing region with prices down 4.7% year-on-year The squeeze on UK households intensified at the start of this year, this morning\u2019s national accounts show. Real households\u2019 disposable income (RHDI) fell by 0.8% following positive growth of 1.3% in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2022. The ONS also reports that households experienced \u201csimultaneous withdrawals from their deposit accounts and negative secured loans for the first time ever\u201d. Newsflash: The UK has avoided recession over the winter, the latest national accounts confirm. The Office for National Statistics has confirmed that the economy grew by 0.1% in the first three months of this year, and also in the final quarter of 2022. That matches the initial estimate, and shows that the UK economy avoided contracting through the cost of living crisis last winter. The major sectors of the economy all grew, the ONS says: In output terms, the services sector grew by 0.1% on the quarter driven by increases in information and communication, and administrative and support service activities; elsewhere, the construction sector grew by a revised 0.4% (previously 0.7%), while the production sector grew by 0.1%, with a revised 0.6% growth in manufacturing (previously 0.5%). We have encouraging news from the UK car sector. UK car production rose for the fourth consecutive month in May, up 26.9% year on year, according to the latest figures published today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The SMMT reports that: 79,046 units left production lines, 16,762 more than in the same month last year, as manufacturers defied the challenging economic backdrop to fulfil customer demand for the latest British-built models, at home and overseas, although the total was still down -31.9% on May 2019. Earlier this week, the UK car industry warned that the growth of electric car production in Britain is under threat from a Brexit \u201ccliff edge\u201d in January unless the EU agrees to delay new trade rules until 2027. China\u2019s factory activity declined for a third straight month in June, and growth in other sectors has slowed. The official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), released earlier today, inched up to 49.0 from 48.8 in May. That left China\u2019s factory PMI below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. The non-manufacturing PMI fell to 53.2 from 54.50 in May, indicating a slowdown in service sector activity and construction. A worrying sign for the global economy\u2026. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Two pieces of data this morning will give us a new insight into the state of the UK economy. The UK\u2019s GDP quarterly national accounts, for January to March 2023, are due at 7am. They will show how fast (or how slowly) the economy grew in the quarter, how various sectors of the economy performed, and how households fared. The initial estimate was that the economy grew by 0.1% in Q1, and in the last quarter of 2022, thus avoiding a recession. That could be revised today, though. We\u2019ll also get a healthheck on the UK property market, from Nationwide\u2019s monthly house price index (also expected at 7am, so we\u2019ll be busy). A month ago, Nationwide reported that UK house prices fell at their fastest annual pace for nearly 14 years in May, by 3.4%, and economists predict a larger fall in June. Also coming up Inflation will also be in focus today, with the latest cost of living data from Europe. Eurozone headline CPI inflation is forecast to have slowed to 5.6%, from 6.1%, but core inflation could nudge higher. In the US, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of price-growth \u2013 core PCE -is expected to show that core elements of inflation remain stubborn. That could encourage the Fed to maintain tight monetary policy, to squeeze the US economy. We\u2019ll also be tracking Thames Water, which has refused to say when it will publish its annual report and accounts, which had been expected by investors next week, as concerns mount over the company\u2019s financial viability. The agenda 7am BST: UK quarterly national accounts for January-March 7am BST: Nationwide house price index for June 7.45am BST: French inflation report for June 8.55am BST: German unemployment report for June 10am BST: Eurozone inflation report for June 1.30pm BST: US PCE index of inflation for May 3pm BST: University of Michigan survey of US consumer confidence"

            "date": "2023-06-07T15:00:41Z",
            "content": "Australia is in the midst of a \u201cretail recession\u201d as inflation and higher interest rates erode the buying power of consumers, according to a report by Deloitte Access Economics. Retail turnover, once inflation is stripped out, sank 0.6% in the March quarter, or twice the pace of the retreat in the final three months of 2022. The June quarter is also likely to post a drop in retail sales, making it three consecutive quarters of decline. \u201cThis retail recession isn\u2019t a surprise,\u201d said David Rumbens, lead author of the Deloitte report. \u201cWe\u2019re also expecting consumer caution to extend further than just goods, with consumers expected to also pull back on services, which could result in a broader-based \u2018consumer recession\u2019 later this year.\u201d Indications retail spending is falling in real terms would probably please the Reserve Bank. It has raised official interest rates 12 times in 13 months \u2013 including earlier this week \u2013 in a bid to remove excessive demand in the economy. The RBA governor said on Wednesday the \u201cvery mixed experience across households and firms\u201d was one of the \u201ccomplicating\u201d elements to determining how high interest rates should go. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThe data that the banks share with us suggest that spending is most subdued among households with a mortgage, especially those that borrowed large amounts relative to their incomes over recent years, and households that rent,\u201d Philip Lowe said, adding some households had \u201caccumulated large additional savings during the pandemic and have not run these down\u201d. March quarter national accounts figures out on Wednesday showed household spending eked out a modest 0.2% in nominal terms, the weakest since Covid lockdowns across eastern Australia during the September quarter of 2021. Consumers drew down savings to keep spending on energy and other essentials, the ABS said. CBA, Australia\u2019s biggest bank, said the March quarter data indicated the economy contracted on a per capita basis, and a further drop would probably be confirmed in the June-quarter numbers. \u201cA recession now looks a distinct possibility in [the second half of 2023] and we put the chance at 50%,\u201d CBA said. Recessions are usually measured by two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction. The bank also lifted its expectations of how much higher the RBA will lift its cash rate. \u201cWe now expect one further 25 basis-point increase in the cash rate for a peak of 4.35% and see it most likely at the August board meeting,\u201d the economists said. \u201cThe risk is a 25bp rate hike earlier in July. And there is also a risk of 25bp rate rises in both July and August, which would take the cash rate to 4.6%.\u201d The Deloitte report said population growth could help Australia break out of its retail recession, with net overseas migration of 400,000 in the year that ends this month and another 315,000 expected in 2023-24. Increases in overseas student numbers would also help. Total real retail turnover is expected to rise from minus-0.7% across calendar year 2023 to 1.3% in calendar 2024, it said. \u201cThis return to growth would be spurred by more people and also more open wallets,\u201d the report said. \u201cAs inflation continues to track down there is expected to be a point in 2024 where real wage growth becomes positive again.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-14T17:58:03Z",
            "content": "Under Liz Truss\u2019s mercifully short-lived premiership, the yield on British government bonds surged last September \u2013 a penalty described as a \u201cmoron risk premium\u201d that markets imposed on her reckless plan for a tax giveaway to the rich. Now it appears that the morons are back: yields on gilts have exceeded the levels they reached last year, and are higher than at any point since the 2008 global financial crisis. The reason is that, although workers are having a tough time in the current cost of living crisis, it\u2019s not tough enough for the City\u2019s liking. In this topsy-turvy world, it\u2019s bad news that unemployment fell and pay growth accelerated to a record high. Never mind that prices are rising at a faster rate than wages, investors are taking their cue from the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey. Last month, Mr Bailey warned that unemployment was \u201chappening at a slower pace than we expected\u201d and wages were still going up. Inflation was high because the shallow recession the Bank had forecast hadn\u2019t happened. Many Britons, he signalled, would therefore have to be pushed out of work to keep a lid on prices. The Bank will almost certainly raise interest rates next week \u2013 and keep raising them for months to come. The result will be economic pain as mortgage costs rise for millions of households. The level for mortgage arrears is already at its highest for a decade, and the rate of repossessions is starting to go up, too. Rishi Sunak became prime minister because he bet \u2013 rightly \u2013 on Ms Truss\u2019s ineptitude. However, he may not win a wager that voters would bear pain now for uncertain future gains. The Conservative party depends on a coalition of outright owners, who comprise 32% of households, and mortgage holders, who make up 30%. It\u2019s the latter whom the Tories risk losing as rates rise. Millions of Britons are living in areas where they are unable to afford a mid-priced property, face a disproportionately high rent, or both. Higher rates would see many more priced out. This would lead to cracks in the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Tory southern seats. Some MPs think Mr Sunak could call an early general election this year before a rate crisis peaks. The Bank\u2019s theory of how to bring inflation under control is twofold: higher housing costs prevent money being spent in the economy; keeping jobs scarce means workers won\u2019t ask for pay increases. This is the wrong interpretation, particularly as wage growth is not a cause, but a consequence, of inflation. Workers are responding with pay claims to cope with higher prices set by firms. Regulatory action to curb monopoly power and financial speculation, as well as price controls, would be better policies. These may yet be deployed, as the UN has warned that food prices could rise again. The lack of creative thinking about the causes of, and responses to, inflation reflects the sorry state of the economics profession. Behaviour that economists call rational would be foolish in ordinary language. That was underlined by Jeremy Hunt\u2019s admission that a recession was an acceptable price to pay if interest rate rises curbed inflation. People\u2019s livelihoods are being deliberately put at risk by a government committed to growing the economy by shrinking it. Just how many might have to lose their jobs to satisfy this bizarre turn to austerity might be answered by the economist Claudia Sahm, who accurately predicted US recessions before they happened with her employment measure. For Britain to be in a \u201cSahm recession\u201d next month would need about 150,000 workers to be thrown out of work. If this is for the good of the country, would economists promoting such ideas, and their political followers, volunteer to be unemployed first? It seems not \u2013 because unemployment is other people\u2019s problem. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 15 June 2023 for editorial reasons"

            "content": "Your editorial on care workers being undervalued and underpaid hits the nail on the head (25 June). There needs to be a long-term workforce plan for adult social care as well as the NHS to enhance the quality of care and support provided by both. We know that social care workers already seek jobs in the NHS \u2013 where pay and conditions are better \u2013 and an NHS-only plan is likely to exacerbate this. Demand for care workers is already at an all-time high. The ongoing deprioritisation of social care is a betrayal of the hardworking, skilled individuals who were on the frontline of the pandemic and continue to provide essential care and support for older and disabled people. Our research reveals that 80% of the public believe social care is as important and deserves the same respect as the NHS. Yet the government has cut \u00a3250m from promised funding to support its workforce. We are petitioning the government to benchmark minimum care worker pay with NHS band 3, and provide the necessary funding for local authorities and social care providers. Sign the petition here: www.change.org/social-care-pay Rachael Dodgson Chief executive, Dimensions \u2022 It\u2019s absolutely vital that we encourage more well-run care recruitment agencies to continue to build their businesses in the UK and not be undercut by cheaper options. I\u2019ve seen many agencies battling for business from care homes on price. It\u2019s a short-termist approach and has led to volatility in the care recruitment sector. Imagine moving to another country, and not only learning the language but undergoing specialised training and being assigned to work on a complex care package, which is draining both mentally and physically. Pay is low and the hours are unreliable; misinformation encouraging workers to become self-employed is rife. Then you find out that your employer can\u2019t pay you as they are losing money \u2013 and you don\u2019t know employment law or where to get help. In this situation, workers will move jobs for better pay and conditions in a heartbeat. Sadly, this is the condition of the care sector today. It is a frightening situation \u2013 and when the bubble bursts, those at the sharp end will pay the price.

            "date": "2023-06-27T10:11:32Z",
            "content": "Last week Donald Trump said that, if re-elected, he\u2019d appoint a \u201creal special prosecutor\u201d to \u201cgo after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family\u201d. In other words, if Trump is re-elected, you can kiss nonpartisan criminal justice goodbye. His remark made me think back almost a half century ago, to when I was a rookie lawyer in the Department of Justice. The department was in shambles, discredited by the political abuse and corruption of Richard Nixon and John Mitchell, the attorney general. To restore trust in the department, President Gerald Ford appointed Edward Levi attorney general. In naming Levi, who had been president of the University of Chicago and the dean of its law school, Ford found someone whose reputation for integrity was impeccable. As Levi said at his swearing-in: \u201cNothing can more weaken the quality of life or more imperil the realization of the goals we all hold dear than our failure to make clear by words and deed that our law is not an instrument of partisan purpose.\u201d Levi set out to insulate the justice department from politics, instituting rules limiting White House involvement in law enforcement decisions. The Senate Watergate committee chairman, Sam Ervin, didn\u2019t think Levi\u2019s rules went far enough to protect the department from an unscrupulous future president. Ervin wanted to make the justice department an independent agency with an attorney general appointed by the president every six years and removable only for neglect. At the time, I thought Ervin\u2019s proposal too extreme. I assumed America had learned its lesson from Watergate and would never again elect a president as repugnant as Nixon, willing to sacrifice the institutions of government to his own political ambition. Yet there was some precedent for Ervin\u2019s view. The position of US attorney general was originally viewed as an independent, semi-judicial role \u2013 analogous to that of judges. Congress established the office of the attorney general in the Judiciary Act of 1789 \u2013 the same act that created the federal court system, as distinct from acts establishing executive departments. In the original draft, attorneys general would be appointed by the US supreme court, not the president. Congress changed this so that attorneys general would be appointed exactly like federal judges. When George Washington appointed the nation\u2019s first attorney general in 1789, Thomas Jefferson referred to him as \u201cthe attorney general for the supreme court\u201d. Early attorneys general shared offices with the court. Their budgets were line items under the federal judiciary, not the executive. Originally, the attorney general was not even in line to succeed to the presidency. Even after the attorney general became a key part of the executive branch and the Department of Justice was established in 1870, presidents continued to respect the need for prosecutorial independence. Until Nixon and the scurrilous John Mitchell. But surely, I said to myself at the time, Nixon and Mitchell were the extremes. Edward Levi\u2019s reforms were adequate. Then came the worst offender of all. During his presidency, Trump viewed the department as an extension of his own will \u2013 even claiming: \u201cI have an absolute right to do what I want to with the justice department.\u201d Trump interfered in the department\u2019s prosecutions of Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, fired the FBI director James Comey for investigating possible collusion between Russia and Trump associates, and demanded that the department reopen a criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton. John Dean, former White House counsel to Nixon, described Trump\u2019s efforts to use the justice department for personal gain as \u201cNixon on stilts and steroids\u201d. Now, Trump threatens that if re-elected he\u2019ll turn the department into his own personal vendetta machine. If there weren\u2019t already enough reason to fear a second Trump presidency, this would be it. Public trust in our governing institutions has already sunk to a new low \u2013 due in large part to Trump\u2019s first term, his subsequent big lie that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d, and now his second big lie that Biden is orchestrating a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d against him. Even if Biden is re-elected, it will be necessary to deal with the damage Trump and his Republican enablers have wrought. Perhaps Sam Ervin\u2019s proposal for an independent justice department should be given more serious consideration. Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

I\u2019ve worked in the NHS for 14 years and in the voluntary sector for 24 years before that. Yes, it worked during the pandemic, when a lot of people were furloughed and were moved to help out in a time of national crisis. But three years on, much has changed. Many people can no longer afford to volunteer, even if paid expenses. Many of the older NHS volunteers have not returned due to their concerns regarding Covid and their own deteriorating health. Many voluntary organisations are struggling to recruit volunteers. We are all fishing in the same pond. Funding for good schemes, such as Home from Hospital, stopped and never restarted. Volunteers require professional support and training, and that\u2019s not free. They are a valuable and often underappreciated addition who can enhance patients\u2019 and service users\u2019 experience. But they are not a fix for the staffing challenges that health and social care face, and should not be used to replace paid roles.

            "content": "Donald Trump has derided the substantial federal charges against him, downplaying the numerous legal threats he faces while attacking Joe Biden for allegedly having \u201cweaponized\u201d the department of justice for political gain. Speaking on Saturday at the Road to Majority conference in Washington, hosted by the right-wing evangelical Faith and Freedom Coalition, Trump said he considered each of the two indictments he has received so far to be a \u201cgreat badge of courage\u201d. \u201cJoe Biden has weaponized law enforcement to interfere in our elections,\u201d Trump told the conservative audience. \u201cI\u2019m being indicted for you.\u201d The speech came less than two weeks after Trump, currently the frontrunner in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, pleaded not guilty to 37 federal charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. According to prosecutors, Trump intentionally withheld highly sensitive government documents from federal officials and obstructed justice in his efforts to keep those materials concealed. Trump also faces charges in New York related to his alleged involvement in a hush-money scheme during the 2016 presidential election, and he could potentially be indicted in Georgia and Washington over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. In his Saturday speech, Trump attempted to argue that the Presidential Records Act of 1978 made his retention of classified documents legal, even though he has actually been charged under the Espionage Act. \u201cWhatever documents a president decides to take with him, he has the absolute right to take them,\u201d Trump falsely claimed. Trump also tried to redirect attention away from the charges by noting that Biden was found to have kept classified documents in his private residence, which is now the subject of a special counsel investigation. However, unlike Trump, Biden never received a subpoena for the classified materials in his possession because his team voluntarily gave them to federal officials. Trump simultaneously accused Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, of corruption, parroting claims from leading House Republicans. News broke Tuesday that Hunter Biden would plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax offenses, and he struck a deal with prosecutors to avoid a conviction on a separate felony gun charge. Hunter Biden was not charged in connection to his overseas business dealings, which have become a source of great outrage among Trump and his allies, but House Republicans have nevertheless pledged to continue investigating the president\u2019s son. \u201cThey lie, they cheat and they steal,\u201d Trump said of Democrats. \u201cThis is how low they\u2019ve fallen in an attempt to win the 2024 election, and we\u2019re not going to let that happen.\u201d He then repeated his false claim that the 2020 presidential election had been rigged against him. In his speech, Trump also touched on some of the policy priorities for the evangelical voters who will play a crucial role in determining the Republican presidential nominee. Trump spoke on the same day that the US marked one year since Roe v Wade was overturned, and the former president took the opportunity to congratulate himself for nominating three of the supreme court justices who supported reversing that landmark decision. \u201cI got it done, and nobody thought it was even a possibility,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be the most pro-life president in American history.\u201d Trump received a warm reception from the conservative audience, who greeted him with a standing ovation as he took the stage. The crowd repeatedly broke out into chants of \u201cUSA!\u201d and \u201cWe vote Trump!\u201d Despite the serious legal threats he faces, Trump continues to dominate in polls of likely Republican primary voters. A CNN survey taken last week, after the indictment in the classified documents case was unsealed, found that 47% of Republican voters name Trump as their top choice to be the party\u2019s 2024 nominee. Trump\u2019s closest competitor, Florida governor Ron DeSantis, trailed him by 21 points. In his own speech at the Road to Majority conference on Friday, DeSantis declined to directly mention the indictment, but he similarly lamented that the federal government had become \u201cweaponized\u201d and promised to replace FBI director Christopher Wray, a Trump appointee. But that sentiment was not shared by fellow presidential candidate Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who was once a Trump ally and has now become one of the former president\u2019s most vocal critics within the Republican party. Speaking at the conference Friday, Christie attacked Trump\u2019s character and accused him of having \u201clet us down\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s unwilling to take responsibility for any of the mistakes that were made, any of the faults that he has, and any of the things that he\u2019s done,\u201d Christie said, prompting some boos from the conference crowd. Trump mocked Christie on Saturday, falsely saying he was \u201cbooed off the stage\u201d, even though he was in fact allowed to finish his remarks despite the harsh reception. Trump\u2019s insult was met with loud applause. At one point, Trump quipped: \u201cI\u2019m probably the only person in history in this country who\u2019s been indicted, and my numbers went up.\u201d"

            "content": "Pay a toll to the ferryman, cross the Xingu River, and you pass a stretch of the Trans-Amazonian Highway that feels as if it is paved with bad intentions. From Anapu to Belo Monte, the 86-mile road \u2013 a small portion of the nearly 2,500-mile highway \u2013 has passed by some of the most violent communities, disrupted waterways and degraded land in the Amazon. For most of the two-and-a-half-hour drive, the hillsides on both sides of the road have almost more cows than trees. The land is so purged of foliage and wildlife that it is hard to believe this is a passage through the world\u2019s biggest rainforest. It looks more like an endless ranch. The other side of the river is even worse, as this is the site of the biggest hydroelectric dam in the Amazon \u2013 a Mordor-esque rampart of concrete behind which lies a cemetery of thousands of white trees drowned by the reservoir. This is where the perverse logic of growing the economy by running down nature reaches its grim apotheosis. And this is where the search for solutions to the Amazon\u2019s degradation must focus, because it is on this road that the problems began. Fail to understand that and no matter how much money, labour or technology is thrown at the issue by governments, companies and civil society groups, it is unlikely to be effective. Like any fire, the conflagration needs to be put out at its source. A potted history of the rainforest reveals why. For thousands of years, Indigenous people lived in the Amazon, not just in harmonious balance with what was already there but also actively planting trees that provided food and medicine, thus nurturing and strengthening the environment. By one estimate, 20% of the forest was planted by ancient civilisations. This started to change after the first European colonisers invaded five centuries ago, followed by prospectors and bandeirantes \u2013 fortune hunters who pushed into the forest in search of Indigenous people to enslave, and lost cities of gold. It was not until the 1970s that industrial-scale deforestation took hold, when Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship built a road through the rainforest as a centrepiece of its nation-building ambitions. This opened the way for a wave of settlers who were encouraged to carve up and clear the land, regardless of existing Indigenous communities or any concern for nature. Since then, the pattern has been repeated across ever-wider swathes of the Amazonian region. First, illegal prospectors and loggers invade, next road-builders open up, and then landgrabbers seize and burn, followed by ranchers and farmers, and finally politicians, who retrospectively legitimise all of the previous illegal activity. It is essentially colonialism, but from within the borders of a nation state for the benefit of a wealthy, often global, elite. On the ground, the result of the policy of violence is social and environmental chaos: ever more people, ever more destruction and ever more crime, but diminishing rates of economic return and increasing climatic impact. Today the rainforest is fast degrading towards what scientists call a \u201ctipping point\u201d, after which it irreversibly dries up because it is no longer capable of generating its own rain. That, of course, puts an even higher premium on agricultural produce and even more pressure on the land. Breaking this vicious cycle is essential for global climate stability, the irrigation of regional crops and the long-term wellbeing of the Amazon\u2019s human and non-human inhabitants. How to do that remains elusive. The first Lula government came closest. With Marina Silva as environment minister, it put in place policies that led to a more than 80% reduction in deforestation. Since then, however, successive governments have only made matters worse, culminating in the catastrophic administration of Jair Bolsonaro, when deforestation increased by 60% in just four years. Finding solutions is now more urgent than ever. Countless universities, NGOs and businesses have devoted themselves to this task. The new Lula government will host an Amazon summit later this year to address the challenge. Guardian contributor Dom Phillips was murdered last year while researching this subject for a book: How to Save the Amazon: Ask the People Who Know. * * * Step 1 Political and Indigenous leadership But who to ask first and where to begin? After the Trans-Amazonian Highway, the next stop is Bras\u00edlia, the centre of power in Brazil. Nationalist paranoia and market failure \u2013 rewarding those who destroy and penalising those who defend \u2013 have to be addressed in the search for any long-term solution. Political leadership must therefore be the starting point. Lula\u2019s current presidency appeared to present a great opportunity. After winning the election last year, the former trade union leader made an international pledge to cut deforestation to zero by 2030 and to halt the expansion of the agricultural frontier. He also created an Indigenous ministry, which gives more power than ever to the people who have the best record of maintaining a healthy forest. Efforts are under way to drive illegal miners from Indigenous territories. Most encouragingly, Lula reappointed the Amazon\u2019s greatest champion, Marina Silva, as environment minister. She has declared protected status to public land the size of Spain through the creation of Indigenous territories and national reserves, and vowed to \u201cfight for the Amazon\u201d. But the forces against her are mounting rapidly. Congress, which is dominated by the rural lobby, has moved to gut her ministry\u2019s powers. The state-managed oil company Petrobras is also up in arms about the environment ministry\u2019s refusal to approve an oil-drilling licence in the mouth of the Amazon. The construction industry wants Silva out of the way so it can build a new road through Amazonas. Most state governors in the Amazon are pro-mining and pro-ranching Bolsonarists. Faced with this resistance, Lula may once again be tempted to ditch his 21st-century climate concerns along with his troublesomely effective environment minister and go back to his 20th-century instincts to build more infrastructure and open more oilwells. If Silva goes, so does Brazil\u2019s environmental credibility. Step 2 Land reform If Silva remains in power, however, there is no shortage of ambitious plans she could adopt. The Amazon Environmental Research Institute says 20m hectares (49m acres) of land could be better conserved through agrarian reforms, such as titling smallholders and compensating them for forest stewardship, while another 10m hectares could be saved by investing in sustainable agriculture. More ambitious still, the Science Panel for the Amazon, which aims to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) but for the rainforest, has proposed \u201carcs of restoration\u201d that would help to regenerate degraded and cleared land. Such policies would be gamechangers. Step 3 Hold foreign countries, businesses and consumers to account To maintain the current positive course, international support needs to be ramped up, and fast. Foreign nations, businesses and consumers must accept their responsibility for much of the destruction of the Amazon, which has accelerated to sell more beef, soy and iron ore to Europe, China, the US and other industrialised markets. The global north also needs to compensate the global south, including Brazil, for climate damage and to pay for the carbon-reducing benefits of natural sinks such as the Amazon. Without this, there is no economic incentive or moral argument for Brazil to reduce deforestation. It seems that last point is finally being understood. At the Cop15 biodiversity summit in Montreal last December, rich nations promised between $20bn (\u00a316bn) and $30bn a year for poorer, biodiverse countries like Brazil. A month earlier, the Cop27 summit in Sharm el-Sheikh had seen a similarly groundbreaking pledge of \u201closs and damage\u201d climate payments. One vehicle for acting early is the Amazon Fund, which has raised more than $1bn, mostly from Norway, which is being used for rainforest projects. More is needed. Encouragingly, President Biden recently asked the US Congress to make its first contribution of $500m to the fund and the UK prime minister Rishi Sunak pledged \u00a380m. This money needs to flow quickly and be increased in the future. Foreign governments also need to crack down on deforestation-related trade. The EU recently enacted progressive legislation in this area. The US and particularly China \u2013 the main export market for soy and iron ore from the Amazon \u2013 should be encouraged to follow. Step 4 Radically reform the beef industry Beef needs to be the primary target as the industry accounts for about 80% of agriculture-related deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Cattle are used as occupying armies to consolidate land ownership in an extension of the nationalist mindset encouraged by the generals in the 1970s. The government still gives subsidies to ranchers. Looked at in terms of revenue for every hectare of forest destroyed, it is horrendously inefficient and provides relatively few jobs. The world\u2019s biggest meatpacker, JBS, and rivals such as Marfrig need to be more transparent, efficient and accountable to the public as well as to their shareholders. The prices of their products should also include the indirect damage they do to the Amazon, and subsidies removed. Once these costs are forced on to the balance sheet, only the most productive ranches will remain. Carlos Nobre, Brazil\u2019s most influential climate scientist, says consolidation of the beef industry was long overdue. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to increase production of beef and reduce deforestation. It can be done. The technology exists. We can improve them genetically. It\u2019s a question of going to scale,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can feed the world for ever using less and less land.\u201d Step 5 Build intelligent (rather than concrete) infrastructure Technology offers other solutions. Instead of integrating the Amazon destructively with roads, as in the past, moves are under way to build a less intrusive and more sustainable communication and energy network. Brazil already boasts the world\u2019s most sophisticated satellite system for monitoring biomes. One analytical platform, MapBiomas, is able to rapidly identify whether land changes from forest to cattle pasture, soy plantation, fruit orchard, mining site or other categories. This is now used by banks to determine whether land owners are entitled to loans or sanctioned for environmental violations. The next step, according to Tasso Azevedo, the founder of MapBiomas, is to provide solar panels and satellite internet access to remote communities so they can quickly denounce invasions of their land and pollution of their rivers in return for social benefits. \u201cWe need to think of technology as infrastructure. Internet in remote areas is now possible, which helps access to health and education,\u201d he says. Environmental defenders believe improved communications could help with enforcement, which is vital to end impunity, but public security institutions need to put more boots on the ground and helicopters in the air. \u201cThe population now has internet. They tell us what is happening. Now we need a rapid reaction squad,\u201d says a local public prosecutor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe have to identify and support communities that are bases of vigilance and detection. This means building up the capacity of environment protection and indigenous affairs agencies, which were gutted during the Bolsonaro and Michel Temer administrations.\u201d Step 6 Create a bioeconomy The market failure of Amazon destruction needs to be recognised. The World Bank \u2013 which has previously financed forest-clearing industries \u2013 recently issued a report showing that the economic losses caused by Amazon deforestation, estimated at $317bn, are seven times higher for Brazil than the gains from extractive industries, such as ranching, mining and logging for Brazil. Forest dwellers need alternatives. This needs to be handled sensitively with regulations to ensure money flows do not cause more problems than they solve. Instead of making money from landgrabbing, illegal mining and destructive cattle ranching, people have to be persuaded they are better off with a standing forest. That can mean ecological stewardship payments for smallholders, subsidies for sustainable agriculture, stronger law enforcement to protect Indigenous territories and carbon credits for big landowners and traditional communities. The latter is essential but controversial as the carbon credit market is unregulated and open to abuse. \u201cNow we are seeing a new wave of carbon cowboys promising the earth to indigenous and traditional communities,\u201d says Paulo Moutinho of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute. Lula\u2019s government needs to build a system to ensure money is channelled towards projects that offer the maximum benefit to the climate and local communities, rather than open a new era of green colonialism. The promised land at the end of this journey is a bioeconomy that grows in tandem with the forest, providing decent livelihoods to local communities, promoting agroforestry that rewards biodiversity, and punishing corporations that take more than they give. Such a system does not yet exist in any comprehensive form, but there are concrete examples at the grassroots and a raft of initiatives at a state, national and global level. In some ways, the bioeconomy is a 21st century attempt to achieve the balance that indigenous communities mastered long ago in growing the forest while providing livelihoods. The academic brothers Carlos and Ismael Nobre have sketched out how Brazil could become an \u201cenvironmental powerhouse\u201d by adopting what they call Amazon 4.0 \u2013 a economic model of new technology and advanced conservation thinking. For idealists, the bioeconomy is the best potential vaccine to the virus of destructive neoliberal capitalism. But it could just as easily prove the latest greenwashing buzzword. The Par\u00e1 state governor Helder Barbalho touts the bioeconomy as a way to pitch for international investment. His administration has just announced the creation of a bioeconomy park with 4.2m hectares devoted to carbon capture and will soon host a large bioeconomy conference in the state capital of Bel\u00e9m. Forest residents remain suspicious of Barbalho\u2019s motives, but he is at least willing to engage with Lula\u2019s government. Lula has created a new government post, secretary for bioeconomy, with the challenging task of inventing a whole new economic system. The holder, Carina Pimenta, says she is wary of including carbon credits and prefers to direct government support and subsidies away from industrial monocultures and towards sustainable forest products and communities. \u201cBrazil must define its own concept of the bioeconomy,\u201d Pimenta says. \u201cIt must be based on what already works, such as extractive reserves.\u201d These reserves are occupied by traditional riverine communities that harvest forest resources sustainably. On the Trans-Amazonian Highway, there is a possibility of changing direction once you reach Altamira, a frontier town for ranching and mining. Switch here from car to boat, and after four or five hours on the Xingu and Iriri Rivers you finally get beyond the reservoir of the Belo Monte dam and can once again see the true wealth of the Amazon: dense forest, clear tributaries and abundant biodiversity. This is the territory of the Cantinas Network, a cooperative of sustainable producers who live in extractive reserves and provide an example of what the bioeconomy might look like. Now, with radio and basic internet, they pool resources, knowledge and harvests of brazil nuts, baba\u00e7u oil and other products so they can sell together at a better price. There is a vibrant local culture and strong commitment to maintaining the forest. The seed is here of an alternative way of existing with the forest that blends decent livelihoods, high technology and a healthy forest. But there is a long way to go before this can be any kind of model. Healthcare and education need to be improved, river transport electrified, and prices guaranteed. The state must also provide better protection against the constant threats of incursion by landgrabbers, loggers and illegal miners. Step 7 Rethink the concept of national security A change of outlook is essential. For hundreds of years, the function of the state has been to encourage extraction and open up new markets \u2013 an essentially colonial, destructive project. If that is to end, as the imminent approach of the Amazon tipping point suggests it must, then governments need a different set of priorities and a new way of thinking about national identity and security. That is true, too, of the police and military, which have neglected or been co-opted by environmental criminals. State power should be directed towards 21st-century threats to climate stability, the physical integrity of national biomes and the wellbeing of the population. For the moment, that is far from mainstream thinking. But as the economic and strategic threats of climate change become more apparent in the future, this argument should become more persuasive. Hopefully, there will still be a forest left by then."

            "content": "Mohammad Zubair Harooni has been trying and failing to get a job in his field since he arrived in Australia nearly 18 months ago. While Harooni has a glittering CV, with more than 20 years of experience in public health in Afghanistan, including work as a UN program specialist in HIV, his biggest obstacle has been his status as a recent migrant. He is one of the many who have struggled to have their qualifications recognised in Australia, with one in four migrants working beneath their skill level. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cI have applied for several positions within the health sector and it has been rejection after rejection,\u201d says Harooni, a father of four. \u201cIt\u2019s been really frustrating because my qualifications have not been considered since my arrival. Not even my master\u2019s degree, which was actually completed in Australia, has made a difference.\u201d Only 33% of permanent arrivals in Australia have had their post-school qualifications recognised, even as Australia faces a crippling national skills shortage, with approximately 350,000 skilled job vacancies across the country. It can be an arduous task to get overseas qualifications recognised in Australia. The Productivity Commission in 2006 described it as \u201ccomplex, time-consuming and bureaucratic\u201d process. And it has forced Harooni to turn to other options, including taking an entry-level role at Transport NSW, a job he says he is happy for but doesn\u2019t reflect what he can do. \u201cI\u2019m really thankful for my job, but within myself I am not feeling happy that I am not working in my profession, which is what I have dedicated most of my life to,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has affected all parts of my life. I\u2019ve had no income for the last year. I couldn\u2019t rent a house, and the stress was having a negative impact on my health. So I just had to take any role.\u201d A new report from a consortium of migrant advocacy and service groups is calling for reform to get more migrants into suitable jobs that will ease labour supply issues as 286 occupations face shortages. The consortium \u2013 comprising Settlement Services International, The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS), Amnesty International, Settlement Council of Australia and Community Corporate \u2013 proposes five solutions. These include fixing the \u201cbroken\u201d skills and qualifications recognition system, strengthening protections for migrant workers, reviewing the right to work for people on temporary visas, building partnerships between public and private sectors, and reforming English language requirements. Violet Roumeliotis, the CEO of Settlement Services International, said the proposed reforms would be a \u201cwin-win-win\u201d for migrants, employers and the economy. \u201cThese ideas could have a significant impact on their lives. We have so many cases of doctors or dentists or lawyers who are Uber drivers because they need the money and can\u2019t get their qualifications recognised,\u201d Roumeliotis said. \u201cThey become de-skilled, they become demoralised and lose motivation, it can be a real struggle for them and their families, particularly when they know they can work in a role they are skilled in and can be paid well.\u201d She said the current system for recognising overseas qualifications was a \u201ccumbersome and confusing process\u201d and as a result only a third of permanent arrivals get through it. \u201cIt\u2019s around 34 different authorities that govern around 400 professions.\u201d Roumeliotis said there are also often cultural barriers to employment and qualification recognition, such as racism. \u201cWe\u2019ve got recruiters who tell us there is, unfortunately, a racist element here,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some who insist they don\u2019t want to hire people from particular backgrounds, or people with names they can\u2019t pronounce. It\u2019s a toxic attitude.\u201d Mohan Gunasekara, the acting CEO at Western Sydney Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) said the cost of qualification recognition should also be reformed. \u201cIt can cost thousands of dollars to have some skills assessed, with some occupations requiring multiple tests that can multiply the cost,\u201d Gunasekara said. \u201cAnd it acts as a disincentive \u2013 it leaves people behind.\u201d The federal government, ismeanwhile, is moving to increase Australia\u2019s humanitarian resettlement program for 2023-24, in keeping with its election promise. The 2022-23 program has 17,875 places including 1,400 places for the community support Program and 4,125 additional places for Afghan nationals. The government has also announced it is on track to convert the majority of people on temporary protection visas to permanent visas, with approximately 3,000 resolution of status (ROS) visas granted so far. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering a humanitarian program that considers a refugee\u2019s entire resettlement journey, ensuring refugees can rebuild their lives with certainty and participate fully in Australian society,\u201d immigration minister Andrew Giles said."

            "content": "Israeli politics is once again reaching a fever pitch before a crucial vote related to the government\u2019s controversial proposals to overhaul the judiciary. The Knesset will convene on Wednesday to elect two representatives to Israel\u2019s judicial selection committee \u2013 the composition of which is at the heart of the now six-month-old battle over the future of Israeli democracy. Two of the nine members of the panel, which appoints judges, are political appointments. Historically, one has been chosen by the government and one by the opposition. The opposition has put forward the centre-left Yesh Atid MK Karine Elharar as a candidate, but several hardliners in the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s religious-nationalist coalition have demanded that both positions are filled with their own representatives. Whether the status quo will be maintained is expected to indicate how much appetite Netanyahu has to push on with the bitterly contested judicial changes package. He has sent mixed signals over the overhaul\u2019s future, but it remains a central goal for his far-right partners and some members of his Likud party: abandoning it could threaten his coalition. Netanyahu returned to office in late December at the head of the most rightwing government in Israeli history, and his justice minister soon announced the wide-ranging judicial overhaul aimed at curbing the outsized power of the supreme court and its perceived leftwing bias. The measures could also help Netanyahu evade prosecution in his corruption trial, in which he denies all charges. Critics counter that the measures will erase democratic norms, handing politicians too much power by allowing a simple majority in the Knesset to overrule almost all of the court\u2019s decisions, and politicise the judiciary by adding more parliamentarians, or MKs, to the judicial selection committee. News of the proposals damaged Israel\u2019s economy and inflamed tensions with international allies worried about the country\u2019s democratic health, as well as sparking the country\u2019s largest-ever protest movement, including unexpected pressure from the tech sector and military reservists. The debate reached a climax in late March when Netanyahu fired his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, over his objections to the changes: wildcat strikes in response brought the country to a standstill, leading the prime minister to announce that the legislation would be delayed until the summer parliamentary session. Israel\u2019s figurehead president, Isaac Herzog, has since brokered halting compromise talks between the government and the opposition, but the negotiations have yielded little in the way of concrete solutions. Gadi Eizenkot, an opposition lawmaker, told Army Radio on Tuesday that if no opposition representative was elected to the judges selection committee, talks would be terminated. Netanyahu has kept his thoughts on Wednesday\u2019s vote to himself, and despite intense opposition lobbying of unconvinced coalition members it is still not clear which way the vote will go. The prime minister told the Likud party last week that \u201cthe reform is not dead, but we are making every effort in talks in order to reach broad agreements\u201d. One potential deal floated in the Hebrew media this week would see Elharar, the opposition candidate, appointed to the judicial selection committee, in exchange for opposition support for the reinstatement of the influential Ultra-Orthodox politician Aryeh Deri as a cabinet minister. The supreme court ruled that Deri could not serve as a minister in January, shortly after the coalition entered office, because of a previous conviction for tax offences. The affair deepened the rift over the power of Israel\u2019s courts."

Anger at the fiasco united the opposition and the government\u2019s own backbench MPs on Thursday after the release of a review into the project, which has been running for 12 years. It emerged this year that the troubled \u00a35.5bn programme, which was already six years late, would not be ready until the end of the decade. However, as army personnel restarted training this week on the vehicles, a defence minister told parliament that the review made for \u201cdifficult reading\u201d. It highlighted a \u201cnumber of systemic, cultural and institutional problems across several areas,\u201d the defence minister James Cartlidge said. Originally intended to enter service in 2017, the programme has been repeatedly delayed, with problems including noise and vibration that have injured soldiers testing the vehicles. The lessons learned review, which was produced by Clive Sheldon KC and published on Thursday, said it found no evidence of misconduct by any individual or anything that would require disciplinary action. However, it found that \u201ca number of errors of judgment\u201d were made and that \u201c\u2018optimism bias\u2019 infected some of the thinking of senior individuals\u201d. The shadow defence minister, Chris Evans, said the Sheldon review had shown that Ajax was the biggest procurement failure for a decade, adding: \u201cThe review is beyond damning.\u201d The Conservative former defence minister Mark Francois told the Commons: \u201cThe Ajax programme has been an absolute debacle. This report starkly reveals in exquisite, agonising detail just how massively bureaucratic and broken the MoD\u2019s procurement really is.\u201d He called for \u201croot-and-branch reform of how we buy military commitment\u201d and said the \u201ctaxpayer and our armed forces deserve no less\u201d. The Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee, Tobias Ellwood, said that Ajax was a case study of how not to do procurement. \u201cAjax\u2019s journey has been miserable \u2026 Something very, very serious has gone wrong,\u201d he said. Cartlidge said that the Household Cavalry had been undergoing standard army field training on Salisbury Plain in Ajax vehicles since Tuesday. \u201cFocused on individual and crew training, this step marks the restarting of British army training on these sophisticated vehicles, and I hope underlines that this project really has turned the corner,\u201d So far 44 vehicles have been delivered, while there is an \u201cend goal\u201d for 589 vehicles to be fully operational by 2029, he said."

But now it\u2019s about what happens next and the plan that will secure the way forward for our game.\u201d Something clearly has to happen urgently, with the worst not necessarily yet over. \u201cI think there\u2019s more pain to come,\u201d says Leicester\u2019s former chief executive Simon Cohen, a keen analyst of this particular minefield. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can say there is a club that isn\u2019t wobbling. Bristol has the richest owner in the Premiership [Steve Lansdown] and even he has indicated he is prepared to sell. If he wants out and can\u2019t find a buyer, where does that leave Bristol? \u201cThe clubs you think are secure at the moment are only secure because of a wealthy benefactor. And there is clearly investor fatigue. Every club is loss-making and those losses will accumulate to a point where they\u2019re no longer able to fund them internally. Externally it\u2019s extremely difficult to find a buyer. I don\u2019t see any reason why this problem shouldn\u2019t get worse instead of better.\u201d The solution, to Cohen\u2019s mind, is not complicated. The English club game simply needs to get real, reform its governance, cut costs, link wages to revenues and rein in its delusions of grandeur. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can fiddle about at the edges of this problem because it\u2019s so significant,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless you significantly change the governance model you\u2019re not going to be able to do anything. I\u2019ve seen lots of talk about getting more revenue. I think that\u2019s a complete red herring. It\u2019s about having a sustainable model. \u201cThe game needs a reset. There are all sorts of areas in which money is not being spent as well as it could be. I think you can reset it quite quickly and restore people\u2019s confidence but the root of all the evils is the lack of governance and, therefore, the ability to do what is best for the league. Rather than pandering to the wishes of he who shouts loudest, it requires people to be brave enough to take the right decisions in the interests of the whole game, not their own vested interests.\u201d In other words the days of wealthy owners bending the entire sport to their personal whim are numbered. So are the days of inflated salaries and mismanagement of the English game, both by Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Football Union. Take your pick from the RFU\u2019s failure to grasp the nettle at the outset of professionalism in the mid-1990s, the decades of internecine political rows, the inability to sustain the legacy of the 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph, the failure to advance beyond the pool stages of the home 2015 tournament and the running down of the Championship, which has soured relations between the shires and the elite game. On top of it all have been the ramifications of the 2019 deal to sell a 27% stake in Premiership Rugby, worth \u00a3200m, to the private equity firm CVC. \u201cSome of us thought the CVC deal was an extremely poor one for Premiership Rugby to enter into,\u201d adds Cohen. \u201cIt just seemed to me like it was a securitisation of future income. There was a price to pay \u2013 and it is now being paid.\u201d Among the knock-on effects is the likelihood of more players either moving abroad or staying put and earning less. \u201cIt may be that players think they are worth more but to play a game they love with their mates for \u00a390,000 rather than \u00a3150,000 a year might still be an attractive option,\u201d suggests Cohen. Act decisively, though, and the English patient could yet be resuscitated. Ojo, a presenter on Channel 5\u2019s highlights show among his impressively wide-ranging portfolio of roles, is convinced of rugby\u2019s ability to rise again. \u201cWorking at pitchside you see all the reasons why we love rugby. At the moment we\u2019re firefighting. But in among all of that there is some really good rugby being played. Rugby still has a really good core fanbase and thousands of people still love the game. If we can get the governance bit right then rugby can absolutely thrive again.\u201d With a potentially enthralling Rugby World Cup also looming this autumn, the sport\u2019s worst Titanic nightmare can still be averted."

            "content": "Very high pollen levels and hot weather are conspiring to bring discomfort to hay fever sufferers across the country, with the Met Office saying climate change could make pollen seasons longer and more extreme. Weekly visitors to the site\u2019s hay fever advice pages have tripled in the past five weeks, according to NHS England, with 27,834 visits in 24 hours on Sunday \u2013 one every three seconds. On Friday, the Met Office put 12 areas of the UK, covering England, Wales and most of Scotland, on red alert for \u201cvery high\u201d pollen levels. \u201cWe are seeing lots of high count days because the weather is very suitable for pollen emission from grasses,\u201d said Dr Beverley Adams-Groom, a senior palynologist at the University of Worcester, who leads the UK\u2019s pollen forecasting programme in association with the Met Office. Adams-Groom said pollen counts this year were roughly average, but added: \u201cThe problem for hay fever sufferers is not so much the size of the pollen count, since any amount over 50 pollen grains per cubic metre of air is problematic for the majority, it is more the perpetual onslaught of high days, due to the almost continuous good weather in many regions since the season began in late May/early June.\u201d If the hot weather continues into next week, the grasses will become exhausted more quickly, offering some respite to those with hay fever, she said. \u201cAlready, I am seeing some evidence that this is happening, with grasses going over very quickly.\u201d Typically, the season for grass pollen, which causes most allergies, lasts from mid-May until July, while the weed pollen season generally covers the end of June to September. The Met Office pollen forecast show that some areas are getting a double hit. Hay fever symptoms include sneezing, coughing, a runny or blocked nose, as well as red, itchy or watery eyes. Sufferers can also experience headaches, earache or lose their sense of smell. Scientists predict that as global heating causes a higher frequency of hotter, drier summers and warmer wetter winters in the UK, the seasonal pollen pattern could change. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing scientific consensus that climate change will impact the pollen season in the UK. It could result in longer pollen seasons,\u201d said a Met Office spokesperson. Urban areas tend to have lower pollen counts than the countryside, but research has also shown that people in urban areas experience more severe symptoms because pollution can exacerbate the body\u2019s reaction. Prof Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist at the University of Manchester who carried out the research, said: \u201cPollution can damage the protective barriers in our nose and respiratory tracts so we\u2019re more likely to get things in, we\u2019re seeing that pollution can have an effect on immune sensing \u2026 and it can narrow airways and make it difficult to breathe. \u201cWe are seeing more and more people developing hay fever. It has been increasing year on year and in the hospitalisation data, you can see that trend too. More of us are being very ill with it.\u201d Margaret Kelman, the acting head of clinical services at Allergy UK, said one in four adults in the UK were affected by hay fever and that the number had been increasing sharply. \u201cThe number of people affected by hay fever has trebled in the last 30 years.\u201d The increase is partly due to better diagnosis, but is likely to also be climate-related. \u201cThe weather affects hay fever exposure and symptoms because pollen counts are higher on dry, warm days with low humidity and a gentle breeze to help disperse the fine pollen granules into the air and keep the pollen grains circulating\u201d said Kelman."

            "content": "A network of young volunteers that translates climate information into dozens of languages is being boosted by new artificial intelligence tools designed by Google. Since founding Climate Cardinals three years ago to improve global climate literacy, Sophia Kianni, 21, has built a network of 9,000 young volunteers around the world who translate reports and content into more than 100 languages, including Swahili, Hebrew, Urdu, Mandarin and Hindi. Volunteers have translated 500,000 words since 2020. They work with professional networks including Respond Crisis Translation and Translators Without Borders for editing and proofreading to ensure translations are credible and accurate. By trialling Google Cloud\u2019s new AI-powered Translation Hub platform, Climate Cardinals has translated an additional 800,000 words into more than 40 languages. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. The change in pace was immediate \u2013 we\u2019ve created the same volume of output in the first three months of this partnership that we had done in our first two years of operation,\u201d said Kianni, who is studying science, technology and society at Stanford University in the heart of Silicon Valley. She said Climate Cardinals was developing its own online translation portal using the generative AI tool ChatGPT so people could easily translate their own resources. English is the main language of international scientific communication, with 80% of scientific papers written in the language. A 2016 study found that languages were still a \u201cmajor barrier\u201d to the global transfer of scientific knowledge. Just 18% of the world\u2019s population speaks English as a native or second language. \u201cEducation is an empowerment tool,\u201d said Kianni, who first learned about the climate crisis in sixth grade. When she found out that temperatures in the Middle East were rising at more than twice the global average rate, she began verbally translating climate information into Farsi to educate her Iranian relatives who had previously been unaware of the climate emergency. They now had pro-environmental attitudes, she said, and supported environmental defenders in Iran who had been persecuted for standing up against the government. \u201cThose who are being worst impacted by the climate crisis deserve to have access to the resources they need to really make sense of the disasters impacting their communities, so that they can use their voices to create this larger chorus of people calling for action,\u201d said Kianni, who has served as the youngest ever adviser to the UN secretary general\u2019s youth advisory group on climate change. \u201cAfrica is on the frontlines of the climate crisis despite barely contributing to it. People who are being disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis tend to be people of colour, and 80% of climate refugees are women, so it is 100% a social justice issue.\u201d \u201cObviously, we have not solved the problem of climate translation but through our partnership with Google, we\u2019ve created a tangible pipeline for providing an amazing capacity of translations to almost all of our partners,\u201d added Kianni. She said Climate Cardinals\u2019 youth members were still collating, formatting and delivering the automated translations. \u201cThe next step is about empowerment and making people understand how they can be part of the solution.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-02T11:00:01Z",
            "content": "Within the next five years, the world is likely to experience at least one year in which the global average surface temperature exceeds 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. That was the stark prediction of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) this week, in its climate forecast. Straying beyond 1.5C could lead to potentially irreversible effects on the global climate system, scientists have warned, including the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, the abrupt melting of permafrost, rising sea levels and bleaching coral reefs. For these reasons, the 1.5C limit is at the heart of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which bound countries to hold global temperature rises \u201cwell below 2C\u201d and \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to 1.5C. Breaching the 1.5C threshold in one or even two years will not be enough to invalidate the Paris agreement. The rise would have to be sustained over several years or more before such a judgment could be drawn, and the WMO has said it is still possible temperatures could fall back again slightly. But it would be a huge blow to global climate action and a terrifying reminder of how close we are to the precipice of irretrievable harm. Changing course on the climate is still possible with concerted action, and governments will have the opportunity to do so in six months\u2019 time at Cop28, the latest iteration of the annual UN climate talks. This year will mark a significant milestone: the first assessment since 2015 of how countries are faring against the emissions-cutting commitments they made at Paris, a process known as the \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d. While we already know in outline what the stocktake will say \u2013 that we are well off track to make the emissions cuts needed to stay within 1.5C and meet the Paris goals \u2013 the setting out of our failures in detail could yet be the spur for action needed, optimists believe. Alok Sharma, the UK Conservative MP and former minister who led the Cop26 talks in Glasgow in 2021, says the task is clear. \u201cCop28 must deliver strengthened emissions reduction targets, and a commitment to peak global emissions by 2025,\u201d he said. \u201c[There must be] a plan to turbocharge the clean energy revolution, and a commitment to phase out fossil fuels. And a meaningful agreement on how to scale up finance, both public and private, to support developing nations to decarbonise their economies \u2013 moving from the billions to the trillions.\u201d Tom Evans, of the E3G thinktank, said the exercise provided a lever to push recalcitrant countries to higher efforts: \u201cThe global stocktake will not tell us anything new \u2013 we have more than enough evidence of the large gap between what\u2019s needed [in emissions cuts] and the reality \u2013 but the global stocktake is mandated under the Paris agreement, so parties have to respond with increased ambition.\u201d That is the theory. But even the most optimistic supporter of Cops may find their bright hopes ebbing in the face of Cop28. The last UN climate summit, Cop27, ended in Egypt last November with some joy and much frustration: triumph for developing countries that demanded climate justice from the rich world, in the form of a \u201closs and damage\u201d fund to pay for the ravages of extreme weather they are suffering; and frustration that few countries stepped up with concrete plans on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preferring instead to prevaricate and procrastinate over the future of fossil fuels. Sharma warned starkly in the closing minutes of Cop27 that the world would pay a high price for that failure, and other countries lined up to agree with him. They were angry that some countries had appeared to want to slow down agreement, unpick progress and water down commitments. A resolution to phase out fossil fuels, with the support of more than 80 countries, was discarded, and the final text contained only weak language on meeting the 1.5C goal. Since then, the situation has not improved. Nations are still at loggerheads over the Ukraine war, geopolitical tensions between the west and China are high, and inflation and economic woes are afflicting rich and debt-ridden poor countries alike. Meanwhile, emissions are still rising. Any Cop would be challenging under such dire circumstances. For Cop28, there is an added twist. It will take place in Dubai, hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a leading oil and gas producer. And the official chosen to preside over the summit \u2013 Sultan Al Jaber \u2013 is the chief executive of the country\u2019s national oil company, Adnoc, which is planning a big expansion of production capacity. A diplomat from one developed country said: \u201cIt could not be much worse.\u201d Another said: \u201cYou could not make this stuff up.\u201d Jaber\u2019s appointment in January was greeted with disbelief and dismay by climate campaigners and experts around the world. \u201cIf I were asked how to make Cop28 a success, I would not put the head of a fossil fuel company in charge of organising it,\u201d said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate at the Grantham Institute, at Imperial College London. \u201cI would not invite lobbyists from fossil fuel companies. I would try to see that everything was done to remove fossil fuels from the energy supply globally as soon as possible.\u201d Since his appointment, Jaber has attracted further controversy. He has invited the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to the summit, to the outrage of human rights campaigners. He has also hired David Canzini, a former Downing Street operator who helped to kibosh renewable energy plans when advising Boris Johnson, and fanned Liz Truss\u2019s enthusiasm for fossil fuels. There have been whisperings of internal turmoil within the presidency: at least three PR companies that were working, or hoping to work, on aspects of the summit have had contracts terminated, and at least two high-ranking officials have recently left, one for personal reasons. Most damagingly, Jaber was hit with a stinging broadside by the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, one of the architects of the Paris agreement. In her Outrage and Optimism podcast, she accused him of imperilling Cop28 by appearing to favour carbon capture and storage technology, as a way of enabling fossil fuel use to continue. \u201cFrom a Cop president perspective, it\u2019s very dangerous. I just don\u2019t see most countries, and certainly not the vulnerable countries, being willing to support the Cop president on this because it is a direct threat to their survival,\u201d she said. For Jaber, the criticism comes as a surprise and a challenge, which he has responded to by embarking on a global listening tour that has taken in governments, civil society groups, scientists and industry, both the high and low carbon varieties. \u201cDo not prejudge me,\u201d he pleaded with his critics, arguing that as it is the fossil fuel industry that must change most to stave off the climate crisis, an oil industry insider was best placed to make that change. \u201cProactively, I decided I want to go and engage with everybody,\u201d he told the Guardian in a rare interview. \u201cI am here promoting inclusivity for Cop28 \u2013 I want everyone to be heard, and I want everyone to have face time with me. So I travelled the world and I met even with those who attack me publicly. I made it a point to go and see them.\u201d The results had been encouraging, he said. \u201cWhile I appreciate all the feedback I got from everybody, representing all sectors and all industries, I promise you, the best feedback I got and the best advice I got was the uncensored feedback, guidance and advice that I received from NGOs and civil society. Everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cStarting from the UK, to France, to Germany, to Copenhagen, to India twice, to China, New York, Houston and Washington DC, twice.\u201d For proof of his intent as Cop president, Jaber said he was not a conventional oil industry executive. Although he was handpicked by the then ruler of UAE, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to lead Adnoc in 2016, Jaber started out quite differently. He was the co-founder in 2006 of Masdar, a renewable energy company specialising in solar farms and wind, investing globally and operating in 40 countries including the UK and US. Jaber is still chair of Masdar and has commanded a large rise in its production. \u201cI am passionate about this [renewable energy],\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in it.\u201d On the issue of carbon capture, Jaber\u2019s defence is that the technology will be needed and that countries should work together on all ways of reducing emissions and tackling the climate crisis. \u201cIf we were just laser focused on reducing emissions, while investing in the acceleration of renewable energy, and investing in the acceleration and deployment of new and emerging viable zero-carbon emission new sources of energy, I think we\u2019d be in a much better place. But to get there, we need to stop the fingerpointing. We need to stop this polarisation. We need to flip the page and start focusing on being optimistic, positive and working together in harmony.\u201d As well as persuading countries to come up with concrete plans on emissions cuts, in line with the Paris agreement goals, Jaber will have to find answers to the parallel \u2013 and just as tricky \u2013 question of financial support for the poor world. Cop27 ended with a resounding victory for developing countries on the vexed issue of loss and damage. This refers to the catastrophic effects of extreme weather, which are already laying waste to many countries \u2013 such as the devastating floods in Pakistan last year, which affected 33 million people and wiped a third off the country\u2019s GDP. Vulnerable countries hit by such disasters need funds for rescue, relief and rehabilitation. But rich countries at Cop27 first strenuously opposed setting up a dedicated loss and damage fund, only relenting when faced with the scorn and anger of developing countries\u2019 governments. Their victory means a loss and damage fund will be set up but there is still no agreement on how it will be filled. Mohamed Adow, the director of the NGO Power Shift Africa, said: \u201cLast year\u2019s agreement on the loss and damage fund was a breakthrough, and showed the climate vulnerable countries that the UN process could actually deliver for them. But that moment will only be worth anything if the fund is set up quickly and money starts to flow. We need to see progress on that in Dubai.\u201d Rich countries may prefer to try to take longer over the fund, setting out only the structure of such a fund this year, without considering ways to provide the cashflows. Adow says that will not wash. \u201cMy big hope is that we get more than vague discussion on loss and damage. Not a single person living on the frontlines of climate change has actually been helped by leaders agreeing to set up a fund last year,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly when money starts to actually reach those people to help them rebuild their lives will it mean anything. Rich nations must not be allowed to turn this Cop into a talking shop.\u201d Funds could be raised on a more permanent basis through mechanisms such as carbon taxes, or levies on high-carbon activities such as frequent flying, according to proposals tabled by developing countries last year. Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, has floated a 1% tax on the sales of fossil fuels globally. But none of these suggestions yet has widespread support among rich countries. Another question is who should contribute. The UN framework convention on climate change, parent treaty to the 2015 Paris agreement, was signed in 1992 and many of the countries classed as developing then \u2013 and therefore not required to contribute finance \u2013 are now much richer, including China and oil-rich countries such as Saudi Arabia, and the host, UAE. Bernice Lee of the Chatham House thinktank said: \u201cWe are coming to the point where whoever is capable should find a way to contribute [to a loss and damage fund] and that should include all countries who can. Everyone knows some countries have benefited from high oil and gas prices recently. UAE should be corralling countries that have the resources to help.\u201d Jaber said UAE was not yet ready for such a call. \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to answer this,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not my speciality.\u201d With six months to go before Cop28, there is not much time to bring recalcitrant countries into line, on emissions or on finance. Cop participants who spoke to the Guardian voiced rising concern that they are still not clear what Jaber\u2019s plans for Cop28 will involve, and how he will prove UAE\u2019s own carbon-cutting credentials. Next week, countries will gather in Bonn, Germany, for two weeks of preliminary talks laying the groundwork for Cop28, the only scheduled negotiating session before Dubai. If Jaber is to win over his critics and pull off a diplomatic coup at Cop28, that is where he must start. Rachel Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher school at Tufts University in the US and a longtime participant in Cops, said: \u201cThere is pressure on and scrutiny of UAE and Dr Sultan [Al Jaber] to prove their management of the Cop presidency is for the planet and not the energy status quo. They still have an opportunity to show oil sector leadership to accelerating the transition, but the window is closing. The presidency needs quickly to show where its ambition lies in ending the fossil fuel era and ramping up the era of renewables. They are uniquely placed to do so, but the world needs to understand the plan.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-12T10:00:17Z",
            "content": "A groundbreaking climate change trial will begin on Monday in a courtroom in Montana\u2019s capital city, involving 16 young residents who allege state officials violated their constitutional rights to a healthy environment. Filed in March 2020, the lawsuit, Held v Montana, will mark the first-ever constitutional climate trial in US history. \u201cWe\u2019re asking the government and the courts to do their job and protect us, along with the rest of Montana\u2019s citizens and our incredible home state; this case is one big opportunity for the state to become a leader in preserving a safe, beautiful and prosperous future for Montana,\u201d Grace Gibson-Snyder, a 19-year-old plaintiff, said. Advocates hope the trial could set precedent for similar cases to move forward and that it could inspire legal action in other states. The state\u2019s constitution has since 1972 guaranteed that the \u201cstate and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations\u201d. By propping up fossil fuels, the plaintiffs argue, the state has failed to uphold this responsibility. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled about this unique opportunity to lay out the whole story of how the government promotes fossil fuel development, how those policies exacerbate climate change, and how that in turn harms me and the other youth plaintiffs,\u201d said Gibson-Snyder. Jim Nelson, a retired Montana supreme court justice, says Montana has \u201cnever, never\u201d fulfilled its duty to maintain a healthy environment. Just this session, he said, the state\u2019s legislature enacted two dozen bills that will \u201cadversely affect the environment\u201d. \u201cThe legislature basically thumbed its nose at these constitutional provisions,\u201d Nelson said. A favorable judgment, he said, could \u201cforce the legislature and public officials in the state administration to actually do what the constitution requires\u201d. The two-week trial in Helena, Montana, is scheduled to run from 12 to 23 June. A judge is expected to issue a ruling sometime after its conclusion. \u201cGiven the urgency of the climate crisis, we would hope that she would make a decision fairly promptly, but we totally understand that she\u2019s going to have a whole lot of evidence and a whole lot of testimony to consider as well as to research,\u201d said Philip Gregory, an attorney for the plaintiffs. \u201cSo it could be a matter of weeks or it could be a matter of months.\u201d The court case specifically alleges that two Montana statutes are unconstitutional: the state energy policy, which directs statewide energy production and use, and a part of the Montana Environmental Policy Act which prevents the state from considering how its energy economy may contribute to climate change. Earlier this year, state lawmakers repealed the state energy policy in what attorneys on the case assert was a thinly veiled attempt to avert a trial. But in May, Judge Kathy Seeley of the first judicial district court, who is scheduled to hear the case, rejected the state\u2019s bid to throw out the suit, allowing the trial to proceed. \u201cThe judge saying the case can go to trial is always a win,\u201d said Gregory, adding that he felt \u201cvery excited\u201d and \u201chonored\u201d about the opportunity for the judge to hear the case. Last week, the state\u2019s supreme court rebuffed a last-ditch attempt by the state attorney general to delay the trial, clearing the path for it to open on Monday as planned. \u201cThe very fact that we are going to trial is empowering, because it means that the courts are willing to hold the government accountable,\u201d said Gibson-Snyder. Held v Montana follows the highly publicized 2015 Juliana v United States in which 21 young people sued the US government for violating their constitutional rights to life, liberty and property by enacting pro-fossil fuel policies that drove climate change. Last week, a US district court ruled in favor of the youth plaintiffs, allowing that their claims can be decided at trial in open court. Both the federal and Montana suits were filed by the non-profit law firm Our Children\u2019s Trust. Litigation based on state constitutional rights, brought by the same firm, is currently pending in four other states. One of those cases, brought by Hawaii youth plaintiffs, is set to go to trial, possibly as soon as this fall."

            "content": "The government\u2019s plans to hit net zero have been comprehensively criticised in a withering report by its own advisers that says targets are being missed on nearly every front. Fewer homes were insulated last year under the government-backed scheme than the year before, despite soaring energy bills and a cost of living crisis. There is little progress on transport emissions, no coherent programme for behaviour change, and still no decision on hydrogen for home heating. Meanwhile the installation of new wind and solar farms and the upgrading of the electricity grid are still too slow to meet net zero, according to the Climate Change Committee, which says that the lack of urgency of government and a failure of political leadership means progress has stalled. Lord Deben, the outgoing chair of the CCC, said the UK had \u201clost the leadership\u201d on climate action shown at Cop26 in 2021 and done \u201ca number of things\u201d \u2013 such as greenlighting a new coal mine and new oil and gasfields in the North Sea \u2013 that were \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d. He said the committee\u2019s confidence that the government would meet its shorter-term carbon-cutting goals by 2030 was even lower than last year, despite the publication of a new green strategy by ministers. \u201cWe\u2019ve slipped behind, and other people have moved ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a report that suggests satisfactory progress.\u201d Greenhouse gas emissions have been falling by just under 3% a year, but this will need to double over the next eight years. The committee warned that the UK could no longer expand any of its airports without closures or shrinking of capacity elsewhere but the government seems not to have accepted this. Public charging for electric vehicles is more costly than it need be, and the government is expecting transport emissions to be higher than was previously admitted, according to the CCC\u2019s latest annual report, published on Wednesday, entitled Progress in Reducing UK Emissions: 2023 Report to Parliament. The report also found: The number of homes receiving energy efficiency improvements under the government\u2019s Energy Company Obligation scheme more than halved, from 383,700 in 2021 to 159,600 in 2022, according to the report. At least 1m to 2m homes should be upgraded each year to meet net zero. Homes are still being built that will need to be retrofitted with low-carbon heating and efficiency measures, because the government has not yet brought in its promised future homes standard. No decision on whether to use hydrogen for home heating will be made until 2026, leaving households and boiler companies in limbo. Emissions from transport have remained stubbornly high as the government has \u201cmade a political choice\u201d to allow an increase in road traffic, instead of encouraging people on to public transport. There is no coherent programme to encourage people to change their high-carbon lifestyles. There is no clear policy to decarbonise steel production, or emissions from other heavy industries. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said: \u201cWhat\u2019s missing is the kind of political leadership. You\u2019ve got a series of strings being pushed across government and no one at the top pulling it up to raise it to the political priority that is required. Until that happens, this programme [of reaching net zero] is going to run into the sand.\u201d Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics for Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThere\u2019s almost no progress in this progress report, just a pitiful catalogue of Rishi Sunak\u2019s climate failures.\u201d The 438-page annual progress report was the committee\u2019s 15th since the 2008 Climate Change Act, and the last for Deben, a former Conservative environment secretary, who is stepping down after an extended 10-year term as chair. An interim chair, the scientist Prof Piers Forster of Leeds, will take over while a replacement is found. Deben said ministers could still step up: \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is the leadership which is essential when we are at a moment not just of national emergency, but of global emergency.\u201d Alok Sharma, the Tory MP who acted as president of Cop26, urged the government to lift the ban on onshore wind, catch up with rival countries on green jobs, and to show leadership internationally, before Cop28, the next UN climate summit, which takes place in November. \u201cIn the global race to attract green investment, jobs and growth the UK risks falling behind without a material response to initiatives from other countries like the US\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act,\u201d he said. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe can be proud of the UK\u2019s record as a world leader on net zero. We are going far beyond other countries and delivering tangible progress whilst bringing down energy bills, with hundreds of pounds coming off bills from next month. \u201cThe UK is cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country and attracted billions of investment into renewables, which now account for 40% of our electricity. In the last year alone, we have confirmed the first state backing of a nuclear project in over 30 years and invested billions to kickstart new industries like carbon capture and floating offshore wind. \u201cWith a new department dedicated to delivering net zero and energy security, we are driving economic growth, creating jobs, bringing down energy bills, and reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels.\u201d"

            "title": "Carbon emissions from UK rail travel lower than previously thought",
            "date": "2023-06-30T05:00:35Z",
            "content": "Rail travel is far more carbon efficient than previously thought, according to a rail industry group that has commissioned a new tool for calculating emissions. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), the association of train companies and National Rail that works to coordinate Britain\u2019s railways, commissioned the development of the tool so that they could measure their carbon footprint properly. The calculator, developed by Thrust Carbon, a sustainability intelligence platform, uses seven sets of data \u2013 including engine and fuel type, occupancy and carriage layout, and exact journey distance \u2013 to more accurately measure the footprint. \u201cThe more granular you can get with the data, the better decisions can be made,\u201d says Kit Brennan, founder and head of product at Thrust Carbon, who led the project. Previously the calculation had been based on the UK government\u2019s annual \u201cgreenhouse gas conversion factors for company reporting\u201d data which involves one simple calculation \u2013 total energy consumed by the national rail network divided by total reported number of passenger kilometres travelled. On the electrified rail route from London King\u2019s Cross to Edinburgh Waverley station, figures showed emissions per passenger were 24kg/CO2e, where CO2e is a measurement used to show the total greenhouse gases emitted as an equivalent of carbon dioxide. The first result from RDG\u2019s new carbon calculator confirms this figure is actually 12.5kg/CO2e \u2013 approximately half the previous estimation, and 10 times less carbon than car travel or 13 times less than the equivalent flight. The new calculations are part of the rail industry\u2019s green travel pledge that aims to make travel sustainability information clearer so that travellers can make informed choices between transport options such as plane and car. This calculator will also enable businesses to measure their carbon emissions from rail travel more effectively. \u201cWe want to empower businesses to make greener travel choices,\u201d said Jacqueline Starr, RDG\u2019s chief executive, who plans to make detailed carbon calculations for rail routes across Britain available by the end of the year. Fuel use is a major factor, but there are also operational efficiencies to consider, Brennan said: \u201cSo, if a train runs but is completely empty, and you\u2019re breaking down your emissions on a specific train then perhaps ticket prices should be lower to encourage more people to take those trains.\u201d He hopes that greater transparency with carbon emissions may add an element of healthy competition between rail operators that use the same train line: \u201cThat\u2019s good because it encourages rail operators to invest in their trains, to have newer, more energy-efficient trains, and to lobby government to electrify more of the lines for the same reasons.\u201d Latest statistics from the Office of Rail and Road show that in 2021-2022, just 2km of track were electrified in Great Britain. \u201cBasically HM Treasury has pulled the plug on electrification,\u201d said Richard Hebditch, UK director at Transport &amp; Environment, an organisation that campaigns for cleaner transport across Europe. \u201cThis new research from Thrust Carbon shows how electrified routes are clearly miles better for carbon savings, so it should be common sense for the government to have a rolling programme to electrify the rail network.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s basically stupid to have so many diesel-only routes, and older, polluting trains travelling around the system,\u201d said Hebditch, who described the contrast between the old and new data as \u201cdramatic\u201d. He explains that the new calculator will not only show the variation of CO2 emissions between different rail routes but it will be possible to get a more accurate comparison between aviation and rail as well. \u201cThis should be a catalyst for better understanding what\u2019s on the railway and for showing that train travel is really good for minimal CO2,\u201d said Hebditch. \u201cThis shows the clear case of the environmental advantages of supporting it. Hopefully, more [trains] will start to be electrified, routes can be decarbonised and we might see newer trains with regenerative braking that put energy back into the system.\u201d Clive Wratten, chief executive at the Business Travel Association, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard loud and clear from our members and the business travel community that consistency in carbon measurement is an imperative. This initiative from RDG on behalf of the whole rail industry has the potential to provide clarity and a robust green message to all parts of business travel.\u201d Once rail carbon information is displayed at point of sale, booking sustainable travel will be easier, especially when comparisons between rail journeys and flights are listed, Brennan said. \u201cAll our tools are about making sustainability effortless,\u201d he added. Plane or train? A trip from Edinburgh to London on, say Monday 3 July, by train would start at \u00a359, according to Trainline. It would take upwards of four hours and 40 minutes, and according to Thrust Carbon, would emit about 12.5kg of CO2 per passenger A plane ticket from Edinburgh to London Gatwick on the same day would start at \u00a365 (easyJet via Opodo) and take 1.15 hours (although that doesn\u2019t include waiting times after check-in). And it would emit about 131kg of CO2."

            "date": "2023-06-02T05:00:06Z",
            "content": "The US is in negotiations with Turkmenistan over an agreement to plug the central Asian nation\u2019s colossal methane leaks. Turkmenistan was responsible for 184 \u201csuper-emitter\u201d events in which the powerful greenhouse gas was released in 2022, the highest number in the world. One caused climate pollution equivalent to the rate of emissions from 67m cars. US officials hope that some leaks from Turkmenistan\u2019s oil and gas industry could be halted by the start of the UN\u2019s Cop28 climate summit in late November. Success would represent a major achievement in tackling the climate crisis. Methane emissions cause 25% of global heating today. A surge since 2007 may be the biggest threat to keeping below 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels and seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points, according to scientists. Tackling leaks from fossil fuel sites is the fastest, simplest and cheapest way to slash methane emissions. John Kerry, the US special envoy for climate, spoke with the president of Turkmenistan, Serdar Berdimuhamedov, on Monday. In April, US secretary of state Antony Blinken met foreign minister Rashid Meredov in Washington DC, with Blinken \u201cunderscoring the critical importance of reducing methane emissions to combat the climate crisis and outlining opportunities to work with Turkmenistan\u201d. \u201cThe US and Turkmenistan \u2026 will endeavour to feature methane mitigation outcomes by Cop28,\u201d a US statement said. An agreement could see the US providing financial support and expertise, according to Bloomberg news. After the Kerry-Berdimuhamedov call, Turkmenistan\u2019s foreign ministry recorded an \u201cexchange of views\u201d and said \u201csystematic work is being carried out in our country \u2026 focused on the consistent introduction of advanced environmentally friendly resource-saving technologies in the oil and gas, energy, transport and other industries\u201d. Satellite data shows little change in Turkmenistan\u2019s methane emissions from 2019-2022. New satellite data is increasingly putting the spotlight on nations with major methane leaks. These include the US, where new regulations will impose large fines for leaks, and Russia. In early May, the Guardian revealed that methane leaks alone from Turkmenistan\u2019s two main fossil fuel fields caused more global heating in 2022 than the entire carbon emissions of the UK. Emissions of the gas were \u201cmind-boggling\u201d and an \u201cinfuriating\u201d problem that should be easy to fix, experts said. In March, the Guardian revealed that Turkmenistan was the worst country in the world for methane \u201csuper emitting\u201d leaks, based on satellite data analysis by French company Kayrros. The leaks are believed to come from ageing and poorly maintained oil and gas pipelines and from the venting to the atmosphere of unwanted methane gas that is produced alongside oil, though gathering information on the ground in the repressive and authoritarian state is very difficult. A recent scientific study found significant leaks from just 29 pieces of equipment in one of Turkmenistan\u2019s main fossil fuel fields. It also suggested a switch from the flaring of methane, when unwanted gas is burned, to venting was behind some of the vast outpourings. Burning the gas produces carbon dioxide, which causes about 80 times less global heating over 20 years. Relighting flares is straightforward and fixing leaks increases the amount of gas captured, increasing revenues. \u201cPumping gas out of the ground and immediately releasing it into the air is about as clever as driving a car over a cliff,\u201d said Prof Euan Nisbet of Royal Holloway, University of London, a member of the scientific oversight committee of the UN International Methane Emissions Observatory (Imeo). \u201cKerry will deserve much credit if the US can help Turkmenistan rapidly cut its methane emissions.\u201d Manfredi Caltagirone, head of Imeo, told the Guardian: \u201cReducing methane emissions is key to reaching the objective of the Paris Agreement. Turkmenistan is an important country of focus for global actions on methane emissions, but so are other major emitting countries such as Russia, US, Iran, Iraq, China, Libya, Algeria, Venezuela and Canada.\u201d Imeo, hosted by the UN Environment Programme, is creating a global dataset of verified methane emissions that will be reported to countries to enable them to take targeted action and then made public."

            "content": "Greenhouse gas emissions have reached an all-time high, threatening to push the world into \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels of global heating, scientists have warned. The world is rapidly running out of \u201ccarbon budget\u201d, the amount of carbon dioxide that can be poured into the atmosphere if we are to stay within the vital threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures, according to a study published in the journal Earth System Science Data on Thursday. Only about 250bn tonnes of carbon dioxide can now be emitted, to avoid the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere that would raise temperatures by 1.5C. That is down from 500bn tonnes just a few years ago, and at current annual rates of greenhouse gas emissions, of about 54bn tonnes a year over the past decade, it would run out well before the end of this decade. Prof Piers Forster, the director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, and lead author of the paper, said: \u201cThis is the critical decade for climate change. Decisions made now will have an impact on how much temperatures will rise and the degree and severity of impacts we will see as a result.\u201d He said the rate of annual increase in emissions had slowed down, but far stronger action was needed. \u201cWe need to change policy and approaches in light of the latest evidence about the state of the climate system. Time is no longer on our side,\u201d he said. Governments are meeting in Bonn to prepare for a major UN summit on the climate, Cop28, this November in the United Arab Emirates. Cop28 is seen as one of the last opportunities for the world to get on track to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and stay within 1.5C. Sultan Al Jaber, the president-designate of Cop28, will arrive at Bonn on Thursday, under pressure to produce a plan for the talks that will achieve the \u201ccourse correction\u201d he has called for. While heading the talks, Al Jaber has retained his role as head of UAE\u2019s national oil company, Adnoc, which is planning to increase its oil and gas production capacity. Al Jaber has previously told the Guardian that his dual role is a benefit to the talks, as he will bring a \u201cbusiness mindset\u201d and galvanise the private sector. Major figures in the talks, including John Kerry of the US and Frans Timmermans of the EU, have praised him. Campaigners remain unconvinced, however, and are planning a protest in Bonn on Thursday against the perceived conflict of interest in Al Jaber\u2019s role. At Cop28, nations will undertake a \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d for the first time since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, to assess whether they are on track to meet their commitments to cut emissions. That stocktake is likely to show the world is far off track, as the paper published on Thursday also shows. Greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise, despite a sharp fall in 2020 when Covid lockdowns were in place in many countries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calculated in 2018 that the world must nearly halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, in order to stay within the 1.5C threshold, and reach net zero emissions by 2050. But that calculation rested on an assumption that the world would reduce emissions by about 7% a year during the 2020s. As emissions have continued to rise, the annual rate of decline for emissions will now have to be much steeper to stay within the 1.5C limit. Joeri Rogelj, co-author of the new paper and a professor of climate science at Imperial College London, told the Guardian: \u201cThe years of continued high emissions as the updates the remaining carbon budget mean that by now we should be doing more. That means either moving forward the global goal net zero date for CO2 from around 2050 to about 2035, or cutting much deeper by 2030.\u201d Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency found that emissions from energy \u2013 the biggest source of emissions \u2013 were showing signs of reaching a plateau. But only 18 countries have shown sustained decreases in their emissions. Majid Al Suwaidi, the director general of Cop28 and one of the top aides to Al Jaber, told the Guardian that UAE would not be using the global stocktake to name and shame the nations that were missing their pledges under the Paris agreement, or failing to cut emissions fast enough. \u201cClimate change is one of those things where we\u2019re all interconnected,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve the problem individually. We have to solve as a collective. That\u2019s what makes it difficult. And so there\u2019s no simple bad guy, good guy in this discussion. Everybody has their solutions. Everybody has their ideas. And if we can bring people together behind those sort of common solutions, and drive the agenda behind that, that becomes a real powerful moment. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to achieve at Cop28.\u201d"

Although climate scientists had realised that world temperatures were rising, they put forward other explanations for the warming, such as sunspots or wobbles in the Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun. Plass had researched the climate in his spare time while working at the Ford motor company, before publishing his research in two science journals, as well as writing a popular piece in a science magazine. In 1961, he went further and blamed fossil fuels for most of the global warming.

            "date": "2023-06-20T14:00:35Z",
            "content": "Rewetting about half of England\u2019s lowland peat would be enough to deliver a fifth of the greenhouse gas emissions savings needed from the country\u2019s farming by 2030, research suggests. Rewetting peat would also help restore habitats for birds, wildlife and plant species. But farming experts strongly dispute the potential for such projects. Food grown on lowland peat in England has a much higher carbon footprint than imports of soya from Brazil, according to the research, from the Green Alliance thinktank. That is because wet peat sequesters carbon, but when peat is drained and farmed it emits about 19 times as much carbon as non-peat cropland. The Green Alliance said the findings showed that rewetting peat, through removing drainage or building dams to retain water on the land, should be a government priority. Lowland peat occupies only about 1% of the UK\u2019s farmland, so even if half were rewetted it would have little impact on land availability, according to the analysis, but make a substantial contribution to the UK\u2019s efforts to reach net zero. However, farmers said drained peatlands \u2013 including the fens of East Anglia \u2013 were some of the UK\u2019s most productive farmland, so a simple comparison of land area would not reflect their true value. Farming is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions but so far government efforts to reduce agricultural emissions have not produced the changes needed. Farmers could be given stronger incentives to rewet lowland peat on their farms through the government\u2019s environmental land management schemes, as current incentives appear ineffective, according to the Green Alliance analysis. Lydia Collas, the author of the research at Green Alliance, said: \u201cIn its natural form, lowland peat can support a huge range of wetland species and absorb significant rainfall, preventing flooding downstream. \u201cEveryone knows that clearing Brazilian rainforest for soya production is a disaster for the climate and for nature, but we\u2019re sabotaging our own environment by growing grain on lowland peat.\u201d Farmers were unconvinced, however. Aidan Gill, an environment policy adviser at the National Farmers\u2019 Union, said the impacts on food of rewetting peat could be substantial, depending on the areas affected. \u201cThe highly productive East Anglian fens produce more than 7% of England\u2019s total agricultural production, worth \u00a31.2bn, so rewetting peat soils [there] would be quite a significant land use change and have a big impact on UK food security,\u201d he said. He added that there were many practical obstacles, as fields could not be rewetted in isolation, and there was a risk of flooding to surrounding areas. Gareth Morgan, the head of farming policy at the Soil Association, also urged caution. \u201cThe fens are crucial for rural communities and domestic food production, supplying a third of British-grown vegetables. \u201cA poorly thought-out change in land management on the fens could increase reliance on imports, weakening the resilience of our local food systems, and contributing to emissions and habitat loss abroad,\u201d he told the Guardian. He said the Soil Association agreed that rewetting peat in some areas was needed but called on the government to \u201cwork with local farmers and use their expert knowledge of the land to adopt a mosaic approach that maintains nature-friendly farming in the most suitable areas while rewetting and restoring peatlands in others\u201d. \u201cA one-size-fits-all approach will be inappropriate,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe made clear in our plan for water that reducing emissions from peatlands will require rewetting \u2013 and are committed to working with farmers and other land managers to halt the degradation of our lowland peat soils. \u201cLater this year, we will launch a \u00a36.6m lowland peat research and development programme to help us identify the best way to reduce emissions from peatlands.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-29T10:00:53Z",
            "content": "Georgia\u2019s top election official is disregarding a recently released report that identifies serious vulnerabilities in Georgia\u2019s computerized election system, instead siding with a conflicting report and claiming that scientific findings about cybersecurity threats are no more than conspiracy theories. The Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, charged with overseeing elections, announced that despite the report\u2019s findings, he will not update software to protect against the vulnerabilities before the 2024 presidential elections. The dueling reports were released by a federal court as part of a lawsuit. One, a 96-page report prepared by J Alex Halderman, and Drew Springall, computer science professors at the University of Michigan and Auburn University, respectively, is based on tests of the equipment used in the increasingly important swing state. The report, which had been sealed for two years by the court, found \u201cvulnerabilities in nearly every part of the system that is exposed to potential attackers\u201d which could allow votes to be changed, potentially affecting election outcomes in Georgia, according to a summary by Halderman. The other was prepared by Mitre, a research and development company, and paid for by Dominion Voting Systems, manufacturer of the state\u2019s electronic voting system. Mitre did not have the same access to test Georgia\u2019s voting equipment, and claimed the vulnerabilities are unlikely to be exploited on a wide scale. In justifying his decision not to update the state\u2019s voting system, Raffensperger pointed to the Mitre report, which says the potential attacks Halderman identifies are \u201coperationally infeasible\u201d. Halderman called Raffensperger\u2019s decision not to address the system\u2019s vulnerabilities \u201cirresponsible and wrong\u201d. Raffensperger has made several statements in recent weeks calling the computer scientists\u2019 conclusions \u201ctheoretical and imaginary\u201d, and conflating their warnings with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d efforts post-2020 \u2013 leading Halderman to label the state\u2019s officials as \u201cvulnerability deniers\u201d. Computer scientists from many of the US\u2019s leading universities signed a letter decrying the standoff, and urging Mitre to retract its report. The scenario lands Georgia in a situation where top computer scientists and Trump-aligned election deniers appear to be sharing the same or similar concerns, even while one relies on groundbreaking research, while the other has been discredited by courts and election officials alike. US district judge Amy Totenberg had sealed the Halderman report since 2021 because of cybersecurity concerns, as part of a lawsuit that started before the most recent presidential election and rise of election deniers. But an agreement was reached earlier this month to release a redacted version, together with the Mitre report. Halderman, who has researched digital elections equipment for decades, said court-ordered access to Georgia\u2019s election equipment, manufactured by Dominion, allowed them to do \u201cthe first study in more than 10 years to comprehensively and independently assess the security of a widely deployed US voting machine, as well as the first-ever comprehensive security review of a widely deployed ballot marking device\u201d. \u201cThe most critical problem we found,\u201d Halderman wrote, is a \u201cvulnerability that can be exploited to spread malware from a county\u2019s central election management system to every ballot-marking device in the jurisdiction. This makes it possible to attack the ballot-marking devices at scale, over a wide area, without needing physical access to any of them.\u201d Mitre\u2019s countering report not only lacks any testing of voting machines, it also relies on a key premise, stated in a footnote on the first page: that no one besides election workers have access to the state\u2019s voting hardware and software. But records obtained by the Coalition for Good Governance \u2013 the group behind the ongoing lawsuit against Georgia\u2019s election system \u2013 show that people associated with the effort to deny the 2020 election results visited rural Coffee county\u2019s election department in early 2021, and the Trump attorney Sidney Powell was able to copy Dominion software and other data. These records, including surveillance video, were reported by the Washington Post and are now under investigation by the Georgia bureau of investigation (GBI). The Coffee county security breach and other issues led a group of 29 computer scientists from MIT, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton, Georgia Tech and other US universities to write a letter last week urging Mitre to retract its report, calling the company\u2019s conclusions a \u201cdangerously misleading analysis\u201d. \u201cMitre embarrassed themselves,\u201d Richard DeMillo, a computer science professor at Georgia Tech and one of the letter\u2019s signers, told the Guardian. The report is \u201cbased on representations from the secretary of state about physical security, when right before our eyes, we can see video of people marching into Coffee county\u2019s election department\u201d. Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for Raffensperger, pointed to the GBI investigation when asked about the Coffee county incident and whether people other than election workers can access voting equipment. Hassinger also said that the \u201cvulnerabilities identified in a lab are not real vulnerabilities, and do not pose risks\u201d to the state\u2019s election system. But DeMillo, who has worked in cybersecurity at Hewlett-Packard and the US Department of Defense, said: \u201cIf Alex Halderman can discover the system\u2019s vulnerabilities, then nation states like North Korea and Russia can as well.\u201d DeMillo has testified as part of the lawsuit, now in its sixth year. In 2019, the Coalition for Good Governance\u2019s efforts led Judge Totenberg to order the state to scrap its previous statewide computer election system, made by Diebold Election Systems, due to vulnerabilities \u2013 a first in election integrity court cases. Diebold no longer makes voting machines, and coalition plaintiffs have continued their efforts to force the state to use paper ballots filled out by hand for voting instead of touchscreens, as is done by nearly 70% of voters across the US, with computers available for people with disabilities. \u201cBallots filled out by pen and paper are non-hackable,\u201d said Marilyn Marks, executive director of the coalition. Georgia\u2019s current system prints out a ballot after voters use touchscreens, and the ballot has a barcode that scanners read to record each voter\u2019s choices. In the months leading up to Georgia\u2019s 2019 decision to change its election system to Dominion\u2019s machines, a committee formed to advise the state on the decision ignored the recommendations of its lone computer scientist, Georgia Tech\u2019s Wenke Lee, who urged the state to move to paper ballots marked by hand. But the state ignored the recommendations and purchased machines from Dominion, another digital system, instead. \u201cYou can see that pattern of negligent, vulnerability denialism \u2013 of not facing facts,\u201d Halderman said. In a statement released on 20 June, Raffensperger said that \u201ccritics of Georgia\u2019s election security\u201d are probably either \u201celection-denying conspiracy theorists or litigants in the long-running \u2026 lawsuit. These two groups make ever-shifting but always baseless assertions that Georgia\u2019s election system is at risk because bad actors might hack the system and change the result of an election.\u201d The statement conflates conspiracists like Cyber Ninjas \u2013 the now-defunct company that performed discredited \u201caudits\u201d in Arizona after the 2020 presidential election \u2013 with cybersecurity experts who have decades of research to their names at leading universities. Asked about the researchers\u2019 claims, Hassinger dismissed the line of inquiry as an \u201cappeal to authority fallacy\u201d and said in an email that \u201celection denialism comes in many forms\u201d, again conflating researchers with conspiracists. Halderman told the Guardian he found Raffensperger\u2019s 20 June statement \u201coffensive\u201d. \u201cCan they actually not tell the difference?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre they so incompetent? Scientists can\u2019t sit quietly while a state like Georgia continues to ignore these issues.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-19T06:53:17Z",
            "content": "The hackers believed to be behind a recent attack that took some of Microsoft\u2019s services offline are likely to be a Russian-linked group rather than a grassroots pro-Islam collective operating out of Sudan, experts say. Anonymous Sudan, which surfaced in January 2023, has also claimed responsibility for at least 24 distributed denial-of-service attacks on Australian companies, including healthcare, aviation and education organisations. Last week, Microsoft confirmed that outages to its Outlook service in early June were the result of a DoS attack believed to have been carried out by Anonymous Sudan, which had claimed credit. The group presented itself as a loose group of hacktivists with a name that suggested they were located in Sudan, and it claimed to be targeting Australian organisations in March in protest against clothing worn at Melbourne fashion festival with \u201cGod walks with me\u201d written on it in Arabic. Cybersecurity firm CyberCX said in a report released on Monday that the group is unlikely to be an authentic hacktivist organisation and is likely linked to the Russian state, after an analysis of the group\u2019s activities. CyberCX said most hacktivist groups conduct their plans for operations in a semi-public way online, but Anonymous Sudan had only announced targets when they were being attacked, indicating a closely held operation. The firm also said the organisation\u2019s use of paid infrastructure in the attacks \u2013 directing mass amounts of traffic to a service in order to bring it down \u2013 would have cost tens of thousands of dollars, and was less likely to have been used by a loose collective. CyberCX said Anonymous Sudan was also publicly aligned with pro-Russian threat actors and is a member of the pro-Russia hacker group Killnet. Alastair MacGibbon, CyberCX\u2019s chief strategy officer, told Guardian Australia that Anonymous Sudan\u2019s generally low-level targets and the fact it was presenting itself as an Islamic group indicated a Russian-backed organisation that could be trying to \u201cdrive division in society\u201d and disrupt the west. \u201cIt really stems from the Russian government proclivities to drive division in society,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t really care about the issue \u2026 anti-racism, pro-environment or whatever \u2013 [they] just get into whatever it is that matters to [harm] targets. In this case, the west.\u201d MacGibbon said there appeared to be a growing pattern in the spate of cyber-attacks from Russian-linked hacker groups against Australia. The Optus and Medibank attacks last year were \u201cless monetisable forms of attack\u201d, he said, with the groups threatening to post the data online rather than locking up systems in ransomware attacks. \u201cThere has to be a link to other forms of monetisation, potentially a state or some form of direction coming from the state that says \u2018go and cause fear, uncertainty and doubt\u2019,\u201d he said. Anonymous Sudan\u2019s Telegram channel has grown to more 60,000 followers since launching."

            "date": "2023-06-23T10:53:36Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has told residents they should turn their smartphones off and on again once a day as a cybersecurity measure \u2013 and tech experts agree. Albanese said the country needed to be proactive to thwart cyber risks, as he announced the appointment of Australia\u2019s inaugural national cybersecurity coordinator. \u201cWe need to mobilise the private sector, we need to mobilise, as well, consumers,\u201d the prime minister said on Friday. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads \u201cWe all have a responsibility. Simple things, turn your phone off every night for five minutes. For people watching this, do that every 24 hours, do it while you\u2019re brushing your teeth or whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d The Australian government\u2019s advice is not new. In 2020, the United State\u2019s National Security Agency issued best-practice guidelines for mobile device security, which included rebooting smartphones once a week to prevent hacking. While a reboot every day may seem a basic measure, experts believe it can help, in some instances. Dr Priyadarsi Nanda is a senior lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney who specialises in cybersecurity development. He said rebooting a phone regularly could minimise risk because it forcibly closes any applications and processes running in the background that could maliciously be monitoring users or collecting data. Nanda said many users don\u2019t realise their apps are often running in the background. \u201cGiven how much we use smartphones in our lives, we know of cases where people haven\u2019t turned their phones off in an entire year,\u201d Nanda said, noting people who rely on their phone\u2019s alarm clock, for example, may need it on 24 hours a day. Nanda said some of the benefits of rebooting a phone could be achieved by regularly closing apps that might be running in the background. But there could be other malicious processes running on a compromised device that will only be stopped by turning the phone off. \u201cIf there\u2019s a process running from the adversarial side, turning off the phone breaks the chain, even if it\u2019s only for the time the phone is off, it certainly frustrates the potential hacker. \u201cIt may not fully protect you, but [rebooting] can make things more difficult\u201d for hackers, Nanda said. Experts, while backing the advice of a regular reboot, have previously flagged the strategy is unlikely to stop determined hackers targeting a specific individual \u2013 especially in light of the proliferation of sophisticated technologies used to hack world leaders revealed in recent years. Dr Arash Shaghaghi, a senior lecturer in cybersecurity at the University of New South Wales, said daily rebooting was a good first step to \u201cencourage users to adopt good cyberhygiene\u201d because disconnecting can minimise certain risks. However, Shaghaghi warned against a false sense of security. \u201cIf your password is stolen and you disconnect your phone, you are not protected, and your account is still at risk. If attackers target a device, a temporary disconnect may be only an inconvenience for attackers,\u201d he said. Some components of phones can remain active even if turned off. Shaghaghi said that with so-called zero click exploits \u2013 sophisticated attacks that don\u2019t require an action from a user to give an adversary access \u2013 rebooting a smartphone \u201cmay challenge the attackers as they may need to find alternative means to exploit the device once powered back on\u201d. \u201cRebooting your device regularly helps when your device is not compromised with persistent malware, as can turning on airplane mode.\u201d Shaghaghi said smartphones can compromise privacy via apps that maliciously track location and listen to conversations. Being cautious of the applications users install and the permissions they grant is another important cybersafety step, he said."

            "date": "2023-06-26T06:30:44Z",
            "content": "Hundreds of clients of law firm HWL Ebsworth, including dozens of government agencies, have been in discussions with the firm over whether highly sensitive legal information has been exposed. The Russian-linked ALPHV/Blackcat ransomware group hacked the law firm in April. Earlier this month, the group published 1.1TB of the data it claimed to have stolen, later established to be 3.6TB worth of data. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup An analysis of more than 1,000 contracts with HWL Ebsworth published on AusTender over the past decade revealed that at least 60 departments or government agencies have used HWL Ebsworth\u2019s services including the Defence Department, Home Affairs, the Australian federal police, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Services Australia and the Fair Work Ombudsman. The total value of the published contracts in the past decade alone adds up to almost $140m. Many of the contracts are for the provision of legal services or advice but some detail much more sensitive work, including cases with the government insurance fund, Comcover, legal advice on monitoring the use of human embryos in research, and investigation into complaints of breaches of the public sector code of conduct at the Department of Veteran Affairs. Guardian Australia reported last week that the agency responsible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme was also trying to confirm whether its client data was included in the hack, as HWL Ebsworth had represented the NDIA in coverage cases at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Digital Transformation Agency also said it was seeking to learn whether its own information may have been affected after having recruited HWL Ebsworth to conduct a privacy impact assessment for the former Morrison government\u2019s digital ID legislation last year. The minister for cybersecurity, Clare O\u2019Neil, said on Friday she could not say which departments had been affected, but said it was a \u201csignificant incident\u201d the government was deeply concerned about. \u201cI would place it in the realm of the most significant cyber incidents that we\u2019ve experienced as a country over the last year, along with Latitude, Optus and Medibank,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s been really important with this particular incident is that the cyber incident response coordination function, which we have been building over the last eight months or so, was on the ground with this company from the very beginning.\u201d O\u2019Neil made the comments in a press conference to mark the appointment of Air Marshal Darren Goldie as Australia\u2019s inaugural national cyber security coordinator. HWL Ebsworth told Guardian Australia last week it would not comment on specific clients, but said it was continuing to do a detailed and comprehensive review of the data as swiftly as it can. Shadow cybersecurity minister James Paterson said in a statement Goldie\u2019s appointment should have come sooner, saying he could have been in the role for what Paterson said was \u201cone of the most serious data breaches affecting sensitive, and potentially classified, government information\u201d in the HWL breach. Paterson said the coordinator must be open and transparent in any investigation of the hack. \u201cThe first task of the coordinator must be to get to the bottom of what government data has been lost in the HWL Ebsworth attack, the implications of the breach and how to mitigate them, and steps being taken to inform and support affected parties,\u201d he said. The concern over the hack goes beyond government clients, with National Australia Bank stating earlier this month that it was seeking information from the law firm over whether any of its own information had been affected. HWL Ebsworth was also involved in the case around Virgin Australia\u2019s administration at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, but Virgin Australia said it has been assured by the firm its data is not included in the hack. Prof Monica Whitty, head of department of software systems and cybersecurity at Monash University, said the hack should cause business and government to consider the cybersecurity risk of their suppliers closely. \u201cI think part of the problem is that a lot of organisations will use third parties in some way or another, but the consideration of their secure systems often doesn\u2019t come into play,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they may be keeping their own systems secure and thinking that\u2019s enough. But when you\u2019ve got third parties, you\u2019ve actually got to think about and maybe ask the questions regarding their own cybersecurity practices.\u201d"

            "content": "British Airways, Boots and the BBC are investigating the potential theft of personal details of staff after the companies were hit by a cyber-attack attributed to a Russia-linked criminal gang. BA confirmed it was one of the companies affected by the hack, which targeted software called MOVEit used by Zellis, a payroll provider. \u201cWe have been informed that we are one of the companies impacted by Zellis\u2019s cybersecurity incident, which occurred via one of their third-party suppliers called MOVEit,\u201d said a spokesperson for the airline. An email sent to BA staff told employees that compromised information included names, addresses, national insurance numbers and banking details, according to the Daily Telegraph, which first reported the breach. BA said the hack had affected staff paid through BA payroll in the UK and Ireland. Boots said \u201csome of our team members\u2019 personal details\u201d had been affected. The Telegraph reported that staff had been told that data involved in the attack included names, surnames, employee numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, the first lines of home addresses, and national insurance numbers. A BBC spokesperson also confirmed the broadcaster had been affected. The corporation believes the breach does not include staff bank details. \u201cWe are aware of a data breach at our third-party supplier, Zellis, and are working closely with them as they urgently investigate the extent of the breach. We take data security extremely seriously and are following the established reporting procedures,\u201d the spokesperson said. Zellis said a \u201csmall\u201d number of its customers had been hit by a vulnerability in MOVEit, a file transfer system used by the company. \u201cWe can confirm that a small number of our customers have been impacted by this global issue and we are actively working to support them,\u201d it said, adding that the UK data watchdog and the National Cyber Security Centre had been informed. It is understood the attack has affected eight Zellis customers in the UK and Ireland. In a tweet on Sunday, Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence team attributed the attacks on MOVEit to a group it called Lace Tempest. It said the group was known for ransomware operations and running an \u201cextortion site\u201d carrying data extracted from attacks using a strain of ransomware known as Clop. Microsoft added: \u201cThe threat actor has used similar vulnerabilities in the past to steal data and extort victims.\u201d Rafe Pilling, a director for threat research at the US cybersecurity firm Secureworks, said the attack was likely to have been carried out by an affiliate of the cybercriminal gang behind Clop ransomware, as well as the related website \u2013 referred to by Microsoft \u2013 where stolen data is advertised. Pilling said the entity behind Clop was a Russian-speaking cybercrime group. Pilling added that victims of the hack should expect to be contacted and asked for money for the return of any stolen data. \u201cVictims will be contacted and if they refuse they will probably be listed and published on the Clop site,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for MOVEit, which was developed by US firm Progress Software, said it had \u201ccorrected\u201d the vulnerability exploited by the hackers. \u201cWe are continuing to work with industry-leading cybersecurity experts to investigate the issue and ensure we take all appropriate response measures,\u201d they said."

The rating agency left the French credit rating unchanged at AA, with a negatve outlook due to \u201cdownside risks to our forecast for France\u2019s public finances amid its already elevated general government debt\u201d. That should please Paris, given the efforts by ministers to persuade S&amp;P not to lower its credit rating. Reuters has more details: S&amp;P said that it now expects a slightly smaller public sector budget deficit following a recent update of the government\u2019s long-term financial plans that aim to cut the deficit to 2.7% of economic output in 2027 from 4.9% this year. The ratings agency also said that it looked positively on a reform of unemployment benefits last year and a law passed this year to raise the retirement age two years to 64, which sparked weeks of protests and strikes. And finally, the London stock market has racked up its best day since late March. The blue-chip FTS 100 index has closed 117 points higher at 7607 points, up over 1.5% today. That recovers its losses earlier this week, when recession worries were weighing on the markets. Insurance group Prudential (+5.6%) was the top riser, followed by copper miner Antofagasta (+5.5%) and commodity giant Anglo American (+5.15%). Analysts at ABN Amro sum up today\u2019s jobs report: The takeaway is that the labour market remains both exceptionally strong on the demand side, as signalled by the jobs numbers, but we also see that layoffs are increasing, leading to a rise in unemployment. This is corroborated by the Challenger job cuts report for May, which shows layoffs somewhat on the high side, though by no means consistent with recession yet. Meanwhile, the JOLTS job vacancy report for April \u2013 also released this week \u2013 showed a rise in vacancies and an upward revision to previous months, suggesting a lower likelihood that excess demand for labour can be eliminated without a meaningful rise in the unemployment rate. And that\u2019s all for this week. Have a lovely weekend. GW The White House has hailed today\u2019s jobs report, pointing out that it extends the jobs gains under the current administration: Employment has risen pretty steadily since the restrictions imposed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic were eased. The bipartisan bill to solve the US debt ceiling crisis just days before a catastrophic and unprecedented default is on its way to Joe Biden\u2019s desk, as the US president prepared to address the nation and hailed \u201ca big win for our economy and the American people\u201d. The compromise package negotiated between Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy passed the US Senate late on Thursday. Biden acknowledged that it leaves neither Republicans nor Democrats fully pleased with the outcome. But the result, after weeks of torturous negotiations, shelves the volatile debt ceiling issue until 2025, after the next presidential election. \u201cNo one gets everything they want in a negotiation, but make no mistake: this bipartisan agreement is a big win for our economy and the American people,\u201d Biden tweeted after the Senate voted 63 to 36 to pass the deal agreed between Biden and McCarthy last weekend, which passed the House on Wednesday. Encouraging: A quick recap: High interest rates, a recent banking crisis and Washington\u2019s fight over the debt ceiling may have shaken the US economy recently, but the US jobs market continues to show signs of strength. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported 339,000 jobs were added in May, surpassing forecasts that predicted the increase would be approximately 190,000 jobs and a sign of continued growth from the jobs market despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s continuing efforts to cool the economy. But, the US unemployment rate has risen to 3.7%, and wage growth cooled last month. The latest jobs report has pushed up shares on both sides of the Atlantic, with investors also relieved that the Senate narrowly passed a bill to suspend the debt ceiling on Thursday night. The pound is track for its best week against the US dollar this year, with the Bank of England expected to keep raising interest rates this year to fight inflation. World food prices have dipped to their lowest level in two years, as the shock caused by Russia\u2019s invasion driving up commodity prices fades. Ireland\u2019s domestic economy has escapted a shallow recession, by returning to growth in the first three months of the year. France is bracing for a possible credit rating downgrade from Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s tonight, when the agency updates its assessment. A network of underground geothermal plants is being touted as a way to help level up the UK after a report discovered many areas with the greatest geothermal potential lie beneath the towns and cities most in need of investment. Britain\u2019s electricity system operator is to tell energy developers to get on with their projects or get out of the queue for a grid connection as it struggles to manage the growing backlog of delayed green energy projects. More than 20,000 rail workers in England have begun a 24-hour strike that will cancel half of the services on affected lines as part of a long-running dispute with train operators over jobs, pay and conditions. Fiat has called on the government to boost incentives for British motorists to buy electric vehicles, after warning that growth in UK sales of the vehicles has tailed off after a key subsidy was scrapped last year. Shareholders in Purplebricks have voted overwhelmingly to sell the online estate agent for only \u00a31 to Strike, a competitor backed by the telecoms tycoon Sir Charles Dunstone. Ireland aren\u2019t having the best day at Lords (where England are rollicking along at 465 for 2), and the economic picture in the Republic is a little mixed too. On the upside, Ireland\u2019s domestic economy has returned to growth in the first three months of the year after a shallow recession, data showed on Friday. Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael McGrath, said momentum was set to continue as the country hits full employment: \u201cIncoming data suggest that momentum has continued into the second quarter, bolstered by a record low unemployment rate of 3.8% registered in May.\u201d However, Ireland\u2019s GDP fell 4.6% in the first quarter, a sharp fall. But, GDP is a volatile measure of Ireland\u2019s economic performance, as it can be disruped by multinational companies. Stocks are pushing higher in London, too. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is now up 97 points, or 1.3%, at 7587 points, on track for the biggest one-day jump since 21 March. Paul Ashworth, Chief North America Economist at Capital Economics, points out that there are sighs of weakness in the US jobs report. Ashworth says: The bigger-than-expected 339,000 increase in non-farm payroll employment in May will dominate the headlines, but the employment report was not all positive \u2013 with a big drop in the household survey measure of employment driving the unemployment rate up to a seven-month high of 3.7% and average weekly hours worked edging down to a three-year low. [such weakness could encourage the Fed to resist further rate hikes]. May brought the largest increase in US jobs since January, points out Josie Anderson, managing economist at Centre for Economics and Business Research. Anderson explains: \u201cThe number of US non-farm payrolls increased by 339,000 in May, roughly in line with the average job additions recorded in the 12-month period to April 2023, of 341,000. It is the first time since January that the increase in payrolls has stood above 300,000, bucking the broadly downwards trend in additions. After last week\u2019s acceleration in PCE inflation, today\u2019s data on net payroll additions add to the likelihood of another Fed rate rise later this month.\u201d Shares are rallying in New York in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average, of 30 large US companies, has jumped by 351 points or 1.1% at 33,413. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also 1% higher, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite has jumped by 1.1% to its highest level since April 2022. Simon Harvey, Head of FX Analysis at Monex Europe, says: A monstrous 339k jobs were added in May, up from an upwardly revised 294k in April. This net employment increase is the largest since January\u2019s whopping 472k figure, which sparked markets to price in a higher terminal rate for the Fed \u2013 a contributing to the start of the regional banking crisis just a month later. Although, despite the recent uptick in the pace of employment, it is worth noting May\u2019s gains are in line with the series +341k twelve-month average. While the net employment figure suggests that labour demand is yet to come off the boil, the rest of May\u2019s jobs report was on the soft side, leaving the market-implied odds of a rate hike from the Fed in June relatively low. Bad news for US borrowers: Another interest rate hike is in the bag, after today\u2019s jobs report. That\u2019s the verdict of Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, who also argues tha hopes of rate cuts this year are misplaced. Shah says: May\u2019s blow out jobs report, combined with an upward revision to April, means that the Fed\u2019s job is not yet done. The key question now is: can they wait until July or does this monster payrolls number trigger another burst of urgency in the FOMC? Perhaps the report details, with the unemployment rate rising and average hourly earnings growth slowing, tilts the decision to July. But overall, this is not a labour market that is slowing \u2013 and if it\u2019s not slowing, then inflation isn\u2019t coming down to 2%. In the past month, incoming economic data has emphasised the continued stickiness of inflation and resilience of the labour market. Markets have repriced their rate outlook significantly but are still over-optimistic about the prospects of rate cuts this year. With May payrolls almost double the average monthly gain in the 10 years pre-pandemic, what reason would the Fed have to cut rates?\u201d Today\u2019s US jobs report could spur some Federal Reserve policymakers to push for another increase in interest rates this month. So says Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, who explains: \u201cExpectations of a rate rise have been flip-flopping this month, and the employment data has now shown a surprisingly large increase in payrolls. This may well flip markets back to pencilling in a hike. The Fed has said it is data dependent and what it reads into this is therefore crucial. This will undoubtedly give plenty of support to the more hawkish members of the Fed.\u201d Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: \u201cInvestors will interpret today\u2019s strong jobs report as a sign that the US labour market is still very tight. The figures underscore the success of the US economy in getting workers back into the workforce. Amid myriad concerns for investors this year, the labour market remains in focus given its strength as it continues to outpace economists\u2019 estimates Some snap reaction to the US jobs report: US short-term government debt has weakened, following the stronger-than-expected jobs growth last month. This has driven up the yield, or interest rate, on two-year Treasury bills: Although US job creation accelerated last month, wage growth cooled in May. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.3%, today\u2019s non-farm payroll shows. That\u2019s down from 4.4% in the year to April. It\u2019s also below the US CPI inflation rate, which rose by 4.9% in the year to April. In May along, average hourly earnings rose by 11 cents, or 0.3%, to $33.44. Newsflash: the US economy added 339,000 jobs last month, a stronger increase than expected, despite the impact of higher interest rates. Economists had expected around 190,000 new jobs, but instead hiring has accelerated \u2013 in a potential boost to president Joe Biden, but a new headache for US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell as he tries to cool inflation. Job gains occurred in professional and business services, government, health care, construction, transportation and warehousing, and social assistance, according to the latest report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. March\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll has been revised higher too, by 52,000, from +165,000 to +217,000. April\u2019s data has been revised up by 41,000, from +253,000 to +294,000. However, the US unemployment rate has risen by 0.3% to 3.7%. The number of unemployed people rose by 440,000 to 6.1 million \u2013 with more people out of work and looking for a job. Global stock markets are rallying today, as are commodity prices, as investors express relief that the US debt ceiling crisis has been resolved. Optimism that the US Federal Reserve could leave interest rates on hold next month are also supporting asset prices. In London, the FTSE 100 share index has jumped by 0.9% or 68 points to 7558, the highest since Tuesday, lead by mining stocks. Earlier today, Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei index closed at a three-decade high, after U.S. lawmakers voted to raise the debt limit. There are also likely to be painful job cuts at Swiss bank Credit Suisse, following its takeover by UBS. UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti told a financial conference in Bern today: \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to create, short term, job opportunities for everybody. Synergies is part of the story. \u201cWe need to take a serious look at the cost base of the standalone and combined organisations and create a sustainable outcome. It will be painful.\u201d Fiat has called on the government to boost incentives for British motorists to buy electric vehicles, after warning that growth in UK sales of the vehicles has tailed off after a key subsidy was scrapped last year. Writing in an open letter to the government, the car manufacturer said other countries around the world were providing more support for the transition to electric vehicles and argued more action was required in Britain. It comes a year after ministers scrapped the last remaining subsidies for electric cars, saying it would free up funds to expand the charging network and support other battery-powered vehicles. However, car manufacturers warned this week of a gulf between the number of electric vehicles on the road and public charging points, with the shortfall more than doubling in some parts of the country in the past year\u2026.

A spokesperson for the company, which was previously called Sports Direct, said in an e-mail. \u201cWe are reviewing our team structures to identify efficiencies and streamline processes, and we have entered a consultation period with colleagues affected by these changes,\u201d The job cuts were first reported by the Sun last week. Ashley - who once owned the Newcastle United football club - no longer heads Frasers but holds a roughly 70% stake in the company, which owns brands including House of Fraser, Flannels, USC and Jack Wills. Earlier this week Frasers narrowly avoided falling out of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index in the latest reshuffle. The Department for Transport have responded to Fiat\u2019s call for more support to incentivise drivers to buy electric cars. A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve invested more than \u00a32bn into accelerating the transition to electric vehicles, and grants have been in place for over a decade to support the transition to zero emission vehicles \u2013 supporting more than 340,000 so far. \u201cTo ensure value for the taxpayer, our support is now targeted where it will make most impact, including grants for vans and taxis, and support for the roll-out of rapid chargers.\u201d The pound is on track for its best week so far this year. So far this week, sterling has gained 1.5% against the US dollar, or almost two cents, to $1.253 this morning. The rally comes as investors conclude that interest rates are likely to level off sooner in the US than in the UK, given Britain\u2019s persistent inflation problem. In the UK, annual inflation was 8.7% in April, compared with 4.9% in the US. The latest US jobs report, at 1.30pm, will help the US Federal Reserve judge if jobs creation, and wage growth, is slowing due to higher borrowing costs. Relief that the US should lift the debt ceiling, to avoid a default, are also providing some support. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, explains: Risk sentiment has improved markedly with the passage of the US debt ceiling deal through Congress. This kept European currencies supported on Friday morning. Global food commodity prices have hit their lowest level in over two years, according to fresh data from the United Nations food agency. The Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s (FAO) price index, which tracks the most globally-traded food commodities, has hit its lowest level since March 2021. There were \u201csignificant drops\u201d in the price indices for vegetable oils, cereals and dairy, which were partly counterbalanced by increases in the sugar and meat indices, the FAO reports. The price index fell to 124.3 points in May, down from 127.7 in April. It is now 22% lower than the all-time high of March 2022, after the invasion of Ukraine sparked a surge in food costs. The report shows that: International wheat prices declined by 3.5 percent month-on-month, reflecting prospects for ample global supplies in the upcoming 2023/24 season and the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The Vegetable Oil Price Index fell 8.7% in May, and was 48.2% below its year-earlier level. The continued decline in the index reflected lower world prices across palm, soy, rapeseed and sunflower oils. The Dairy Price Index fell 3.9%, led by a steep drop in international cheese prices, principally due to ample export availabilities, including from inventories, amid seasonally high milk production in the northern hemisphere Strike action over the last year has been a success despite the lack of a pay deal, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has said. Speaking from the picket line at Euston station, as today\u2019s strike action got underway, the union leader said that the action had pushed back plans that would have negatively impacted RMT members. Lynch said: \u201cWe\u2019ve pushed them back on all the stuff they wanted to do, they wanted to make thousands of our people redundant, they wanted to shut every booking office in Britain, restructure our engineering workers, cut the catering service. \u201cSo we\u2019ve pushed them back on that, they haven\u2019t been able to implement any of their plans. Lynch added: \u201cWhat we haven\u2019t got is a pay deal, we haven\u2019t got any guarantees on our members\u2019 futures but we have stopped them doing the worst aspects of their proposals and their ideas. \u201cIt has been a success, our members are still with us, they\u2019ve had three ballots to continue with the strike action under the law. Other people seem to have been inspired to fight back and take action in their own industries, so it has been a success and it\u2019s put trade unions back on the map in Britain.\u201d Lynch also accused the government of \u201csubsidising\u201d disruption on the railways, telling Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThey are subsidising this disruption: \u00a3900 million has been delivered to the train operating companies to deliver this dispute. They are enforcing the disruption. \u201cAll we want is a pay rise and the protection of our terms and conditions.\u201d More than 20,000 rail workers in England have begun a 24-hour strike that will cancel half of the services on affected lines as part of a long-running dispute with train operators over jobs, pay and conditions. The stoppage by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) \u2013 the second of three by rail unions to hit the network this week \u2013 will affect most operators in England and some cross-border services into Scotland and Wales. Then on Saturday more than 12,000 members of Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, who went on strike on Wednesday, will carry out another day of industrial action that will leave only 40% of services running. The wave of rail disruption coincides with half-term holidays for most schools in England and Wales, and will cause difficulties for people travelling to events in London this weekend. Those affected include supporters travelling to see the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday between Manchester City and Manchester United, racegoers hoping to attend the Epsom Derby and tens of thousands of Beyonc\u00e9 fans hoping to catch the pop star\u2019s Renaissance tour shows in the capital. Rail operators have said services on Friday and Saturday will be severely reduced and have urged passengers to plan their journey before travelling. More here, by my colleague Casper Hughes: Car manufacturer Fiat has warned that growth in electric car sales in the UK is tailing off, and called for more government help to get people to switch from fossil fuel vehicles. Fiat is concerned that EV sales are not accelerating as quickly as it or other manufacturers expected. In a letter to the government, it warns that the market share of EV\u2019s in the UK has plateaued in the year since the Plug-in Car Grant (PiCG), which subsidied the cost, was abolished. Fiat is now asking ministers to boost incentives for British motorists to make the switch to electric vehicles (EVs). Fiat are also offering a \u00a33,000 discount to its electric cars, dubbed the Fiat \u2018E-Grant\u2019, which is larger than the phased-out government subsidy. Damien Dally, Fiat UK\u2019s managing director, told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that the EV market has grown from less than 1% in 2019 to 15% today. Dally says: That means 85% of people are not buying electric vehicles today. And it\u2019s really halted since the removal of the grant. Fiat believes that demand for EV cars will start to tail off in six month\u2019s time, Dally says. He agrees that a better charging infrastructure would help the EV industry, but insists charging is becoming easier. A new report from Resolution Foundation this week shows that the move away from petrol and diesel cars will create a \u00a310bn shortfall in tax revenues \u2013 arguing for a new \u201cpackage of measures that ensure EV drivers start to pay their way\u201d. Fiat\u2019s Dally, though, argues that the government needs to do more to incentivise the shift to EV, saying: I think the government is already talking about looking at other ways of taxing in terms of road tax, etc. I think that\u2019s been discussed for 2025. But ultimately, at the moment\u2026we need to give people equally a reason to make that switch. Dally argues that could be tax breaks, either subsidies or similar incentives, to encourage motorists to shift, warning that demand is \u201creally, really dropping off significantly\u201d. It\u2019s understandable, because of the cost of living crisis etc. People need a reason to buy. Otherwise, I think they will just walk into another petrol or diesel car. Fiat\u2019s calls follow similar pressure on the government from elsewhere in the automobile industry. Its parent company Stellantis, which also owns the Peugeot, Chrysler and Citro\u00ebn brands, warned last month that post-Brexit trading arrangements are a risk to its operations in the country. Senior officials in Brussels are now urging the UK to join a pan-European agreement on goods trade to limit the damage to its car industry from looming post-Brexit tariffs, the Financial Times reports today. The FT says: From next January, electric vehicles shipped between the UK and the EU will need to have at least 45 per cent of their parts sourced from within the two regions or face 10 per cent tariffs, under \u201crules of origin\u201d terms set out in their post-Brexit trading agreement. The limit rises to 60 per cent for batteries, which make up a significant part of the value of an EV, and is particularly problematic as the UK and EU still import many from China, South Korea or Japan. London wants the EU to delay the introduction of the levy until 2027. The move is backed by carmakers in the UK and EU, which have warned they will not be able to comply with \u201crules of origin\u201d from next January due to the lack of battery manufacturing capacity in Europe. More here: Brussels urges UK to join trade pact to ease risk of post-Brexit car tariffs In a boost for France, industrial production across the country has picked up \u2013 helped by a drop in strike action. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7% in April, new data from statistics body INSEE shows, while wider industrial output gained 0.8%. Output \u201cbounced back substantially in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum\u201d \u2013 rising by +23.6% in April after a 45.2% plunge the previous month. That, INSEE said, is because the strikes in refineries were less significant than in March, when protests against president Macron\u2019s pension reforms blocked several French refineries from delivering products. The health of the US jobs market will also be in the spotlight today, when the latest non-farm payroll is published. Economists expect a slowdown in hiring last month, with around 193,000 new jobs created, down from 253,000 in April. A sharp slowdown could deter the US Federal Reserve from raising interest rates again, while a strong NFP could spur them on. The question of the sustainability of France\u2019s public debt has moved back into the spotlight, analysts at ING warn. In a report published yesterday, ING warn it has become \u201can important issue for the government, the general public and the rating agencies alike in a context of economic slowdown, rising interest rates and a minority government in parliament\u201d. As they point out, France\u2019s national debt has risen due to recent economic shocks: Already well above the eurozone average, the \u2018whatever it costs\u2019 approach of the government has led to a significant increase in French public debt since the pandemic, rising from 97.4% of GDP in 2019 to 111.6% of GDP in 2022. Over the period, this represents an increase of 14.2 percentage points, the highest among eurozone countries after Spain. By the end of 2022, France was the fifth country with the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the eurozone, well above the European target of 60%. If policy remains unchanged, the government estimates that public debt could continue to rise over the next few years, reaching 114.6% of GDP in 2027. French president Emmanuel Macron has also been warned that the country can\u2019t afford tax cuts without also trimming spending. Yesterday, Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau told a conference: \u201cWe need to make a bigger effort on the public finances, we need to be careful about unfunded tax cuts and letting spending grow too quickly,\u201d Last month, Macron revealed he had asked his government to draw up \u20ac2bn worth of tax cuts that would benefit the middle class. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. France is bracing for a possible credit rating downgrade today, despite some strenuous efforts by Paris to fend the risk off. Standard and Poor\u2019s, one of the Big Three rating agencies, is expected to update its assessment of France\u2019s credit-worthiness later today. Back in December S&amp;P cut France\u2019s outlook to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201cstable\u201d, due to rising risks to the country\u2019s public finances, so it could now cut France\u2019s AA rating \u2013 the third-highest notch. Since December, France\u2019s economy has grown by 0.2% in the January-March quarter, and president Emmanuel Macron has signed a controversial pension reform into law, after wide protests and much bashing of pots and pans on the streets by furious members of the public. In April, Fitch downgraded France\u2019s sovereign credit rating and warned that Macron\u2019s reform agenda could stall following the battle to increase the country\u2019s retirement age. And last week another rating agency, Scope, lowered its outlook on France\u2019s credit rating, blaming weakening public finances and risks to Macron\u2019s economic reform agenda. A downgrade could be embarrassing for Paris, and raise questions about Macron\u2019s efforts to spur growth and reduce a debt burden that has been pushed higher by spending on the pandemic and then subsidising energy costs since the Ukraine war. The risk of a downgrade on Friday \u201ccould be a wakeup call for the markets,\u201d Adam Kurpiel, rates strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told Bloomberg, adding: \u201cWe and the rating agencies have been highlighting the weakness in France\u2019s public finances for some time.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, pledged in April to \u201caccelerate France\u2019s debt reduction\u201d. He is aiming to lower the national debt from 111.6% of GDP to 108.3%, by 2027. By then, Paris hopes to have brought the budget deficit down to 2.9% of GDP, back below the 3% limit set under the European Union\u2019s Growth and Stability Pact. Earlier this week, La Maire launched an effort to deter S&amp;P from cutting France\u2019s credit rating. He told public broadcaster France Inter that he made a compelling case to S&amp;P when he met its representatives earlier this week, pledging to be \u201cuncompromising\u201d with the debt reduction plan. Le Maire pledged: \u201cWe have good arguments to put forth. Prime minister Elisabeth Borne said on Sunday that Le Maire is in \u201cvery close discussions\u201d with S&amp;P. Borne told Radio J. \u201cI think there were detailed explanations from Bruno Le Maire to Standard and Poor\u2019s on everything we\u2019re doing to control our public finances and I think that we act in this direction.\u201d The US, though, can breathe easier about its credit rating today. Last night, the US Senate narrowly passed a bill to suspend the debt ceiling, which should avert the risk of a default that could have wreaked havoc on the US economy and global markets.

            "date": "2023-06-19T23:01:25Z",
            "content": "More than half a trillion pounds\u2019 worth of underinvestment by government and business over recent decades has left Britain\u2019s economy trapped in a growth \u201cdoom loop\u201d, according to a thinktank. Sounding the alarm as the economy struggles to gain momentum, the Institute for Public Policy Research said the UK risked falling further behind comparable wealthy nations without a sharp turnaround in approach. Business investment is lower in the UK than in any other country in the G7, and 27th out of 30 OECD countries, ahead of only Poland, Luxembourg and Greece. Highlighting a severe shortfall in public and private investment stretching back over several decades, the IPPR\u2019s research showed that Britain had ranked below the G7 average since 2005 for spending on infrastructure, research and development, skills and training. Had the UK maintained its position at the G7 average since that date, the private sector would have invested an extra \u00a3354bn in real terms. If public sector investment had also held that position, the UK government would have invested an additional \u00a3208bn between 2006 and 2021. However, the UK has steadily slipped down the global investment league tables as successive governments have held back from boosting expenditure, alongside a faltering performance in the private sector \u2013 amounting to a shortfall versus the G7 average worth the equivalent of 30 Elizabeth line rail projects. The centre-left thinktank said low investment put Britain at risk of being left behind in a global race to develop the green industries of the future, which are forecast to be worth $10.3tn (\u00a38tn) to the global economy by 2050. The findings come as Rishi Sunak\u2019s government attempts to reboot economic growth with a focus on boosting business investment, including with a package of tax reliefs announced as part of the spring budget. Business leaders say political and economic instability, Brexit, high inflation and rising interest rates are deterring firms from investing in Britain. The IPPR said increased public investment could \u201ccrowd-in\u201d private sector investment and give confidence to companies to choose the UK as a place to build the green companies of the future \u2013 provided the government invested with a sense of longevity and certainty, as Joe Biden\u2019s administration had done in the US. George Dibb, an associate director for economy at IPPR, said: \u201cIf the economy is the engine of a country, investment is its fuel. But the UK\u2019s tank is running on empty and it\u2019s harming economic growth, driving inequality and slowing progress towards net zero and energy security. \u201cCurrently, the UK is experiencing a debilitating case of investment-phobia, and the government\u2019s aversion to investing to seize future opportunities is stopping us from getting out of the growth doom loop we find ourselves in.\u201d A government spokesperson said it was \u201cdisingenuous to say the UK is not harnessing the power of green tech and investment\u201d because almost \u00a3200bn of public and private investment had been made since 2010. \u201cWith the lowest corporation tax in the G7, a smart regulatory system and a simplified tax system, the UK is an exceptionally attractive place to do business, and a top destination for investment in Europe.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-06-19T23:01:24Z",
            "content": "Fixing Britain\u2019s draughty homes could add almost \u00a340bn to the economy by the end of the decade by cutting energy use and improving health, according to research by Citizens Advice. The consumer group said raising the minimum energy efficiency standards of Britain\u2019s homes could have a profound impact beyond reducing bills and should be the government\u2019s top priority. Home heating bills could fall by \u00a324bn if the efficiency of 13m homes was upgraded to at least a C rating under the energy performance certificate (EPC) scheme by 2030, according to Citizens Advice\u2019s research. It also found warmer homes could help to avoid 6,000 unnecessary winter deaths every year, which would have an economic benefit of \u00a36.6bn. Better insulated homes could help save the NHS about \u00a32bn by preventing millions of people from developing respiratory conditions including asthma, it said. Using less energy could save an estimated \u00a34bn worth of investment in infrastructure such as new electricity networks and substations needed to meet the UK\u2019s growing demand for electricity. It would also reduce emissions from power plants by 5%, thus cutting air pollution, and bring a \u00a32.7bn benefit to society, the report found. Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cThe impact of raising minimum energy standards would be profound: giving a boost to household budgets, improving people\u2019s health, increasing energy security and helping the UK reach its net zero targets.\u201d The government has been criticised for dragging its feet on enacting proposals that would force landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties to at least an EPC rating of C by 2028. Privately rented homes are only required to meet an E rating. Research by the Energy and Climate Intelligence unit thinktank has found that delaying the measures to 2030 could add \u00a31bn to the energy bills of 2.4m of the UK\u2019s leakiest homes. Moriarty said the Citizens Advice report showed insulating homes was \u201cabout so much more than reducing energy bills. It\u2019s a long-term solution that makes running the NHS cheaper and boosts quality of life in areas that need it most.\u201d \u201cThe government must make improving our draughty homes a top priority,\u201d she added. Ministers began a consultation on raising the minimum EPC requirement for privately rented homes in 2020 \u2013 but the government has so far not turned the proposals into legislation. Elmhurst Energy, which runs an EPC accreditation scheme, said landlords needed clarity on the government\u2019s plans. Stuart Fairlie, Elmhurst\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cPrivate landlords are understandably concerned about the property improvement-related regulatory changes coming their way, but most of these fears are not based on fact. \u201cTo calm concerns, we need absolute clarity on the deadline for making energy efficiency improvements to EPC band C, clarity at a policy level on how our housing stock reaches carbon net zero, and clarity on the level of monetary support landlords will receive for making energy efficiency improvements.\u201d A government spokesman said: \u201cThe government\u2019s record on energy efficiency speaks for itself, with the proportion of homes in England with an EPC rating of C or above up from 14% in 2010 to 47% in 2022. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, an additional 300,000 of the UK\u2019s least energy efficient homes are in line for improvement under the new Great British Insulation Scheme, and we have committed \u00a36.6bn towards upgrades this parliament, plus a further \u00a36bn from 2025.\u201d"

            "title": "UK economy returns to slender growth as spending in pubs lifts output",
            "date": "2023-06-14T08:16:50Z",
            "content": "The UK economy eked out a return to growth in April as rising car sales and customers spending in pubs and bars helped output to recover from a wave of public sector strikes in the previous month. The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that gross domestic product rose by a slender 0.2% month on month, matching the forecasts of City economists for a recovery from March when output declined by 0.3%. Fuelled by an increase in consumer spending in the country\u2019s dominant services sector, the rise in activity was partly offset by a dip in health sector output, which was affected by junior doctors\u2019 strikes. Activity also fell in computer manufacturing and the pharmaceuticals industry. The ONS warned there were signs of stress emerging amid a sharp monthly fall in construction activity. Under pressure from rising interest rates and falling property values, it said housebuilders and estate agents had a poor month. The latest snapshot comes amid growing expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates for a 13th time in succession next week from its current level of 4.5% in response to stubbornly high inflation, adding to the pressure on households and businesses already reeling from the sharpest rise in borrowing costs for decades. Economists said the return to growth in April could be interpreted by the Bank\u2019s policymakers as a sign that higher interest rates have not yet dampened demand enough to reduce inflationary pressure. Kitty Ussher, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cHouseholds responded to the improving weather in April by raising their levels of discretionary spending \u2013 even in the face of rising costs.\u201d Figures on Tuesday showed activity in the UK jobs market was stronger than expected in April, with wage growth hitting the highest level on record outside the Covid pandemic. Inflation fell by less than expected in April to 8.7% \u2013 the highest level in the G7 \u2013 fuelling expectations for a rate rise. \u201cThe facts remain that families are feeling worse off, facing a soaring Tory mortgage penalty and we\u2019re lagging behind on the global stage,\u201d said Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor. \u201cDespite our country\u2019s huge potential and promise, today is another day in the dismal low growth record book of this Conservative government.\u201d More broadly, GDP grew by 0.1% over the three months to April, lifting Britain\u2019s economy marginally above pre-pandemic levels. However, analysts warned that the resurgence in activity was unlikely to last, thanks to higher interest rates hitting the spending power of mortgage holders. Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the consultancy estimated that more than 60% of the drag on the economy from higher borrowing costs was yet to be felt. Financial markets also anticipate the Bank will increase rates by more than one percentage point from the current level of 4.5%. \u201cThat\u2019s why we still think a recession is on its way in the second half of this year,\u201d she added. Late last year, economists feared the UK would be in recession by now. However, falling global energy prices and rising consumer confidence have helped to bolster activity. The economy grew by 0.1% over the first quarter, matching the performance in the final three months of 2022. Revised figures last week showed the eurozone sank into a mild recession around the turn of the year, after two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP. The US economy grew by 0.3% in the first quarter, after 0.6% growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said the International Monetary Fund forecast the UK economy would be growing faster than Germany, France and Italy from 2025. \u201cBut high growth needs low inflation, so we must stick relentlessly to our plan to halve the rate this year to protect family budgets.\u201d However, business leaders warned there was little to celebrate, with a growth rate close to zero. \u201cThe economy continues to skirt recession,\u201d said David Bharier, the head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce. \u201cFurther upcoming changes on trade with the EU, such as new reporting requirements and import charges, will also add more pressure to exporters, many of whom have seen diminished activity due to mounting trade barriers.\u201d"

That\u2019s a concern since Labour backtracked on its centrepiece green prosperity plan after aggressive attacks by critics from both outside the party and within. The plan, as originally set out, was to borrow \u00a328bn a year from the beginning of a Labour government to invest in wind power, tidal energy, solar, green hydrogen, battery factories, home insulation, carbon-capture and other climate-friendly projects. The plan acknowledged that achieving a decarbonised, more sustainable and more resilient economy requires a substantial commitment by the state because the private sector on its own will not do what needs to be done. The Labour leader and his colleagues have cast it as a British version of Joe Biden\u2019s Green New Deal designed to pump up investment in cutting-edge technologies and reduce our dependence on hydrocarbons that can be weaponised by tyrants while creating high-skill, well-paid jobs in left-behind regions. It is \u2013 or, at any rate, was \u2013 Sir Keir\u2019s best riposte to the charge that Labour doesn\u2019t have much to offer that is ambitious and inspirational. Yet there\u2019s been chuntering against the green prosperity plan from within Labour\u2019s own ranks ever since he chose to put it front and centre of his leader\u2019s speech to the last party conference. A gripe I hear from some Labour MPs is that it is not \u201cconnecting\u201d with voters who \u2013 or so it is claimed \u2013 are less bothered about the climate crisis than they are by stubbornly high inflation and the crunch on living standards. Another issue is the price tag. A Labour government will be handed a dire inheritance from the Tories and face intense pressures to spend more in every area of the public realm. Those who think the NHS or schools or insert-your-preferred-priority-here should come first have resented the scale of the commitment to the green transition. In the rumbles of dissent from Labour frontbenchers, I have detected envy that the chequebook has been opened for what some see as Mr Miliband\u2019s passion project. The more so because other members of the shadow cabinet asking for permission to make spending promises are shown the hand by Ms Reeves and Pat McFadden, her flinty deputy. The levees broke when she announced the plan could no longer be reconciled with the fiscal rules she says she will impose on a Labour government. Her desire to be a \u201cgreen chancellor\u201d takes second place to her determination to be seen as an \u201ciron chancellor\u201d. Labour\u2019s pledges are now subject to delays, a change of position confirmed by Sir Keir last week. Rather than invest \u00a328bn annually from the first year of a Labour government, the figure has turned into a more distant target that they aim to hit by the second half of the next parliament. Their explanation is that the cost of borrowing has ballooned since the plan was devised in 2021 and the public finances look much worse. In other words, blame the Tories. This alibi is accompanied by senior shadow cabinet members saying, at least in private, that the state isn\u2019t equipped to funnel a lot of money into decarbonisation projects from day one of a Labour government. This implicitly admits that they were green, in the sense of being naive, in once thinking this would be possible. Mr Miliband has put a brave face on any disappointment he may feel by saying that Labour remains \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to the green transition. He is telling allies that he\u2019s content because those who agitated to have the plan chucked out have lost and the party\u2019s senior leadership is now locked in. Sir Keir is keen to emphasise that other pledges, such as creating a new state-owned energy company, remain intact. Still, there\u2019s no disguising that this is a significant retreat. Green campaigners have expressed dismay while Tories have jeered about another \u201cStarmer flip-flop\u201d, but there\u2019s not been as much blowback as senior Labour people feared. That\u2019s because attention has been focused elsewhere: on the defenestration from parliament of Boris Johnson and the rolling economic miseries engulfing Rishi Sunak. This has meant that some key questions for Labour have been under-scrutinised. Is it realistic to think that the UK can generate all its electricity from clean sources by the end of this decade? Sir Keir maintains that is still his mission, but a lot of expert opinion is sceptical. The polite say it sounds \u201chighly ambitious\u201d. The ruder say there\u2019s not \u201ca hope in hell\u201d of achieving the target. Labour claims it can kickstart growth to turn the UK into the fastest-expanding economy in the G7. Does that still add up when investment in a critical component is going to start later than originally promised? A hard pledge has softened into a vaguer-sounding goal. The wary are suspicious that it will next dissolve into nothing better than a wispy aspiration. That would be bad for the country and for the planet. It would mean not being competitive in the global race to develop technologies, create jobs and master markets of the future. It would leave Sir Keir bereft of a flagship policy. For sure, Labour has to persuade voters it will invest wisely, but the money needs to be placed in perspective. Government spends more than \u00a31tn a year. Compared with that mountain, \u00a328bn is a molehill. The cost of government schemes to help people cope with soaring energy bills is expected to come in somewhere north of \u00a375bn with no new infrastructure, technology or employment opportunities to show for it. The Conservatives borrowed an ocean of cash, upwards of \u00a3400bn on some estimates, to mitigate the impact of Covid-19. Most people agreed that this was justified because the pandemic was such a threat to lives and livelihoods. The climate crisis is an existential menace to the planet which imperils many more lives and livelihoods. In that context, an annual investment of \u00a328bn to accelerate attainment of net zero is not such an extraordinary sum. It is small change compared with the epic damage that will be inflicted on the economy and the public finances if we fail to progress with sufficient urgency. The political advantage to Labour of the green prosperity plan is that it is future-facing and creates a crisp dividing line with Tories who are too divided among themselves to produce a coherent strategy to decarbonise the economy. There\u2019s a sizeable minority of voters for whom the climate crisis and the environment trumps everything. The Greens did rather well in May\u2019s local elections. At the general election, Sir Keir will be hoping to squeeze a chunk of that vote over to Labour. His chances of doing so will be reduced if these voters conclude that Labour\u2019s commitments are hollow. The majority of the electorate is supportive of net zero. Even at a time when there are many other things jostling for the attention of voters, surveys indicate that the climate ranks in the top four issues that they regard as the most important challenges facing the UK today. Anxiety about our frying planet tends to rise as you go down the age range. A compelling programme to address the climate crisis will be important in galvanising younger voters to turn out for Labour. For all these reasons, it had better be true that this shift on green policy is a tactical adjustment rather than the beginning of a headlong retreat. It should not be beyond Sir Keir and his team to make the green prosperity plan attractive. If the Labour party cannot sell lower bills, more jobs, a healthier planet, energy self-sufficiency and screwing Vladimir Putin to the electorate it might as well get out of the business of politics altogether. The Labour leader and his colleagues ought to be mindful of the dangers of giving the impression that they make grandiose-sounding pledges to change the world only then to retreat when they encounter challenge and resistance. That\u2019s not the way for an opposition to generate confidence. As a method of running a government, it would be terrible. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"

            "date": "2023-06-11T07:00:44Z",
            "content": "Rory McIlroy could spend half of his life battling misconceptions had he the inclination or the energy. The latest surround the supposed fury the 34-year-old should have over the extraordinary events of recent days, where aghast onlookers have witnessed the PGA and DP World Tours combine with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) to ensure \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 peace in our golfing time. A lesson in recent history would be apposite before McIlroy\u2019s position is considered. The Northern Irishman has cause to be conflicted. He was as stunned by Tuesday\u2019s announcement as everyone bar the handful of individuals who have changed the shape of elite golf for ever. The rest of us required smelling salts. Yet the sense McIlroy was embattled or insistent on continuing war is inaccurate. \u201cThis \u2018us versus them\u2019 thing has gotten way out of control,\u201d he said in the Guardian in October. McIlroy did not believe Saudi intentions in golf were bad but that they had been \u201cmisguided\u201d in how to spend vast swathes of money; namely on the rebel LIV circuit. McIlroy is a genius with golf club in hand but far smarter away from the course than he is widely given credit for. He is superb at sizing up people and situations. With this in mind, it is highly plausible he foresaw a settlement between warring factions. It was the nature and timing of it that caused \u201cshock\u201d to the four-time major winner. Far from backing away from ongoing and potentially explosive litigation, PIF has struck a deal with sworn enemies. What next? Joe Biden as Donald Trump\u2019s presidential running mate? As the PGA Tour\u2019s most prominent voice in the locker room, McIlroy went above and beyond in public and in private to keep players within the traditional model as LIV offers hovered. Little did McIlroy know that, as he tried to compute desperate disappointment after the Masters in April, the PGA Tour\u2019s commissioner, Jay Monahan, was breaking bread with the very people he had not only resisted for so long but encouraged the Northern Irishman to do on his behalf. Luckily for Monahan, McIlroy is not prone to bearing grudges. McIlroy is a self-confessed crowd pleaser. He will still be concerned about how his role looks to his peers and the public at large. As a director of the PGA Tour\u2019s player advisory council, McIlroy is well versed in the rantings of no-mark golfers who believe themselves grossly underpaid. Those who spurned LIV\u2019s advances will be squealing or, more accurately, will want to be compensated for supposed loyalty now it transpires there would have been a route back to the PGA Tour in any case. \u201cAll I\u2019ve tried to do is protect what the PGA Tour is and what the PGA Tour stands for,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cAnd I think it will continue to do that.\u201d The PGA Tour had a duty to be more protective of McIlroy, including by way of Monahan speaking routinely on his own behalf, long ago. By the time McIlroy reached the media room at the Canadian Open on Wednesday, he claimed it was the most uncomfortable he had felt in a year. This is a golfer, remember, who was reduced to tears after failing to win the Open last July. \u201cThe more that I can focus on the birdies and the bogeys instead of the stuff that\u2019s happened in the boardroom, I\u2019ll be much happier,\u201d McIlroy said. It would be a pity if McIlroy \u2013 articulate, forthright, well-intentioned \u2013 reassesses his public approach. It should also be noted corporate sharks penned golf\u2019s new world order. If McIlroy had a failing, it was in believing Monahan would operate differently to the PIF generals he is now in cahoots with. The timing of this drama may do McIlroy no harm. He has previous for prevailing against a backdrop of tumult. Yet in this condensed major season, McIlroy finds himself facing question upon question about sporting politics as the US Open, which begins on Thursday at Los Angeles Country Club, slips into view. It is an indicator of McIlroy\u2019s talent that his B, C or D game can place him on leaderboards \u2013 such as at the US PGA Championship \u2013 but the reality is that he had been out of sorts and appeared low on confidence before a bogey-free 67 on Friday in Toronto. This may prove a timely boost. There is no course and distance specialism or otherwise to draw on this time. LA Country Club has never staged a major before. This will, in fact, be the first men\u2019s major in the City of Angels for almost three decades. \u201cI have never played there,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cI\u2019ll first lay eyes on it on Monday when I get to LA. I\u2019ve watched some videos on YouTube. I know the look of the course and the topography a little bit and sort of what to expect. But you don\u2019t get a real grasp of it until you\u2019re actually out there and your feet are on the ground.\u201d Collin Morikawa and Scottie Scheffler were part of the successful US Walker Cup team at the same venue in 2017. No amount of money in the world can make a difference to McIlroy\u2019s life at this point (therein sits another misconception, that is he somehow too affected by dollar signs). But the claiming of a fifth major title, ending an occasional painful wait stretching back to August 2014, would kickstart a fresh chapter in his career. It would take a weight off his shoulders just as another, relating to golf\u2019s big picture, refuses to budge."

            "content": "Gisele Barreto Fetterman, married to a former mayor and lieutenant governor who is now a US senator, regrets how \u201cmean\u201d the US political scene has become, saying: \u201cI still hate politics.\u201d The wife of the Democratic Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman was speaking to MSNBC in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday. \u201cI still hate politics,\u201d Barreto Fetterman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I ended up here \u2026 I hated what it has become. And I think it can be very different of course and we need to elect the right people to change that. But it\u2019s just so mean.\u201d Barreto Fetterman came to the US from Brazil when she was seven, traveling with her mother and brother, without documentation. \u201cAfter 15 years of living in the shadows,\u201d her official biography says, \u201cGisele received her green card in 2004 and became a United States citizen in 2009.\u201d She married John Fetterman in 2008, when he had been mayor of Braddock for two years. In 2019, the 6ft 9in populist was elected lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. In 2022 he won a US Senate seat, defeating the TV doctor Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate endorsed by Donald Trump. During a campaign which quickly turned nasty, Fetterman suffered a stroke. After taking his seat in the Senate, he was hospitalised with depression. His wife, who has acted as his spokesperson, became the subject of rightwing attacks. In November, Barreto Fetterman told the New Republic: \u201cThe right wing hates women. They especially hate strong women, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. \u201cThe fact that a spouse of a senator-elect has been attacked nonstop for the past 24 hours and everyone\u2019s OK with it, and everyone thinks it\u2019s normal \u2026 It\u2019s not normal.\u201d She also told the magazine: \u201cSince entering the Capitol for training, my inbox has been completely filled with threats and horrible things. And that\u2019s because I\u2019ve been [on] loop on Fox News.\u201d In her new MSNBC interview, on Inside with Jen Psaki, Barreto Fetterman told the former White House press secretary she was \u201cso proud\u201d of her husband for seeking treatment for depression. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s so courageous, right, and we always read in the news about when something tragic happens to someone. And instead I want to read about someone talking openly about seeking help.\u201d Of rightwing attacks against her, she said: \u201cEntering this world of politics that I happen to fall into, people would always say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Gisele, you\u2019re gonna toughen up, you\u2019re gonna get a thicker skin.\u2019 And it was never like, \u2018We\u2019re going to address the issues.\u2019 It\u2019s like you\u2019re going to become stronger to deal with them. \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018I like my skin. It\u2019s just fine. I don\u2019t want a thicker skin. Let\u2019s talk about the actual issues, not how we should \u2026 become stronger to carry this weight.\u2019\u201d Asked why she thought she was attacked and threatened more than her husband, Barreto Fetterman said: \u201cI think it\u2019s the immigrant part of it. I think it\u2019s easier to attack women, right? Women are just a target.\u201d Barreto Fetterman said she wanted her attackers to know \u201cthat I can take it. Again. I\u2019m fine. But there are millions of young women, young girls that are watching this, and maybe making decisions that are not what they want for fear that they\u2019re next. And that\u2019s harmful.\u201d"

            "title": "Caroline Lucas was the best PM Britain never had \u2013 but she\u2019s shown us how to fix our politics | Neal Lawson",
            "date": "2023-06-08T13:00:32Z",
            "content": "With our forlorn sense that politics isn\u2019t working and that democracy is broken, as we feel the impacts of both climate change and the decision to leave the European Union in real time, the symbolic answer to our political crisis was always staring us in the face. It was Caroline Lucas, the best prime minister we never had \u2013 and, now that she is standing down from her Brighton Pavilion seat, we will never get. In her bold but gentle way, Lucas embodied the fact that politicians and politics could be better. Not perfect, but good enough. Good enough to know that meaningful change needs a vision of a good society to compel it, alongside bold enough policies and strong enough alliances to get us there. As the lone Green MP, Lucas embodied those traits and more. Necessity is the mother of invention. She had no choice but to forge alliances with other MPs, to work cooperatively on bills and campaigns on everything from stopping fracking to reversing the ludicrous privatisation of our water companies. Tony Benn famously said that politics wasn\u2019t about personalities but issues. He was both right and wrong. Politics is about ideas, movement and moments. But it is always about people \u2013 about political leaders. We need charismatic, inspiring and purposeful leadership. Not demagogues, but full-time professionals who know their job is to help us build a good society and lead good lives. The energy and ambition Lucas brought to this pursuit was incredible. Great works are performed, as Samuel Johnson told us, not by strength but by perseverance. Lucas persevered. But she is human. And political humans, as we saw with Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s former prime minister, tire and burn out. The system is so broken that no single person can hope to fix it. Lucas has signalled that she will continue to work tirelessly on climate change, again echoing Benn, who said on leaving Westminster that he was stepping down to spend more time with his politics. But Westminster, Whitehall and formal politics do matter. They are the sites that set the rules that determine how we regulate society, the economy and our democracy, and how we invest public money. While power has clearly slipped through the fingers of the formal political classes over the past few decades, away from the green benches to blue-chip corporations, big tech companies and, thankfully, to civil society campaigns, the role of formal politics in facing perma-crisis, while insufficient, is still necessary. We need a political class that can spend and regulate in the right way, that knows its job isn\u2019t to usher in a better world for us, but to create the conditions in which we can build it ourselves. Lucas knew that, but our political and democratic system is so broken it fails to people like her; it wears them down and spits them out. It hoards power at the centre, while opening itself up to the rich and powerful as it turns its back on the rest of us. It lets small factions win control of parties and ruthlessly exploit their position with impunity. It produces identikit MPs who meekly follow the whip in a system that puts party before country. So, it is bewildering that just when we need more politicians like Lucas, we lose those few we have. But big change was never going to come from within the system. It\u2019s too cosy and too keen to protect its interests over ours. So her leaving isn\u2019t a sign that all is lost, but that change can and must come to a broken edifice. It\u2019s as if the ravens are leaving the Tower of London. Some, such as Lucas and the compelling Labour MP Jon Cruddas, are jumping, others, such as Jamie Driscoll, the serving Labour mayor for North of Tyne, and Beth Winter, a south Wales Labour MP, are being pushed out. But it\u2019s a sign that change is coming. Everywhere beyond the desiccated walls of parliament, people are picking up the torch: the overwhelming majority of Labour members and unions who know we need proportional representation to create a fairer electoral system that brings in other voices; the thousands of activists and millions of voters who campaigned and voted tactically in the May local elections; the political experiments such as the primary being trialled in south Devon; the huge number of people on the streets for Extinction Rebellion, the companies queueing up for B Corp status to build an economy more in tune with our planet and its people. Everywhere, except Westminster, change is in the air. The brittle walls of the old politics will tumble. A better politics of collaboration and putting issues before parties looks like Lucas. We know what to do. She has shown us. Neal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation Compass"

            "content": "Re John Harris\u2019s article (Conspiracy theories are festering \u2013 and our politicians are making it worse, 18 June), the idea that \u201cthe world is controlled by a secretive elite\u201d may be a conspiracy theory, but you only have to change \u201celite\u201d to \u201celites\u201d for it to be, in essence, true. The governments of China and Russia are surely secretive elites. And are the governments of, say, the US and Britain (with their flawed systems of democracy, their governments formed by political parties funded by wealthy donors, supported by media owned by reclusive billionaires, beset by lobbyists, and served by administrative machines as opaque as they can keep them) really such paragons of transparency and honesty? The day before Harris\u2019s article you published an obituary of the US whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, who revealed that \u201ceverything that the American public had been told \u2026 about the Vietnam war \u2026 was false\u201d. Of course, Britain has its Freedom of Information Act, introduced by Tony Blair, who later said he regretted it. All governments are obsessed with secrecy, and all governments are, by definition, elites. Simon Wilson London \u2022 One of the ironies of conspiracy theories such as \u201cthe world is controlled by a secretive elite\u201d is that the real elite are hiding in plain sight. More than that, they want to be seen as victims. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, at the National Conservatism conference railed against \u201cself-appointed gurus, experts and elites who think they know best what is in the public\u2019s interest\u201d. When those who claim to oppose inequality merely suggest tinkering at the edges and warn that nothing else will be possible, people lose any belief that challenging class injustice is achievable. Conspiracy theories are the end result. The consequence is a politics that is the opposite of what it claims to represent. Donald Trump tells his working-class supporters: \u201cThey\u2019re not coming after me, they\u2019re coming after you \u2013 and I\u2019m just standing in their way.\u201d If the elite rant about Marxist mobs and \u201cwoke blobs\u201d, and the centre-left believe the elite are untouchable, then people either resign themselves to Labour\u2019s technocratic \u201cfiscal straitjacket\u201d or they come to believe that a secret elite runs the game. Nothing changes either way. Nick Moss London \u2022 I have often wondered why people become comfortable or satisfied with conspiracy theories. I can\u2019t help linking it to our children\u2019s education. We tell them there are unseen centres of power observing and interfering with their lives, from certain deities to Father Christmas and the tooth fairy. These all require the suspension of disbelief and the reinterpretation of events as evidence of hidden power at work. We set human brains up as fertile ground for conspiracy. Tom Hutchison Bath \u2022 I share John Harris\u2019s concern about conspiracy theories. They appeal to those often living in denial, who either can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to think rationally. Schools have an important role to play in fostering critical thinking, exposing the danger posed by conspiracy theories and confronting those that crop up in the classroom. Stan Labovitch Windsor, Berkshire \u2022 To those readers alarmed by the proliferation of conspiracy theories and their growing influence, can I suggest that they read Conspiracy by Tom Phillips and Jonn Elledge. The chapter on pandemics is most illuminating. The subtitle, A History of Boll*cks Theories, and How Not to Fall for Them, tells the reader all they need to know about the content.

            "date": "2023-06-16T12:17:23Z",
            "content": "Silvio Berlusconi was, in more ways than one, the televisual prophet of the neoliberal age. Though he officially entered politics only in 1994, his cultural hegemony began long before. From the early 80s, Berlusconi ruled Italy by means of entertainment, managing political life the same way he did his media conglomerates, translating Reaganite hedonism into Italian. His private TV channels changed the tastes of Italian audiences by bringing the action-filled dreams of American capitalism into their living rooms. The fuel that propelled the early days of Berlusconi\u2019s Mediaset empire was cinema, mostly American cinema. The budget for original content was limited, so pay TV filled programming schedules with films. Films that, back then, one could not see on other channels. For more than two decades, Mediaset successfully challenged the state television monopoly, thereby paving the way for the privatisation of everyday life. With the expediency of a pirate, he steered the nation away from the cinema of Fellini and Antonioni, towards the inexorable Americanisation of mass culture. Berlusconi went on to bring the colours and intoxicating freedom of consumer choice to wider Italian TV culture. Previously Italians could only choose from three public TV channels. RAI, the state broadcaster, hired the likes of Umberto Eco and avant garde composer Luciano Berio, while Berlusconi pied-pipered viewers with scantily clad women, quizshows and generous amounts of advertising. In 1981 Mediaset (then still called Fininvest) acquired the CBS soap opera Dallas and turned it into an audience favourite. Another golden acquisition was that of the TV host Mike Bongiorno, who Berlusconi bought from RAI in 1979. Born in the US to parents of Italian descent, Bongiorno became famous in the early days of Italian television for adapting popular American formats such as The $64,000 Question, Jeopardy and, after he started working for Berlusconi, The Wheel of Fortune. Crucial to Berlusconi\u2019s mass-media ascendancy was the figure of Antonio Ricci, a TV writer and showrunner who, in the words of Variety, \u201cwith his penchant for comedy and variety, changed the face of Italian television\u201d. State television programming up to then had appealed to a wide, inter-generational audience, Ricci\u2019s shows attracted younger spectators. His series \u2013 such as Drive In, Lupo Solitario and Striscia la Notizia \u2013 had a new rhythm: catchier, funnier and flashier, allowing for more commercial breaks whose tones and aesthetics seamlessly blended into his programmes. A post-ideological Italy enchanted by wealth, notoriety and status-seeking ambitions was immortalised in and moulded by Mediaset\u2019s programmes. It might not have been a pretty sight, but it was a very popular one. Anticipating the Netflix model, Berlusconi then started producing films to fill his own TV channels with. In the early 90s he entered a partnership with Vittorio Cecchi Gori and went on to produce films by Lucio Fulci, Bernardo Bertolucci, Ettore Scola, Giuseppe Tornatore and Franco Zeffirelli. Faced with the very concrete risk of ending up in jail due to his not-always-transparent business conduct, Berlusconi entered politics to seek parliamentary immunity. It worked. And his previous experience in entertainment proved vital: he surfed the rotten waters of Italian politics and brought neo-fascists out of the sewers and into parliament for the first time since the second world war. Now these same neo-fascists are ruling the country after being democratically elected. Berlusconi\u2019s last show was his own state funeral which Italians were able to watch, needless to say, on television."

            "content": "Ron DeSantis pledged on Wednesday that he would eliminate four federal agencies if he were elected president: the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, and Department of Education. \u201cIf Congress will work with me on doing that, we\u2019ll be able to reduce the size and scope of government,\u201d the Florida governor said in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Martha MacCallum. \u201cIf Congress won\u2019t go that far, I\u2019m going to use those agencies to push back against woke ideology and against the leftism that we see creeping into all institutions of American life.\u201d Presidential candidates have long tried to eliminate federal agencies, but cannot do so unilaterally, needing Congress to go along with the plan. Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, had one of the most embarrassing moments in a presidential campaign in recent memory during a 2011 debate, when he forgot one of the agencies he wanted to eliminate. Donald Trump later tapped him to lead that agency, the Department of Energy. DeSantis offered the proposals as he continues to significantly lag behind Donald Trump in polls for the GOP presidential nomination. The Florida governor is moving to run to the right of Trump on key issues, hoping to mobilize the GOP\u2019s conservative base. DeSantis is also facing scrutiny over his use of government resources in Texas, the Daily Beast reported. On Monday, when he visited the Texas-Mexico border, his campaign posted a photo of him standing in front of a helicopter owned by the Texas department of public safety (DPS). It\u2019s not clear who paid for the effort, but Texas ethics rules bar the use of state resources to assist in a political campaign. As a candidate for president, DeSantis is also required to pay \u201cfair market value\u201d for non-commercial flights. DeSantis\u2019s office told the New York Times his visit was both in a campaign and official capacity. The Texas Department of Public Safety told the Times that the purpose of the trip was so DeSantis could see how Florida government equipment was being used to curb migration. Texas and Florida have a joint immigration enforcement program, Operation Lone Star, which was announced in May. \u201cThe briefing included an aerial tour which was provided by DPS in order to give Governor DeSantis a clearer understanding of how Florida\u2019s resources are being utilized along our southern border and see the challenges first hand,\u201d Ericka Miller, a DPS spokesperson, told the Times. Earlier this year, DeSantis\u2019s former state political committee in Florida transferred $82.5m to a federal Super Pac supporting him \u2013 a move critics said ran afoul of federal law because Super Pacs are supposed to be independent from candidates. DeSantis also signed a law in Florida making it more difficult to track his travel and see who is paying for it. DeSantis was also given a tour of the Rio Grande river on a boat owned by the Florida government, the New York Times reported. After the event, he gave a lengthy campaign speech on immigration."

            "date": "2023-06-02T17:20:54Z",
            "content": "A mastermind of the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse two years ago has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a federal court judge in Florida. Rodolphe Jaar, a Haitian-Chilean businessman, conspired with a group of Colombian mercenaries to murder Mo\u00efse at his home in Port-au-Prince on 7 July 2021. Prosecutors at his sentencing hearing in Miami said Jaar obtained the weapons used in the \u201ccommando-style\u201d attack that killed Mo\u00efse, 53, and seriously injured his wife. Jaar, 50, a convicted drug trafficker and US government informant, pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy to commit murder or kidnapping outside the US, and providing material support resulting in death. He was among 11 people arrested and charged in the US, after his extradition from the Dominican Republic \u2013 and so far the only one to admit guilt. A trial is set to begin in Miami next month for the others, but is likely to be delayed, authorities said. The sentence from federal judge Jos\u00e9 E Mart\u00ednez was the maximum Jaar could have received. Court papers from his plea hearing stated that he provided personnel and funds to kidnap Mo\u00efse, but the plot evolved into murder. Some of the money was used to purchase weapons and bribe members of the president\u2019s security detail, prosecutors said. His alleged co-conspirators are a mix of politicians, businessmen and military figures, including the former Haitian senator Joseph Joel John, Haitian-American Joseph Vincent, retired Colombian army captain Germ\u00e1n Rivera, and Antonio Intriago, the Venezuelan owner of a private security firm in Miami. Colombian authorities have said that Rivera received $50,000 for helping to plot the assassination. The US Department of Justice revealed details of the murder plan in a statement in May last year announcing the extradition of John from Jamaica. The conspirators met several times in Haiti and Florida to finalize the operation that Bocchit Edmond, the Haitian ambassador to the US, told the Guardian at the time was: \u201can act of barbarity. It\u2019s an attack on our democracy.\u201d First lady Martine Marie \u00c9tienne Mo\u00efse, who has since recovered, said in 2021 that her husband\u2019s murderers \u201ccame to to kill his dream, his vision, his ideology\u201d for the western hemisphere\u2019s most impoverished nation. Since the assassination, Haiti has descended into crisis, with violence from street gangs and vigilantes prevalent, and communities fighting back with bloody reprisals of their own. \u201cFaced with these increasingly violent armed gangs vying for control of neighborhoods of the capital, with limited or no police presence, some residents have begun to take matters into their own hands,\u201d the Ecuadorian diplomat Mar\u00eda Isabel Salvador told the UN security council in March. \u201cThese dynamics lead unfailingly to the breakdown of social fabric with unpredictable consequences for the entire region.\u201d The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report"

            "title": "Biden is America\u2019s oldest president \u2013 but tripping over a sandbag tells us nothing | Jill Filipovic",
            "date": "2023-06-02T19:48:12Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s a story so benign and unremarkable that it\u2019s embarrassing it\u2019s getting any coverage at all: man trips, falls, stands back up and walks it off. Except, of course, that the man is Joe Biden, who at 80 and seeking re-election is currently competing to be the oldest president in US history. On Thursday, Biden was at the US Air Force Academy graduation ceremony handing out the last diploma when he tripped over a black sandbag. He got back up with a hand from Secret Service agents, and walked himself back to his seat. By all accounts, he was fine. This isn\u2019t the first time a president or White House-seeker\u2019s stumble or unsteadiness has proven to be ripe fodder for both the opposition and the media. Donald Trump, who before Biden was the oldest first-term president in US history, was wobbly on his feet at the graduation ceremony for the US Military Academy at West Point in 2020, and seemed to struggle to raise a glass to his lips. That fueled broad speculation about the then president\u2019s health. With the leading 2024 contenders both well into their golden years, it\u2019s reasonable to ask if they\u2019re cognitively and physically up to the task. Being president is taxing on all levels, and Americans are justified in wanting to elect a leader who is cognitively sharp and possesses the physical stamina to endure a punishing travel schedule and long days that often involve too little sleep. Tripping over a sandbag and then righting oneself, though, offers no insight into Biden\u2019s physical or cognitive health. The \u201cBiden falls\u201d story doesn\u2019t tell us much. Biden tripped, in a minor accident that could have befallen any one of us. The concern (or feigned concern) over it also only reveals what we already know: that the president, as well as the leading presidential contender from the Republican party, are both elderly men, and that comes with risks, broken bones from falls among them. And it is true that falls among the elderly can cause serious injuries, which can lead to swift decline. But Biden was fine; the only story is that he fell, which is only a story because he\u2019s old. And \u201che\u2019s old\u201d doesn\u2019t make for much of a partisan gotcha: if Biden is too old to be president, then so is Trump, and vice versa. Instead, Biden detractors zero in on what they say are his deficits, tripping over a badly placed sandbag apparently among them. Putting aside this specific story which truly is nothing more than \u201cman trips\u201d, an anecdote even less interesting than \u201cdog bites man\u201d, it\u2019s worth asking which physical skills are actually necessary to do the job of president. One of the greatest American presidents, after all, used a wheelchair to get around, with no apparent impact on his ability to govern (yes, he also died in office \u2013 not ideal, but also not related to his disability). Governor Greg Abbott of Texas is no less effective (and no less inclined toward a politics of cruelty than any other Republican) by his wheelchair usage. The question of which physical capacities a president needs is a complicated one. Is it enough to have the physical fitness to physically show up to the job every day? Or do we need a president to radiate a kind of strength and vitality that gives him or her a subtle advantage in negotiations? Which basic physical skills \u2013 standing for long periods, navigating stairs easily, lifting one\u2019s arms above one\u2019s head, standing unassisted \u2013 reflect the broader fitness necessary to make it through an arduous presidential schedule? I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions, and I doubt even the most skilled doctors can draw clear and bright lines. What is obvious, though, is that cognitive fitness should be non-negotiable, and our demands for it similarly tuned to the requirements of an executive. Biden is not a Strom Thurmond or a Dianne Feinstein, in office clearly past the ability to cognitively function at the level necessary to carry out basic legislative duties. Still, his \u2013 and Trump\u2019s \u2013 cognitive fitness are fair areas for inquiry. So too is their moral fitness, a scale on which Biden clearly surpasses the former president. If the 2024 election does pit Biden against Trump, it will again be an unprecedented one: the first election in US history in which the winner will be above 80 when he leaves office, assuming he survives all four years. This should indeed be cause for concern, and should spur on some serious soul-searching among Democratic party leaders in particular to ask how and why they\u2019ve failed to cultivate and support fresh young talent in a party whose voter base skews younger, browner and more female. Age, cognitive health and physical fitness are all fair concerns to have about a president or presidential contender. A man tripping over a sandbag, though, doesn\u2019t tell us much about any of them. Jill Filipovic is the author of OK Boomer, Let\u2019s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind"

            "title": "Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan announces new cabinet",
            "date": "2023-06-03T20:05:39Z",
            "content": "The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, announced his new cabinet after a lavish inauguration ceremony on Saturday, marking the beginning of his third decade in office with appointments intended to hint at a move towards orthodox economic policy and muscular diplomacy. At a swearing in where he attempted to strike a unifying tone in contrast with much of his campaign, Erdo\u011fan said: \u201cWe will embrace all 85 million people of Turkey, regardless of their political view, roots, creed or sect.\u201d The inauguration was attended by heads of state including the Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Azerbaijani\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, the Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan. Also in attendance was the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, reportedly in Turkey to pressure Ankara to allow Sweden to join the organisation \u201cas early as possible\u201d. Erdo\u011fan, whose re-election was buoyed up by a newly hard-right coalition in the Turkish parliament, has repeatedly accused Sweden of harbouring Kurdish militants hostile to the Turkish state. He told CNN in a recent interview that \u201cwe cannot look favourably on Sweden\u2019s membership in Nato\u201d, amid increasing demands for Sweden\u2019s membership from the White House, including during a congratulatory phone call with Joe Biden. The Turkish president won re-election with 52.18% compared with his rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu with 47.82% last week, after a campaign where the opposition challenged Erdo\u011fan on his economic record as well as the country\u2019s increasing shift towards one-man rule. A cabinet reshuffle as well as the return of widely respected economist Mehmet \u015eim\u015fek provided signs of a potential new direction for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rule, after his previous five-year term was marked by an increasingly unorthodox economic policy. The choice to appoint Hakan Fidan, the longtime head of Turkey\u2019s National Intelligence Organization (MIT), as foreign minister to replace tenured diplomat Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu suggests a future potential shift in Turkey\u2019s style of foreign relations. Fidan headed MIT for 13 years, and has had recent meetings in Moscow with his Russian, Iranian and Syrian counterparts concerning the conflict in Syria. \u201cHe is my secret-keeper, he is the state\u2019s secret-keeper,\u201d Erdo\u011fan once said of Fidan. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s decision to name \u015eim\u015fek finance minister was heralded in the domestic and financial press in advance of the announcement, with the move expected to reassure markets as the Turkish lira hit a new low during Erdo\u011fan\u2019s inauguration, trading near 21 to the dollar. \u015eim\u015fek\u2019s appointment, along with a potential new head of the Turkish central bank, provided tentative signs that Erdo\u011fan could be willing to relinquish some of his control over the central bank, as well as move away from economic policies founded on his belief that interest rates cause, rather than curb, inflation. Some observers said that while \u015eim\u015fek\u2019s appointment was welcome the real test would be in what policies emerge from the new cabinet. Liam Peach of Capital Economics wrote that \u015eim\u015fek\u2019s appointment to the cabinet \u201cprovides encouraging signs that President Erdogan will moderate his economic policies. But there are still question marks about whether policymakers are about to embark on a fully fledged return to orthodoxy.\u201d \u015eim\u015fek previously served as Erdo\u011fan\u2019s deputy prime minister prior to the introduction of a presidential system, as well as minister of finance after seven years at investment firm Merrill Lynch, a short period with UBS on Wall Street and as chief economist at the US embassy in Ankara. His departure from government also heralded a clear shift away from conventional economics. Turkey has had four different heads of the central bank since 2018, a period in which the Turkish lira has plummeted, including losing over half its value relative to the dollar in one year alone. Skyrocketing inflation has come in tandem with a cost of living crisis affecting the majority of Turkish citizens. The unofficial Inflation Research Group, ENAG, calculates Turkey\u2019s year-on-year inflation as 105.19%, with notable price increases in the cost of food."

            "title": "At least 100 million people are eligible to run for US president. Why are we left with Robert F Kennedy Jr? | Arwa Mahdawi",
            "date": "2023-06-06T13:00:22Z",
            "content": "Robert F Kennedy Jr likes to talk to dead people. In a recent interview, the anti-vaccine activist, who is challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination, said he talks to the dearly departed daily. \u201cThey are one-way prayers for strength and wisdom,\u201d he later clarified. \u201cI get no strategic advice from the dead.\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem as if he needs it. Kennedy, who is the nephew of the former President John F Kennedy and the son of the assassinated presidential hopeful Robert F Kennedy, is doing pretty well in the land of the living. While it is incredibly unlikely that the 69-year-old will wangle his way into the White House, his long-shot presidential campaign has gained momentum. According to a recent CNN poll, 20% of Democratic voters say they support RFK to be the party\u2019s candidate and 64% say they would consider supporting him. That is well behind Biden (who came in with 60% of supporters) but nothing to sniff at. Particularly considering that Kennedy doesn\u2019t have many policies, just a famous last name \u2013 and a penchant for spreading conspiracy theories and referencing Anne Frank in offensive ways. On Sunday, Kennedy got a boost to his campaign when Twitter\u2019s co-founder, Jack Dorsey, retweeted a video of the candidate saying he could beat the former President Donald Trump and the Florida governor Ron DeSantis in 2024. Dorsey captioned the video with: \u201cHe can and will.\u201d When a Twitter user asked if the tweet was an endorsement or a prediction, the billionaire replied: \u201cBoth.\u201d Dorsey is not exactly a political kingmaker, but he has influence and money so his endorsements matter. Dorsey isn\u2019t the only tech bro eyeing up Kennedy. On Monday, Elon Musk hosted a conversation with RFK on Twitter Spaces. I imagine Musk was thrilled with how this turned out: it wasn\u2019t plagued with the same technical glitches that affected his conversation with Republican DeSantis last month and Kennedy spent much of the conversation licking Musk\u2019s boots. At one point, RFK compared the Twitter troll to colonists who died during the American revolution in order to give \u201cus our constitution.\u201d He went on to blame school shootings on antidepressants: \u201cPrior to the introduction of Prozac we had almost none of these events in our country,\u201d he said. This was among a number of other questionable statements. It\u2019s easy to make fun of RFK, to dismiss him as a wacky conspiracy theorist. But it\u2019s more productive to ask why he resonates with so many people. Again, 64% of Democratic-leaning voters say they either support or would consider supporting him being the Democratic party candidate \u2013 that\u2019s not a small number. While Kennedy may spread vaccine misinformation, his platform also taps into very real feelings of frustration and desperation in the US. One of RFK\u2019s big talking points is \u201cthe corrupt merger of state and corporate power\u201d and the decimation of the middle class. Those aren\u2019t conspiracy theories; they are facts. The middle class is shrinking in the US and polls show that the majority of Americans on either side of the aisle think the government is corrupt and rigged against normal people. Of course it is going to resonate when a politician rails against this. Of course it\u2019s going to resonate when someone says they are going to challenge the deeply unfair status quo. To be clear: this isn\u2019t an endorsement of RFK. Rather, it\u2019s a primal scream of frustration. Let\u2019s do a bit of quick maths, shall we? There are more than 331 million people in the US. Let\u2019s say more than half of those people can\u2019t run for president because they are too young or don\u2019t fulfil the various technical requirements; that still gives you at least 100 million eligible people. That\u2019s a big talent pool! Surely there should be an inspiring field of candidates standing in 2024? Well, no. There isn\u2019t. There is Biden, obviously. He has decades of experience, sure, but he is also 80 years old and will be 86 at the end of a second term. And he is not particularly popular. Still, the Democratic establishment have closed ranks around him and he\u2019s the only real candidate: his sole challengers are kooky outsiders. RFK, a man who speaks to dead people, and Marianne Williamson, a woman who once tweeted \u2013 before deleting the comment \u2013 that hurricanes can be stopped with the power of the mind. And on the other side? The leading candidate is Trump, a sexual predator. Why don\u2019t people have any trust in politicians these days? This might be why. \u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist"
