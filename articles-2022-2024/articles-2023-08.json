            "date": "2023-08-25T03:05:34Z",
            "content": "In a lightning visit to Atlanta, Donald Trump was formally arrested after being indicted by Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis for trying to overturn the 2020 election, then released after posting a $200,000 bail bond. The visit to the county jail \u2013 a pilgrimage many of his co-defendants made this week \u2013 produced an image that will no doubt endure in American politics: his mug shot, the first ever taken of a former US president. Trump embraced the scowling portrait, even deploying it on Twitter in his first post since two days after the January 6 insurrection, when the platform temporarily booted him. That may be the biggest news of all. Trump used Twitter like no other politician during his successful White House run in 2016, and throughout his four years in office. We\u2019ll be watching to see if he tries to repeat the trick as he runs for president once again. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Willis asked a judge to start the trials in her case on 23 October \u2013 a speedy deadline that Trump is likely to fight. But Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who assisted Trump as he looked for ways to prevent Joe Biden from taking office, will go to trial on 23 October, after he asked that his case be resolved quickly. House Republicans are running interference for Trump once again by announcing an investigation into Willis. Mark Meadows, who was Trump\u2019s chief of staff around the time of his election loss and was indicted in Georgia, wants his trial moved to federal court. One thing we learned from last night\u2019s Republican presidential debate (which Trump skipped): opinions on abortion access range more than one might expect among the candidates. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is putting his mug shot to use wherever they can, but Chris LaCivita, a senior advisor to his presidential campaign, is warning other parties against using it: Donald Trump is free to tweet his mug shot because he posted a $200,000 bond that will allow him to stay out of jail while his case in Georgia is resolved. The Washington Post interviewed a Georgia bail bondsman at a company called Red Eye Bail Bonds (who asked to stay anonymous, citing privacy concerns and the headaches that can come with weighing in on American politics). While the bond was in the \u201ctop tier\u201d of what he deals with, the bondsman said Trump\u2019s case isn\u2019t as unusual as it may appear, at least from the perspective of a bondsman: In general, the manager said, Red Eye requires that a client provide 10 percent of the total bond. If the person under arrest is deemed to be a higher risk, that percentage increases. If the risk is higher, the company also will do more on the front end to establish whether resources exist to recoup the full value of the bond. Does the client own a house? Things like this. After all, while Red Eye requires only 10 percent, the county requires the whole thing. That doesn\u2019t mean that the firm has to put up $200,000 in cash. The whole point of involving a bondsman, after all, is that the firm serves as a proxy of trust on behalf of clients. There is a specialized power of attorney that is granted the firm, and when Red Eye decides to act as a guarantor for a client, a sum reflecting the total bond is frozen with the firm\u2019s insurer. I asked whether Trump\u2019s $200,000 was unusually high. The manager thought about it for a moment before determining that it was in the \u201ctop tier\u201d of what he usually sees. The midrange is about $100,000 or $110,000, he told me, but in cases involving more serious charges, costs could run higher. He was also not fazed by the unique circumstances of Trump\u2019s situation. He often has clients who are facing more than one indictment; that shows up in the initial analysis of the case and factors into the consideration of the arrestee as a flight risk. It is also not unusual for one party to live out of state, as Trump does. (He used the example of a college kid getting arrested and his parents posting bond remotely.) This, too, would on other occasions give him pause. But he wasn\u2019t really worried about Trump. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think he\u2019s just outright not going to show up in court,\u201d he said. This wasn\u2019t just about Trump; in other \u201chigh-end cases like that, most likely or not the families are not going anywhere.\u201d (I didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s recent social media post about moving to Russia.) Citing two sources, CNN has more details on why Donald Trump opted to pose the way he did in his mug shot: Twitter banned Donald Trump two days after the January 6 attack, citing \u201cthe risk of further incitement of violence\u201d. That all changed about a year-and-a-half later when, after a tortuous process that nearly went to court, billionaire Elon Musk bought the influential social media platform. Musk, who recently renamed the platform X, was already a prolific tweeter and after buying the site held a poll asking whether Trump should be let back on. A slim majority said yes, and Trump\u2019s account was reinstated last November, but the former president did not use it \u2013 until today. Donald Trump has used his Twitter account for the first time since two days after the January 6 insurrection to share a photo of his newly taken mug shot: It seems Donald Trump was happy with the mugshot authorities took at the Fulton county jail during his appearance there this evening. It\u2019s on the front of his main fundraising page, and his campaign is already selling t-shirts with the photo on the front and the words \u201cNEVER SURRENDER!\u201d on the back. For all the spectacle the arrest of Donald Trump and his co-defendants provided in Georgia, the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports that it is unlikely to change the basic dynamics of next year\u2019s presidential election: One by one this week, they\u2019ve made their way to 901 Rice Street, the address of the notorious Fulton county jail. Lawyers, government officials, a former state party chair and others have all surrendered to authorities after being charged as part of an alleged criminal effort to overturn the 2020 election. On Thursday, the head of that enterprise, Donald Trump, himself surrendered, marking another historic moment for a president who has reshaped the rules of American politics. This is the closest that Trump has been to a jail cell to date and serves as a blunt reminder that no American or former president is above the law. Like nearly everything Trump does, his surrender was orchestrated to be a spectacle. He deliberately timed his surrender, 7.30pm, to maximize cable news coverage. Reporters camped outside the jail all day on Thursday as temperatures reached mid-90F and Trump supporters gathered for a demonstration. There was wall-to-wall news coverage of Trump\u2019s motorcade and arrival at the jail. While politicians typically try and shift attention away from their criminal legal troubles, Trump has embraced it, feeding into the circuit by advertising his surrender time. Donald Trump\u2019s hostility shines through in the mugshot taken at the Fulton county jail as he was booked on charges of trying to steal the 2020 presidential election. The former president turns his eyes up to glare toward the camera above him. Dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie, he makes no attempt to put on a smile like some of his co-accused in their booking photos. Instead, his mouth is taut and downturned. The picture does not flatter, but it does convey the message many of Trump\u2019s supporters want to hear \u2013 one of belligerence. The six-pointed star of the Fulton county sheriff\u2019s office badge and the name of the sheriff, Patrick Labat, sits in the top left-hand corner of the picture. But some will be disappointed that Trump is not seen in the classic pose holding a board in front of his chest with his name and date of arrest. For all that, the former president\u2019s supporters are already embracing the booking photo as a badge of honour and defiance. It will be held up as evidence that their man will not give up the fight against a system his followers see as ever more determined to bring him down and prevent him returning to the White House. The mugshot\u2019s rapid appearance on T-shirts, posters and, well, mugs glorifying a martyred Trump can be expected. The president\u2019s detractors, on the other hand, will see the booking photo as evidence that even a man who was once the most powerful person in the land cannot escape the might of the justice system. Some will welcome anything that makes him look even a little bit more criminal as a confirmation that sooner or later he is going to prison. The accused may be innocent until a plea or a jury says otherwise, but mugshots can have a way of conveying guilt. Donald Trump\u2019s plane has now departed Atlanta, but the former president will undoubtedly be back. The question is: when? Expect Trump\u2019s lawyers to do everything they can to delay his trial on the indictment brought by Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis. For a taste of his likely strategy, take a look at the pre-trial motions in the federal case brought against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election, where Trump\u2019s lawyers have proposed a trial date in 2026. A judge has yet to decide the matter. Here is the mug shot of Donald Trump that was taken when he was arrested at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta: No former US president has ever had his mug shot taken. Here\u2019s a video clip of Donald Trump\u2019s brief remarks to reporters before departing Atlanta: Before boarding his plane at Atlanta\u2019s airport, Donald Trump spoke briefly to reporters about his arrest. \u201cWhat has taken place here is a travesty of justice. We did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong, and everybody knows that,\u201d Trump said, hewing to the line he has taken repeatedly as the investigations into his attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat have unfolded. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is election interference,\u201d he added, in a nod to his ongoing campaign to return to the White House in the 2024 polls. \u201cWe did nothing wrong at all, and we have every right, every single right, to challenge an election that we think is dishonest.\u201d He declined to answer shouted questions from the press, including about whether he would pardon himself if he is again elected president. Donald Trump is expected to speak at the Atlanta airport before he boards his private plane, CNN reports. The former president made remarks from the tarmac in Washington DC earlier this month, after appearing in federal court to answer charges related to the plot to stop Joe Biden from taking office and the January 6 insurrection. Just before he arrived in Atlanta, Donald Trump (or whoever writes his messages for him) sent an email to supporters that begins: \u201cThis will be my last email to you before I enter the Fulton County Jail to be ARRESTED as an innocent man.\u201d It\u2019s a gripping opening line, and indeed, this was a big moment: Trump\u2019s trip to jail was something no former president has ever gone through. The 250-plus words that follow are filled with dire proclamations. \u201cThe people of our country will watch in shock and horror as a former President \u2013 and the LEADING OPPONENT to the current regime \u2013 gets WRONGFULLY ARRESTED in a notoriously violent jail at the hands of the ruling political party\u201d, Trump protests in a typical line. \u201cI\u2019m now about to enter Fulton County Jail. These are my last words to you before my sham arrest: I WILL NEVER SURRENDER OUR MISSION TO SAVE AMERICA\u201d he continues. And that\u2019s when the message\u2019s purpose becomes clear: \u201cPlease make a contribution to peacefully defend our movement as the Deep State tries to JAIL me for life as an innocent man all because I put AMERICA first.\u201d The text itself is actually a hyperlink that leads to a donation page run by WinRed \u2013 a fundraising platform with a history of ripping off consumers. Below that is a series of boxes beginning at $24 and going up to $250. Perhaps the goal is to cover the $20,000 he had to put down to bond out of the Fulton county jail. The motorcade carrying Donald Trump has left the Fulton county jail, about 20 minutes after he arrived to be formally arrested following his indictment by district attorney Fani Willis on charges related to trying to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s election victory in the state. Donald Trump had his mugshot taken during his processing into custody at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, CNN reports, citing the county sheriff. It\u2019s possible that Donald Trump will have his mugshot taken when he is processed into custody in Fulton county \u2013 as has been the case with the other co-defendants who have surrendered at the jail. Outside the jail, rightwing Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was not involved in the case but is nonetheless an enthusiastic supporter of the former president, announced she had made her own mugshot, and encouraged other Trump fans to do the same: She has indeed made the mugshot her Twitter (or X) profile picture. Donald Trump\u2019s booking details have been posted on the Fulton county jail\u2019s website. Besides listing the 13 charges the former president faces, the jail provides his identifying details: white male, 6ft 3in in height, 215lbs, blond or strawberry hair, blue eyes. Donald Trump has been officially booked into the Fulton county jail after being indicted for trying to meddle in Georgia\u2019s elections three years ago, Reuters reports. The former president plans to post a $200,000 bond that will allow him to avoid spending time behind bars before trial, but it is possible he will have his mugshot taken today \u2013 the first time this has happened in the four separate criminal cases he is now facing. Donald Trump has arrived at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, where he will be formally arrested after his indictment by the district attorney Fani Willis on charges related to his efforts to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory in the state. The former president is not expected to spend time in jail, having reached an agreement to post a $200,000 bond that will guarantee his release as his case moves through the court system. Here\u2019s the scene outside the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, where Donald Trump will soon arrive: Here\u2019s video of the moment Donald Trump disembarked in Atlanta: Donald Trump disembarked from his plane, flashing a thumbs up to a small group of reporters gathered below the boarding stairs. He made no comments before getting into one of the many black SUVs that make up his motorcade. Here\u2019s a livestream of Donald Trump\u2019s plane, which is currently taxiing at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport: Donald Trump\u2019s plane has landed in Atlanta. Next stop: the Fulton county jail, where the former president will be formally arrested, but is expected to be released after posting a $200,000 bond. Donald Trump has enlisted a local bonding company to secure his release from the Fulton county jail, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. \u201cWe will be posting his bond when he arrives,\u201d Charles Shaw, the CEO of Foster Bail Bonds LLC in Lawrenceville, an Atlanta suburb, told the paper. According to CNN, Trump paid 10% of the $200,000 bond, which was one of the conditions for his release agreed to with the Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis. When Donald Trump arrives at the Fulton county jail, he\u2019ll have company. Besides the Secret Service agents guarding him, CNN reports his newly retained lawyer will be there for his formal arrest: Trump is not expected to spend time in jail, having posted a $200,000 bond as part of an agreement that will allow him to remain free while his case moves towards trial. CNN reports that the rightwing Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene will also be waiting for Trump when he lands in Atlanta: The former president is currently in the air and expected to land at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport shortly. Georgia is far from the only state grappling with the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to stay in the White House despite losing the 2020 election. As the Guardian\u2019s Alice Herman reports, local officials in Michigan are outraged by the fake elector scandal that occurred there: When the news broke in 2020 that 16 Republicans in Michigan had signed a certificate falsely claiming to be electors for Donald Trump, Rosemary Herweyer was dismayed to find a prominent local politician, Kent Vanderwood, listed among the signatories. \u201cHis willingness to sign a fake elector paper and try to send that in and negate Michigan\u2019s actual vote speaks to his integrity,\u201d Herweyer said of Vanderwood, who was then a member of the Wyoming, Michigan, city council. \u201cHow can I trust anything he does?\u201d Vanderwood, who served on the city council for 16 years before being elected mayor of the city in 2022, now faces eight felony charges for his role as a false elector during the 2020 presidential election. Fifteen other Republicans, including the former co-chair of the Michigan GOP, have also been criminally charged. Since Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Dana Nessel, announced the charges on 18 July \u2013 making the state the first to prosecute a full slate of false electors involved in the seven-state scheme \u2013 voters and good government groups have begun a push for elected officials involved to resign. Across the state, a mayor, a school board member and a township clerk whose role includes administering elections have each been arraigned and have pleaded not guilty, and in each community, constituents are pushing for accountability. \u201cOver 2 million people voted for Joe Biden in Michigan, and Stan Grot decided that our votes didn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Alisa Diez, a Democratic party activist in Shelby Township, where Stanley Grot, one of the 16 false electors, currently serves as township clerk. After Grot was charged, the state stripped him of his ability to administer elections, but he remains in office. Donald Trump will appear on Newsmax with host Greg Kelly at 9pm tonight following his surrender at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, Georgia, the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports. Trump\u2019s Newsmax appearance later tonight will follow a post he made on his Truth Social account earlier today as he prepared to make his way from New Jersey to Georgia, which read: I have to start getting ready to head down to Atlanta, Georgia, where Murder and other Violent Crimes have reached levels never seen before, to get ARRESTED by a Radical Left, Lowlife District Attorney, Fani Willis, for A PERFECT PHONE CALL, and having the audacity to challenge a RIGGED &amp; STOLEN ELECTION. THE EVIDENCE IS IRREFUTABLE! ARREST TIME: 7:30 P.M. The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports that a federal judge has set an 18 September hearing for former Donald Trump Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark\u2019s request to remove his case to federal court. Clark has been charged alongside Trump in a 41-count indictment over efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential elections in Georgia. Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie appeared on Morning Joe following Wednesday evening\u2019s debate during which he refused to raise his hand when the presidential candidates were asked whether they would support Donald Trump if he becomes the GOP nominee. Christie spoke about the other candidates who raised their hands, saying: \u201cI can only assume it\u2019s because they\u2019re auditioning for what they\u2019re praying to be a future vice-president nomination or cabinet bid in a Trump administration.\u201d The problem for them is that Donald Trump is never going to be president of the United States again \u2026 When someone says they\u2019re willing to suspend the constitution, that they took an oath to preserve, protect and defend. That\u2019s just wrong \u2026 It\u2019s not a hard answer for them either, but they\u2019re playing a political game. As Donald Trump makes his way to Atlanta, Georgia, his former vice-president and current Republican opponent Mike Pence has urged him to join the other candidates in the next GOP debate. Speaking to the Associated Press in a new interview after Wednesday night\u2019s debate, Pence said: I believe that this country\u2019s in a lot of trouble and every man and woman who aspires to carry the banner of the Republican party owes it to the American people to get on that stage to answer the tough questions and to articulate their vision for the future of the country and let the voters decide. The legal gears continue to grind forward for the other people indicted in Georgia alongside Donald Trump, including Jeff Clark, the former justice department official who has asked to move his trial to federal court. Politico reports that the judge handling his case will hold a hearing on 18 September on the matter: This was the scene as the motorcade of Donald Trump made its way from his resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, to the airport in Newark: Squint through the gloomy Newark, New Jersey weather in this Sky News footage and you can see the flashing lights of what appears to be Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade arriving at the plane that will take him to Georgia: Donald Trump has arrived at the airport in Newark, New Jersey, where he will board his flight to face arrest in Atlanta, CNN reports. In his order to begin Kenneth Chesebro\u2019s trial on 23 October, Judge Scott McAfee noted that the schedule does not apply to anyone else. \u201cAt this time, these deadlines do not apply to any co-defendant,\u201d the judge wrote. That\u2019s good news for the 18 other people indicted by the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, including Donald Trump, whose lawyers are currently trying to get his case moved to federal court, which could delay it for months \u2013 potentially long enough for him to win his race for the White House. Kenneth Chesebro, another of Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys who advised him on his plot to overturn his 2020 election loss, requested a speedy trial after being indicted in Georgia, and it appears his wish has been granted. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that the judge handling his case has said Chesebro\u2019s trial will begin on 23 October \u2013 as Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis had proposed: When Donald Trump appears at the Rice Street jail in Atlanta this evening, the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports that he will be treated like any other defendant. That includes having his mugshot taken, and his height and weight recorded: Donald Trump was expected to surrender at the Fulton county jail on Thursday evening on racketeering and conspiracy charges over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, yielding to the criminal justice process in Georgia that will involve him being processed like any other defendant. The former president\u2019s arrival in Georgia follows a presidential debate featuring his main rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination, a race in which Trump remains the overwhelmingly dominant frontrunner despite his many legal troubles. Trump had his legal team negotiate his booking to take place during the primetime viewing hours for the cable news networks, as he sought to discredit the charges and distract from the indignity of the surrender by turning it into a spectacle. But Trump was expected to be booked by authorities without the special privileges afforded to him in his other criminal cases, being subject to a mugshot that he had desperately sought to avoid, having his fingerprints taken, as well as having his height and weight recorded. Trump faced his fourth indictment since leaving office when he was charged in a 41-count indictment by the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, last week, that described Trump and 18 allies as having engaged in a criminal enterprise to reverse his 2020 election defeat. Donald Trump has left his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort for Georgia, where he is expected to be formally arrested this evening, CNN reports. In a post on his Truth social account, Donald Trump said he expected to be arrested in Georgia at 7.30pm eastern time, and fired off his typical string of insults at Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis. Here it is, in full: 231,000,000 Views, and still counting. The Biggest Video on Social Media, EVER, more than double the Super Bowl! But please excuse me, I have to start getting ready to head down to Atlanta, Georgia, where Murder and other Violent Crimes have reached levels never seen before, to get ARRESTED by a Radical Left, Lowlife District Attorney, Fani Willis, for A PERFECT PHONE CALL, and having the audacity to challenge a RIGGED &amp; STOLEN ELECTION. THE EVIDENCE IS IRREFUTABLE! ARREST TIME: 7:30 P.M. Here\u2019s the mugshot for Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows, which Georgia authorities released following his booking today: John Eastman\u2019s bad week just got worse. A lawyer who advised Donald Trump on his legal strategy to stop Joe Biden\u2019s election victory, Eastman was among those indicted in Georgia by district attorney Fani Willis for his attempt to tamper with the state\u2019s election. On Tuesday, he was formally booked into the Fulton county jail, and Politico reports that today, the California bar is considering whether to revoke his license to practice law: Eastman\u2019s name popped up repeatedly in the January 6 committee investigation last year, which discovered that he asked Trump for a pardon days after the attack on the Capitol. Hello US politics live blog readers, things are very busy at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta and are only going to get busier as more co-defendants in Donald Trump\u2019s Georgia election subversion case negotiate bail then turn themselves in \u2013 and the former US president is due there this evening to surrender himself. We\u2019re covering all this as it happens, so do stick with Guardian US. Here\u2019s where things stand: Mark Meadows, Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff at the White House, turned himself in at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, Georgia to face racketeering charges. Jeff Clark, a former justice department attorney and a codefendant in the Georgia election subversion case, struck a $100,00 bond agreement with Fulton county prosecutors. Fani Willis, Fulton county district attorney, has proposed for the Georgia racketeering (Rico) case against Trump and his 18 co-defendants to start on 23 October 2023, according to a court filing. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, has been subpoenaed to testify at a Monday hearing examining efforts by Meadows to move the Fulton county criminal case to federal court. The Republican-led House judiciary committee launched a congressional investigation into the Willis, over whether her prosecution of Donald Trump is \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. Mark Meadows is trying to get his part of the Georgia organized crime case against him, Donald Trump and others moved from state court to federal court and had hoped to be able to avoid having to surrender at the jail in Atlanta this week with his co-defendants. Two days ago he asked a federal court in an emergency motion to block his arrest, according to court documents filed on Tuesday. He asked the court to \u201cprotect\u201d him from arrest before a Monday 28 August, hearing on his request to move the case out of the Fulton county superior court to the district court of northern Georgia. Meadows is arguing that the charges against him concern his actions as an officer of the federal government. Trump is expected to argue likewise in due course. In response, Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis unequivocally rejected the request, noting: \u201cI am not granting any extensions\u201d and that he was no different from any other defendant in a criminal case. Willis indicated that if Meadows does not turn himself in by noon on Friday, he would be arrested, writing: \u201cAt 12:30 pm on Friday I shall file warrants in the system.\u201d Early Thursday afternoon, he surrendered to the jail to be booked. Mark Meadows has turned himself in at Fulton county jail in Atlanta, just under 24 hours before the deadline of noon Friday for all 19 defendants in the Georgia case to surrender, to face the criminal charges against him Like Donald Trump and all 17 fellow co-defendants, Meadows is charged with being part of an organized crime racket in relation to working with others to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia in the 2020 presidential election. In official terms, he\u2019s charged with violating the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico) and \u201csolicitation of violation of oath by a public officer\u201d, in the latter case being accused in the indictment of \u201cunlawfully soliciting, requesting and importuning Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger \u2026 to engage in conduct constituting the felony offense\u2026by unlawfully altering, unlawfully adjusting and otherwise unlawfully influencing the certified returns for presidential electors for the November 3, 2020, election in Georgia\u2026\u201d This, in short, related to efforts from Trump\u2019s mob to persuade Raffensperger to rustle up enough non-existent Republican votes falsely that it would give the-then president the win in the crucial state. Mark Meadows, Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff at the White House, has just turned himself in at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, Georgia. He faces racketeering charges alongside Trump and 17 other co-defendants. Here are some of the latest images from the newswires taken at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, Georgia, where Donald Trump is expected to surrender this evening on racketeering and conspiracy charges. Trevian Kutti, a former publicist who was charged in the Georgia case in connection with the intimidation of an Atlanta election worker, has agreed to a $75,000 bond. A Chicago-based publicist, Kutti allegedly threatened a Georgia election worker, Ruby Freeman, with jail if she did not say she participated in election fraud. She faces three counts in the indictment: violation of Georgia\u2019s Rico Act, criminal conspiracy and influencing witnesses. Jeff Clark, a former justice department attorney, has struck a $100,00 bond agreement with Fulton county prosecutors. Clark\u2019s bail conditions include not communicating with witnesses and co-defendants, reporting to pretrial services by phone every month, surrendering by noon on Friday and not obstructing justice by intimidating witnesses. From Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney: Ahead of the surrender, Donald Trump shook up his legal team and retained the top Georgia attorney Steven Sadow, who filed a notice of appearance with the Fulton county superior court as lead counsel, replacing Drew Findling. Trump\u2019s other lawyer in the case, Jennifer Little, is staying on. The reason for the abrupt recalibration was unclear, and Trump\u2019s aides suggested it was unrelated to performance. Still, Trump has a record of firing lawyers who represented him during criminal investigations but were unable to stave off charges. Findling was also unable to exempt Trump from having his mugshot taken, according to people familiar with the matter \u2013 something that personally irritated Trump, even though the Fulton county sheriff\u2019s office had always indicated they were uninterested in making such an accommodatioin. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The other 18 co-defendants in the 2020 election subversion case appear to be receiving regular treatment based on online jail records for the former Trump election lawyer John Eastman and others, who had their height, weight and personal appearance made public. Once the booking is complete, Trump was expected to be released immediately on conditions that include stringent witness intimidation restrictions that have not been put in place for his co-defendants, court filings show, until he is due back in state court for arraignment. The Trump legal team could file a motion to remove the case to federal court before then, under a federal statute that allows for such venue changes if the case involves federal officials\u2019 actions taken \u201cunder color\u201d of their office \u2013 as in, if it was part of official duties. Trump could face major difficulties with that argument, however, since he would have to show that taking steps to change the outcome of the 2020 election in Georgia amounted to him acting in his official capacity as president, legal experts have said. Donald Trump was expected to leave this afternoon from his Bedminster club in New Jersey, where he spends his summers, and fly by private plane to Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson airport. He was then expected to travel into Atlanta by US Secret Service motorcade, a person familiar with the matter said. The schedule will involve Trump arriving at the infamously decrepit Rice Street jail, located north-west of downtown Atlanta, in the early evening and the motorcade is expected to snake around into the jail premises down a road lined with dozens of TV cameras. The strategy to turn the surrender into a made-for-television circus has been an effort to discredit the indictments, the person said, as well as to capitalize on the information void left by prosecutors after the events to foist his own spin on the charges. To that end, once Trump is done with the booking process and returns directly to the airport, Trump is weighing delivering impromptu remarks to reporters there before boarding his plane as he liked to do when he was president talking to a pool of reporters, the person said. Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis has proposed for the Georgia election subversion trial against Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants to start on 23 October 2023, according to a court filing. The scheduling request by Willis came a day after one of Trump\u2019s co-defendants, Kenneth Chesebro, filed a demand for a speedy trial in the county superior court. Mark Meadows, former White House chief of staff for Donald Trump, has agreed to a $100,000 bond deal with the Fulton county district attorney\u2019s office, according to court documents. Meadows was charged with two felony counts, including violating the Georgia Rico Act and solicitation of violation of oath from a public officer. Here\u2019s more on Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis\u2019 subpoenas for Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and investigator Francis Watson. A federal judge last week ordered an \u201cevidentiary hearing\u201d on a motion by Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff for Donald Trump, to remove the case to federal court. The hearing is expected to take place at 10am ET on Monday. Meadows, who is a co-defendant alongside Trump in the Georgia election subversion case, has sought to move his charges to federal court and push his Friday deadline to turn himself into Fulton county authorities, aruing the charges concern his actions as an officer of the federal government. On Wednesday, Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis urged a judge to deny Meadows\u2019 \u201cmeritless\u201d request to delay his arrest in the Georgia case. Willis rejected Meadows\u2019 request for an extension on the deadline, according to Meadows\u2019 emergency motion. I am not granting any extensions. I gave 2 weeks for people to surrender themselves to the court. Your client is no different than any other criminal defendant in this jurisdiction. The two weeks was a tremendous courtesy. Meadows was charged with two felony counts, including violating the Georgia Rico Act and solicitation of violation of oath from a public officer, according to Willis\u2019s indictment. Meadows was on the infamous phone call when Trump asked Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the state. He also received hundreds of text messages on 6 January 2021 alerting him and the White House of escalating violence at the US Capitol and asking Trump to intervene. Donald Trump is expected to leave his club in New Jersey later this afternoon with a coterie of aides and turn himself to Fulton county authorities this evening, the Washington Post reported, citing sources. Trump is not expected to deliver a speech, as he has done in the past after some of his previous indictments, the report says. Former Trump DoJ official Jeff Clark\u2019s lawyer has arrived at the Fulton county district attorney\u2019s office, apparently to negotiate bond conditions. A federal judge denied Clark\u2019s motion to stay his surrender before noon tomorrow while he tries to have his case removed to federal court. While former president Donald Trump was preparing to surrender at an Atlanta jail on Thursday, he was apparently also reconsidering his legal defense team. Just hours before Trump is supposed to turn himself in, reports broke that he had shaken up his team. Criminal defense lawyer Steve Sadow is reportedly going to replace Trump\u2019s existing lawyer, Drew Findling, according to the New York Times. Notably, Findling, alongside Jennifer Little and Marissa Goldberg, was key in negotiating Trump\u2019s $200,000 bond. Little will reportedly stay on the team. The Guardian has contacted Sadow for further comment. Law enforcement officers are on high alert at the Fulton county jail, where Donald Trump is expected to turn himself to be processed later today. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, has been subpoenaed to testify at a Monday hearing examining efforts by the former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to move the Fulton county criminal case to federal court, according to court filings. Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis also subpoenaed Frances Watson, the chief investigator for Raffensperger during the 2020 election. From Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s Tamar Hallerman: The Republican-led House judiciary committee launched a congressional investigation into the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, over whether her prosecution of Donald Trump is \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. In a letter to Willis announcing the investigation, House Judiciary chairman Jim Jordan demanded Willis turn over information and communications with the justice department and federal officials by 7 September. The letter states: Ms. Willis\u2019s indictment and prosecution implicate substantial federal interests, and the circumstances surrounding her actions raise serious concerns about whether such actions are politically motivated. It was perhaps remarkable that the conversation between Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson was taking place at all. Just five months ago, Carlson was revealed to have said of Trump in a text message: I hate him passionately. \u201cWe are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,\u201d the then Fox News prime-time anchor said in a message to a colleague in early January 2021 as the former president continued a futile battle to remain in office. \u201cI truly can\u2019t wait.\u201d But the two men set aside their differences to jointly take on their respective enemies \u2013 Fox and the rest of the Republican primary field. Despite the array of charges he faces for trying to rig the 2020 presidential election, Trump continued to maintain the false claim that it was stolen from him by the Democrats. Trump also defended the crowd that gathered to hear him speak on 6 January 2021 immediately before the mass assault on Congress that shocked the US and the world and is now the subject of one of Trump\u2019s indictments. Trump suggested that he told the protesters to behave \u201cpeacefully and patriotically\u201d but \u201ca very small group\u201d went to the Capitol. Donald Trump suggested to Tucker Carlson, in a Twitter interview with the far-right former Fox News host staged to undermine the first Republican primary debate in Milwaukee, that he is concerned \u201cthe left\u201d will try to kill him. In a rambling interview, speckled with discussion of conspiracy theories from whether the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was murdered in his jail cell to the role of federal agencies limiting the amount of water in washing machines, Trump took aim at critics on all sides in his traditional derisory fashion. In the 46-minute interview broadcast on Twitter, Carlson asked Trump if he is concerned \u201cthe left\u201d, after impeaching and then indicting him, would try to kill him. \u201cThey\u2019re savage animals. They are people that are sick, really sick,\u201d Trump responded. You have great people that are Democrats. Most of the people in our country are fantastic. And I\u2019m representing everybody \u2026 But I\u2019ve seen what they do. Carlson, who is engaged in a protracted dispute with his former network after being taken off air, launched the interview five minutes before the Republican debate aired on Fox. If that was an attempt to upstage both Trump\u2019s rivals in the 2024 election and Carlson\u2019s ex-employer, then it would appear to have been successful. The interview had more than 80m views on Twitter within two hours of being posted. Rather than attending the GOP debate, Donald Trump chose to sit down for an interview with the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which was available on X, formerly known as Twitter, minutes before the debate began. Trump cited his standing in the polls to justify skipping the debate, mocking his opponents\u2019 struggles to gain momentum in the race. You see the polls that have come out, and I\u2019m leading by 50 and 60 points and some of them are at one and zero and two. And I\u2019m saying, do I sit there for an hour or two hours or whatever it\u2019s going to be and get harassed by people who shouldn\u2019t even be running for president? \u201cI just felt it would be more appropriate not to do the debate,\u201d he added. During his interview with Carlson, Trump suggested the US could see intensifying political violence and described the day of the January 6 2021 insurrection as one of \u201clove and unity\u201d, according to a Washington Post report. People in that crowd said it was the most beautiful day they ever experienced. There was love and unity. I have never seen such spirit and such passion and such love. And I\u2019ve also never seen, simultaneously and from the same people, such hatred at what they\u2019ve done to our country. At the conclusion of the 46-minute interview, Carlson asked the former president if he believed the country was moving toward civil war. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s open conflict?\u201d he asked. Trump replied: I don\u2019t know. Without the specter of Roe v Wade looming overhead, the eight Republican presidential hopefuls on last night\u2019s debate stage faced a new litmus test on abortion: whether or not they support a nationwide ban on the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The former vice-president Mike Pence, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson and South Carolina senator Tim Scott all pledged to support a federal 15-week ban. The question from the moderator Martha MacCallum had noted that abortion had consistently been a losing issue for Republicans in state ballots since the Dobbs decision. Nevertheless just one candidate, the North Dakota governor, Doug Burgum, decisively rejected the idea that Congress ought to regulate abortion access. Burgum, who signed North Dakota\u2019s six-week abortion ban in April, said the conservative mission to overturn Roe was predicated on the belief that states should be allowed to set their own rules on the procedure. What is going to work in New York will never work in North Dakota and vice versa. For decades, Roe v Wade offered Republican candidates a convenient boogeyman. The supreme court ruling was not just about abortion \u2013 swing state conservatives like Burgum could point to Roe as an example of federal overreach. But Wednesday\u2019s debate signaled a schism in the GOP\u2019s position on abortion. Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and Republican presidential candidates, has performed well on Google search traffic since her appearance on the GOP primary debate stage last night, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver writes. Tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who emerged in the absence of Donald Trump as a surprise focus of the debate, is also likely to rise in the polls as a result of getting more media attention, Silver says. The Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, delivered a sweeping indictment earlier this month that charges Donald Trump, along with more than a dozen co-defendants, with 41 counts including racketeering, conspiracy, solicitation and filing false statements. These are the other defendants charged in the indictment, which alleges a coordinated group effort to pressure Georgia officials into changing the outcome of the 2020 election. Brian Tevis, an attorney representing Rudy Giuliani in Georgia, said he doesn\u2019t know who paid for the private plane that Giuliani flew on to Atlanta on Wednesday. Tevis, a Georgia attorney who represented the former New York Mayor and Trump attorney in bond and surrender negotiations with the Fulton County district attorney\u2019s office, refused to discuss his client\u2019s finances during a CNN interview. He also told Kaitlan Collins it is \u201cvery premature to be saying what is the defense going to be\u201d when asked if Giuliani would be using his status as Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer as a defense in the Georgia election subversion case. Nearly an hour into the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Fox News hosts Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier asked the eight candidates on the stage whether they would still support Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee if he were convicted of the charges he faces. Six candidates \u2013 North Carolina\u2019s Governor Doug Burgum, Florida\u2019s Governor Ron DeSantis, the former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, the former vice-president Mike Pence, the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and South Carolina\u2019s Senator Tim Scott \u2013 indicated they would still support Trump. Only two candidates \u2013 the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson \u2013 said they would not. The debate came one day before Trump was expected to surrender to authorities in Fulton county, Georgia, where he has been charged on 13 felony counts related to his efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s 2020 victory in the state. The former president faces 91 total felony counts across four criminal cases. But a CBS News/YouGov survey compiled last week found that Trump now holds his largest polling lead to date, as he won the support of 62% of likely Republican primary voters. The survey showed Trump beating his next closest competitor, DeSantis, by 46 points, with every other candidate mired in the single digits. With such stalwart support for Trump among the Republican base, it remains unclear how any of the participants in the Monday debate could capture the nomination. The electoral threat of nominating a twice-impeached former president, who now faces nearly 100 criminal charges, did not escape the attention of at least one debate participant. \u201cWe have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\u201d Haley said. \u201cWe can\u2019t win a general election that way.\u201d Supporters of Donald Trump are beginning to gather near the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, where the former president is expected to appear later today to surrender to authorities in connection with his attempts to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Vivek Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old biotech entrepreneur running third in Republican polling, emerged in the absence of Donald Trump as a surprise focus of the first debate of the Republican primary, showing scant respect for other candidates and drawing heavy fire in return. \u201cWe live in a dark moment,\u201d Ramaswamy declaimed, in the distinctly Trumpian and conspiratorial fashion that has become a hallmark of his campaign. Ramaswamy\u2019s bid for the Republican nomination has been hit by recent scandals over remarks that suggested sympathy for conspiracy theories around the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the January 6 assault on the Capitol. But he has sought to portray himself as a Trump-like outsider taking on the establishment with his extreme views. All the other presidential candidates onstage in Milwaukee, Ramaswamy repeatedly said, were \u201cbought and paid for\u201d by donors. After all eight candidates declined to raise their hands when asked if they believed human behavior was causing the climate crisis, Ramaswamy jumped in, stridently rapping out: Unlock American energy, drill, frack, burn coal, embrace nuclear. Amid exchanges on crime, Ramaswamy attacked the former vice-president Mike Pence, seeming even to doubt a Republican saint, Ronald Reagan, when he said: \u201cSome others like you on this stage may have an, \u2018It\u2019s morning in America speech.\u2019 It is not morning in America. We live in a dark moment and we have to confront the fact that we\u2019re in an internal sort of cold cultural civil war and we have to recognise that. Ron DeSantis, second to Trump for months but widely seen to be struggling, stood centre stage. But the rightwing Florida governor was often reduced to an onlooker as Ramaswamy threw rhetorical punches and others hit him back, making him a frequent center of the debate. Read the full report by Martin Pengelly here. In a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, 35% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they think the climate change is a major factor in the extreme heat that the US has experienced recently, compared with 85% of those who lean Democratic. Overall, nearly two-thirds of Americans who experienced extremely hot days said climate change was a major factor. Young Republican voters, however, seem increasingly concerned about the climate crisis. A 2022 Pew poll found that 73% of Republicans aged 18-39 thought climate change was an extremely/very or somewhat serious issue. Meanwhile, the rightwing groups have been working to boost the fossil fuel industry while undermining the energy transition. Project 2025, a $22m endeavor by the climate-denying thinktank the Heritage Foundation, has developed a presidential proposal that lays out how a Republican president could dismantle US climate policy within their first 180 days in office. The GOP candidates who\u2019ve held public office have already given voters a glimpse of how they might approach the climate crisis. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, has supported projects to build sea walls and improve drainage systems as Florida faces increasingly powerful hurricanes and storm surges, as well as threats from sea level rise. But he has refused to acknowledge the role of global heating on these disasters, scoffing at the \u201cpoliticization of the weather\u201d and pushing bills banning Florida cities from adopting 100% clean energy goals. He also barred the state\u2019s pension fund from considering the climate crisis when making investment decisions. Donald Trump, who did not attend the debate, has done even more to impede climate action. As president, he rolled back nearly 100 climate regulations, according a New York Times tally. Among the candidates who do support doing anything about the climate crisis, most think that thing should be carbon capture. Nikki Haley, who as US ambassador to the United Nations helped orchestrated the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement, has presented carbon capture technologies and tree planting as a way to keep burning fossil fuels while slowing the climate crisis. The consensus among climate scientists is that while such technologies could be a tool in fighting global heating, an overreliance on them could cause the world to surpass climate tipping points. Unlike in recent election cycles, most Republican presidential hopefuls this time around didn\u2019t flat out deny that the climate crisis is real. But on the Fox News debate stage, they made clear that they\u2019re not interested in dwelling on the issues \u2013 or doing much about it. On Tuesday night, the eight candidates were asked to raise their hands if they believed in the reality of human-caused global heating. They all punted. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, immediately derailed efforts to elicit a clear yes or no response. \u201cLet\u2019s have this debate,\u201d he said, before proceeding not to have it at all, instead criticising Joe Biden\u2019s response to the fires in Maui. Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur, was notably the only candidate to full-throatedly deny climate science, making the unsubstantiated claim that \u201cmore people are dying due to bad climate change policies than they are due to actual climate change\u201d. There\u2019s no discernible trend of deaths linked to policies encouraging renewable energy. However, extreme heat \u2013 fueled by the climate crisis \u2013 killed about 1,500 people last year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention records. Researchers estimate that the true figure is closer to 10,000 people every year. Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, on the other hand, said \u201cclimate change is real\u201d but then pushed off all responsibility to take care of it on India and China. Both those countries have lower per capita carbon emissions than the US. And as of the latest figures, from 2021, no country had emitted more carbon dioxide since 1850 than the US. The South Carolina senator Tim Scott didn\u2019t offer much in terms of solutions earlier, pointing a finger at the continent of Africa, as well as India and China. Africa accounts for one-fifth of the world\u2019s population and produces about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Association, while disproportionately experiencing the consequences of climate chaos. The US is responsible for about 14% of global emissions. Eight Republicans vying for the party nomination took the debate stage on Wednesday night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, throwing punches over Ukraine, a federal abortion ban and more, hoping to increase their chances at defeating the no-show frontrunner. Absent was Donald Trump, whose pre-taped interview with the rightwing media personality Tucker Carlson simultaneously published on Twitter, now known as X, and sought to siphon away screen time from the debate housed on Fox News, which famously ousted Carlson earlier this year. But Trump\u2019s presence loomed over the debate, even as candidates seemed to somewhat hold back from criticizing the ex-president, as Fox debate moderator Bret Baier put it, \u201cthe elephant not in the room\u201d. Here are eight key takeaways from the night: During the first Republican debate on Wednesday, eight candidates attempted to cast themselves as viable alternatives to Donald Trump while, for the most part, studiously ignoring the shadow of the doggedly popular former president who declined to appear on stage. The Republicans alternatively railed on government excesses \u2013 promising, for example, to slash funding for federal programs \u2013 while debating the merits of a federal abortion ban and calling for an increasingly militarized southern border. The debate was somewhat calmer without belligerent Trump, with the exception of outsider tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who clashed repeatedly with former vice-president Mike Pence, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina. Other than his increasingly aggressive approach to immigration, Ron DeSantis \u2013 meant to be Trump\u2019s most likely challenger \u2013 remained relatively passive. The debate opened with a focus on the economy, as Fox News moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum played a clip of the viral conservative folk hit Rich Men North of Richmond, in which country artist Oliver Anthony describes his economic struggles while lamenting poor people \u201cmilkin\u2019 welfare\u201d. The candidates launched into a brief discussion of the economy \u2013 the first and last point on which they appeared to entirely agree. On the war in Ukraine, the Republicans diverged sharply in their view of the ideal role of US funding for the Ukrainian military. Ramaswamy, who accused supporters of Ukraine of neglecting \u201cpeople in Maui or the south side of Chicago\u201d, drew sharp rebuke from Christie, who said that \u201cif we don\u2019t stand up to this kind of autocratic killing, we will be next\u201d, describing in vivid detail Russia\u2019s bloody occupation of Ukraine. Pence echoed Christie\u2019s position, calling Vladimir Putin a \u201cdictator\u201d. The Republicans also used the discussion of the war in Ukraine to pivot to the topic of immigration, articulating a vision of a militarized southern US border. DeSantis, whose floundering campaign has suffered repeated false steps and who largely hung back during the debate, jumped into the fold on that topic. When moderator MacCallum introduced the thorny question of abortion, which has energized Democratic voters since Roe v Wade was overturned, the candidates raced to claim their anti-abortion bona fides while splitting over the question of a federal ban. Read the full report by Alice Herman here. Donald Trump is expected to surrender at the Fulton county jail on Thursday evening on racketeering and conspiracy charges over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. The surrender itself is expected to be mundane. At the Rice Street jail north-west of downtown Atlanta, where defendants charged in Fulton county are typically taken, the booking process involves a mugshot, fingerprinting and having height and weight recorded. Trump asked his lawyers and the US secret service to get him an exemption from being photographed, according to sources, though it was not clear whether he will get special treatment. The Fulton county sheriff, Patrick Labat, has previously said Trump would be treated no differently. The other 18 co-defendants in the 2020 election subversion case appear to be receiving regular treatment based on online jail records for the former Trump election lawyer John Eastman and others, who had their height, weight and personal appearance made public. Once the booking is complete, Trump is expected to be released immediately on conditions that include stringent witness intimidation restrictions that have not been put in place for his co-defendants, court filings show, until he is due back in state court for arraignment. Some Maga fans are worried that the pro-Donald Trump rally planned for today in Georgia is an FBI setup, according to an NBC report. On both Truth Social and X, formerly known as Twitter, Trump supporters have allegedly voiced concern that undercover law enforcement officials and antifa activists were behind the protest. \u201cWatch out for the FBI and antifa/blm to stir up a riot,\u201d one user wrote. Another said: \u201cBe careful, it could be a setup just like the J6.\u201d The social media posts were highlighted by Advance Democracy, a nonpartisan research organization. A pro-Trump rally organized by the white nationalist conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer has been planned outside the Fulton county jail where Donald Trump is expected to surrender to authorities later today. Trump posted about the protest on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, which has been planned for Thursday 10am Eastern time at the jail. A Florida activist and failed political candidate who once described herself as a \u201cproud Islamophobe\u201d, Loomer received Trump\u2019s endorsement for a Republican House primary in 2020. She has been closely linked to Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist who, with the rapper Ye, controversially dined with Trump last year. Steven Sadow, who has just been added to Donald Trump\u2019s Georgia legal defense team, is an Atlanta-based attorney whose website profile describes him as a \u201cspecial counsel for white collar and high profile defense\u201d. \u201cI have been retained to represent President Trump in the Fulton County, Georgia case,\u201d said Sadow, according to ABC. The President should never have been indicted. He is innocent of all the charges brought against him. We look forward to the case being dismissed or, if necessary, an unbiased, open minded jury finding the President not guilty. Prosecutions intended to advance or serve the ambitions and careers of political opponents of the President have no place in our justice system. Donald Trump has shaken up his legal team just hours ahead of his expected surrender to authorities in Fulton county on charges over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. Drew Findling is expected to depart the team and be replaced by Steven Sadow, a veteran criminal defense lawyer, the New York Times reported. Findling has served as lead attorney for Trump as it relates to the over two-year probe by the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, into efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election results. Another attorney, Jennifer Little, is expected to remain and work with Sadow, ABC reported. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is expected to surrender at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta today on racketeering and conspiracy charges over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. \u201cI\u2019ll be going to Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday to be ARRESTED,\u201d the former US president posted on his Truth Social platform earlier this week. The date was set during negotiations between Trump\u2019s lawyers and the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, at her office on Monday. Trump became a criminal defendant in a fourth case last week when a grand jury handed up a sprawling 41-count indictment that accused Trump and 18 co-defendants of engaging in a criminal enterprise and committing election fraud in trying to reverse his 2020 defeat. He has denied wrongdoing in Georgia and in three other indictments which have produced a total of 91 criminal charges. On Wednesday, Trump shared a screenshot of a tweet promoting a protest outside the Fulton county jail ahead of his expected surrender. The rally, promoted by the far-right activist Laura Loomer, is expected to begin at 10am Eastern time with attendees encouraged to bring their Trump-related flags, hats, shirts, signs and \u201clove\u201d to support the former president. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s shadow loomed large on the first Republican primary debate stage last night in Milwaukee, as eight candidates attempted to cast themselves as viable alternatives to the former president. Despite his absence, they seemed to somewhat hold back from criticizing Trump, as Fox debate moderator Bret Baier put it, \u201cthe elephant not in the room\u201d."

            "title": "Donald Trump to appear in court over attempt to overturn 2020 US election",
            "date": "2023-08-02T18:49:50Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump is due to appear in court on Thursday after federal prosecutors indicted the former US president for attempting to overturn the 2020 election, Democrats welcoming the criminal charges as Republicans rallied behind him. Prosecutors in Washington will outline the four conspiracy and obstruction counts and a judge will set bail conditions in the latest criminal case involving the ex-president, weeks after he was charged with putting government secrets at risk. In Trump\u2019s third appearance in a courtroom as a criminal defendant, the magistrate judge Moxila Upadhyaya will set a schedule for pre-trial motions and discovery. Both sides are likely later to file motions seeking to shape what evidence and legal arguments will be permitted at trial, which could be many months away. The former president stands accused of \u201cobstructing a bedrock function of the US government \u2013 the nation\u2019s process of collecting, counting and certifying the results of the presidential election\u201d. In a possible preview of Trump\u2019s defence, his lawyer John Lauro called the indictment \u201can attack on free speech and political advocacy\u201d, implying Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud were protected under the constitutional right to freedom of expression. Lauro told CNN the indictment was \u201can effort to not only criminalise, but also to censor free speech\u201d. Trump\u2019s lies fueled a deadly riot by supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. The long-awaited charges are the first related to actions taken by an American president in office \u2013 and set up a collision course between the justice system and a potentially volatile election in November next year. Many Republicans \u2013 elected officials and voters \u2013 have unashamedly backed Trump, seeking to portray the charges against him as a politically motivated prosecution and a Democratic plot to derail his re-election bid. That pattern largely held after Tuesday\u2019s indictment, which was brought by the special counsel Jack Smith and filed in federal district court in Washington. Trump set the tone on his Truth Social platform: \u201cThis unprecedented indictment of a former (highly successful!) president and the leading candidate, by far, in both the Republican party and the 2024 general election, has awoken the world to the corruption, scandal, and failure that has taken place in the United States for the past three years.\u201d The House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, called the indictment an attempt \u201cto distract from news\u201d about Republican allegations of corruption involving Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, \u201cand attack the frontrunner\u201d to face Joe Biden next year. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, Trump\u2019s leading rival for the nomination, said he had not read the indictment but vowed to \u201cend the weaponisation of the federal government\u201d. DeSantis did not mention Trump by name but promised to \u201censure a single standard of justice for all Americans\u201d, adding: \u201cOne of the reasons our country is in decline is the politicisation of the rule of law.\u201d The latest charges mean Trump has been impeached twice, arrested twice and indicted three times: over attempted election subversion, hush-money payments to a porn actor, and the alleged mishandling of classified documents. Despite the charges \u2013 and the prospect of more, over alleged election subversion in Georgia \u2013 Trump leads Republican polling by more than 30 points. Nothing prevents criminal defendants from campaigning or taking office if they are convicted. Strategists said that while the indictments could help Trump win the Republican nomination, they could prove less helpful in next year\u2019s election, when he will have to win over moderates and independents. Republican condemnation of Trump was rare. Will Hurd, a former Texas congressman, said Trump\u2019s presidential bid was \u201cdriven by an attempt to stay out of prison and scam his supporters into footing his legal bills\u201d. Hurd added: \u201cFurthermore, his denial of the 2020 election results and actions on 6 January show he\u2019s unfit for office.\u201d If Republicans \u201cmake the upcoming election about Trump, we are giving Joe Biden another four years in the White House\u201d, he said. Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s former vice-president, who refused to bow to pressure not to certify the election results and fled the mob at the Capitol, said the latest indictment was \u201can important reminder anyone who puts himself over the constitution should never be president of the United States\u201d, adding that Trump\u2019s candidacy meant \u201cmore distractions\u201d. The indictment listed several conversations in which Trump attempted to persuade Pence to delay certification or reject presidential electors. In one call, on 1 January 2021, Trump told Pence: \u201cYou\u2019re too honest.\u201d Most Republicans, however, backed the former president. The South Carolina senator Tim Scott claimed that \u201cBiden\u2019s justice department\u201d was \u201chunting Republicans, while protecting Democrats\u201d. Byron Donalds of Florida, a hard-right Trump ally in the US House, said Trump was the victim of \u201cselective use of \u2026 the federal government\u201d while prosecutors \u201cconcoct sweetheart deals for Hunter [Biden], Hillary [Clinton] and the rest of the Democrat darlings\u201d. Democratic reactions reflected the deep divide in US politics. Nancy Pelosi, a former House speaker who oversaw Trump\u2019s impeachments, said the charges outlined \u201ca sinister plot\u201d. The House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, and the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, said the indictment \u201cillustrates in shocking detail \u2026 a months-long criminal plot led by the former president to defy democracy and overturn the will of the American people\u201d. Noah Bookbinder, the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, called the latest charges \u201cthe most significant [Trump] has yet faced because they address the most serious offense he committed: trying to block the peaceful transfer of power and keep himself in office\u201d. The case was assigned to the district judge Tanya Chutkan, a former assistant public defender nominated by Barack Obama. Chutkan has handed down prison sentences in January 6 riot cases harsher than prosecutors recommended. She ruled against Trump in a separate January 6 case, refusing his request to block the release of documents to a House committee investigating the attack. In a memorable line from her ruling, Chutkan wrote: \u201cPresidents are not kings, and plaintiff is not president.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-29T15:00:10Z",
            "content": "Reese Witherspoon may have got her Oscar for Walk the Line but she has never been as iconic as she was in what should be considered the real highlight of her career: Election. Alexander Payne\u2019s spiky and smart 1999 movie is set at an average American high school in a town where the most defining characteristic is its banality. Nothing extraordinary is supposed to happen in Omaha, Nebraska and, in some ways, nothing did. The drama in Election is the race for school president but the real war is between well-liked teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) and high-achieving student Tracy Flick (Witherspoon). Armed with \u201cPick Flick\u201d campaign cupcakes, her Jansport backpack and an unerring belief in her bright, successful future, Tracy\u2019s unopposed pursuit of the presidency is thwarted by Jim when he eggs on Paul (Chris Klein), a sweet but dumb athlete, to run against her in the election. The battle royale is complicated further by the entry of Paul\u2019s sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), whose anarchic \u201cWho cares?\u201d platform promises to dismantle the student government. The election campaign unfolds in hilarious and bizarre beats \u2013 including a wildly funny scene involving a bee sting \u2013 and culminates in a vote-stealing scandal that is both shocking and not shocking at the same time. Election masquerades as a familiar high school comedy, but it is astute and keenly observed. Like Wag the Dog and Primary Colors, it tapped into the now almost-quaint Clintonian era of the 1990s. There was partisanship and sex scandals, but US politics still managed to amuse as well as enrage, when compared with the terrifying hellscape it morphed into. At the heart of the film is Tracy, the kind of earnest try-hard you just want to see taken down a notch, or three. When she surreptitiously discovers she won the election, the sight of her ecstatic, contorted face is forever captured and amplified in freeze frame. It remains an indelible image in cinema: Tracy, in that moment, is every person you\u2019ve ever met that struck you as just a little too ambitious, just a little too sanctimonious and just a little too annoying. Tracy is not blameless \u2013 she rails against \u201csubversive elements\u201d, she lies and stands in judgment of others. Still, it reveals a lot about our own neuroses and complexes that we pour scorn on ambitious souls like her. Why do we find their unabashed aspirations so grating? Why do we roll our eyes at the person \u2013 and it\u2019s always the same person \u2013 who volunteers every year to organise the charity morning teas? Especially if they\u2019re a woman? When you\u2019re laughing at Tracy, Payne\u2019s movie grounds you in Jim\u2019s perspective. You convict her because he convicts her. It\u2019s only later when Jim is revealed to be flawed, manipulative and a love rat that you are forced to ask yourself why you saw Tracy as the antagonist. Rewatching Election now, it\u2019s hard to ignore how those judgments about female ambition have played out in real life. When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, she was compared to Tracy Flick, all grown up. On that note, Witherspoon is set to reprise the role again in an Election sequel directed by Payne, which will follow the adult Tracy Flick as she battles to become the principal of a suburban high school. While you\u2019re laughing at those silly mechanical seatbelts that seem to be in every car in Omaha, or at Klein\u2019s voiceover delivery of rich kid Paul\u2019s existential crisis, Election will confront you with serious ideas about political systems, predatory behaviour and entitlement. Who gets to decide who gets to rule? Why should anyone have more say than anyone else? This biting black comedy is a microcosm of the questions that still plague institutions of power and those subjected to its inequities. It just does it with a plucky attitude.

            "date": "2023-08-12T07:00:11Z",
            "content": "As Rishi Sunak transforms himself into the driver\u2019s champion and rightwingers savage net zero targets as a fascist plot of the wokerati, get ready for the thing you thought impossible: a general election even stupider than the last. Essentially, it\u2019s looking as if it will be a referendum on whether climate change exists. What better time for such a dumb question, than right when we can all see it? It won\u2019t always be expressed so simply. Sometimes it will be: \u201cWho will stand up for the humble driver of diesel cars, already squeezed in so many directions, in ways that I, not even quite a billionaire, can totally understand?\u201d Other times it will be: \u201cWhat can we do about Just Stop Oil protesters, who pose an existential threat to society with their vile and undemocratic tactics?\u201d Probably only at the Faragist fringes will people openly repudiate the goal of net zero, while the Conservative core picks more contestable battles on low-traffic neighbourhoods, oil and gas licences, heat pumps. Policies hold very little interest for Conservatives, still less ideas: they want to set Britain\u2019s the mood music. Tory arguments as they battle for votes will be so stupid as to make you despair, and some mornings you\u2019ll wake up thinking humanity is a blight, and we should concentrate on preserving the planet for every species besides us. But that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t work. The case against environmentalism looks worse than unwinnable; it looks like electoral suicide, with 71% of the British public is in favour of the net zero target. Indeed, being a Conservative is beginning to look rather niche. Labour has pulled ahead of the Tories decisively, consistently leading by 20 points in the polls. Research commissioned by Channel 4 this week projected a landslide victory for Keir Starmer and the Conservatives reduced to 90 seats, with high-profile losses including Sunak himself and 17 cabinet ministers. In an election fought at any time between now and January 2025, on normal terms, one fully costed manifesto versus another, a suite of issues discussed in a sober fashion, there is no plausible route to victory for Sunak. But that\u2019s not how modern Tories work. Rather, they set out their stall in such a way as to destroy the unity of their opponents, torch any faith in evidence, facts and expertise, and spread a sense of hopelessness and frustration. They want voters walking into the ballot box in the spirit of \u201cmake it go away\u201d. If this sounds tough to pull off, from such a weak party, disgraced in so many ways, running on intellectual fumes, consider how much it has already achieved. Only three months ago, Labour\u2019s policy was to block all new oil and gas projects in the North Sea. It wasn\u2019t as radical as its original green new deal pledge \u2013 \u00a328bn a year to tackle the climate crisis \u2013 and it didn\u2019t hold the same promise of change as last year\u2019s conference pledge to set up Great British Energy, publicly owned and green. Nevertheless, it was something a large number of people could unite behind. You can easily imagine a Conservative environmentalist and a leftwing Green both lending their vote to a party that promised to leave fossil fuels in the ground. Then Sunak said he would issue 100 new oil and gas licences. It had nothing to do with bills or energy security or Putin or the cost of living; these projects wouldn\u2019t even be operational for five to seven years at the earliest. From an energy perspective, the policy is nonsensical, since nobody in the oil and gas industries thinks for a second that Sunak will win the next election. From a geological perspective, it is impractical: the North Sea is a mature oil province, which means there are likely to be very few large oilfields left to discover. Any that are left will be small, and few companies will be interested. Indeed, even in the last two rounds of licences, interest was pretty meagre, with only about one-third of the blocks on offer attracting bids; the super-majors are selling up their North Sea assets, and the smaller companies buying them are not interested in long-term, capital-intensive exploration. These licences had only one purpose, which was to back Starmer into a corner where he had to say whether or not he would revoke them \u2013 which sure enough, he wouldn\u2019t, because respecting a contract is more important than the climate. So he marked himself out as a lukewarm technocrat without the passion or urgency that the battle for the planet needs, and then it got worse: criticised, perfectly legitimately, by Just Stop Oil, Starmer called them \u201ccontemptible\u201d for beliefs that are indistinguishable from those of the UN secretary general. It\u2019s pointless hand-wringing about these obvious traps that Starmer obediently walks into, but this is the game we\u2019re in now \u2013 one in which every Tory move, whether it\u2019s camouflaged as policy or delivered in hate speech, is a bid to disrupt the unity of progressive voters. I do not think it will succeed. But I didn\u2019t think it would succeed in 2019, either. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"

            "title": "Biden\u2019s China investment ban: who\u2019s targeted and what does it mean for the 2024 US election?",
            "date": "2023-08-10T01:14:54Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has moved to restrict US investment in Chinese technology, signing an executive order which focuses on a few, sensitive hi-tech sectors including semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). It is the latest in a series of measures taken by the US to restrict China\u2019s access to the most advanced technology and comes as the president has embarked on a multi-state tour of the south-west to tout his plans to revive American manufacturing after decades of decline. The restrictions are expected to take effect next year \u2013 and come at a sensitive time in the US-China relationship. The Biden administration has launched diplomatic overtures to Beijing in recent months, seeking to mend ties after a series of incidents, while still attempting to bolster its position against China on military, economic and technological fronts. What are the latest restrictions? As a result of previous Biden administration measures, the US already bans or restricts the export to China of many of the technologies covered in these new measures. The aim of Wednesday\u2019s executive order is to prevent US funds from helping China build its own domestic capabilities, which could undermine the existing export controls. Under the executive order, the US Treasury has been directed to regulate certain US investments in semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum computing and artificial intelligence. China, Hong Kong and Macau are listed as the \u201ccountries of concern\u201d, but a senior Biden official has told Reuters other countries could be added in the future. The rules are not retroactive and apply to to future investments, with officials saying the goal is to regulate investments in areas that could give China military and intelligence advantages. Britain and the European Union have signalled their intention to move along similar lines, and the Group of Seven advanced economies agreed in June that restrictions on outbound investments should be part of an overall toolkit. Biden\u2019s plan has been criticised by Republicans, many of whom say it does not go far enough. Republican Senator Marco Rubio has called it \u201calmost laughable\u201d, adding that the plan is \u201criddled with loopholes \u2026 and fails to include industries China\u2019s government deems critical\u201d, he said. How has China reacted? A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said the White House had ignored \u201cChina\u2019s repeated expression of deep concerns\u201d about the plan. The embassy warned that it would affect more than 70,000 US companies that do business in China, hurting both Chinese and American businesses. The country\u2019s commerce ministry said it reserved the right to take countermeasures and encouraged the US to respect the laws of market economy and the principle of fair competition. What part do these measures play in Biden\u2019s re-election bid? As the executive order was made public, Biden was speaking in New Mexico, touting his government\u2019s success in boosting manufacturing jobs in the renewable energy sector. \u201cWhere\u2019s it written that America can\u2019t lead the world again in manufacturing? Because we\u2019re going to do just that,\u201d Biden said at the groundbreaking of a new factory manufacturing wind turbine towers in the city of Belon. \u201cInstead of exporting American jobs, we\u2019re creating American jobs and we\u2019re exporting American products,\u201d he added. However, polling shows that for many, the perception of the president\u2019s economic policies \u2013 \u201cBidenomics\u201d as his communications team likes to call them \u2013 are at odds with a range of positive indicators. US inflation has dropped to the lowest levels since 2021 and the administration has repeatedly touted months of consistent jobs growth; despite this though multiple polls show that only a minority of Americans support Biden\u2019s handling of the economy. The cornerstone of Biden\u2019s refreshed bid to voters are two major bills he shepherded through Congress and signed into law a year ago: the Chips and Science Act \u2013 which pumps huge funding into semiconductor manufacturing, research and development \u2013 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a law for megaprojects boosting green investment. The chips act aims to further freeze China\u2019s semiconductor industry in place, while pouring billions of dollars in subsidies into the US chip industry. Both laws, along with the growing restrictions on Chinese industry, are positioned to win back portions of the working-class vote who felt left behind by globalisation and turned to Donald Trump at previous elections. What\u2019s next? The ban is a step in a broad and ongoing push to undermine China\u2019s efforts to achieve independence in a number of technological areas, in particular the development of advanced semiconductors. In recent months, the US government has signalled it still wants to close some loopholes Chinese businesses are using to get their hands on the most advanced semiconductors. In response to previous chip bans, Nvidia one of the world\u2019s leading chip companies, has started offering a less advanced chip, the A800, to Chinese buyers. But new curbs being considered by Washington would restrict even those products. In possible anticipation of such a move China\u2019s tech giants \u2013 including Baidu, TikTok-owner ByteDance, Tencent and Alibaba \u2013 have made orders worth $1bn to acquire about 100,000 A800 processors from the Nvidia to be delivered this year, the Financial Times has reported. The Chinese groups had also bought a further $4bn worth of graphics processing units to be delivered in 2024, according to the report. Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"

            "date": "2023-08-21T12:11:24Z",
            "content": "Central America\u2019s democratic downswing has received a powerful correction after the centrist anti-corruption crusader Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo was elected president of Guatemala \u2013 a result almost inconceivable just a few weeks ago. Alongside El Salvador and Nicaragua, Guatemala was one of several Central American countries to have suffered a troubling authoritarian slide in recent years with judges and prosecutors forced into exile and a leading journalist thrown in jail. The election of Ar\u00e9valo \u2013 the son of Guatemala\u2019s first democratically elected president, Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo \u2013 represents a potent repudiation of such democratic erosion and deeply entrenched political corruption in Central America\u2019s most populous nation. Addressing a press conference after his win, Ar\u00e9valo celebrated the courage of voters who turned out to \u201cdefend democracy\u201d and hand him a landslide victory over the former first lady Sandra Torres. With 100% of votes counted, Ar\u00e9valo had 58.01% of votes to Torres\u2019s 37.24%. \u201cThank you people of Guatemala. This triumph isn\u2019t ours. It belongs to you, who supported us throughout the electoral campaign,\u201d said the president-elect, a former diplomat and sociologist who leads a recently founded party called Movimiento Semilla (Seed Movement). \u201cThis victory belongs to the people and now, together, as a people, we will fight against corruption.\u201d Jubilant Semilla supporters gathered outside the Las Am\u00e9ricas hotel in the capital, Guatemala City, where Ar\u00e9valo was due to speak, blaring horns, waving national flags and cheering. \u201cWe have waited for this moment for many years,\u201d said Carlos de Le\u00f3n Samayoa, 27, as he celebrated. \u201cI feel pretty emotional.\u201d Until a few months ago, the idea of an Ar\u00e9valo presidency seemed far-fetched. The 64-year-old intellectual, who was born in Uruguay after his father was forced into exile by 1954\u2019s CIA-backed coup, narrowly snatched a spot in Sunday\u2019s runoff after claiming second place in June\u2019s first round with 12% of the vote. \u201cNo one saw it coming \u2013 not even the leaders of Semilla,\u201d the Latin America specialist Will Freeman wrote last month in a profile of the presidential hopeful in the Americas Quarterly magazine. Weeks later, in July, the election was thrown into confusion after Guatemala\u2019s top prosecutor unsuccessfully attempted to suspend Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s party in what was widely seen as a politically motivated attempt to scupper his campaign. However, that move boomeranged, propelling Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s name further into the headlines and prompting an outpouring of support from across the political spectrum. On Sunday, Guatemala\u2019s outgoing president, Alejandro Giammattei, offered his congratulations on Twitter, now known as X, and said he had invited Ar\u00e9valo to the presidential palace to organise \u201cthe most orderly and complete transition the country has ever seen\u201d. The new president will take over on 14 January. Guatemala\u2019s democratic advance stands in start contrast to the bleak situation in El Salvador and Nicaragua. In the former, the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, has thrown about 1% of his country\u2019s population behind bars as part of a highly controversial \u201cwar on gangs\u201d and looks set to secure a second five-year term next year despite that being outlawed by the constitution. In the latter, the former Sandinista hero Daniel Ortega has ruled continuously since being elected in 2006, and, at 77, shows no sign of stepping down. Ortega recently deported more than 200 political prisoners to the US and stripped them of their citizenship. \u201cWe think it is a disaster,\u201d Guatemala\u2019s new leader said of the situation in Nicaragua while campaigning before Sunday\u2019s vote. \u201cOur foreign policy will be to promote democracy, always, both abroad and at home,\u201d he added. Beyond his anti-corruption policies, Ar\u00e9valo has said he wants to expand relations with China alongside Guatemala\u2019s longstanding allegiance with Taiwan. How he plans to do that remains to be seen, given China\u2019s policy that no country it has ties with can maintain separate diplomatic relations with Taipei. Ana Mar\u00eda M\u00e9ndez Dard\u00f3n, the director for Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America thinktank, said Ar\u00e9valo would face major challenges and inherit a \u201cvery complicated\u201d country. \u201cI see it more as a transition government, to restore the democratic values that have been broken in Guatemala,\u201d she told Reuters."

            "content": "The Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio has been shot dead as he left a campaign event in Quito, days before an election where the central issue is rising violence and crime. Videos on social media show Villavicencio, a former journalist who had collaborated with the Guardian and was outspoken about alleged links between organised crime and politics, surrounded by supporters and being escorted by security guards to a waiting vehicle when gunshots ring out as people start to scream and take cover. In a televised address made after midnight, the country\u2019s president, Guillermo Lasso, said the elections would continue as planned, though under a two-month state of emergency in which soldiers would guard polling stations. Flanked by cabinet members and electoral authorities, he said: \u201cWe agree in the face of the loss of a patriot and a fighter, elections should not be suspended; on the contrary, they should be held and democracy should be strengthened.\u201d He announced three days of national mourning. \u201cI want to say to those who want to threaten the state, we will not hand over the power and the democratic institutions to organised crime even though it is disguised as political organisations,\u201d he added. A suspect in the killing died from injuries sustained during the shootout that ensued, the attorney general\u2019s office said, with six arrests made in connection with the attack. Speaking at the scene of the shooting, Villavicencio\u2019s uncle, Galo Valencia, blamed the state for not giving his nephew enough security and described how he thought the gunshots were fireworks launched by supporters until \u201cwe saw that there were wounded falling, blood, injured people\u201d. \u201cWhat we witnessed was like a horror film. The death of my relative. I have no words for what\u2019s happening in the country. They just killed democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat insecurity we live in \u2026 if a man who fought more than 20 years, the most likely to win the elections, is silenced. Is this the way to win elections?\u201d The assassination comes amid a shocking surge in violent crime in the small South American country, as rival drug-trafficking gangs perpetrate prison massacres and murder rates have more than doubled between 2020 and 2022. Lasso said after Wednesday\u2019s killing: \u201cOrganised crime has gone too far but they will feel the full weight of the law.\u201d Villavicencio was one of eight presidential candidates running in early elections due to be held on 20 August. More than half of Ecuadorians said in a poll that fixing the country\u2019s insecurity problem was their biggest priority. A witness to the attack, who did not wish to be identified, said he initially thought the gunshots were fireworks. \u201cWe never imagined the tragedy that we are now living in the country. This is terrorism. \u201cIf this can happen to a candidate who supposedly had security and contacts then anyone can be killed. It leaves a clear message that here life is worth nothing.\u201d Villavicencio\u2019s fellow candidates expressed remorse. Otto Sonnenholzner, tweeted: \u201cOur deepest condolences and deep solidarity with the loved ones of Fernando Villavicencio. May God keep him in his glory. Our country has gotten out of hand.\u201d His fellow presidential hopeful Jan Topic said: \u201cToday more than ever, the need to act with a strong hand against crime is reiterated. May God have him in his glory.\u201d Days before his murder, Villavicencio, who was 59, had said on national television that he had received several death threats that he alleged came from the jailed leader of the Choneros gang, Alias Fito, ordering him to stop mentioning his name. Villavicencio, from the Andean province of Chimborazo, was the candidate for the Build Ecuador Movement. He was a former union member at the state oil company Petroecuador and later a journalist who denounced alleged millions in oil contract losses. He was one of the most critical voices against corruption, especially during the 2007-17 government of the former president Rafael Correa, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison for defamation over statements made against the former president. \u201cEcuador has become a failed state,\u201d tweeted Correa after the killing. \u201cThose who seek to sow even more hatred with this new tragedy, I hope they understand that it only continues to destroy us.\u201d In 2014, Villavicencio fled to Indigenous territory within Ecuador and later, in 2017, was given asylum in Peru. He spent time in the Indigenous Kichwa community of Sarayaku in Ecuador\u2019s Amazon. At the news of his killing, the community\u2019s leader, Patricia Gualinga, said: \u201cI am crying and very distressed because he was a personal friend.\u201d \u201cSarayaku gave him asylum,\u201d Gualinga, an Indigenous activist who was at the Amazon summit in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, told the Guardian. \u201cFernando said if we handed [him] over [he] would not survive,\u201d she said, describing him as \u201cfamiliar and kind figure\u201d who gave talks at local schools. As a legislator, Villavicencio was criticised by opposition politicians for obstructing an impeachment process this year against Lasso, which led the latter to call the early elections."

            "content": "Donald Trump should drop out of the 2024 race for the White House because polling shows the former US president trailing Joe Biden as he grapples with more than 90 pending criminal charges, according to the Republican US senator Bill Cassidy. Cassidy\u2019s comments to the State of the Union host, Kasie Hunt, on Sunday were not the first time he has denounced Trump. About two months earlier, he went on CNN and predicted that Trump would lose if his party nominated him to run for the Oval Office again, citing the poor performance of his endorsed candidates during the 2022 midterms. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s up to him \u2026 but he will lose to Joe Biden, if you look at the current polls,\u201d Cassidy said of his fellow Republican and the ex-president on State of the Union. The Louisiana senator added that it would do their party no good if Trump \u201cends up getting the nomination but cannot win a general [election]\u201d against the Democratic incumbent Joe Biden. Alluding to a Republican presidential candidates\u2019 debate scheduled Wednesday in Milwaukee that Trump intends to skip, Cassidy said: \u201cI want one of them to win.\u201d But he passed on an opportunity to single out any of the expected debate participants as someone he supported and assured he would vote for \u201ca Republican\u201d if Trump stayed in the race. A poll by CBS News on Sunday showed Trump at the moment enjoys 62% support among Republicans, with many of them trusting him more than they do their friends, family and religious leaders. But polling for now shows Biden generally is ahead of Trump, whose next closest rival for the Republican nomination \u2013 Florida governor Ron DeSantis \u2013 is culling just 16% support among his party\u2019s voters. Trump has established his domination so far in the Republican presidential primary despite facing 91 criminal charges across four separate indictments filed against him for his alleged 2020 election subversion, illicit retention of classified documents and hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. On Sunday\u2019s edition of State of the Union, Cassidy said to him it seemed like the classified documents case was \u201calmost a slam dunk\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not an attorney,\u201d said Cassidy, who is a gastroenterologist. But, while referring to an audio recording of Trump discussing military secrets that he had not declassified at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club in 2021, Cassidy remarked: \u201cThe mishandling of the federal documents \u2026 seems \u2026 a very strong case. \u201cThey have a tape recording of him speaking of it. If that is proven, then we may have a candidate for president who has been convicted of a crime. I think Joe Biden needs to be replaced, but I don\u2019t think Americans will vote for someone who\u2019s been convicted. So, I\u2019m just very sorry about how all this is playing out.\u201d Cassidy joined six other Senate Republicans who voted to convict the former president when Trump was impeached after his supporters staged the US Capitol attack on 6 January 2021. Trump had more than enough votes to be acquitted at his impeachment trial despite the lack of support from Cassidy, whom the former president has previously dismissed as a \u201cRino\u201d, the acronym meaning \u201cRepublican in name only\u201d. Cassidy is in his second six-year term in the Senate and is not up for re-election until 2026."

            "date": "2023-08-19T10:23:26Z",
            "content": "As Ecuadorians go to the polls on Sunday they must not only decide between eight presidential candidates but also vote on an unprecedented referendum question that could set a new course for the oil-reliant nation. The poll will decide whether to halt drilling at the Yasun\u00ed Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) oilfield, also known as oil block 43, which lies in an Amazon national park and one of the world\u2019s richest pockets of biodiversity. Ecuador\u2019s largest protected area is also home to the Waorani people and the country\u2019s last Indigenous communities in voluntary isolation, the Tagaeri and Taromenane. When casting their ballots in a snap election that has been marked by the brutal assassination of a presidential candidate, a second referendum question will ask voters just in Quito whether to allow mining in the Choc\u00f3 Andino, a vast area of land near the capital. Ecuador is cash-strapped amid declining revenue from tax collection and the oil industry. The country earned $991m (\u00a3778m) from oil between January and July this year, less than half the $2.3bn it received during the same period last year, according to finance ministry data. Last week, the rating agency Fitch downgraded Ecuador\u2019s credit score to CCC+, seven points below investment grade. While it cited the country\u2019s political and security risk, it also estimated a $600m fall in fiscal revenues and a 12% drop in oil output if the yes vote succeeded. It is not the first time Yasun\u00ed ITT has become a touchstone for the struggle between big oil and protecting the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. In 2007, the then newly elected president, Rafael Correa, famously offered the world the chance to keep about 850m barrels in the ground at the oilfield. By creating a fund for half of the oil\u2019s estimated value, $3.6bn, countries would compensate Ecuador for not touching the reserves. Whether it was a gamble or a publicity stunt, the bid failed to get the money. In 2013, Correa ended the initiative and gave the go-ahead to oil drilling on the 2,000-hectare (4,942-acre) patch of rainforest, reaching peak production of 57,000 barrels of oil a day. It was also the beginning of the activist movement Yasunidos, which gathered more than 750,000 signatures to hold a referendum to achieve what Correa had failed to do. Ten years on and after lengthy legal battles, Ecuador\u2019s highest court ruled the vote could take place. The Indigenous Waorani leader and activist Nemonte Nenquimo said Sunday\u2019s vote offered Ecuadorians a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201d. \u201cThe decision is now ours: we can change the course of history by saying yes to [blocking] Yasun\u00ed, we can all be defenders of Mother Earth and protect our future\u201d, she told the Guardian. \u201cOil extraction isn\u2019t development. We only need to look at the facts to see the truth: oil causes poverty, contamination and death.\u201d Alberto Acosta-Burneo, an economist and editor of the Weekly Analysis bulletin, said Ecuador would be \u201cshooting itself in the foot\u201d if it shut down the fourth oil block in Yasun\u00ed ITT. \u201cSupposedly we do the environment good by ceasing to produce oil but we don\u2019t reduce consumption of fossil fuels; as a result, another country will raise its oil output to sell us more fuel,\u201d he said in a video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. Polls indicate that Ecuadorians may be listening to activists\u2019 and Indigenous people\u2019s calls to cease the country\u2019s half-century of reliance on oil. \u201cEcuador has an obligation to make an energy transition which is economically viable,\u201d Patricia Gualinga, an Indigenous leader of the Kichwa community of Sarayaku, said. \u201cThe oil won\u2019t last more than 15 years. It\u2019s a non-renewable resource.\u201d Gualinga fought and won a case in the inter-American court of human rights in 2012 to block government-authorised oil exploration by an Argentinian company on her people\u2019s land. She said Ecuador\u2019s dependence on oil had not brought \u201cany benefit, only death and destruction\u201d for its Indigenous people, half of whom still live in poverty while oil spills in the Amazon are commonplace. The country\u2019s rainforest has been the scene of an \u201cAmazon Chernobyl\u201d, a series of huge oil spills that sparked a legal battle which has been going on for three decades between activists and the oil company Chevron. \u201cIf we win, it will be a triumph for Ecuador,\u201d said Hueiya Cahuiya, 46, the founder of the Waorani Women\u2019s Association of the Ecuadorian Amazon who has fought oil drilling in the park since, as a teenager, oil contractors destroyed a sacred burial ground where her grandfather\u2019s remains lay. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more contamination in our rivers, any more extraction on our land,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want a different future.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-13T07:00:40Z",
            "content": "Millions of Ecuadorians will have seen the phone camera footage showing the last seconds before presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was killed, shot through the windows of a white pickup truck after being escorted by unarmed policemen who were helpless to save him. The images that followed showed panic and chaos as the burst of gunfire sent screaming supporters to the ground. Another clip filmed inside the campaign meeting, which Villavicencio had just left, showed panicked followers fleeing or ducking for cover and bloodstains on the tiled floor. Ecuador, a South American nation of 18 million people, has lived through mass protests, autocratic governments and economic meltdowns. But the horror of the latest trauma etched on to the public consciousness, the country\u2019s first political assassination, seems to be a defining sign of the times. The Ecuadorian government has said that six suspects arrested after the killing were all foreign members of organised crime groups. For S\u00edmon Pachano, a political scientist at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences in Quito, the escalation is a \u201cproduct of the penetration of organised crime into politics \u2013 specifically the drug cartels.\u201d Ecuadorians are fearful. Just a few years ago, their country was a haven. Now it has joined the ranks of the most violent nations in Latin America, with its homicide rate increasing fivefold since 2016 to become one of the highest in the region. The plunge into violent insecurity has prompted comparisons with neighbouring Colombia in the 1980s and the latest tragedy with the assassination of New Liberalism party candidate Luis Carlos Gal\u00e1n in 1989. A series of prison massacres carried out by rival drug-trafficking gangs signalled violence was spiralling out of control. As bomb attacks and brutal killings in public places followed, security experts said Ecuador was under attack from urban terrorism. While all eight candidates in next Sunday\u2019s presidential election had promised to address the surge in violent crime, Villavicencio, a former journalist who had collaborated with the Guardian, had repeatedly reiterated his intention to confront mafias such as drug traffickers, including in the weeks before his death. \u201cTo remain silent and hide at a time when criminals are murdering citizens and authorities is an act of cowardice and complicity,\u201d he said. Friends and supporters gathered on Friday at a convention centre in the north of Quito to say farewell to the outspoken whistleblower-turned-politician who had revealed the links between organised crime and politics. \u201cHe was the only one to face the bullets by speaking the truth,\u201d said supporter Fabiola Cisneros. \u201cI want the world to know that Fernando Villavicencio, the bravest man in Ecuador of the last 15 years, was murdered for denouncing and fighting against drug trafficking,\u201d said Martha Rold\u00f3s, daughter of former president Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera who died along with her mother in a plane crash in 1981. \u201cI believe he left a challenge to all Ecuadorians; we cannot vote for those who authorise narco-politics and mafias,\u201d she added. Christian Zurita, a close friend and fellow journalist, vowed to investigate who was behind his murder. \u201cWhat we need is for the prosecutor\u2019s office to do its job ... and to encourage the police to do theirs because they know [who did this],\u201d he said. Villavicencio was fearless to the point of recklessness, refusing to wear a bullet-proof vest on the campaign trail. In the weeks before his murder, he reported on national television receiving multiple threats from Jose Adolfo Mac\u00edas, alias \u201cFito\u201d, the jailed leader of the Choneros gang, the local armed wing of the Mexican Sinaloa cartel. \u201cHere I am, standing up to them. I am not afraid of them. I have spent 20 years in this country fighting against these criminal structures, and I reiterate: I am not afraid of them,\u201d Villavicencio said. Security experts have questioned why the candidate was so exposed in his final moments; the lack of a security cordon, the fact the police were unarmed, and that Villavicencio was not being transported in a bullet-proof vehicle have prompted accusations of negligence or, worse, alleged complicity in his death. \u201cIt has raised suspicions about the penetration of the police by narco-trafficking,\u201d said Pachano, alleging that the judiciary was also corrupted. \u201cJudges are threatened and liberate the suspects,\u201d he added, suggesting that many faced the \u201cplata o plomo\u201d conundrum \u2013 the money or the lead. In early 2021, the US ambassador to Ecuador, Michael Fitzpatrick, made a pointed remark about \u201cnarco-generals\u201d referring to high-ranking members of the Ecuadorian security forces with alleged links to drug trafficking. Days later, Ecuador\u2019s president, Guillermo Lasso, said he thought the ambassador could not have been referring to generals in active service. But a year later at a presentation made by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Fitzpatrick doubled down on that remark in an excoriating critique of corruption in Ecuador\u2019s judiciary, accusing it of ceasing to do its job and providing a \u201ccamouflage to protect narcos, thugs or their paid frontmen to clean their reputation, their money, their public image\u201d. Last year, Fitzpatrick\u2019s government withdrew a US visa from Ronny Aleaga, a former lawmaker for the Union for Hope party, after photos \u2013 revealed by Villavicencio \u2013 showed him sharing a swimming pool in Miami with two men wanted on corruption charges in Ecuador. Villavicencio made his name as a crusading anti-corruption journalist during the 10-year leftist government of Rafael Correa (2007-2017). His whistleblowing had made him many enemies, not just in drug gangs but also in politics and the public sector, particularly the state oil industry. At the same time, the cocaine trade is booming, according to the UNODC, with Europe providing much of the demand as fentanyl consumption takes hold in the US. In June authorities in Amsterdam seized 3.5 tonnes of cocaine in a shipment of bananas from Ecuador. The consequences for Ecuador are that it is on the brink of becoming a narco-state. The security forces are unable to deal with the presence of Mexican and Colombian cartels and Balkan drug gangs exploiting Ecuador\u2019s porous coastline and its large fishing fleets and shipping industry as a transit point for cocaine produced by its neighbours, Peru and Colombia. All the while, Ecuador\u2019s fractious political scene has been paralysed by infighting. Next week\u2019s election was called by President Lasso in May to see off a looming impeachment bid by a hostile congress. Whoever takes office in the coming months will face \u201cserious problems, like the current one\u201d says Pachano, and a security plan will require outside help from the US and Europe, the destinations for most of the cocaine that leaves Ecuador."

            "date": "2023-08-09T15:18:41Z",
            "content": "A previously unseen internal memo from the 2020 Trump campaign describes in detail the plot by Donald Trump and his lawyers to subvert election results in six states, according to a copy obtained by The New York Times. The memo describes a three-pronged plan to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden\u2019s victory on 6 January 2021, that involved coordinating with Republican electors and campaign attorneys in six states, as well as Mike Pence. It also emphasized the importance of the participation by \u201call six states\u201d and \u201cmessaging about this being a routine measure\u201d as well as \u201clogistics\u201d regarding what is now known as the fake electors scheme. The letter was written by Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney associated with Trump who is believed to be one of six unnamed co-conspirators in the indictment against Trump over his attempt to subvert the results of the 2020 election. Much of Chesebro\u2019s actions have been revealed through previous memos and through the January 6 investigation last year, but this memo brings further details to light about the fake electors scheme that he concocted. It was addressed to a Wisconsin lawyer, James R Troupis, the lead attorney for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin, who oversaw the fake electors scheme in his state. Troupis filed a lawsuit in December 2020 asking the Wisconsin supreme court to throw out hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots, saying they violated voting requirements. The court ultimately rejected the lawsuit. Chesebro wrote to Troupis that \u201cit seems feasible\u201d the Trump campaign could subvert Biden\u2019s victory. His plan would \u201cforce the Members of Congress, the media, and the American people to focus on the substantive evidence of illegal election and counting activities in the six contested States, provided three things happen\u201d. He then lays out those three steps, describing a plan in detail. According to Chesebro\u2019s plan, Republican electors in all six states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 would meet and cast votes for Trump on 14 December 2020, the deadline for electors to send their votes to Congress for certification in January. Attorneys in each of the six states would simultaneously file lawsuits that would lead to either a Trump victory or a Biden loss \u2013 which would be pending on 6 January, the certification date. Finally, on the day Congress meets to certify the electors\u2019 votes, \u201cPence, presiding over the joint session, takes the position that it is his constitutional power and duty, alone, as president of the Senate, to both open and count the votes, and that anything in the Electoral Count Act to the contrary is unconstitutional,\u201d according to language from the memo. Pence, who is running against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, has lashed out against his former ticket-mate and his \u201cgaggle of crackpot lawyers\u201d for plotting to overturn the election. According to the indictment, Trump repeatedly \u201cpressured\u201d Pence to participate in the plan, to which the vice-president replied: \u201cYou know I don\u2019t think I have the authority to change the outcome\u201d. The indictment identified six co-conspirators, including one who is widely believed to be Chesebro. Co-Conspirator 5, thought to be Chesebro, \u201cassisted in devising and attempting to implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding\u201d. The indictment also described the previously unseen 6 December 2020 memo as a \u201csharp departure\u201d from an earlier and previously reported memo that Chesebro sent to Troupis outlining a plan to use \u201calternate\u201d electors to send votes for Trump to Congress for certification amid a recount \u2013 even though Biden won the state. \u201cI recognize that what I suggest is a bold, controversial strategy, and that there are many reasons why it might not end up being executed on January 6,\u201d Chesebro wrote in the 6 December 2020 memo. \u201cBut as long as it is one possible option, to preserve it as a possibility it is important that the Trump-Pence electors cast their electoral votes on December 14.\u201d Trump pleaded not guilty on all counts in the 6 January case, which charged him with three counts of conspiracy and one count of obstruction of an official proceeding \u2013 certifying the electoral vote. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 August 2023. The certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory took place on 6 January 2021, not 2020 as an earlier version said."

            "title": "What is Trump charged with in Georgia and what is the case about?",
            "date": "2023-08-31T17:17:32Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has been criminally charged by the Fulton county district attorney for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. Prosecutors brought numerous counts against Trump and his associates, including forgery and racketeering, and soliciting a public official to violate their oath of office, among other charges. Prosecutors charged 18 other people, including Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff, and the lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman. The charges mark the second time Trump has been indicted in connection to his push to overturn the will of American voters after losing to Joe Biden in 2020. Unlike the federal charges filed by Jack Smith, the special counsel for the justice department, the Fulton county case will proceed in state court. That means that Trump would have less capacity to interfere with the case if he is elected president next year, and he could not pardon himself. Trump is essentially accused of leading an organized crime racket in Georgia via the varied efforts of a web of people collectively to achieve the overturning of his election loss there. In the indictment by the state of Georgia, the state wrote: \u201cTrump and the other defendants charged in this indictment refused to accept that Trump lost, and they knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump. That conspiracy contained a common plan and purpose to commit two or more acts of racketeering activity.\u201d The group, the state charges, \u201cconstituted a criminal organization whose members and associates engaged in various related criminal activities including, but not limited to, false statements and writings, impersonating a public of\ufb01cer, forgery, \ufb01ling false documents, in\ufb02uencing witnesses, computer theft, computer trespass, computer invasion of privacy, conspiracy to defraud the state, acts involving theft, and perjury\u201d. Trump waived his right to appear in court for a formal arraignment on the charges, pleading not guilty on 31 August. What is this case about? Donald Trump lost Georgia to Joe Biden in the November 2020 presidential election. After the election, Trump and his allies made an aggressive but unsuccessful push to invalidate the election results in Georgia as part of an effort to overturn his defeat nationally. On 2 January 2021, Trump called Brad Raffensperger, the Republican who serves as Georgia\u2019s top election official, and asked him to overturn the election. \u201cAll I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,\u201d Trump said to Raffensperger on the call. Raffensperger refused. The call came as Trump and his allies, including Rudy Giuliani, were spreading outlandish lies about the election in Georgia in order to seed doubt about the results. Most notably, Giuliani and others amplified misleading surveillance video from State Farm Arena they claimed showed election workers taking ballots out from under a table and counting them after observers left for the evening. The claim was false \u2013 counting had not stopped for the evening when the ballots were tallied. Just as he did in other swing states, Trump convened a slate of fake electors in Georgia. The group of 16 people met discreetly in the Georgia capitol in December 2020 and signed a certificate affirming Trump\u2019s purported victory that was sent to the National Archives. Some involved in the scheme have said they merely believed they were preserving Trump\u2019s options amid pending litigation. The alternate slate of electors, both in Georgia and elsewhere, would later become a linchpin of Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election. One of those fake electors, Cathy Latham, also was involved in a separate incident in which Trump allies obtained unauthorized access to Dominion voting equipment. On 7 January 2021, Latham helped a firm hired by the Trump campaign get access to voting equipment in Coffee county, a rural county 200 miles south-east of Atlanta. The data was uploaded to a password-protected site, where other election deniers could download it as they sought to prove the baseless allegation that Dominion voting machines had been rigged and cost Trump the election. Why is this case taking place in Fulton county? Nearly all of the key events connected to Trump\u2019s effort to overturn Georgia\u2019s election results took place in Atlanta, the state capital, which is in Fulton county. Raffensperger was in Atlanta when he received the phone call from Trump urging him to overturn the election results. Trump and Giuliani targeted election workers in Atlanta and the fake electors convened at the state capitol in the city in December 2020. What is the Georgia Rico Act? Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act essentially allows prosecutors to link together different crimes committed by different people and bring criminal charges against a larger criminal enterprise. The law requires prosecutors to show the existence of a criminal enterprise that has committed at least two underlying crimes. Prosecutors have long used the federal Rico Act to go after the mafia. But Georgia\u2019s version is even more expansive than the federal statute. It allows prosecutors in the state to bring racketeering charges if a defendant attempts or solicits a crime, even if they don\u2019t bring charges for those crimes themselves. How is this case different from other criminal cases pending against Trump? This is the second case that has sought any kind of criminal accountability for Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election. It is the fourth time the former president has been charged with a crime this year. Earlier in August, Smith filed four federal charges against Trump for trying to overturn the election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to those charges, and Smith has moved to set a trial date for 2 January. If Trump were elected president while the case was still pending, he would almost certainly move to fire Smith and get rid of the charges. He could also theoretically pardon himself if he has been convicted. The Georgia case is different because Trump cannot interfere in it, even if he is president, and cannot issue a pardon. In June, Smith charged Trump with illegally retaining national defense information under the Espionage Act and obstructing the government\u2019s attempt to retrieve the documents. Trump pleaded not guilty. In March, Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in Manhattan. Those charges are connected to a $130,000 payment he made to Stormy Daniels, a porn star, with whom he is alleged to have had an extramarital affair. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s attorney at the time, paid the money to Daniels through a shell company and Trump reimbursed him, cataloguing it as a legal expense. Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, said that amounted to falsifying business records. Trump has pleaded not guilty. Can Trump still run for president? Yes. The US constitution does not prohibit anyone charged with a crime, nor anyone convicted of one, from holding office. The 14th amendment, however, does bar anyone who has taken an oath to protect the United States and engaged in \u201cinsurrection or rebellion\u201d from holding office. Relying on that provision, a slew of separate civil lawsuits in state courts are expected in the near future to try to bar Trump from holding office. Who is Fani Willis, the prosecutor bringing the charges in Fulton county? Willis, a Democrat, was elected Fulton county district attorney in 2020. She is the first Black woman to hold the office. She worked as the prosecutor in the Fulton county district attorney\u2019s office from 2001 to 2018 and is no stranger to high-profile cases. In 2014, she led the prosecution against a dozen Atlanta educators who conspired to cheat on test scores in order to win funding. She is also prosecuting the rapper Young Thug as part of a broader indictment of the YSL gang. Willis relied on the Georgia Rico Act in both cases. How did the charges come about? In January of 2022, Willis requested that a Fulton county judge approve a special purpose grand jury to assist her investigation into Trump. A special purpose grand jury can issue subpoenas, hear testimony and ultimately issue a report recommending whether or not to charge someone. It cannot issue an indictment. A regular grand jury was convened in late July and ultimately voted to file criminal charges against Trump. Cast of characters In addition to Trump, Fani Willis has filed charges of violating the Georgia Rico Act and a variety of other laws against 18 co-defendants: Mark Meadows, former chief of staff heavily involved in efforts to keep Trump in office; Rudy Giuliani, an attorney to Trump who played a key role in national efforts to overturn the 2020 election results; John Eastman, an attorney to Trump and key to efforts to overturn the 2020 election result; Kenneth Chesebro, a legal adviser to the 2020 election campaign involved in the Georgia fake electors scheme; Jeffrey Clark, former justice department lawyer who became involved in efforts to overturn the Georgia result; Sidney Powell, a lawyer for Trump heavily involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 result; Jenna Ellis, an election campaign lawyer; Ray Smith, a Georgia lawyer implicated in the fake electors scheme; Robert Cheeley, a Georgia lawyer implicated in efforts to falsely show election fraud; Michael Roman, former aide in the Trump White House implicated in the fake electors scheme; David Shafer, former chairman of the Georgia Republican party who signed the fake official certificate to send to Congress declaring Trump won the state; Shawn Still, a senior Georgia Republican and state senator who also signed the fake certificate; Stephen Cliffgard Lee, a pastor accused of bullying election workers over fake fraud claims; Harrison William Prescott Floyd, director of Black Voices for Trump, accused of influencing witnesses; Trevian Kutti, a publicist accused of pressuring election workers; Cathy Latham, who as chair of Georgia\u2019s Coffee county Republican party signed the false certificate claiming Trump won the state; Scott Hall, a bondsman accused with others of breaching voting machines in Georgia; Misty Hampton, accused of involvement in breaching voting machines while serving as Coffee county elections director."

            "date": "2023-08-30T15:57:25Z",
            "content": "Military officers in Gabon say they have taken power and put the president, Ali Bongo Ondimba, under house arrest, as the country becomes the latest in Africa to suffer an attempted coup, only weeks after mutinous troops seized power in Niger. A group of military personnel appeared on state television to announce they were seizing power to overturn the results of a presidential election, seeking to remove a president whose family has held power for nearly 56 years. The officers introduced themselves as members of the Committee of Transition and the Restoration of Institutions. If successful, the coup would be the eighth in west and central Africa since 2020. The most recent one, in Niger, was in July, while the military has also seized power in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Chad. In a video apparently from detention in his residence, Bongo Ondimba called on people to \u201cmake noise\u201d to support him. Crowds instead took to the streets of the capital and sang the national anthem to celebrate the coup attempt against a dynasty accused of getting rich on the country\u2019s resource wealth while many of its citizens struggle to scrape by. The officers said they represented all Gabonese security and defence forces and announced the election results were cancelled, all borders were closed until further notice and state institutions dissolved. \u201cToday the country is undergoing a severe institutional, political, economic, and social crisis,\u201d the officers said in a statement, saying the 26 August election lacked transparency and credibility. \u201cIn the name of the Gabonese people \u2026 we have decided to defend the peace by putting an end to the current regime.\u201d A Gabon army officer, Brice Oligui Nguema, told French newspaper Le Monde that generals would meet on Wednesday to decide who would lead a transition. The coup attempt came hours after Bongo, 64, was declared winner of an election marred by fears of violence. He was last seen in public casting his vote on Saturday. Gabon is a member of the Opec oil cartel, with a production of 181,000 barrels of crude a day, making it the eighth-largest producer of oil in sub-Saharan Africa. It is home to more than 2 million people, and is slightly smaller than the US state of Colorado. Unlike Niger and two other west African countries run by military juntas, Gabon has not been afflicted by jihadi violence and had been seen as relatively stable. But nearly 40% of Gabonese aged 15-24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank. The president of Nigeria, Bola Tinubu, who is also chair of the West African regional bloc Ecowas that has threatened to intervene military in Niger to restore constitutional order, was said by a spokesman to be \u201cwatching developments in Gabon very closely with deep concern for the country\u2019s socio-political stability and the seeming autocratic contagion apparently spreading across different regions of our beloved continent.\u201d White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the the US was \u201cfollowing this very, very closely.\u201d China called for a peaceful resolution and Russia said it hoped for a swift return to stability. The political demise of Bongo fits a pattern of coups in French-speaking Africa in recent years. The French-educated Bongo met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris in late June and shared photos of them shaking hands. The French prime minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, said France, Gabon\u2019s former colonial ruler, was following the situation closely. France has around 400 soldiers permanently deployed in the country for training and military support, including at a base in the capital, and has extensive economic ties to the country in the mining and oil sectors. Before Wednesday\u2019s dramatic announcement, Bongo\u2019s spell in office was marked by disputed elections and a stroke that spurred rumours about his fitness for office and fuelled a minor attempted coup. Niger and other Sahel countries have been fighting Islamist insurgencies that have eroded faith in democratic governments. Gabon, which lies further south on the Atlantic coast, is not facing the same challenges, but a coup would suggest another sign of democratic backsliding in a volatile region. Viviane Mbou, a shopkeeper, offered the soldiers juice, which they declined. And Jordy Dikaba, a young man walking with his friends on a street lined with armoured policemen, said: \u201cLong live our army.\u201d The French mining company Eramet said it was ceasing all operations in Gabon, and was implementing procedures to ensure the safety of its staff and facilities. The company\u2019s subsidiaries in Gabon operate the world\u2019s largest manganese mine and a rail transport company. The private intelligence firm Ambrey said all operations at Gabon\u2019s main port in Libreville had been halted, with authorities refusing to grant permission for vessels to leave. One morning flight at Libreville\u2019s L\u00e9on-Mba international airport had already been delayed early on Wednesday morning. A man who answered a number listed for the airport told Associated Press that flights were cancelled on Wednesday. The coup attempt came about a month after mutinous soldiers in Niger seized power from the democratically elected government, and is the latest in a series of coups that have challenged governments with ties to France. Bongo, in his annual Independence Day speech on 17 August, said: \u201cWhile our continent has been shaken in recent weeks by violent crises, rest assured that I will never allow you and our country, Gabon, to be hostages to attempts at destabilisation. Never.\u201d In his speech, Bongo acknowledged the widespread frustration over rising costs of living, and listed measures his government was taking to contain fuel prices, make education more affordable, and stabilise the price of baguettes. The EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, asked about Gabon on Wednesday, said European ministers would discuss the situation this week. \u201cIf this is confirmed, it\u2019s another military coup, which increases instability in the whole region,\u201d he said."

            "title": "A-level results reflect inequalities across England after challenging years",
            "date": "2023-08-17T12:11:04Z",
            "content": "Students have today been awarded their A-level and level 3 technical or vocational qualification results, and grades are now beginning to resemble their pre-pandemic status. In 2023, 26.5% of A-level entries in England were awarded top grades, compared with 25.2% in 2019, and down from 35.9% in 2022. About three-quarters of A-level entries were awarded grade C or above in 2019 and 2023, compared with 82% last year. Marginally more entries were awarded U and E grades in 2023 than in 2019. There is debate as to whether it is too soon to return to pre-pandemic grading in England. However, although universities and employers will need to be mindful of the grading approaches taken between years, 2023 finishers will largely be competing for higher education places against other students from 2023. Moreover, future cohorts and their teachers will benefit from the return of predictability in the examination and grading process. None of that is to understate the challenges faced by this year\u2019s cohort. Their GCSE years were disrupted by school closures, and their GCSE grades were teacher assessed, meaning most will not have sat a public exam prior to this summer. Furthermore, student absences were rife, with added disruption stemming from industrial action as unions strove to reach a pay deal. These issues appear to have had unequal impacts on different students. In particular, the proportion achieving top grades in parts of northern England have declined relative to 2019, whereas the rate in other regions, notably London, has increased. As was the case last year, the return to exams relative to teacher assessments appears to have benefited male students across most subjects. In particular, the female lead in the proportion achieving top grades in maths and physics in 2022 appears to have reversed. Independent schools had one of the largest drops since last year, but their proportion achieving top grades since 2019 increased the most. In contrast, the proportion achieving top A-level grades in further education establishments has decreased since 2019. We cannot say to what extent this variation represents differences in the impacts of school closures and absences, the suitability of post-16 course choices based on inflated 2021 GCSE results, or the year-on-year variation we might expect to see anyway. Most likely it is a combination of all three. Many will now be considering their options for future study, or thinking about employment. University applications are marginally down this year compared with last, despite a larger number of 18-year-olds in the population, but competition for the most selective universities remains high. The second cohort of students also this year completed T-level courses, the government\u2019s new vocational study programme. The vast majority who finished their course received a pass grade and will have gained valuable skills for future study or employment. However, dropout rates appear high and there is debate around how suitable T-levels are for all students, with the qualifications being more demanding than existing alternatives. The government is poised to defund many of the alternative qualifications, a risky manoeuvre given these issues. Students and their teachers should be commended for their efforts after a uniquely challenging few years. However, we should not lose sight of the problems facing future cohorts. There have been positive funding settlements recently, but these must be considered against the real-term cuts the sector has faced over the last decade. Correspondingly, teacher recruitment and retention are big issues for many colleges, and EPI research shows that the grades of disadvantaged students have fallen further behind those of their peers over the course of the pandemic. Today\u2019s results cannot yet tell us whether this persisted into 2023. However, with an election looming, supporting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged students needs to remain a priority for all parties, if all students are to benefit from the opportunities of a world class education system. \u2022 Sam Tuckett is associate director at the Education Policy Institute"

            "date": "2023-08-23T06:17:18Z",
            "content": "An ever-worsening economic situation is hanging over Zimbabwean voters as they go to the polls in a repeat of the 2018 election pitting President Emmerson Mnangagwa against his charismatic and relatively youthful challenger, Nelson Chamisa. Mnangagwa narrowly defeated Chamisa five years ago after the coup that deposed Robert Mugabe, and pledged to to tackle the economy \u201chead on\u201d in his first term. However, unemployment, inflation and falls in the value of the Zimdollar have persisted. Eleven candidates are vying for top office but the real contest is between Mnangagwa, from the ruling Zanu-PF party, and Chamisa, of the Citizens Coalition for Change. In several poor townships of the capital, Harare, some people were at polling stations two hours before voting opened, fearing long lines. Chamisa has promised to turn around the country\u2019s fortunes and return Zimbabwe to the community of nations. He also pledged to fight corruption, and pay workers a minimum wage in US dollars. For his part, Mnangagwa claims to have made major strides towards getting the economy on track, in part by building infrastructure, and says Zimbabwe will be more prosperous if he gets another five years. Since repossessing land from white farm owners in 2000, Zimbabwe\u2019s economy has suffered a major collapse, as financial aid from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank dried up in the face of economic sanctions on Mugabe\u2019s administration. Unemployment and poverty levels remain high in the country once regarded as the bread basket of southern Africa. Despite claiming a bumper harvest, nearly 3.8 million people will go hungry this year. \u201cWe are going to restore the economy. We will get rid of the Zimbabwean dollar and put US dollars in your pockets,\u201d Chamisa said on Monday in Harare, to cheers from his supporters. About 6.6 million Zimbabweans are expected to vote for a new president, legislators and councillors in the second general election to be held since the end of Mugabe\u2019s 37-year-rule. Of the total number of voters, 1 million are be voting for the first time, most of whom have never experienced a prosperous Zimbabwe. \u201cAll I want is a decent job,\u201d Everjoy Mupazvirihwo, 26, an engineering graduate, said as he waved a yellow flag emblazoned with Chamisa\u2019s face on Monday. \u201cEver since I finished college, finding a job has been difficult. We are not asking for much.\u201d Observers have predicted an increased voter turnout in Wednesday\u2019s polls despite a crackdown on the opposition. In 2018, voter turnout was 75%, according to the electoral commission. Zimbabwe has a history of disputed and violent elections since it became independent from the UK in 1980. Human rights groups say the same factors that blighted previous elections \u2013 voter roll irregularities, public media bias, and the use of law enforcement and the courts to hamstring opposition campaigns \u2013 remain. Forty CCC supporters are in custody after being detained for attending a banned car rally last week. An opposition supporter died in early August after a group of people travelling to a rally were ambushed by suspected ruling party supporters. Human rights organisations have reported growing intimidation in rural areas, where Chamisa has described voters\u2019 choices as \u201cdeath or Zanu-PF\u201d. He told supporters on Monday: \u201cZimbabwe, try me. My hands have no blood. These hands are safe.\u201d The CCC leader claimed during campaigning that the electoral commission had refused to give him a full and searchable voters\u2019 roll and a copy of the ballot paper, among other complaints. His party has taken the commission to court over the issues, but no ruling has been made. The 45-year-old pastor and lawyer, who lost a constitutional court challenge to overturn Mnangagwa\u2019s narrow win in 2018, said he had briefed electoral observers about his concerns and that he had employed election agents to monitor the counting of ballots and avoid electoral \u201ctheft\u201d. Polling stations opened on Wednesday at 7am (0500 GMT) and close at 7pm, after which counting of votes will begin. To win the presidency, a candidate will need to get more than 50% of the vote and two-thirds of seats in parliament to claim a majority."

            "date": "2023-08-20T21:00:22Z",
            "content": "Ecuadoreans are choosing a new president in early elections amid a powerful display of security after the assassination of the presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio less than two weeks before the vote. Voters are heading to the polls in the backdrop of rising crime, violence and economic turmoil. Villavicencio, a former journalist and lawmaker, was shot dead leaving a campaign event in Quito on 9 August. Six suspects, all Colombians who police say belong to criminal gangs, are being held in connection to the murder. Another suspect died of injuries sustained in a shootout. Flanked by dozens of police and army special forces, Villavicencio\u2019s replacement, Christian Zurita, cast his ballot at a polling station in the Republica de Bolivia school in northern Quito, wearing a bulletproof vest and a helmet. Zurita, who was a close friend of Villavicencio, became the new Construye 25 (or Build 25) party candidate just a week before the vote. A fellow investigative journalist, he too had received death threats, some attributed to drug cartels linked to massacres in prisons and a homicide rate that has risen fivefold in as many years. \u201cThese are difficult and dark moments for the country but we are up to it,\u201d Zurita told journalists. \u201cWe will face with determination [the challenge] to move our country forward under the principles and programmes which we have proposed. \u201cWe must expose all the possible threats against us. Remember that\u2019s how they killed Fernando,\u201d he added. Candidates have pledged to fight the wave of crime as well as improve the flagging economy, which has forced many Ecuadoreans without work to migrate. The murder of Villavicencio, the third politician to be assassinated this year, appeared to be foremost in voters\u2019 minds at a polling station in Quito, just metres from where the killing took place. \u201cHere, what we need is a leader who first of all guarantees that all citizens can move freely,\u201d Jose Luis Hernandez, 37, said. \u201cIn the building next door, they killed Fernando Villavicencio, so these are situations that we as Ecuadoreans \u2013 in a country that used to be one of peace and tranquillity \u2013 did not see coming.\u201d Janet Castro, 55, a teacher who voted for pro-market candidate Otto Sonnenholzner, said: \u201cI think that he has a good plan for our safety because that is our main problem. He also has good ideas for our economic situation.\u201d Voting in the capital, Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez, a former president and a parliamentary candidate, said Ecuador needed international help to combat Mexican and Balkan drug cartels operating in the country. \u201cEcuador is bleeding to death, Ecuador is falling apart, and if there is no unity between the executive and the legislature, the state could collapse, it could become a failed state.\u201d At the same polling station, former interior minister, Patricio Carrillo Rosero, denied accusations that the country was becoming a \u201cnarcostate\u201d but said organised crime and illegal economies had infiltrated the state. \u201cWe have to fight corruption and break with this agenda of impunity, that is fundamental,\u201d he said. The interior ministry said 100,000 soldiers have been deployed across the country to protect the electoral process. The snap election was called by outgoing president, Guillermo Lasso, in May to stave off being impeached by a hostile parliament \u2013 which he then dissolved in a constitutional move. Whoever is elected will only govern for less than a year and a half, until 2025. If no candidate wins an outright majority a runoff vote will be held in October."

            "content": "The brazen assassination of a presidential candidate will hang heavy over Ecuadorian voters as they choose a new president this weekend, following the latest eruption of drug cartel violence in the once-peaceful nation. The winner of Sunday\u2019s vote will face an overwhelming public demand for security \u2013 but may not have the budget or the political capital to overhaul failed crime-fighting policies and fund new ones. The killing of the journalist turned politician Fernando Villavicencio in broad daylight on 9 August \u2013 less than two weeks before the first-round vote \u2013 has transformed the presidential race. His name remains among the eight candidates on the ballot papers, but Christian Zurita, a close friend and fellow journalist, was chosen to run in his place. Zurita, 53, has vowed to continue Villavicencio\u2019s anti-corruption crusade and at a meeting with the foreign press on Thursday, he declared that organised crime was so deeply embedded in Ecuador that the country had become a \u201cnarcostate\u201d. \u201cIt is a process of total deterioration of social conditions in places that didn\u2019t know violence,\u201d he said. Flanked by a special forces police officer, he said: \u201cHow long are we going to put up with it so that it doesn\u2019t spread any further? This is going to grow and we have to stop it.\u201d Zurita, who was present when his friend was shot, said he believed Villavicencio had been assassinated because he planned to militarise the country\u2019s ports \u2013 key gateways for cocaine smuggling. Police have arrested six suspects over the murder \u2013 all described as members of Colombian crime factions; another was killed in a shootout. But there is still no clarity over who ordered the killing, why Villavicencio did not have his usual armoured car \u2013 and how the gunman was able to penetrate three rings of security. Zurita repeated an allegation that the country\u2019s police knew who was behind the murder and called for their ranks to be purged. \u201cDecisions must be taken on the police leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be one of the most important guidelines left by Fernando Villavicencio. Whose side are they on?\u201d Villavicencio, who had received repeated death threats, was considered brave to the point of recklessness, even giving a campaign speech in Chone, the home city of the Choneros gang, whose jailed leader, Jose Adolfo Mac\u00edas, alias \u201cFito\u201d, reportedly threatened the candidate in the weeks before his murder. His combative stance won him supporters among Ecuadorians tired of crime and violence. In the South American nation of 18 million people there has been a surge in violent crime as rival drug-trafficking gangs perpetrate prison massacres and attacks in public places. Murder rates have increased fivefold in as many years. Marielena Romero, a caf\u00e9 owner in Quito, said she ran her business behind closed doors for fear of robberies or assaults. \u201cMy business is affected because I don\u2019t open the caf\u00e9 fully. I feel it\u2019s too risky.\u201d But despite her fears, she said Villavicencio\u2019s assassination had made her even more determined to vote. \u201cThe need to vote has never been so clear. I believe democracy is the only way we can escape this situation.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s interior minister, Juan Zapata, said more than 100,000 police and military officers were being deployed to secure the election process. Celeste Jaramillo, who had been living in the US for 15 years, returned to visit her children and grandchildren, as well as vote. \u201cWe never thought that the situation could become so terrible, we feel there are no principles, no one to believe in,\u201d she said. She said Villavicencio \u201chad the courage to confront it and the information and evidence to put a stop to the shamelessness in the country\u201d. Security analysts say the country\u2019s nosedive into a violent drug war has a precedent in the region: in neighbouring Colombia, three presidential candidates were assassinated \u2013 and an airliner carrying 107 people was bombed in an attempt to kill a fourth \u2013 before the 1990 election. \u201cThe situation we are in now is the same situation that Colombia was in when it was the [world\u2019s] most dangerous country,\u201d said Gen Paco Moncayo, a military officer who served as a national security adviser in the government of the outgoing president, Guillermo Lasso. \u201cWhen the Medell\u00edn and Cali cartels were ravaging that state, what Colombia did was strengthen the state: judges, legislators, executives had a single plan, a single agreement.\u201d If Ecuador was to pull itself back from the brink, it could not rely on a military solution alone, Moncayo said. Sandwiched between Colombia and Peru, the world\u2019s biggest cocaine producers, Ecuador has become a key transit point for the drug. That has attracted criminal gangs able to buy guns, police officers and politicians. Both of Mexico\u2019s most powerful factions \u2013 the Sinaloa and the Jalisco cartels \u2013 are present, as are other groups from as far afield as the Balkans. By contrast, the Ecuadorian state has been under austerity measures amid declining revenues from taxes and the oil industry. \u201cThe supreme weapon of drug-trafficking criminals is corruption; they need to corrupt judges, prosecutors, military, police, politicians and even mayors,\u201d Moncayo said. \u201cIt is through corruption that drug trafficking takes over the sovereignty of the state and manages to besiege it.\u201d Until that problem was tackled, nothing would improve, he said. The official response to the crisis has been hamstrung by political infighting and mutual accusations of corruption among the country\u2019s political elite. Whoever is elected will only govern for about a year and a half, until 2025. The snap election was called by Lasso in May to stave off being impeached by a hostile parliament \u2013 which he then dissolved in a constitutional move. \u201cWe want to fight,\u201d said Jaramillo. \u201cBut there are times when we ask: what future is there for our children and grandchildren in this country?\u201d"

            "content": "Less than three months before New Zealand\u2019s general election, support for the governing Labour party has slid further in the wake of the departure of justice minister Kiri Allan from prime minister Chris Hipkins\u2019 cabinet. This week\u2019s Newshub-Reid Research poll shows support for Labour is down 3.6 percentage points to 32.3%, with National up 1.3 points to 36.6%. It suggests National and its prospective coalition partner, the libertarian right Act party, may hold the numbers to tip the scales in their favour in the upcoming election on 14 October. The numbers follow a poll in mid July, in which both major parties were down two points, with Labour on 33%, and National 35%. In late July, Allan resigned from office after police charged her with careless driving and refusing to accompany a police officer after a car crash. The incident followed a series of errors and scandals involving government ministers, including the resignation of the transport and immigration minister, Michael Wood, in June, who failed to disclose conflicts of interest related to shareholdings. In March, the police minister, Stuart Nash, was sacked after it was revealed he had supplied confidential information to donors. In May, the customs minister, Meka Whaitiri, was fired after defecting to Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori. Despite Labour\u2019s ministerial losses and setbacks over the past few months, support for Hipkins has held, with the prime minister up 0.6 points to 24% in the preferred prime minister ratings, well ahead of Luxon, down 0.5 points to 15.9%. Rising in the polls are the minor parties \u2013 and coalition partners \u2013 with support for Act up 1.3 points to 12.1%, and the Greens up 1.5 points to 9.6%. The populist-and perennial kingmaker Winston Peters of the New Zealand First party has seen his faction climb 1.1 points to 4.1%, edging closer to the 5% threshold required to enter parliament. Support for Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori slipped slightly, by 0.8 points, to 2.7%. A party, or coalition of parties, must win at least 60 of parliament\u2019s 120 seats to form a government. Based on the latest numbers, a National-Act coalition would secure power with 61 seats, with the left bloc holding 59. Despite support coalescing within the right bloc in a tight race, New Zealand First\u2019s support may be needed. However, Act party leader David Seymour has emphatically ruled out working with Peters, and has urged National to adopt the same stance, telling 1News that Peters was \u201cunable to work with anyone\u201d. Opposition leader Christopher Luxon told RNZ working with New Zealand First \u201cwas not a consideration\u201d. Hipkins has said Peters had ruled out working with Labour. While New Zealand First exited parliament after the 2020 election with just 2.6% of votes, Peters has over his long career habitually defied polls and recently told broadcaster RNZ the party remained an underrated contender. Several months out from the 2011 election the party sat at 2%, landing on 6.5% on election day, and in 2017 secured 7.2% of the vote, which saw him crowned kingmaker when neither major party had the requisite seats to govern alone."

            "content": "China\u2019s army released a propaganda video showing soldiers preparing for a conflict in what appears to be the Taiwan strait. The one-and-a-half-minute video, published on the Eastern Theatre Command\u2019s official WeChat account on Thursday, is titled \u201cReading the Strait\u201d and shows soldiers in combat gear doing press-ups under crashing waves, a tank battalion driving into the sunset and troops running up sandy shores past anti-landing barricades, similar to those that dot Taiwan\u2019s coast. The video is accompanied by a catchy ballad, with lyrics such as \u201cgo over the city gate and the high wall and take the freest way\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid\u201d and \u201cwe turned over the mountain to meet the sunset\u201d. The WeChat post includes a poem with similar lines. The poem concludes: \u201cYou, no matter how dark it is, don\u2019t be afraid. Fireflies and moonlight as the guiding light, we ride the wind with our dreams, chase and win the warmest years.\u201d Neither the video nor the WeChat post mention Taiwan directly. But the Eastern Theatre Command, a division of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, is based on China\u2019s eastern coast and has responsibility for the Taiwan strait. It is the military division that periodically conducts drills around the self-governing island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory. Last month, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, toured the command\u2019s headquarters in Nanjing and urged the military to improve its war readiness, while praising the \u201csignificant contributions\u201d of the command in safeguarding China\u2019s territorial integrity. The post published on Thursday said Eastern Theatre Command soldiers were \u201cready to fight all the time, ready to fight at any time\u201d."

            "title": "Battlefield deaths in Ukraine have risen sharply this year, say US officials",
            "date": "2023-08-18T17:20:35Z",
            "content": "The number of battlefield casualties in Ukraine is approaching nearly 500,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, US officials have told the New York Times, marking a significant rise in the death toll this year following intense fighting in the east of the country. Russia\u2019s military casualties are approaching 300,000, the officials claimed, with as many as 120,000 killed in action. Last November, Gen Mark Milley, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, said 100,000 troops on each side had been killed or wounded. But fierce fighting near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, where Russia sent convicts in human wave attacks, and an unsuccessful Ukrainian counteroffensive against fortified Russian positions, have led to significant casualties on both sides, more than doubling the number of dead since November. Ukraine was said to have close to 70,000 killed and 100,000-120,000 wounded. Russia\u2019s standing army is between two to three times larger than Ukraine\u2019s, and the country has a larger population from which to replenish its frontline soldiers. Ukraine has about 500,000 troops, while Russia has more than 1.3 million, the newspaper estimated, including reserves and Wagner paramilitaries. Both estimates, which the officials admitted were speculative and varied widely within the government, would mark high killed-to-wounded ratios, with one Ukrainian killed for every two other soldiers wounded on the battlefield. The officials said they had estimated the data using \u201csatellite imagery, communication intercepts, social media and news media dispatches from reporters in the country, as well as official reporting from both governments\u201d. The newspaper said that officials \u201ccautioned that casualty figures remained difficult to estimate because Moscow is believed to routinely undercount its war dead and injured, and Kyiv does not disclose official figures\u201d. US intelligence officials had \u201cspent much more time focusing on Russian casualties than those of Ukraine, their ally\u201d, the paper added. The reports of 120,000 Russian soldiers killed is considerably higher than the numbers confirmed by Russian journalists monitoring the conflict. Using open-source data, Meduza and BBC Russian have confirmed the deaths of 30,000 Russian soldiers with social media posts from relatives, reports in local media, or local government statements. Using data on excess deaths from public records, Meduza and Mediazona estimated that 47,000 soldiers had been killed during the war, not counting those from the occupied territories of east Ukraine. The numbers also marked a considerable increase from a leaked assessment from the Defence Intelligence Agency in April that said Russia had sustained as many as 223,000 casualties but just 43,000 killed in action. Similarly, Ukrainian casualties could have reached 131,000 soldiers, the document said, including a maximum 17,500 killed on the battlefield. The number of deaths may reflect changing estimates of how many soldiers survive injuries on the battlefield. Medical care is more rudimentary than in the US military, and soldiers are often evacuated under chaotic conditions to overwhelmed hospitals and aid stations. Russians recruited from prison to fight in Ukraine said they were often sent into frontal attacks against fortified positions and abandoned on the battlefield if they were wounded."

            "title": "China-Philippines dispute could escalate into superpower conflict, say analysts",
            "date": "2023-08-08T10:23:42Z",
            "content": "A territorial dispute between China and the US-aligned Philippines is at increasingly high risk of escalating into a conflict involving the two superpowers, analysts have said, after Chinese coastguards used a water cannon on a Philippine boat. Global concern about China\u2019s naval activities is growing as the country expands and modernises its military, and shows increasing aggression in its claims over the South China Sea and Taiwan. Joint drills with Russia \u2013 during which a flotilla sailed near Alaska this weekend \u2013 have also heightened concern over military coordination between Beijing and Moscow. On Saturday, China\u2019s coastguard directed water cannon at a Philippine coastguard resupply vessels en route to the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, which Beijing also claims. Philippine military personnel are living onboard a grounded former warship, the Sierra Madre, deliberately scuttled at the Shoal in 1999 to reinforce Manila\u2019s claims. China\u2019s coastguard also used water cannon against a Philippine supply crew in November 2021. The Philippine coastguard has accused the Chinese crew of illegal conduct and dangerous manoeuvres, and its government has summoned the Chinese ambassador to lodge a diplomatic protest. Its foreign ministry said it was unable to reach Beijing counterparts during the incident. The US, EU, France, Japan and Australia were among nations to voice support for the Philippines and concern over China\u2019s actions. Washington also reaffirmed its commitment to obligations under a mutual defence treaty, to defend the Philippines if its public vessels and forces come under armed attack. Blake Herzinger, a research fellow at the University of Sydney\u2019s United States Studies Centre, said there was \u201csignificant escalatory potential\u201d in the Philippine holdings of the South China Sea. \u201cBeijing\u2019s risky behaviour in the region has the potential to draw the two powers into conflict even without intending to do so,\u201d Herzinger said. What activity would trigger the treaty, and how close the weekend\u2019s incident came, remains unclear, said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in east Asia at King\u2019s College London. Both sides have released footage of the confrontation. The Philippine coastguard spokesperson, Jay Taryela, also released photos purporting to show boats from China\u2019s maritime militia assisting the interception of the Philippines supply mission. But Patalano said the US was sending Beijing a message that it considered activity in disputed areas such as the Shoal as covered by the treaty. \u201cIf these things continue to escalate there will be a serious conversation with the US and Philippines on how to cooperate so the Philippines remain firmly in control of the situation as much as possible.\u201d Beijing says its coastguard was \u201cprofessional and restrained\u201d in having \u201clawfully stopped\u201d two Philippine vessels which it accused of violating Chinese sovereignty. Under the administration of its president, Bongbong Marcos, who succeeded Rodrigo Duterte in June 2022, the Philippines has strengthened its ties and increased cooperation with the US, particularly in pushing back on China\u2019s territorial claims. Amanda Hsiao, senior China analyst with the Crisis Group, said Beijing had traditionally sought to draw a line between Philippine transportations of humanitarian supplies and of construction equipment to the Shoal. Statements suggested it was blaming this incident on the Philippines for transporting the latter. \u201cThis is unlikely to be the primary motivation,\u201d she said on Twitter. \u201cThe use of a more forceful (though not new) tactic is likely more tied to Beijing\u2019s concerns with the Marcos administration\u2019s US tilt and more forward-leaning South China Sea policy than the specifics of the resupply.\u201d China\u2019s claim of sovereignty over about 90% of the South China Sea was found by the Hague in 2016 to have no legal basis, but Beijing continues to ignore that ruling and has boosted its presence in the region, in particular through its coastguard. \u201cChina has created a coastguard with a mission to expand Chinese control in the South China Sea. This is all based on a warped historical narrative that bears little relation to the evidence,\u201d said Bill Hayton, the author of The South China Sea: The Struggle for Power in Asia. Combined with the growing cooperation between Washington and Manila in pushing back on China, \u201cthis is setting up a cycle of action and reaction that is becoming more dangerous\u201d, said Hayton. Reactions were still escalating on Tuesday. China\u2019s foreign ministry repeated calls for the Philippines to immediately remove the Sierra Madre from the Shoal and \u201crestore it to its unoccupied state\u201d. In reply, a senior Philippine national security council official said they would never abandon their post, and would do \u201cwhatever is necessary\u201d to resupply it. At the same time China\u2019s coastguard was challenging Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, its navy was conducting joint drills with Russia off the coast of Alaska. The exercise raised some concern about the growing cooperation between Beijing and Moscow, whose leaders declared a \u201climitless\u201d partnership in 2021, but did not draw the same opprobrious reaction from the US as the Philippine incident. Available information suggests the 11 Chinese and Russian warships were in the US\u2019s exclusive economic zone, where the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) says foreign military activity is legal as long as it doesn\u2019t intrude into territorial waters. The US deployed four US Navy destroyers to the area, but government and military statements did not suggest the presence was a threat. Alaska senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, however, described the activity as an \u201cincursion\u201d and called for increased military funding for their region. \u201cReacting by calling this a threat, or an incursion, is playing into Beijing\u2019s hands in particular, as it commonly labels legal US maritime activity in the same way when objecting to it,\u201d said Herzinger, from the Sydney-based United States Studies Centre. The US government frequently conducts freedom of navigation exercises, including in places like the Taiwan strait and South China Sea, to reassert the rights under Unclos. However, Herzinger added: \u201cThe US has long been the only power capable of projecting significant combat power far from its shores without much fear of similar operations being conducted near its own homeland \u2013 these kinds of operations are intended to shake the foundation of that long-held assumption of relative insulation.\u201d"

            "title": "World Cup winners Spain prove conflict and success can co-exist | Anita Asante",
            "date": "2023-08-22T07:00:38Z",
            "content": "Shortly before the 2017 European Championship in the Netherlands I watched one of the tournament outsiders pass and move their way across a pitch and fell in love. \u201cThe way Spain play football is the way it should be played,\u201d I tweeted afterwards. Fast forward six years and Spain have come a very long way since the rainy Sunday evening in Breda when they lost 2-0 against England in the group stage. Even then, the Lionesses ceded the vast majority of possession but found a way to win thanks to counterattacking goals from Fran Kirby and Jodie Taylor. On Sunday in Sydney, I genuinely believed England would win again \u2013 this time in a World Cup final but, instead, it was a night when everything clicked for Jorge Vilda\u2019s side. With the exception of Jennifer Hermoso\u2019s penalty miss, every single thing went right for Spain. After beating Australia in the semi-final I had expected Sarina Wiegman\u2019s Euro 2022 winners to have the psychological edge but Spain proved the better team, monopolising possession and controlling large parts of the game. Some of their one- and two\u2011touch football was a joy to watch and, in a deeper than usual role, Hermoso maintained an effective tempo courtesy of some really clever touches. Although England initially created more chances they failed to score and their momentum began ebbing away in the face of the super talented Aitana Bonmat\u00ed, Salma Paralluelo and co. Off the pitch Vilda and his players have clearly not always seen eye to eye. The long\u2011running dispute between the squad and their head coach is well documented but the reality is that background conflict and success can coexist. A lot of people struggle to accept that but, for instance, it really is possible to be a good coach and a terrible person; not that I\u2019m saying this applies to Vilda! Spain\u2019s coach and his players seemed to have a \u201creset\u201d after losing 4-0 against Japan in the group stage and, looking in from the outside, he subsequently made some inspired tactical decisions. What we don\u2019t know is how much of their victory was down to the players; this is such an exceptionally talented and intelligent team that Vilda could, conceivably, have exerted limited impact. Top international players don\u2019t always play for the manager or even their country; they want to win for themselves, their families, their friends. This explains why sometimes off-field adversity really can make teams stronger. I remember playing for Sky Blue FC in New Jersey in the US when we had three coaches in six months and still won a title. Moreover most women in sport have had to put up with far from ideal off-field situations at times, sometimes confronting appalling misconduct. Maybe it makes them better at compartmentalisation than some male counterparts; perhaps they are just more used to coping with adversity. On Sunday, though, Vilda and his players were, for once, in perfect alignment: everyone wanted to win. Had Lauren Hemp scored rather than hit the crossbar early on it might have been very different but, as time passed, Spain were the team with belief, confidence and balance. Olga Carmona\u2019s winner was fantastic \u2013 and, for a full-back, an absolute dream goal. It\u2019s harsh to say Lucy Bronze made a bad mistake in the buildup. In inverting and carrying the ball forward she was trying to progress England\u2019s game but she took one touch too many and failed to release the ball early enough to an initially well\u2011placed Ella Toone. I think Lucy was trying to make the play fit a picture she had painted in her mind rather than adapting to the game\u2019s reality. A clinical Spain capitalised from the ensuing turnover but, overall, England gave the ball away far too many times. All those turnovers left Wiegman\u2019s players spending too long managing space and defending. Spain had done their homework and succeeded in nullifying Keira Walsh in midfield. Keira hasn\u2019t been at her best during this tournament yet she and England departed Australia as winners, too. They certainly won\u2019t feel like that for quite a while but, after reaching the 2015 and 2019 World Cup semi-finals, the Lionesses finally made a final. More will follow \u2013 and, sooner or later, the World Cup will be won. Let\u2019s hope England get rewarded fairly for their achievements. Everyone talks about gender equality but it sounded a bit hollow as the European champions began this World Cup in a dispute with the Football Association over bonuses. It prompts the question: is women\u2019s football being valued properly commercially? Australia and New Zealand 2023 has proved beyond doubt that the technical quality is high and rising fast. The challenge now is to ensure that under-resourced stars of the tournament \u2013 perhaps most notably, Nigeria and Jamaica \u2013 receive the backing they need to challenge for the top prizes. But it\u2019s been a great World Cup. I hear the organisation off the field was excellent with fans, players and media benefiting from the sort of smoothly efficient logistics not always synonymous with previous women\u2019s tournaments. The co-hosts Australia and New Zealand finished without medals \u2013 although the latter did win their first World Cup game \u2013 but they captured countless hearts and minds. In my book, that spells victory."

            "title": "Revealed: Louisiana created alleged conflict of interest in \u2018Cancer Alley\u2019 case",
            "date": "2023-08-10T15:00:03Z",
            "content": "Facing a pivotal federal investigation into Louisiana\u2019s relationship with petro-chemical companies, the state\u2019s attorney general hired lawyers who were simultaneously representing one of the main corporations at the center of the investigation, documents reveal. The revelations, contained in documents released under public records requests, have led to allegations of a major conflict of interest and come just weeks after the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] dropped its civil rights investigation. Internal emails, contracts and payments, show that the office of the attorney general, Jeff Landry, hired two lawyers to enter closed-door negotiations with the EPA during the 14-month civil rights investigation. But John King and Tim Hardy were also representing the Taiwanese chemicals firm Formosa in separate litigation, challenging a decision to revoke the company\u2019s state air permits. Formosa has proposed a gargantuan plastics facility in St James parish, at the center of \u201cCancer Alley\u201d, the heavily polluted corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, but has been paused by a series of recent court and permitting decisions. In June, however, the EPA prematurely dropped its investigation, which included an investigation of 14 air permits issued for Formosa and the racially disproportionate impacts of air pollution in the region, without declaring any findings. The case was considered a groundbreaking development by activists who have long argued that the petrochemical industry\u2019s expansion on Louisiana\u2019s coast is not only harmful but also an act of racism. The decision, a blow to local residents seeking justice, prompted suggestions the EPA may have buckled due to outside pressure from a legal challenge filed by Landry. But revelations that the two lawyers were working for both the state and Formosa indicate that the federal government may have also faced direct pressure at the negotiations table in the civil rights investigation itself, which was announced in April last year. \u201cThe conflicts are apparent and disturbing,\u201d said Monique Harden, the director of law and policy at the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, a community advocacy group not involved in the civil rights complaints that triggered the EPA investigation. \u201cWe have the attorney general of Louisiana receiving legal services from the same attorneys who are representing a company seeking a state issued permit.\u201d Landry\u2019s decision to hire petrochemical lawyers gave them an active role in the conversations that shape how the state follows its obligations under the Civil Rights Act, especially concerning the permitting of industrial facilities in communities of color with legacies of pollution. Even the EPA expressed ethical reservations about the industry representatives, records show, but later backed down from its concerns as the lawyers remained in negotiations. The federal agency explicitly raised concerns in a February email that Formosa representative John King could compromise the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the investigation. Landry, a hard-right conservative, is the frontrunner in this year\u2019s gubernatorial election in Louisiana and is a member of the Republican Attorneys General Association, a Koch Industries funded lobbying group. He has been endorsed by Donald Trump and has described the climate crisis as \u201ca hoax\u201d. In May, Landry filed a suit against the EPA challenging the recent complaints and the very idea of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, a critical avenue for addressing not only intentional discrimination, but more embedded, systemic forms of inequality that result in \u201cdisparate impacts\u201d across race, gender and national origin. The following month, the EPA dropped the complaints despite earlier promises by the Biden administration to support environmental justice communities with \u201cthe vigorous enforcement of civil rights\u201d. Residents\u2019 history of mistrust with Formosa Plastics \u2013 which has been attempting to build in Cancer Alley for at least 30 years \u2013 deepened upon learning that lawyers representing the company were allowed into the negotiations process. In their February email, the EPA expressed fears that \u201chaving the legal representative of a facility participate in this process potentially may create a perception in the community and the public generally that any informal resolution agreement resulting from our hard work together should not be trusted and/or should be questioned\u201d. But that\u2019s exactly what happened. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been left at the altar,\u201d said Jo Banner, a resident of St John the Baptist parish. \u201cAfter putting us through this process, and for [the EPA] to pull out in this way, we need them to step up in other ways.\u201d \u201cA mile away from Formosa\u2019s [proposed facility] is an elementary school of little Black kids. And my heart breaks because I\u2019m like, \u2018These little Black kids are going to go through the same thing I was growing up there,\u2019\u201d said Shamyra Lavigne, who grew up in St James parish. Lavigne is a member of Rise St James, which filed a lawsuit \u2013 in addition to the civil rights complaint \u2013 challenging the state\u2019s decision to permit the petrochemical complex.. The local subsidiary of Formosa, represented by John King and Tim Hardy, joined on the side of the state, which lost the case. Their lawsuit resulted in a district judge withdrawing Formosa\u2019s permits, in a significant, rare victory for residents. In September, Louisiana\u2019s environment agency (LDEQ) and Formosa filed an appeal of this decision, under the same legal counsel as before. This case is ongoing. But it\u2019s become clear that this is not the only legal avenue these lawyers have to shape decisions relating to the plastics behemoth. *** While the Biden administration\u2019s EPA has recognized the Civil Rights Act as a critical tool for environmental justice, the trajectory of the recent complaints raise questions about these bedrock protections. When LDEQ and LDH agreed to the informal resolution process designed to resolve the complaints, in April 2022, it looked like it would rectify some of the issues raised with Louisiana\u2019s air permitting process \u2013 specifically, early drafts of the resolution agreements show that it would have required the state to consider race when greenlighting polluting facilities, among other environmental justice reforms. But over the next year, the efforts to reach these agreements unraveled as the attorney general\u2019s office, represented by the same lawyers as Formosa, frequently pushed back against the EPA in these discussions, according to accounts filed in court. In November, 2022, the office of the attorney general entered into a contract with Breazeale, Sachse and Wilson, a Louisiana law firm with more than 70 attorneys. The contract, obtained through a records request, includes the rates for five attorneys at the firm, including attorneys John King and Tim Hardy. Both lawyers charged the state $400 an hour for their services. The firm was paid a total of $96,000 by the state between March and June, according to vendor payments receipts. Hardy and King did not respond to questions about their work for the state, referring questions to the attorney general\u2019s office. Noting ongoing litigation, the attorney general\u2019s office did not respond to questions about their contract with Breazeale, Sachse and Wilson, which does not end until October. The office\u2019s contract with the law firm authorized spending up to $150,000 on attorneys\u2019 services. About two weeks after the contract went into effect, Landry\u2019s office had a call with the EPA requesting to participate in the resolution negotiations between the federal agency, LDEQ and Louisiana\u2019s health department [LDH], according to a letter from the attorney general\u2019s office. During the November call, the attorney general\u2019s office also expressed concern that the EPA had made public an October letter to state agencies about finding \u201csignificant concerns\u201d that Black residents in St John the Baptist parish, St James parish and Cancer Alley had been the target of discrimination through LDEQ\u2019s air permitting. In a January 2023 call, the EPA continued to take a firm stance in the need to reform Louisiana\u2019s permitting process, according to court filings. But this was met by pushback from the attorney general\u2019s office and LDEQ who accused the EPA of asking for reforms beyond legal requirements. King and Hardy were present in the January scheduled resolution discussion calls, according to emails obtained through a records request. But attorneys with Tulane\u2019s Environmental Law Clinic and EarthJustice, who filed the civil rights complaints on behalf of residents of St James parish and St John the Baptist parish, were not invited to those calls. Neither were the residents. While this is standard for these negotiations, initial conversations with the EPA led participants to believe they\u2019d have more say in the process. It wasn\u2019t until February when Tulane\u2019s Environmental Law Clinic director, Lisa Jordan, first learned of the Formosa attorneys\u2019 involvement when she saw their names on an email she got back from a public records request. \u201cOur initial reaction was shock \u2013 our clients\u2019 was disgust \u2013 and then we became concerned that EPA likely was not aware that these attorneys currently represented (and still do) Formosa in the state court litigation,\u201d Jordan said. The clinic notified the EPA of the apparent conflict of interest that same day. The EPA did not respond to questions from the Guardian. \u201cPlease direct your questions related to Louisiana\u2019s legal representation to the state,\u201d wrote Dominique Joseph, a public affairs officer for the EPA. \u201cLouisiana taxpayers are paying a couple of attorneys to shut down civil rights,\u201d Harden said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would be willing to give up their civil rights so a company can operate. That\u2019s what the AG is pursuing.\u201d"

            "content": "Republicans rallied to Donald Trump\u2019s defense after the former president was indicted on 13 criminal charges in Georgia over his attempt to overturn his defeat there by Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the US House, said: \u201cJustice should be blind, but Biden has weaponized government against his leading political opponent to interfere in the 2024 election.\u201d Trump faces 91 criminal charges in all, also regarding hush-money payments to an adult film star, retention of classified information and federal election subversion. Regardless, he dominates Republican primary polling, leading his closest challengers nationally and in early voting states by about 40 points. Referring to Fani Willis of Fulton county, McCarthy continued: \u201cNow a radical [district attorney] in Georgia is following Biden\u2019s lead by attacking President Trump and using it to fundraise her political career. Americans see through this desperate sham.\u201d Trump has long used his legal predicament as a fundraising engine, both for his campaign and as a way to pay his increasingly mountainous legal bills. On Monday night, after charges were filed in Georgia, an email soliciting donations bemoaned a \u201cFOURTH ACT of Election Interference on behalf of the Democrats in an attempt to keep the White House under Crooked Joe\u2019s control and JAIL his single greatest opponent of the 2024 election\u201d. Republicans in Congress remained firmly on Trump\u2019s side. New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a member of House leadership, insisted Trump \u201chad every legal right to challenge the results of the election\u201d he conclusively lost. She added: \u201cThis blatant election interference by the far left will not work, President Trump will defeat these bogus charges and win back the White House in 2024.\u201d In the Senate, Ted Cruz of Texas, in 2016 Trump\u2019s closest rival for the Republican presidential nomination, said he was \u201cpissed\u201d. Cruz also called the Georgia indictment \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and repeated McCarthy\u2019s \u201cweaponization\u201d complaint \u2013 a party talking point. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump ally who briefly deserted him over the January 6 attack on Congress but swiftly came back onside, told Fox News: \u201cThe American people can decide whether they want [Trump] to be president or not. \u201cThis should be decided at the ballot box and not in a bunch of liberal jurisdictions trying to put the man in jail. They\u2019re weaponizing the law in this country. They\u2019re trying to take Donald Trump down.\u201d Among Republicans aiming to take Trump down \u2013 the other candidates in the presidential primary field \u2013 many were slower to respond. On Tuesday, Ron DeSantis, the second-placed candidate in most polls, told reporters the Georgia indictment was \u201can example of this criminalization of politics. I don\u2019t think that this is something that\u2019s good for the country.\u201d DeSantis also accused Willis of using an \u201cinordinate amount of resources\u201d on the Trump case while failing to tackle crime. Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor now challenging DeSantis for second place in New Hampshire, also questioned Willis\u2019s motives. The indictment was \u201cunnecessary\u201d, Christie, himself a former prosecutor, told Fox News, adding that indicting Trump was \u201cprobably an ego decision\u201d. Christie said he last spoke to Trump in December 2020, amid Trump\u2019s schemes to overturn the election. Christie said he told the man he endorsed four years before: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left. You need to concede the election.\u201d Trump, he said, responded: \u201cI will never, ever, ever admit it.\u201d On social media, the biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who has polled surprisingly strongly, said: \u201cI\u2019d volunteer to write the amicus brief to the court myself: prosecutors should not be deciding US presidential elections, and if they\u2019re so overzealous that they commit constitutional violations, then the cases should be thrown out and they should be held accountable.\u201d Ramaswamy also echoed the Trump campaign in seizing on a mistake in which a version of the indictment was posted on a court website on Monday afternoon and then swiftly deleted, all while grand jury testimony continued. \u201cSince the four prosecutions against Trump are using novel and untested legal theories,\u201d Ramaswamy said, \u201cit\u2019s fair game for him to do the same in defence: immediately file a motion to dismiss for a constitutional due process violation for publicly issuing an indictment before the grand jury had actually signed one. \u201cHe should make a strong argument on these grounds and it would send a powerful message to the ever-expansive prosecutorial police state.\u201d The former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, who like Christie has set himself against Trump, said: \u201cOver a year ago, I said that Donald Trump\u2019s actions disqualified him from ever serving as president again. Those words are more true today than ever before.\u201d Another anti-Trump candidate, the former congressman Will Hurd, like Hutchinson a vanishingly small presence in polling, called the Georgia indictment \u201canother example of how the former president\u2019s baggage will hand Joe Biden re-election if Trump is the nominee\u201d. Bemoaning \u201cfurther evidence that Trump knew he lost the 2020 election and was ready to do anything it took to cling to power\u201d, Hurd said the former president would \u201cuse this latest indictment as another opportunity to manipulate Americans into paying his legal bills\u201d."

            "content": "When Jack Smith announced the latest indictment of Donald Trump this week, the special prosecutor\u2019s language was remarkably clear. Smith used the phrase \u201cfueled by lies\u201d about Trump\u2019s role in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. (Trump officially pleaded not guilty today to charges that he conspired to defraud the United States, to disenfranchise voters and to obstruct the post-election transfer of power.) Smith didn\u2019t hesitate to use the word \u201cheroes\u201d to describe the Capitol police and other law enforcement officials who tried to protect the seat of American democracy. \u201cThey are patriots,\u201d he added, \u201cand they are the very best of us.\u201d And he asked Americans to perform a simple, patriotic act: read the indictment. Those who comply will find equally forthright language there. The indictment \u2013 clearly intended for citizens, not just lawyers \u2013 does not mince words or pussyfoot. More importantly, if they followed Smith\u2019s urging, they quickly would find the response to the \u201cfree speech\u201d defense that\u2019s getting so much play by Trump\u2019s political and media allies. Those allies are trying to make the case that speech \u2013 even false speech \u2013 cannot be a crime in America. \u201cWhat the government would have to prove in this case, beyond a reasonable doubt, is that speech is not protected by the first amendment, and they\u2019ll never be able to do that,\u201d Trump\u2019s defense lawyer John Lauro said in a CBS News interview. But the indictment anticipates that argument, and addresses it quickly \u2013 on the second page of this 45-page indictment. \u201cThe Defendant had a right, like every American, to speak publicly about the election and even to claim, falsely, that there had been outcome-determinative fraud during the election and that he had won,\u201d it acknowledges. It adds that the former president also had the right to challenge the election through legal means like recounts, audits or lawsuits. (Trump, of course, did do these things, to no avail.) Lying? Sure, that\u2019s within the law. Challenging election results? Legal, too. But then came the \u201cunlawful\u201d part: not mere words but criminal actions. Specifically, perpetrating conspiracies to discount legitimate votes and subvert the election results. In short, making concerted efforts to prevent the peaceful transfer of power \u2013 the very heart of American democracy. Sorry, but the first amendment is not down with that. \u201cThere is no First Amendment privilege to commit crimes just because you did it by speech,\u201d Samuel Buell, a Duke University law professor who led the justice department\u2019s prosecution of Enron, told the New York Times. In Buell\u2019s even simpler terms: \u201cTony Soprano can\u2019t invoke the first amendment for telling his crew he wants someone whacked.\u201d Examples abound. If you believe that the US currency system is unlawful, then you have a right to go around and tell everybody they have a right to print their own money. That\u2019s protected free speech. \u201cBut the moment you start printing your own money and putting it into traffic, you are engaging in counterfeiting,\u201d as Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin told the Washington Post\u2019s Ruth Marcus. And that\u2019s a crime that the first amendment wants no part in protecting. You can hear high-pitched and logic-free versions of that defense at nearly every moment on Fox News, which has convinced its viewers that Trump is a victim of a weaponized justice system. How convinced are they? Very. More than 90% of likely Republican primary voters who rely on Fox as their main news source and who stay away from mainstream media, do not think Trump committed serious crimes, according to one poll taken shortly before the latest legal chapter. Only 5% disagree. But a jury who takes these charges seriously should be a different matter. \u201cJack Smith\u2019s indictment is straightforward and narrow but boy, it packs a punch,\u201d the prominent attorney Neal Katyal said on MSNBC this week. \u201cIt\u2019s clean, it\u2019s calculated and I feel like it\u2019s almost certainly going to result in a conviction.\u201d We won\u2019t know if that\u2019s accurate for many months, despite the prosecution\u2019s obvious intention to put this trial on a fast track. But if the foundation of Trump\u2019s defense really turns out to be first amendment protection, Katyal\u2019s prediction should be proven right. A jury, especially a Washington DC jury, surely won\u2019t fail to see a crucial difference. Protected speech is one thing. Criminal action \u2013 conspiring to overthrow an election result \u2013 is quite another. Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture"

            "date": "2023-08-14T11:04:13Z",
            "content": "If Donald Trump stood in the middle of Fifth Avenue after robbing the Chase Bank branch by passing a note to the teller saying, \u201cYour money or your life,\u201d he\u2019d likely plead the first amendment as his defense: \u201cI was just exercising my rights to free speech!\u201d Of course, he\u2019d be wrong. Words that criminal defendants have written or spoken are used against them all the time. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of a confession. Still, no one should discount the potential resonance in the court of public opinion of Trump\u2019s messaging that he is the victim of a government attack on his first amendment rights. For the best of reasons, Americans prize the constitutional guarantee of free speech. Hence, it\u2019s worth a bit of a dive into why Trump has no serious first amendment defense in a court of law to the charges set forth in the masterful, 1 August DC grand jury indictment in which he\u2019s charged with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. The law puts it this way: \u201cSpeech integral to criminal conduct\u201d is not protected speech. UCLA Law professor and first amendment scholar Eugene Volokh has written that \u201c[i]t\u2019s now a standard item on lists of First Amendment exceptions.\u201d In the imagined robbery at Chase, the threatening note is integral to the crime of walking into a bank and taking the loot. In parallel, in the DC grand jury\u2019s indictment, Trump\u2019s claims that the election was stolen were integral to the conspiracy, the agreement with others and the acts of working in concert with them to unlawfully obstruct the January 6 congressional certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election. Surprise, surprise! Trump used words to do that. The first amendment does not immunize him from conviction because he did so. As even former Trump attorney general Bill Barr explained, \u201cAll conspiracies involve speech, and all fraud involves speech. So, free speech doesn\u2019t give you the right to engage in a fraudulent conspiracy.\u201d That\u2019s more than common sense. In 1949, the supreme court expressly rejected a claim that \u201cconstitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute\u201d. The statute at issue criminalized conspiracies in restraint of trade. Applied to Trump\u2019s case, the court\u2019s holding means you can\u2019t tell your campaign subordinates or lawyers to \u201corganize slates of fake electors in seven states\u201d, if those individuals agree to follow your orders and do it. The grand jury indictment fits supreme court law like a glove custom-made for a small hand. It recognizes that Trump has a right to make false claims. The problem, however, is with his actions. As the indictment recounts. Trump \u201cpursued unlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results . . . and perpetrated three criminal conspiracies.\u201d Specifically, the grand jury alleges that \u201cthe Defendant pushed officials in certain states to ignore the popular vote; disenfranchise millions of voters; dismiss legitimate electors; and ultimately, cause the ascertainment of and voting by illegitimate electors in favor of the Defendant.\u201d These are actions performed through words. If proven, they are criminal. So is lying to a court. According to the indictment, \u201cOn December 31, the Defendant signed a verification affirming false election fraud allegations made on his behalf in a lawsuit filed in his name against the Georgia governor.\u201d That\u2019s not free speech. It\u2019s perjury. As to Trump\u2019s unrelenting false election claims, at the trial, there\u2019s little barrier to Special Counsel Jack Smith introducing them into evidence. In 1993, the supreme court squarely held that \u201c[t]he First Amendment . . . does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent.\u201d Trump\u2019s many speeches advancing his phony claims of election fraud show his corrupt intent to use lies as a method and means to enlist state legislators and others into the scheme. At his trial, they will be admissible. Before the trial, Trump has vowed to continue to \u201ctalk about\u201d his case. He has a general right to do so, but no right to say whatever he wants in public about it. On Friday, at a Washington hearing on the government\u2019s request for a protective order to prevent disclosure of the discovery material that prosecutors will soon hand over to Trump, federal district court Judge Tanya Chutkan addressed the issue. \u201cMr. Trump, like every American,\u201d she stated, \u201chas a first amendment right to free speech, but that right is not absolute. In a criminal case such as this one, the defendant\u2019s free speech is subject to the rules.\u201d \u201cThe fact that he is running a political campaign \u2026 must yield to the orderly administration of justice \u2026 If that means he can\u2019t say exactly what he wants to say about witnesses in this case,\u201d the judge declared, \u201cthen that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be\u201d. Her warnings echo the supreme court\u2019s broad teaching in the 1966 case of Sheppard v Maxwell. There, the court made clear that rights derived from the first amendment \u201cmust not be allowed to divert the trial from the very purpose of a court system . . .\u201d including \u201cthe requirement that the jury\u2019s verdict be based on evidence received in open court, not from outside sources\u201d. To ensure \u201cthe purpose of the court system\u201d, Judge Chutkan did what is normal in cases of significant media interest and cases where there are risks to witnesses or of publicly disclosed grand jury material tainting the jury pool. She issued a protective order. By the order, Trump has been specifically told that he may not publicly discuss materials that the government designates as \u201csensitive\u201d. They will include witness\u2019s private identifying information, transcripts of their interviews and grand jury testimony. The supreme court has said that where good cause for a protective order exists, it \u201cdoes not offend the first amendment.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to dispute that good cause exists where the record shows, as it does here, that just days before Judge Chutkan\u2019s order, defendant Trump posted on social media the message, \u201cIf you go after me, I will come after you.\u201d No doubt with that message in mind, Judge Chutkan instructed Trump and his lawyers to \u201ctake special care\u201d that their public statements could not be reasonably viewed as intimidating witnesses or affecting the future judgment of jurors. \u201c[E]ven ambiguous statements,\u201d she warned, \u201c\u2026 can threaten the process.\u201d She has broad authority to impose consequences for a party\u2019s disobedience. Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \u201cIf a party fails to comply\u2026 \u201d the court may \u2026 enter any other order that is just under the circumstances.\u201d In addition, the DC district court\u2019s local rules authorize trial judges to fashion special orders to protect the right to a fair trial in \u201ca widely publicized or sensational criminal case\u201d. For now, Judge Chutkan foreshadowed use of the strongest hammer she has in Trump\u2019s case to punish any future disobedience, a tool that has nothing to do with holding him in contempt and potentially jailing him. \u201cThe more a party makes inflammatory statements about this case\u2026,\u201d she said from the bench, \u201cthe greater the urgency will be that we proceed to trial to ensure a jury pool from which we can select an impartial jury.\u201d That\u2019s sensible. The shorter the time to trial, the less opportunity for the jury pool to be tainted by messages that attempt to get Trump\u2019s story to them extrajudicially or that carry even a hint of intimidation. As we all know, a speedy trial taking place long before the election is the absolute last thing that Donald Trump wants.

            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s dubious defense that he was exercising his free-speech rights in response to a four-count federal criminal indictment charging him with pushing illegal schemes to overturn his 2020 election loss is prompting ex-Department of Justice officials and scholars to criticize such claims as bogus and as threats to the rule of law. Despite special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s detailed 45-page, four-count indictment of Trump for promoting several illegal schemes including organizing slates of fake electors in seven states to thwart Joe Biden\u2019s victory, Trump and some top Republican allies have repeatedly portrayed his multi-pronged drive to stay in power as a free speech matter. But former justice department officials, scholars and ex-Republican House members say Trump\u2019s actions and schemes went far beyond free speech, and that Trump and his allies are weakening the justice system and could breed new conspiracy theories by making a first amendment defense. Critics say Trump allies embracing his free-speech claims seem to be trying to cover themselves with the party\u2019s base and to rationalize sticking with Trump, despite the indictment\u2019s sizable body of damning evidence revealing Trump\u2019s active role in unprecedented and illegal ploys to overturn the 2020 result. The justice department filed a four-count grand jury indictment against Trump on 1 August that charged him with mounting several illegal efforts to stay in office \u2013 with help from six unnamed co-conspirators who were not charged \u2013 despite his loss to Biden by 7 million votes and no evidence of massive fraud, as Trump has falsely and repeatedly claimed. After pleading not guilty, Trump used one of his Truth Social posts on 3 August to charge that \u201cthe Radical Left wants to Criminalize Free Speech!\u201d and cited comments from Republican allies echoing his claims. Trump\u2019s lawyer John Lauro told CNN on 1 August that the charges against Trump are \u201can attack on free speech, and [on] political advocacy\u201d. Justice department veterans say such claims are factually wrong and threaten the integrity of the legal system. \u201cTrump is deliberately distorting the critical difference between just saying things and actively doing things that have criminal consequences,\u201d said Donald Ayer, a deputy attorney general during George HW Bush\u2019s administration. \u201cObviously, he didn\u2019t just talk about the idea that he won the election. The indictment lists several areas of conduct where he conspired and acted repeatedly to alter the outcome of the legitimate voting process that occurred. For Trump or others to now be claiming there is no difference between the two is to once again undermine the very idea that our society is governed by rules that people are required to follow.\u201d Similarly, ex-federal prosecutors say Trump is playing fast and loose with the facts, and mounting a dangerous defense. \u201cThe indictment highlights how Trump and his co-conspirators relied on speech not just to speak their truth or rally their adherents, but to push hard, behind the scenes, to pressure others into assisting the charged fraud,\u201d said Columbia law professor and former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman. Richman added: \u201cTrump\u2019s supporters likely know all this, but find it politically useful to wave the first amendment banner. It\u2019s more for the crowds than for a courtroom. But the effect is simply to advance the theme of political victimhood, and undermine trust in the judicial process.\u201d Trump and his allies have kept up a drumbeat of free-speech claims that seem politically driven in response to Smith\u2019s charges \u2013 the third criminal indictment of Trump this year. On Monday, Trump and 18 allies were indicted by a Georgia district attorney on 41 counts that included 13 racketeering, perjury and forgery charges against Trump involving his efforts to overturn his loss. At his first post-indictment campaign rally in New Hampshire on 8 August, for instance, Trump invoked free speech again. \u201cThey want to silence me because I will never let them silence you,\u201d he said, referring to a recent motion by prosecutors seeking a protective court order to curb Trump from sharing sensitive information about the case which could result in intimidating witnesses. \u201cThey\u2019re not taking away my first amendment rights,\u201d he told the crowd. The motion by the prosecutors came in the wake of a Truth Social post by Trump warning: \u201cIF YOU GO AFTER ME, I\u2019M COMING AFTER YOU.\u201d Some top Republican House leaders have embraced Trump\u2019s messaging. To boost Trump\u2019s political and legal fortunes post indictment, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking party leader, has echoed Trump\u2019s stance. \u201cTrump had every right under the first amendment to correctly raise concerns about election integrity in 2020,\u201d she has said. Some scholars say that Trump and his allies\u2019 free-speech assertions are dangerous rationales that undermine democratic principles. \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t believe this stuff,\u201d said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard government professor and the co-author of How Democracies Die, referring to Trump\u2019s fallacious free-speech defense. \u201cAuthoritarian behavior has to be legitimized and dressed up. Either justified by an emergency or a major security threat or justified as technically legal.\u201d Trump has continued to distort the detailed evidence in the indictment and to use free speech as a cover for his attacks on critics such as former vice-president Mike Pence, whose grand-jury testimony figured prominently in the indictment of Trump and who is expected to be a witness when the case goes to trial. As the indictment details, Trump tried unsuccessfully to pressure Pence on January 6 to block certifying Biden\u2019s win in Congress, and when Pence balked, Trump exclaimed: \u201cYou\u2019re too honest.\u201d Prosecutors\u2019 motion to get a protective order was spurred by concerns that he might improperly share information about the case, and potentially intimidate witnesses such as Pence, who Trump has condemned as \u201cdelusional\u201d. On Friday, Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the latest federal charges against Trump, held a hearing about the prosecutors\u2019 request. At the hearing, Chutkan said \u201cTrump has [the] right to free speech but that right is not absolute\u201d and that it needs to be balanced with the \u201corderly administration of justice \u2026 If that means he can\u2019t say exactly what he wants to say about witnesses in this case, then that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be.\u201d More broadly, ex-Republican House members are voicing strong concerns about Trump and his allies\u2019 distorted free-speech claims. \u201cTrump has a right under the first amendment to say he was ripped off in the election, even though he was wrong,\u201d said ex-Republican congressman Charlie Dent. \u201cHe does not have a first amendment right to steal an election by pressuring his vice-president to ignore and discount state certified electoral votes, encourage his supporters to storm the Capitol, create a fake elector scheme and intimidate state election officials. He did all this after he exhausted all legitimate legal remedies.\u201d Dent warned: \u201cThose who continue to enable Trump\u2019s flouting of the rule of law and his reckless disregard for the constitutional order are causing too many of our fellow Americans to lose faith in our republic and the democratic institutions that undergird it.\u201d Other ex-Republican members see dangers from Trump and his allies\u2019 tactics. \u201cThe GOP has historically been the law and order party, but I think their new strategy for retaking the House is to exacerbate the narrative that DoJ and the courts are biased and corrupt,\u201d former Republican congressman Dave Trott said. For Harvard\u2019s Levitsky, the real issue is \u201cRepublicans\u2019 acquiescence to authoritarianism. Nobody believes conspiracy to commit a crime is free speech. It\u2019s what they say because they can\u2019t say they support Trump, despite the fact that he is a criminal and an authoritarian.\u201d"

The Guardian contacted Bailey Ross via email and a person who lives at the same address via text message to ask for comment, but received no immediate response. After the request was sent, however, Agartha\u2019s account on the X platform, formerly Twitter, blocked this reporter\u2019s account and was set to private, meaning only existing followers could see its tweets. Bailey Ross registered Agartha Publishing LLC on 1 January 2022, according to South Dakota company records. The company\u2019s website first went live a few months earlier on 17 October 2021, according to the site\u2019s WhoIs records and internet archives. The company\u2019s name is derived from a legendary kingdom located on the inner surface of the Earth, and along with other \u201chollow earth\u201d myths it was a subject of speculation among early 20th-century occultists, including proto-Nazi groups such as the Thule Society. The address Ross used to first register the company matches his residence in 2021 and early 2022, according to information sourced from data brokers. A statement of change filed with South Dakota\u2019s secretary of state on 18 August 2022 recorded a new address: the same one Ross has shared with his fiance since July 2022. Agartha republishes pro-fascist and anti-communist works whose copyright has expired, adding eye-catching cover designs. They include two books by James Strachey Barnes. Barnes was a British fascist who wrote in praise of Mussolini\u2019s Italy and Nazi Germany in the years before the second world war. During the war, which he spent in Italy, he recorded hundreds of propaganda broadcasts promoting the Axis powers and criticizing the Allies. Barnes\u2019s book The Universal Aspects of Fascism promoted the adoption of fascism as a political system beyond Germany and Italy; Agartha publishes Half a Life, and Half a Life Left, which encompass pro-fascist accounts of Italy\u2019s invasions of Albania and Ethiopia. Agartha sells from its own website using Shopify as a payment processor, but also sells books on Amazon outside the US. Its titles were available on country-specific Amazon platforms serving other countries including Australia and the UK, with orders fulfilled using Amazon\u2019s own print-on-demand service. The Guardian contacted Amazon and Shopify for comment. In an email, Ashley Vanicek, an Amazon spokesperson, wrote: \u201cAs a bookseller, we believe that providing access to written speech and a variety of viewpoints is important, including books that some may find objectionable.\u201d She added: \u201cWe have content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale and promptly investigate any book when a concern is raised.\u201d Shopify offered no response. Apart from the website, Agartha uses its X account to promote its books, cross-promote other far-right publishers and interact with white nationalists, including Patrick Casey, the former head of the American Identity Movement (AIM). It is not known whether Bailey Ross is currently a member of any organized white nationalist groups, but materials obtained by the Guardian indicate he was a member of the now-disbanded AIM as late as 2019, having joined its predecessor organization Identity Evropa (IE) in 2017. The materials, provided by a source whose identity is being withheld for reasons of personal safety, include a membership list compiled between 2017 and 2019. Bailey D Ross was listed in the spreadsheet as residing in Portland, Oregon; as using the movement alias Chase Ward; and as being 21, Ross\u2019s age in 2017. The listing also associated Ross with a Protonmail email address and a user name for the online chat platform, Discord, \u201cnord8910\u201d. Until recently, Discord appended a four-number string to the name the user chose at sign-up, creating a unique identifier that would persist even if users changed their screen name, so the user name indicates Ross chose the user name \u201cnord\u201d at sign-up. From 2019, the news collective Unicorn Riot published a succession of contemporaneous leaks from internal communication channels used by IE and AIM. They included Discord archives and screenshots following the group\u2019s migration to another platform, Mattermost. AIM was launched in March 2019 as a rebrand of IE following the initial publication of the group\u2019s leaked chats. IE had been formed three years earlier, and members of the group participated in the deadly Unite the Right (UtR) rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the slogan \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d, which demonstrators chanted at the torch rally and daytime march, was coined in IE. A user in the chats employs a variation on the nord screen name, \u201cnord_or\u201d. IE and AIM required users to identify their state of residence in their screen name in the chats. \u201cOR\u201d is a common abbreviation for Oregon, Ross\u2019s state of residence until October 2020, according to information from data brokers and a current website set up to coordinate his October wedding. Ross\u2019s wedding site also identifies him as \u201ca third-year nursing student at South Dakota State University\u201d. A September 2021 article in the South Dakota newspaper the Brookings Register identified Ross as one of \u201csix military veterans [who] were gifted with a \u2018Quilt of Valor\u2019 from the Brookings chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary\u201d in a ceremony at the city\u2019s South Dakota State University campus. In a paragraph detailing each of the recipients\u2019 service, Ross is identified as a Coast Guard veteran, \u201cnow majoring in nursing and serving as an air force reservist in an aeromedical evacuation squadron\u201d. The Guardian repeatedly attempted to confirm Ross\u2019s service with the air force reserve personnel office, but received no definitive confirmation or denial of Ross\u2019s service before technical sergeant Cory Payne, the office\u2019s public affairs officer, ceased responding to the Guardian\u2019s calls and emails. The Guardian contacted the US Coast Guard, who confirmed Ross had enlisted in the service in August 2014 and concluded his full-time commitment in August 2018, and was obliged to be available as a reservist until 2022. Ross\u2019s Coast Guard service thus overlapped with his active involvement in Identity Evropa. The Guardian left a request for comment with the US Coast Guard public affairs office for the 13th district, which covers the Pacific north-west, but received no immediate response. Agartha\u2019s model of publishing is common across a wide range of far-right publishers that have launched in recent years, many of which Agartha promotes, and is promoted by, on social media. Publishers repackaging public-domain fascist \u201cclassics\u201d include DVX Publishing, ExpatPress, and publishers with no website or online infrastructure of their own, such as Caribbean Thule and Rogue Scholar Press. The most established far-right publishers employing this model include Arktos, now based in Budapest, and Antelope Hill, whose principals were identified a year ago as married couple Vincent and Sarah Cucciara, along with Dmitri Loutsik, all based in Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh valley. Hannah Gais, a senior researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center, wrote that \u201cbook publishing can offer white power groups a consistent fundraising stream that they can channel to other activities, such as in-person organizing\u201d, pointing to Antelope Hill\u2019s \u201cclose ties to the pro-Hitler National Justice party\u201d."

            "title": "US and Beijing spar over shipwreck-turned-military outpost",
            "date": "2023-08-09T07:47:16Z",
            "content": "An international row is growing between the Philippines, the US and China over a rusting ship that has been turned into a crucial military outpost in the South China Sea. The dilapidated second world war-era ship was deliberately run aground on a tiny reef in the South China Sea in 1999 by the Philippines, and a small contingent of troops continue to stay on board to stake the country\u2019s claim in the highly disputed water. The strategically important South China Sea is subject to competing territorial claims by China and south-east Asian countries, and is considered a potential flashpoint. Tensions have intensified under the current Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, with the country increasingly accusing China of aggression and pursuing closer ties with the US, with which it has a mutual defence treaty. On Saturday, China provoked condemnation from the Philippines, the US, the EU, France, Japan and Australia after its coastguard directed water cannon at a Philippine coastguard vessel. The Philippines was trying to deliver food, water, fuel and other supplies to its troops stationed in the grounded ship, the BRP Sierra Madre, on Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands. China has since repeated its demands for the rusting ship to be removed, while China\u2019s embassy in Manila has accused Washington of \u201cinciting and supporting the Philippines attempts to overhaul and reinforce\u201d BRP Sierra Madre, and of rallying its allies \u201cto persistently sensationalise the South China Sea issue\u201d. \u201cI would also like to stress that the South China Sea is not a hunting ground for countries outside the region to meddle with, sow discord and provoke conflicts,\u201d the embassy said. Its foreign ministry also accused the US of threatening China with its mutual defence treaty with the Philippines. \u201cThe US has been brazenly bolstering the Philippines as it infringes upon China\u2019s sovereignty but those moves will not succeed,\u201d a ministry spokesperson said. The US, while not a claimant in the dispute, considers the South China Sea crucial to its national interests, and has a mutual defence treaty with the Philippines. On Tuesday, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, underlined the \u201cironclad nature of the US-Philippines alliance\u201d in a call with his counterpart, the Philippine secretary of national defence, Gilberto Teodoro Jr. Austin reaffirmed that the treaty between the two countries \u2013 under which the US would defend the Philippines if its public vessels and forces were subjected to an armed attack \u2013 extended to those of the coastguard in the South China Sea. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, including Second Thomas Shoal, the submerged reef where the Sierra Madre is run aground, though its sweeping claims were found to have no legal basis by an international tribunal in The Hague in 2016. China\u2019s foreign ministry on Tuesday repeated its rejections of the ruling. \u201cThe South China Sea arbitration was a pure political drama staged in the name of the law with the US pulling strings behind the scenes,\u201d it said. Manila has frequently accused the Chinese coastguard of blocking its resupply missions to its troops on the Sierra Madre. In February the Philippine coastguard accused its Chinese counterpart of directing a \u201cmilitary grade\u201d laser at one of its vessels as it tried to support a navy mission to bring food and supplies to its troops at Second Thomas Shoal, known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines, and which lies within the country\u2019s exclusive economic zone. Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China\u2019s ministry of national defence said on Tuesday its coastguard had blocked the Philippine ship \u201cin accordance with the law and took warning law enforcement measures\u201d. Analysts have said Chinese authorities have historically differentiated between Philippine attempts to resupply to ship with humanitarian goods, and with construction or military materials. The Chinese ministry suggested it had targeted only Philippine ships carrying construction materials to the Sierra Madre. China has said the latest water cannon incident was a \u201cwarning\u201d and that it had exercised \u201crational restraint\u201d at all times. It has also reiterated its demands for the Philippines to tow away the grounded Sierra Madre, saying the Philippines has previously promised to remove it \u2013 a claim denied by officials in Manila. The Philippine foreign ministry said the \u201cpermanent station\u201d on Second Thomas Shoal was in response to China\u2019s \u201cillegal occupation\u201d of nearby Mischief Reef in 1995. \u201cThe deployment of a Philippine military station in its own areas of jurisdiction is an inherent right of the Philippines and does not violate any laws,\u201d it added. The Philippines national security council spokesperson, Jonathan Malaya, said the country would \u201cnever abandon Ayungin Shoal\u201d. Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."

            "title": "Revealed: neo-Nazi active club counts several of US military as members",
            "date": "2023-08-14T10:00:13Z",
            "content": "A neo-Nazi \u201cactive club\u201d counts several current and former members of the United States military as its members, the Guardian has learned, including a lance corporal machine gunner currently in detention on insubordination charges and a former US Marine Corps staff sergeant who was booted from the service for stealing large quantities of ammunition. Lance corporal machine gunner Mohammed Wadaa and former Marine Corps staff sergeant Gunnar Naughton are part of the Clockwork Crew, California\u2019s first \u201cactive club\u201d, according to the group\u2019s own internal research records and social media posts, as well as law enforcement sources. Active clubs \u2013 white nationalists and neo-fascist fight clubs that train in combat sports \u2013 are a growing concern for US law enforcement. Their recruitment among active and former members of the military underscores both the broadening appeal of the fitness-centric organising model and the American armed services\u2019 persistent struggle with extremism within the ranks. The Clockwork Crew, formerly known as Crew 562 (the area code for Long Beach, California), was founded in 2021 and counts roughly a dozen members, researchers say. The group has considerable overlap with other California active clubs, as well as with the Golden State Skinheads, a more \u201ctraditional\u201d skinhead gang of whom some members stabbed several anti-fascist protesters at a chaotic 2016 clash outside the state capitol in Sacramento. Clockwork Crew\u2019s reach also briefly extended to eastern Europe: Juraj Mesi\u0107, a Croatian neo-Nazi, headed an eight-person chapter in that country before being arrested in March for racist abuse of an immigrant worker, according to news reports and internal chats. Researchers say Clockwork Crew stands out because of its members\u2019 willingness to engage in public confrontations and the key roles played by active-duty and veterans of the armed forces. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a more aggressive, more hostile far right,\u201d said Jeff Tischauser, a senior researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). \u201cGroups like the Clockwork Crew are more willing to take their hatred into public spaces and shout people down outside of synagogues and in communities they perceive as predominantly Jewish.\u201d Last year, the SPLC listed the Clockwork Crew as a designated hate group over the participation of some members in a 2022 hate march by the Goyim Defense League, an antisemitic hate group, and another episode that spring when some Clockwork Crew members drove through San Diego and harangued passersby from a van draped in white nationalist propaganda. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to recreate the cell-based, ready-made force that RAM had where five to 20 people can go out and intimidate people with propaganda, flyer-ing, and highly aggressive posturing,\u201d said Tischauser, referring to the Rise Above Movement, the now-defunct street-fighting neo-Nazi crew whose members have been targeted by federal authorities for participating in street violence against political opponents in California and Virginia during the presidency of Donald Trump. The Clockwork Crew was co-founded by Mohammed Wadaa, a lance corporal with the 3rd battalion, 5th regiment of the 1st United States Marine Corps division out of Camp Pendleton, the Marine Corps base just north of San Diego and one of the largest in the country. Photographs from Wadaa\u2019s Telegram posts show he lives on base in Camp Pendleton in a room adorned with a poster of Adolf Hitler. A 25-year-old from Oregon who has been in the Marine Corps since at least 2018, Wadaa has claimed one of his ancestors fought alongside the Nazis in the Handschar Division, an SS unit made up of Bosnian and Croatian volunteers to suppress anti-fascist partisans in the former Yugoslavia. Wadaa has participated in the Clockwork Crew\u2019s banner drops and sticker campaigns, and has taken part in marches with members of other hate groups, including the Goyim Defense League. Wadaa is currently under court martial for disobeying Marine Corps general orders prohibiting advocating extremist ideology and having extremist tattoos, the military branch confirmed. He entered a guilty plea on 27 July. He was sentenced to 11 months in the brig, a reduction in rank to private, and will be given a bad conduct discharge, according to court records and a Marine Corps spokesperson. Wadaa co-founded Clockwork Crew with Nicholas Daniel Large. Wadaa and Large met through the Church of Aryanity, a neo-Nazi cult, and at first intended to create a west coast chapter of the group, per communications unearthed by the Southern California Research Club, an independent research cooperative monitoring far-right extremism in southern California. Large works mostly as a propagandist, creating Clockwork Crew\u2019s insignia, including stock Neo-Nazi iconography, and plastering cities in Orange and Los Angeles counties with hateful stickers. Large also has made death threats against the California state senator Scott Wiener. The duo have drawn recruits from the broader far-right community, in particular the west coast chapters of the \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d network, another hate group affiliated with the broader \u201cactive club\u201d nationalist movement. But Clockwork Crew has also made targeted efforts to recruit from within the military and the veterans community. Among those recruits was Gunnar Naughton, a Kansas native and erstwhile civil war re-enactor who served in the Marine Corps\u2019 1st Reconnaissance battalion as a sergeant until military authorities caught him and five other Marines stealing more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition and several grenades from a weapons depot at Camp Pendleton in the winter of 2021. Naughton pled guilty to charges related to the theft in July 2021 and was dismissed from the Marine Corps after being demoted to Private. At his sentencing, Naughton claimed he was bullied by other Marines in 1st Recon and pressured into taking part in the ammunition theft. Naughton first appeared in Clockwork Crew\u2019s circles the following year, in July 2022. A month later, he used volunteer work in eastern Kentucky following lethal flooding there as an opportunity to spread white nationalist propaganda and proselytize for the group, according to posts to Clockwork Crew\u2019s Telegram channel. Ezra Liel, a 22-year-old from the central valley town of Turlock, who enlisted in the Army National Guard in 2021, is another Clockwork Crew member, according to his own social media history, photographs of his neo-Nazi tattoos posted to the group\u2019s public channel and information obtained by the Southern California Research Club. In Telegram group chats with members of other violent neo-fascist groups, including the Base, Liel has claimed he was once affiliated with the Atomwaffen Division, a defunct guerilla group involved in five murders and at least two bomb plots. Liel has also posted photos of himself in a US army uniform toting a machine gun, as well as bare-chested snaps of his Black Sun and Valknut tattoos, both widely used amongst fascists. \u201cI am an NCO [non-commissioned officer] and officers and lower enlisted decided to launch an investigation into me and essentially try to cancel me,\u201d Liel wrote on 25 January 2023. Photographs obtained by the Southern California Research Club show Liel participated in a Goyim Defense League march in Los Angeles and public training sessions publicised by Clockwork Crew on their Telegram account. In other posts, Liel describes himself as an \u201copen supporter of Azov\u201d, the far-right Ukrainian social movement and volunteer regiment. Elsewhere, Liel mulls over volunteering for combat in Ukraine and discusses logistics about travel and enlisting in the Ukrainian military with other neo-Nazis. Another member, social media sources show, is Jayde Milne, a former member of the Marine Corps reserve from Orange county who currently lives in the coastal city of Oxnard. Milne, who has been dipping in and out of the skinhead scene in California, was released from the Marine Corps reserve in 2020 and often refers to his military experience in group chats. Milne appears in the earliest propaganda video shot by Clockwork Crew in 2021. Several members of the Golden State Skinheads have also turned up in Clockwork Crew\u2019s internal communications, including John Gahagan, a Fresno resident from a family immersed in California\u2019s white supremacist culture, Jonathan Court, a Golden State Skinhead who is also a recruiter for the Asatru Folk Assembly, a neo-Nazi pagan group, and Will Planer, a Golden State Skinhead who was convicted of felony assault for knocking a counter protester unconscious with a pole at the 2016 Sacramento melee. Wadaa, Large, Naughton, Liel, Gahagan, Milne, Court and Planer did not respond to a request for comment. Far-right extremists have long been a problem in the modern US military, from race riots and Ku Klux Klan demonstrations on bases during the Vietnam war through Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh\u2019s troubled service in the army\u2019s First Infantry division. The Marine Corps is no exception, with dozens of members brought up on disciplinary charges related to far-right views and actions in recent years. Last month, the Boston Globe found at least 82 current and former military service members immersed in far-right ideology were arrested over the past five years. This month, the Globe documented the involvement of at least 10 army and marine veterans in NSC-131, a growing New England white nationalist street-fighting group with connections to Patriot Front and other active clubs \u2013 including the Clockwork Crew. To this day, commanders and military judges struggle with how to address radicalization in the ranks. Since Joe Biden took office, the Department of Defense has taken public steps to recognize that far-right radicalization is having a major impact on rank and file discipline. In a February 2021 address to the military, Lloyd Austin, the defense secretary, condemned rightwing extremism as \u201cviews and conduct that run counter to everything we believe in and can actually tear at the fabric of who we are as an institution\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this before \u2013 I\u2019ve lived through it as a soldier and as a commander,\u201d Austin said in his remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s not new to our country and sadly, it\u2019s not new to our military.\u201d However, the changes since put in place have not been evaluated and have been criticised for being insufficiently rigorous. Meanwhile, hard-right politicians like the Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville have attacked efforts seeking to root out white nationalists. Kris Goldsmith, an army veteran who researches far-right extremism in the military and veteran community, said that veterans and active duty soldiers are targeted by far-right groups as a guaranteed way to lend credibility to those organizations. \u201cPeople who are in the military, who\u2019ve served in the military, are team players and valuable members of teams,\u201d Goldsmith said. \u201cWe are mission oriented, and a veteran\u2019s involvement lends status to organisations we join that can influence civilians in ways that other demographic groups cannot.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-23T16:13:40Z",
            "content": "A Russian military helicopter has landed in Ukraine, reportedly after the pilot was convinced to defect in a six-month intelligence operation. A Russian military blogger said a helicopter had crossed the border with three people on board \u201ca couple of weeks ago\u201d, but claimed the aircraft had lost its way. The twin-engine Mi-8 AMTSh was on a flight between two airbases, transporting parts for Su-27 and Su-30 fighter jets, Ukrainska Pravda newspaper reported, citing defence intelligence sources. The pilot\u2019s family had already been moved to Ukraine as part of the defection operation and he would join them, it said. Both crew members were killed, the Russian blogger and Ukrainian reports said. A spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence appeared to confirm that the aircraft had landed in Ukraine, but in line with government reticence about intelligence operations, did not give any details. \u201cThere will be official information. We need to wait a little bit \u2013 we are working on it, including with the crew,\u201d said Andriy Yusov told state television. The news about a possible pilot defection came days after a drone attack destroyed a supersonic Russian bomber on an airfield hundreds of kilometres from Ukraine. Russia\u2019s airforce has been among the most destructive parts of its war machine, even though it has not been able to take control of the skies over Ukraine. Russian jets and helicopters launch missiles and unguided bombs at civilian targets, and the support they provide to frontline troops has made it harder for Ukrainian forces mounting a counteroffensive to push through Russian defences. Since the start of the war, Ukraine has pressed western allies to provide better air defences and aircraft to protect the country. That campaign culminated in a pledge of dozens of F-16 fighter jets from Denmark and the Netherlands earlier this week. The planes will be handed over in tranches after pilot training has been satisfactorily completed, but because the new crews have to improve their English before learning to fly and maintain the jets, that will not happen until well into next year. Ukraine\u2019s small air force is currently made up of Soviet-standard planes that can run only a dozen or so low-risk combat missions a day because they are outnumbered by their Russian equivalents. Although Moscow uses its own jets relatively conservatively in frontline areas, the size of its air force means it poses a far greater threat. In the context of Russia\u2019s large fleet, the defection of a highly trained pilot \u2013 after a successful Ukrainian intelligence mission \u2013 would be a more significant military blow than the loss of a single helicopter through crew error. The cross-border flight was presented as an accident by Russian blogger Fighterbomber, who runs a Telegram channel with close links to Russia\u2019s air force. \u201cThe crew, for some reason, lost their bearings and crossed the border,\u201d he said, confirming that the image circulating in Ukrainian media was that of the missing Mi-8. \u201cRealising where they landed, they made an attempt to take off, but were shot while the helicopter was on the ground. Presumably, two board members died and the commander was taken hostage.\u201d In a follow-up post, he dismissed claims the pilot\u2019s family was in Ukraine, claiming to be in contact with relatives of all crew members."

            "date": "2023-08-11T19:08:18Z",
            "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has announced the dismissal of all the heads of Ukraine\u2019s regional military recruitment centres in the latest drive to root out corruption after officials were accused of taking bribes from those seeking to avoid the frontlines. At a time when the country\u2019s army is in need of new recruits, Ukraine\u2019s president described the taking of cash from people who wanted to avoid conscription while others suffered as a form of treachery. \u201cThis system should be run by people who know exactly what war is and why cynicism and bribery during war is treason,\u201d he said in a video statement. \u201cInstead, soldiers who have experienced the front or who cannot be in the trenches because they have lost their health, lost their limbs, but have preserved their dignity and do not have cynicism, are the ones who can be entrusted with this system of recruitment.\u201d Zelenskiy, who was elected in 2019 on a promise that he would clear up the country\u2019s endemic corruption, has in recent months sought to personally and publicly challenge such practices. In January, he dismissed a minister, Vasyl Lozynsky, who was accused of embezzlement, and some within his closest circle departed the government. Last week he also decried the \u201crevolting practices\u201d of some involved in military recruitment after an official in the southern region of Odesa was inexplicably found to have acquired $5m in savings and a property in Spain. There are 112 criminal proceedings ongoing against officials of military enlistment offices. Zelenskiy said that there was evidence that \u201csome took cash, some took cryptocurrency\u201d. \u201cThe cynicism is the same everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIllicit enrichment, legalisation of illegally obtained funds, unlawful benefit, illegal transfer of persons liable for military service across the border.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s commander-in-chief, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, has been ordered by Zelenskiy to hire new heads of the territorial recruitment centres, with applicants facing checks from the security service. \u201cEvery \u2018military commissar\u2019 who is subject to criminal proceedings will be held accountable,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cIt is quite fair. Full responsibility. The dismissed \u2018military commissars\u2019 and other officials who have shoulder straps and in respect of whom no evidence of crimes or violations has been found, if they want to keep their shoulder straps and prove their worthiness should go to the front.\u201d Zelenskiy did not mention a further case of alleged corruption reported in the Ukrainian media involving the ministry of defence. According to documents seen by the investigative news website ZN.ua, the ministry of defence overpaid for summer camouflage kit bought from Turkey as winter coats for the troops. It was claimed that a total of 4,900 jackets that should have cost $142,000 were bought for $421,000. The difference between the two prices was said to have remained with the Turkish firm that supplied the goods owned by a Ukrainian from the southern city of Zaporizhzhia. The ministry of defence has denied overpaying for the clothing. In June, an investigation had been launched by Ukraine\u2019s security services into Vyacheslav Shapovalov, a former deputy minister of defence, and Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, a former head of the department of state procurement in the defence ministry, into the purchase of low-quality winter clothing from outside the country. It is unclear whether the two cases are connected. Shapovalov and Khmelnytskyi have denied any wrongdoing. The corruption scandals have emerged as Ukrainian forces are coming under growing pressure from a Russian advance in the east of the Kharkiv region, in the north-east of the country. The Russian defence ministry claimed on Telegram that 20 Ukrainian soldiers had also been killed in attacks in the Kherson oblast in the south. An eight-year-old was killed after a Russian missile struck a house in western Ukraine\u2019s Ivano-Frankivsk region, about 60 miles from the Polish border, according to the office of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general. Two civilians, a woman and a 44-year-old man, were also said by Ukrainian officials to have been killed in a drone strike in the city of Beryslav in Kherson oblast. The regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said on Telegram that a 53-year-old man had also been killed in the shelling of a high-rise building in the city of Kherson earlier on Friday. Kyiv came under attack on Friday with residents being woken up by four enormous explosions that could be heard across the capital as the city\u2019s air defence systems shot down Russian ballistic missiles. The city\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, posted on Telegram: \u201cIn addition to the debris of the rocket that fell on the territory of one of the capital\u2019s children\u2019s hospitals, two more crash sites were found in the Obolon district of Kyiv. The roof of a private house was damaged on Bogatyrska Street. Also in Obolon, a wreck was discovered in an open area in one of the summer cooperatives. There are no casualties.\u201d An open-source project run jointly by the BBC Russian service and the Mediazona website on Friday confirmed the deaths of more than 30,000 Russian service personnel in the war in Ukraine. Using publicly available data, including online obituaries, newspaper articles and photographs on tombstones, the Russian journalist collective identifies and lists the deaths by region, military unit and age. \u201cThe actual death toll is significantly higher,\u201d Mediazona said on its website. On Friday night the White House said it was open to training Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 fighter jets in the US if capacity for such training is reached in Europe. The White House spokesperson John Kirby, speaking to reporters, said Washington is eager to move forward with the training."

Around 140,000 people died in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and 74,000 in Nagasaki three days later, when the United States dropped atomic bombs on the two Japanese cities days before the end of World War II. \u201cJapan, as the only nation to have suffered atomic bombings in war, will continue efforts towards a nuclear-free world,\u201d said Fumio Kishida at a ceremony in Hiroshima on Sunday. \u201cThe path towards it is becoming increasingly difficult because of deepening divisions in the international community over nuclear disarmament and Russia\u2019s nuclear threat.\u201d Speaking at the ceremonies, the Hiroshima mayor urged the abolition of nuclear weapons and called the G7 leaders\u2019 notion of nuclear deterrence a \u201cfolly\u201d. On Sunday a peace bell tolled at 8.15am, the time the bomb was dropped. About 50,000 participants in the outdoor memorial ceremony including ageing survivors observed a moment of silence, with the summer heat hitting 30C (86F). The day to commemorate the victims of the world\u2019s first nuclear attack comes as Russian officials have talked about using nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. Western authorities have said there is no evidence of Russia preparing such an attack. \u201cLeaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory,\u201d said the Hiroshima mayor, Kazumi Matsui. The ceremony was also attended by Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, who said the road to a world without nuclear weapons was getting steeper due in part to Russia\u2019s nuclear threats, but this made it all the more important to bring back international momentum towards that goal. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, expressed his support. \u201cWorld leaders have visited this city, seen its monuments, spoken with its brave survivors, and emerged emboldened to take up the cause of nuclear disarmament,\u201d he said in remarks read by a UN representative. \u201cMore should do so, because the drums of nuclear war are beating once again.\u201d The bomb dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, nicknamed Little Boy, killed thousands instantly and about 140,000 by the end of the year. Japan surrendered on 15 August. With Reuters and AFP"

Coercive pronatalism \u2013 pressures to compel women to have more children \u2013 inspired by nationalism, xenophobia, militarism or market fundamentalism is at an all-time high, and is a threat to reproductive rights everywhere. The decline in fertility rates is cause for celebration because it represents greater gender equality and greater reproductive autonomy in countries where it occurring. This is a distant reality for the more than 250 million girls and women who do not have access to education, autonomy or reproductive health care services in order to decide whether and when to have children. A globally unified effort to elevate reproductive rights, not squash them for ideological agendas, is what is urgently needed. In addition, the billions of dollars going towards such coercive pronatalist policies would be better used towards climate mitigation efforts, rewilding, supporting an aging population and assisting the more than 1 billion people expected to become climate refugees in the coming decades. On a planet facing numerous ecological and social catastrophes, bemoaning a decline in national fertility rates is a reprehensible distraction. Nandita Bajaj, executive director, Population Balance Toronto, Canada Level playing field?

These are the massive financial rewards for failure given to clubs relegated from the Premier League.

Dave Pollard Leicester Don\u2019t diss daughters As the mother of three brilliant, feisty and intelligent girls aged 14, 12 and 10, I entirely relate to and agree with Joanna Moorhead (\u201cThree daughters and no sons isn\u2019t a bad omen. I should know, I had four\u201d, Comment). I and my husband were also told (or it was implied) that we should be disappointed to have girls. Repeatedly. By the time I was pregnant with my third, the questioning about whether I wanted a boy was off the scale. I once counted 26 such questions in a single morning. My husband was told he would have to find a hobby while we \u201cladies\u201d went shopping, that it would be all pink and no football, that they would be impossible teenagers (they aren\u2019t) but that at least he would \u201chave someone took look after him\u201d, among other choice comments. In short, there has been a constant cultural drumbeat that daughters are second rate, even if this is often presented as a joke. Around this time Zoe Williams, who had just had her son, joked in an article, that even she couldn\u2019t find an issue with the patriarchy connected to having her baby. I remember thinking: you wouldn\u2019t think that if you had had a girl, let alone two or three. The misogynist \u201cjealousy\u201d hypothesis advanced by the researchers (to explain why mothers of three girls were slightly more likely to have lower wellbeing) simply didn\u2019t resonate with me either. Rather than the mothers having an outdated preference for boys as the researcher suggested, it seemed to me the researchers themselves reached for an outdated stereotype and assumption to explain their research findings, and one that tallies with the barrage of negative attitudes that mothers of three girls face. Perhaps the constant battle from day one against patriarchal assumptions that is waged by mothers of three girls is the explanation for the dip in wellbeing that some mothers face? I know at times I have found that exhausting and demoralising, rather than my amazing, adored daughters. Maddy Shaw London N5 My grandfather was a farmer and hoped to have a son to help him on the farm. After seven daughters they gave up. It worked out well for a number of reasons, not the least of which was when the daughters matured, young men would come courting and want to impress the old man. They became enthusiastic farm workers. Andrew Warford Coupeville, Washington, US GPs aren\u2019t miracle workers The NHS has become a false religion in this country that is obscuring dreadful suffering (\u201cMy live fast, die young youth was fun, but I don\u2019t expect the NHS to pick up the pieces\u201d, Comment). The NHS encourages abdication of responsibility where the entire focus of a consultation appears to be what the doctor will do to \u201cfix\u201d a situation. Several of my colleagues in hospital and fellow GPs have given up trying to engage politely with the subject of smoking, obesity and excessive alcohol consumption because it triggers complaints as people take \u201coffence\u201d when instructed to take responsibility for their health. Consultations have become \u201ceggshell consultations\u201d where doctors cannot engage frankly for fear of repercussions for their careers. I am a full-time GP who has seen vexatious patient complaints put strain on fellow doctors\u2019 marriages and sometimes cause so much stress that doctors go off sick. The NHS with its fake promises has created a hedonistic society that wants doctors to work miracles when people do not want to accept personal responsibility. Dr Zishan Syed Maidstone, Kent America\u2019s fundamental flaw Jill Abramson points to the fact that the US founders \u201cintended the judicial branch of the federal government to be insulated from politics\u201d (\u201cTrump\u2019s assault on American justice gives inspiration to authoritarians everywhere\u201d, Comment). While the US constitution is, in all other respects, an impeccable blueprint for democratic governance, one cannot but wonder why, when drafting article 2 (giving the president the power \u201cwith the advice and consent of Senate\u201d to appoint supreme court judges), those founders failed to recognise the fundamental flaw in their objective: the politicisation of the judiciary. The dissenting judges in the recent overturning of Roe v Wade, wringing their hands \u201cbecause the composition of this court has changed\u201d, are doubtless even more dejected by the fact that the founders\u2019 intention to insulate the judiciary from politics by determining that appointments are for life, has now saddled them, and the nation, with a staunchly conservative majority for the foreseeable future. Martin Allen Shoreham, West Sussex UN peacekeeping: a warning Luke Taylor\u2019s article, \u201cKenya\u2019s offer to send police to Haiti sparks human rights concerns\u201d (World), raises the question: will the UN be sent into a new operation that is doomed to failure? I served with the UN Civilian Police Mission in Haiti from 1998 to 2000. While civilian police have been a traditional element of UN peacekeeping, it is a relatively new development to have missions based on civilian police, rather than military. Some member states have seen armed civilian police as the acceptable and least costly option between doing nothing and deploying military contingents. Such perceptions carry the risk of civilian police being deployed in situations and given tasks for which they may not be equipped. Unrealistic and impractical mandates are recipes for failure and risk compounding the very problems that they are intended to resolve. Moreover, to be effective, peacekeeping should be part of a coherent political framework for conflict resolution. A broad strategy for peace in Haiti requires a responsible political class and leaders who can articulate the will of the communities they represent. In the Haitian context, it is especially important to learn the lessons of the recent past, and to recognise what UN civilian police operations can do and what lies beyond their power.

The vast majority of annual UK immigrants come here for work or study or are admitted on humanitarian schemes, such as those for Afghan, Ukrainian or Hong Kong citizens, set up and sponsored by the government itself. According to the Home Office\u2019s own figures, small boat arrivals accounted for just 40,000 asylum claims in 2022 \u2013 fewer than half the number of people who claimed asylum in total, and negligible in comparison with the overall 600,000-plus immigration total for the year. Government focus on small boat arrivals is a deliberately cruel and naked ploy to stir up the Tory right and distract public attention from its abject and life-threatening failures on the economy, NHS, cost of living, housing and education. It should be called out for engendering racism and xenophobia, and the figures publicly set against the far, far larger numbers of those absorbed completely uncontroversially by the UK every year. Small boat arrivals are not a threat, still less the \u201cinvasion\u201d claimed by Suella Braverman. Don Keller London N15 Britain has had its chips Having spent my entire working life in semiconductors for huge multinational companies and small startups, I can tell you that the idea of the UK having an independent strategy to attract investment in this segment is nothing short of ludicrous (\u201cCan Britain create a chip industry worth its salt?\u201d, Business). The government should not invest a penny in semiconductors, as there is no way to get a reasonable return; it is too late. That fight has been fought and the UK was not even involved. If we were still in the EU, there might be a path forward but for today we should focus our investments in areas where we have a chance to win. There are lots of other investment candidates, AI and CRISPR being two in which the UK has at least some momentum. But, honestly, the environment in the UK today is not really conducive to wins in these either, as the government is entirely focused on Sunak\u2019s five short-term pledges and the fallout from not being able to meet them. Simon Prutton Winchester, Hampshire Proud to be a trans ally In reference to Isabel Hardman\u2019s article (\u201cIt took female MPs from both parties to change Starmer\u2019s stance on gender politics\u201d, Comment), my guess is that Keir Starmer and others in the Labour leadership realise that the Labour Women\u2019s Declaration and the \u201cgender criticals\u201d do not speak for the vast majority of female party members or voters. They do not speak for this middle-aged woman who\u2019s proud to be a trans ally and is not afraid of her trans sisters and brothers.

Maybe the opposite is true. People who actually read the labels on these products notice that they are often over-priced, over-processed and surprisingly low in protein (jackfruit, for example, has a minute 1.8g of protein per 100g, compared with 19g for chickpeas) and have probably realised it\u2019s healthier and cheaper to cook from scratch. I\u2019d rather cook one of Nigel Slater\u2019s recipes than a Beyond burger any day! Liz Haigh Heath, Cardiff Put empty offices to good use Last week\u2019s article on office v home working fascinated me, as a (retired) learning and development manager (\u201cBritain has felt the shift to home working more than most countries\u201d, Focus). The social context for coaching and acquiring skills is so important. I was also appalled at the thought of all that expensive empty office space in city centres. Perhaps some deals could be brokered between charities and private sector businesses for \u201cfriendship Fridays\u201d, when the charity could use the offices for staff meetings or centralised training. Identification with an organisation that improves lives or the environment might help provide the sense of purpose many employees crave. A skill-sharing arrangement, with new/inexperienced staff working on a useful project for the charity, could also be of mutual benefit. Dee Stephens Wareham, Dorset Time to tax the rich is now Will Hutton paints a grim picture of the state of Britain\u2019s public finances and the way they have deteriorated over the last 20 years, but he makes no mention of the large increase in private wealth that has happened at the same time, including the emergence of many billionaires (\u201cLet\u2019s stop kidding ourselves we\u2019re a rich nation and get real\u2026 we\u2019ve gone bust\u201d, Comment). When it is difficult for many in full-time work to adequately feed and house themselves and their families, it is surely legitimate to ask what role properly targeted taxes on land, property, inheritance and windfall profits can contribute to solving the nation\u2019s problems.

Throughout the history of music, improvisation has been a valued skill and it would appear not to be taught these days. Kennedy\u2019s cri de coeur for equitable funding in music barely scratched the surface of the problem facing the arts, which is the sheer incompetence and mismanagement by Arts Council England (ACE) and its relationship with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

It is a very aggressive insect that defends its nest with terrifying ferocity when it is disturbed, inflicting multiple stings that can lead to hospitalisation and sometimes death.

            "date": "2023-08-17T15:00:57Z",
            "content": "Sweden has raised its terrorist threat level to the second-highest number possible, as the prime minister said the country had thwarted planned attacks. The move comes amid heightened security fears following a string of Qur\u2019an burnings that have caused outrage around the world. Raising the threat level from three, meaning \u201cheightened threat\u201d, to four, \u201chigh threat\u201d, on the five-point scale, the Swedish security service (S\u00e4po) said that in recent months Sweden had shifted from a \u201clegitimate\u201d to a \u201cprioritised\u201d target for acts of terror. It is the first time since 2016 that the country has changed its threat level to four. Making the announcement on Thursday in Stockholm, Charlotte von Essen, the director general of S\u00e4po, said that Sweden was becoming an \u201cincreased focus\u201d for Islamic extremists. She said the change in terror threat was a strategic and long-term move, not linked to one particular incident. However, she said disinformation campaigns painting Sweden as an Islamophobic country had contributed to the increased threat. Later on Thursday, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said Swedish agencies had already averted planned terror attacks. Speaking alongside von Essen, the justice minister Gunnar Str\u00f6mmer and police chief Anders Thornberg, Kristersson said Qur\u2019an burnings in Sweden had contributed to the heightened terror threat. Another factor, he added, was the attempted murder of an employee of the Swedish consulate in \u0130zmir, Turkey. \u201cOur authorities, not least S\u00e4po and the police, work hard to guarantee safety in Sweden. We know that planned terrorist acts have been prevented,\u201d he said. He announced that he had convened the national security council and said the government would be updating parliament on the situation. \u201cProtecting the safety and security of all citizens is the government\u2019s most important task,\u201d he added. Swedish security services were \u201cproactive and on their toes\u201d, he said, monitoring social media and working closely with each other and international partners. Asked if the Sweden Democrats, the far-right party his minority coalition depends on, had contributed to the international perception that Sweden was Islamophobic, he said that while the country\u2019s laws of freedom still applied, some Swedes should \u201creconsider how you express yourself\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is no reason to intentionally offend someone else, because it actually risks threatening Sweden. Calm and realising the seriousness of the situation is my message.\u201d Addressing future planned Qur\u2019an burnings, he said the government was looking at its public order laws, but also cautioned: \u201cEverything that is legal isn\u2019t [necessarily] appropriate.\u201d Von Essen said: \u201cThe threat posed to Sweden has changed gradually, and the attack threat posed by violent Islamist actors has increased in the past year. Sweden has gone from being considered a legitimate target for terrorist attacks to being considered a prioritised target. In our assessment, this threat will remain for a long time, and I have therefore decided to raise the terrorist threat level.\u201d She added: \u201cGovernment agencies and other societal actors must continue to take measures to prevent and reduce the threat of terrorist attacks in Sweden, and it is important to create the conditions needed to maintain these efforts over time. By doing this, we make Sweden a safer place.\u201d She told Swedish people to live as normal but that it was important to stay informed. It comes after the UK changed its travel recommendations on Sunday, with the Foreign Office warning visitors: \u201cTerrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Sweden. You should maintain a high level of vigilance in public spaces.\u201d Security issues have dominated public discussion in recent weeks after Kristersson warned that the country\u2019s freedom of expression laws were being exploited by outsiders to spread \u201chateful messages\u201d. The string of Qur\u2019an burning protests, which under Sweden\u2019s exceptionally liberal freedom of expression laws are legal, have prompted a domestic debate about whether there should be limits to such laws among those who consider their actions hate crimes. The government has ruled out changing expression of laws but has said it was considering changing public order laws to enable police to stop Qur\u2019an burnings if they posed a national security threat. At the end of July, S\u00e4po said it was handling attack threats against \u201cSweden and Swedish interests on an ongoing basis\u201d and that the desecration of holy scriptures could have a \u201cthreat-inducing effect\u201d. While it said then that events had worsened the country\u2019s security, the threat level remained at three."

            "date": "2023-08-03T12:00:43Z",
            "content": "Unions representing more than 85,000 healthcare workers have held pickets at 50 facilities across California, Washington, Oregon and Colorado amid new contract negotiations as their current union contracts are set to expire on 30 September. The negotiations at Kaiser Permanente are the third largest set of contract negotiations in the US in 2023, behind the 340,000 workers at UPS who will be voting on a tentative agreement this month that was reached days before planned strike action, and 150,000 autoworkers at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis whose contracts are set to expire on 14 September. The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions represents workers in seven states and Washington DC. The coalition said that in a recent bargaining session, Kaiser Permanente claimed workers at the non-profit \u201cmake too much money\u201d while the CEO is paid a salary of $16m a year. Workers fighting for a new contract have criticized Kaiser Permanente over chronic understaffing, high workloads that worsened during the Covid-19 pandemic and lagging wages as the cost of living and inflation has risen substantially in recent years. Trayvonne Ross, a senior food service worker at Zion medical center in San Diego, California, for three years, claimed his department was understaffed and had trouble retaining workers due to low pay and the high cost of living in the area. He said the understaffing affects patients who aren\u2019t able to receive their meals on time, often having to wait for hours while Ross and his co-workers have to do the work of two to three people to try to keep up. \u201cI\u2019m struggling,\u201d said Ross, who is applying for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the federal food assistance program, for his family. \u201cCurrently, I live in just a one-bedroom apartment with me, my wife and three kids just to be able to live close to where I work,\u201d said Ross. \u201cI know that Kaiser is making a whole lot of money and I think it\u2019s just very sad that not only me, but some of my co-workers, are having to ask for government assistance just so we can keep up.\u201d Kaiser Permanente is one of the largest healthcare providers in the US, serving 12.7 million members in California, Washington, Oregon, Georgia, Hawaii, Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia. The non-profit reported a profit for the first quarter of 2023 of $1.2bn after reporting losses in 2022. Over the past five years, Kaiser Permanente has reported over $21bn in profit, while paying 49 corporate executives at least $1m each annually. Megan Mayes, a patient access representative at Kaiser Permanente in Portland, Oregon, for 17 years, said when Covid-19 hit, she and many of her co-workers were putting in 60 to 70 hours a week to help keep up with the high demand. Despite those extra hours, she said, the high cost of living and inflation have made it difficult for Mayes and her family to make ends meet financially. \u201cI have three kids. The grocery bills are a lot. We don\u2019t go out to eat, we meal prep, and it\u2019s still not sustainable. My husband is a journeyman carpenter, has a union, works full-time and has worked overtime since the pandemic as well and we\u2019re always operating in a deficit every single month,\u201d said Mayes. \u201cKaiser Permanente then telling me that I\u2019m overpaid? And what does that look like for bargaining when we\u2019re saying well, we\u2019re very clearly not and here\u2019s the numbers that support it.\u201d Mayes said that even with new job openings, the company can\u2019t get enough applicants because the pay is lagging and no longer competitive. The union is asking for a $ 25-an-hour wage floor for all positions. \u201cWe used to have applicants lined up for blocks to get training just to be at Kaiser Permanente and I\u2019ve never seen this ever in my 17 years here where we can\u2019t even get one single applicant for a job,\u201d she said. \u201cKaiser used to be the best, they were always the gold standard, and they\u2019re not any more. We\u2019re all asking Kaiser to do the right thing, invest in your employees, invest in the people who have stuck with you for years, through a global pandemic. It\u2019s time to start taking care of your employees.\u201d In a statement Kaiser Permanente provided the company said it had filled 6,500 coalition jobs this year as part of plans to hire 10,000 new workers and claimed average staff turnover is 8.5% compared with 21.4% for the healthcare industry as a whole. In a separate statement, a Kaiser Permanente spokesperson dismissed picketing as an attempt by the unions to gain leverage in bargaining and disputed the union\u2019s complaints about wages. The statement added: \u201cOur priority is to reach an agreement that ensures we can continue to provide market-competitive pay and outstanding benefits. We are confident we\u2019ll be able to reach an agreement that strengthens our position as a best place to work and ensures that the high-quality care our members expect from us remains affordable and easy to access.\u201d"

At least 177 hospital bosses and Chinese Communist party (CCP) secretaries have been placed under investigation this year according to local media reports \u2013 more than double the number last year. In a press conference on Tuesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said the campaign would focus on people who had used their position to procure kickbacks and corruption in the pharmaceutical sector, the state tabloid the Global Times reported. The drive appears to have begun in earnest last month. On 21 July, the NHC published a report about a meeting held with the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party\u2019s corruption watchdog, which vowed to \u201cresolutely punish corruption\u201d in the medical sector \u201cwith a zero-tolerance attitude\u201d. In one recent case, a hospital in the south-west province of Yunnan bought radiotherapy equipment for 35.2m yuan (\u00a33.8m), despite the fact that the import price was only 15m yuan, with the hospital director pocketing the difference. In another case, a plastic surgeon in Jiangsu was arrested and 40m yuan in cash found in his home. Previous attempts to root out corruption in the healthcare sector have been accused of targeting the symptoms rather than the causes of graft. Government officials now talk of expanding the remit of the inspections to the pharmaceutical sector, to root out corruption in the whole medical supply chain. The crackdown on medical corruption is part of a broader graft-busting drive that has intensified since Xi Jinping secured his third term as China\u2019s leader in October last year. In the first six months of this year, nearly 2,5000 people have been investigated by the CCDI and the National Supervisory Commission, the government\u2019s anti-corruption authority that works alongside the party-focused CCDI. More than 1,600 people have been punished, according to the CCDI. Anti-corruption has been Xi\u2019s signature policy since taking power more than a decade ago, with the CCP\u2019s inspectors targeting \u201ctigers and flies\u201d \u2013 high- and low-level cadres and government employees \u2013 as well as, recently, itself. More anti-corruption officials have been placed under investigation this year than in any year since 2014. Experts on China\u2019s anti-corruption efforts have said that a renewed drive 10 years after the policy was first launched suggests the problems may be structural. Local party heads wield significant power with few checks on their authority, a system that smooths decision-making but is ripe for abuse. The medical sector is seen as being especially corrupt. The government has launched several crackdowns on it since 2006. Doctors are poorly paid and hospitals rely on patient fees for funding \u2013 a combination that breeds opportunities for bribery and distrust. Violence against doctors is common, as patients or their relatives lash out at what they see as unfair or inadequate treatment. Surveys show that after party officials, doctors are seen as the most corrupt professionals in Chinese society. The perception among many Chinese is that doctors \u201cmust be paid petty bribes to speed up sorely needed consultations in order to charge exorbitant prices for the needed medicine\u201d, noted B\u00f8rge Bakken and Jasmine Wang of Australian National University in a study published in 2021. Research shows bribery is by far the most common form of medical corruption, accounting for nearly 70% of judgments published in court records between 2013 and 2019. But although most of the people lining their pockets are healthcare providers, those paying the bribes are most often pharmaceutical and medical equipment suppliers, rather than patients."

            "date": "2023-08-02T18:00:21Z",
            "content": "Nose-picking should be given greater consideration as a potential health hazard, researchers have said, after finding healthcare workers who engaged in rhinotillexis were more likely to catch Covid than those who refrained. Scientists in the Netherlands say research has previously found healthcare workers who had direct contact with Covid patients were more likely to catch Covid than those who did not. Dr Jonne Sikkens, a co-author of the study, said: \u201cAfter that, we wanted to find out which factors predispose for infections within these groups, for instance touching your nose or even putting your finger inside of your nose.\u201d Sikkens and colleagues reported in the journal Plos One how they gathered information from 219 healthcare workers at Amsterdam University Medical Centers. Almost 85% of participants reported habitually picking their nose with a frequency ranging from daily to monthly, while 67% habitually wore glasses and 33% habitually bit their nails. Among the 52 male participants, 16 had a beard. \u201cDoctors were the most frequent nose pickers,\u201d the team wrote. Overall, 34 of the 219 participants reported having contracted Covid by October 2020, according to PCR or antibody tests; 32 of the infections were among the 185 participants who picked their nose. After taking into account whether the participants had had close contact with someone with Covid or worked directly with Covid patients \u2013 which would affect the level of PPE they were given and their risk of exposure to Covid \u2013 those who picked their noses were found to have almost a three times greater risk of developing a Covid infection than those who did not. Sikkens said with the proportion of nose pickers similar to figures from previous surveys of the general public, it seems participants were not self-censoring their responses. But, he added, while the finding of an association was not a surprise, the size of the effect was unexpectedly large. The team said that nose-picking may directly introduce the virus to the nose, adding that the behaviour may be an underestimated cause of Covid transmission between healthcare workers. However the team did not find an association between Covid infection risk and nail-biting, a finding they suggest may be down to proteins in saliva preventing the virus from entering the body\u2019s cells. No association was found between Covid infection risk and wearing glasses or having a beard \u2013 both of which may have affected the fit of PPE \u2013 although very few participants had facial hair, making those conclusions less robust. The authors noted that, among other limitations, information on behaviours such as nose-picking was collected several months after the infection, while participants who picked their noses were not asked about \u201cthe depth of penetration and eating of boogers\u201d. In addition, the study was carried out before Covid vaccinations were available and before the rise of Omicron. Sikkens also noted that as the study was based on observational data, it could not prove that nose-picking was behind the higher infection rates. \u201cWe cannot rule out for instance, that [healthcare workers who don\u2019t nose pick] are more hygienic people overall, and that other factors have led to this finding,\u201d he said. However the team said their findings suggested nose-picking deserved more consideration as a potential health hazard, given facial hair and other factors were already considered in current advice. \u201cExplicit recommendations against nose-picking should be included in the same Sars-CoV-2 infection prevention guidelines,\u201d they wrote."

            "date": "2023-08-02T04:00:20Z",
            "content": "A new collection of studies released by the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) demonstrates the potential usefulness of artificial intelligence in healthcare. A separate trial found that AI in breast cancer screening is safe and can almost halve the workload of radiologists. The pieces of research showcased in the NIHR report were published between 2020 and 2023. Here are five areas where promising AI interventions are addressing key health challenges. Heart disease About one in 100 adults have heart failure, which is usually diagnosed in hospital. Researchers have shown that an easy-to-use smart stethoscope could detect heart failure in primary care. The AI-supported stethoscope identified people with heart failure correctly nine out of 10 times. It could help GPs prioritise referrals, improve outcomes for patients and save healthcare systems money. Separate research found an AI application using routine clinical data with a blood test can determine whether people attending A&amp;E have experienced a heart attack. Lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Two studies found that AI could help determine whether abnormal growths seen on a CT scan are cancerous. The studies used different types of AI, and focused on different size growths, but both predicted cancer more accurately than the standard Brock score recommended by professional organisations. AI could help diagnose those patients earlier and save lives. Disease progression Research shows AI can predict whether people with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in one eye will develop it in the other. A study including scans from more than 2,500 people found AI outperformed five out of six experts. Researchers have also developed an AI tool that can predict the risk of flare-ups in people with ulcerative colitis. The technology could speed up assessment of ulcerative colitis, and provide accurate information about prognosis to doctors. Personalised treatment AI could help doctors decide which specific drug combinations are likely to benefit a patient with cancer in as little as 12 hours. This could improve the outcomes of patients treated with targeted anti-cancer drugs. People who have Covid-19 around the time of surgery are more likely to die than those without the virus. An international study involving almost 8,500 patients found an AI tool could predict the risk of death in the month after surgery for these people. Hospital pressures Researchers have developed an AI model that correctly predicted, eight out of 10 times, which people did not need to attend emergency departments. This was based on 100,000 linked ambulance and emergency care records from Yorkshire, England. AI could also help managers predict demand for beds. Researchers have developed an AI tool, using real-time data from 200,000 A&amp;E visits to a London teaching hospital, that predicts how many hospital beds were needed in four and eight hours\u2019 time. The estimates outperformed the hospital\u2019s own emergency admissions planning. The NIHR said the collection of studies was \u201ca small but current sample of the research addressing important health challenges\u201d and \u201cadd to the mounting body of evidence demonstrating the benefits\u201d of AI. Dr Jemma Kwint, a senior research fellow at the NIHR and author of the report, said: \u201cI hope the high quality studies selected for this collection are useful examples of the evidence we need to build trust in this advancing technology. \u201cFurther research is needed to deepen our understanding of how these tools could work in routine clinical practice, their long-term effect on patient outcomes and their overall value for money.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-14T15:00:18Z",
            "content": "A chain of medical centres that advertises its bulk-billing services requires patients to sign up for an online rewards program or pay out-of-pocket fees, a Choice investigation has found. The Our Medical chain, which is privately owned by Cornerstone Health and operates 33 medical, dental and radiology clinics along the east coast, launched its own patient rewards program this year. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Signing up to the rewards program is free and it offers benefits including a free flu vaccine and $20 vouchers for dental and physio, but Choice alleges it requires patients to hand over personal data. The chain promotes bulk-billing prominently on its website, referring to \u201cbulk billing quality GPs\u201d and \u201cBulk billing made exceptional\u201d. \u201cWe believe that everyone has the right to quality healthcare, when, where and how they need it,\u201d the website says. Kate Bower, a consumer data advocate at Choice, said the investigation was instigated after the consumer organisation was contacted by two regular patients at different Our Medical practices who were asked to sign up or pay fees for appointments. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be forced to choose between their privacy or getting help when they\u2019re sick,\u201d Bower said. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re hearing from people who have tried to book an appointment at an Our Medical clinic, only to be told they have to sign up for the rewards program or pay a $90 out-of-pocket fee to see a doctor,\u201d Bower said. Choice said it was concerned about people being \u201cpushed into\u201d using the app to access an essential service, and that Our Medical made clear it shared data with a number of entities and third parties, including for marketing and research purposes. \u201cWe think that those policies are much, much too vague for patients to really understand [how] their data is going to be used \u2026 or give them any control over how it may be used,\u201d Bower said. The terms and conditions of the rewards program state that it \u201cuses and discloses information\u201d about the member in accordance with Our Medical\u2019s privacy policy. The privacy policy, which says it complies with Australian privacy law, states that personal information collected on individual patients can be used \u201cto conduct business processing functions including providing personal information to our related bodies corporate, contractors, service providers or other third parties\u201d. It can also be used \u201cfor the administrative, marketing (including direct marketing), planning, product or service development, quality control and research purposes of Cornerstone, its contractors or service providers\u201d. A spokesperson for Cornerstone Health told Guardian Australia: \u201cOur Medical has not and will not ever use personal data for commercial purposes or share it with third parties for financial gain. \u201cNo additional information is captured within this rewards program than in a usual patient registration process.\u201d The spokesperson said capturing accurate and up-to-date personal information was \u201cone of the significant challenges of healthcare \u2026 to enable us to do that, we\u2019re putting it in the hands of the patient\u201d. The app allowed patients to check in for a GP consultation and access eScripts, results and referrals, they said. \u201cWe handle all personal information in accordance with relevant privacy and health records legislation. Our privacy policy includes reference to direct communication with patients including for feedback purposes.\u201d A spokesperson for Cornerstone Health told Choice the Our Medical app had been rolled out over the past nine months. \u201cThere is no obligation on privately owned medical centres or practitioners to provide general practice medical services on a bulk-billing basis,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cHowever, general practice medical services are available on a bulk-billing basis at Our Medical to patients who have joined the rewards program. General practice medical services are available on a private billing basis to all other patients.\u201d The chief executive of the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, Dr Elizabeth Deveny, said the model was concerning on grounds of equity. \u201cFor people on low incomes or pensions, many of whom would be eligible for bulk-billing at most GP clinics, this approach raises serious questions about equity and accessibility of services.\u201d Jeannie Paterson, a professor of law at the University of Melbourne and co-director of the Centre for AI and Digital Ethics, told Choice the practice of charging patients more if they did not join the rewards program was probably not illegal but was \u201cethically outrageous\u201d. Paterson said she believed patients would not expect their data to be used for research and marketing when they signed up for a medical service. Bower said Choice had similar concerns about data collection of fertility and period tracking as well as mental health apps. \u201cI think this is part of a broader trend where people who are trying to access essential health and wellbeing services are being incentivised, or sometimes forced, into sharing more data than they\u2019re comfortable with just in order to use the service,\u201d Bower said."

            "date": "2023-08-15T18:29:27Z",
            "content": "Profits at Harrods rose almost 10-fold last year as big-spending tourists returned to London after the pandemic. The Knightsbridge department store, which is owned by the investment arm of Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, saw profits hit \u00a3171.6m and sales increased 52% to \u00a3994m in the year to January 2023, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Harrods Group (Holding), which also operates a division serving private jets and sells goods to department stores overseas, said its recovery had come as it was able to open for the full year, after closing for 10 weeks because of pandemic lockdowns in the year to January 2022. The retailer said it had \u201ca strong recovery in trade as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic subsided and both local and overseas customers returned\u201d. Tim Parker, the chief financial officer at Harrods, said last year was one of \u201crecovery and growth\u201d. \u201cAt the beginning of 2022, with many international travel restrictions still in place, there was a subdued return of the global tourism trade that is so important to the UK,\u201d he said. Parker said sales had been driven partly by \u201congoing investment in our physical and digital estate\u201d. The department store has fared well while rivals such as Harvey Nichols, John Lewis, Fenwick and House of Fraser have struggled, Debenhams has disappeared from the high street and Beales has just a handful of stores. The retailer plans to introduce new womenswear and furniture rooms and expand its private shopping service in 2023. Its managing director, Michael Ward, was paid \u00a32.3m, the same as a year before, and the company took on almost 400 extra staff, mostly in sales and distribution, as trade bounced back. The group, which was bought by Qatar Holding in 2010 for an estimated \u00a31.5bn, did not pay out a dividend to its owners for the third year in a row as it repaid more than \u00a3220m of loans and financial leases. A spokesperson for the retailer said: \u201cHarrods continued to outperform the wider market due to our longstanding relationships with both brands and loyal customers, fuelled by a commitment to creating innovative and exceptional offerings. \u201cWe remain focused on driving future growth via the curation of exclusive products and experiences that can only be found in Harrods.\u201d The retailer cut about 700 jobs in 2020 when its beauty services and cafes were forced to remained closed amid social distancing measures. It made a loss of \u00a368m in the year to January 2021, hit by restrictions linked to the Covid-19 outbreak, but returned to profit in 2022 as restrictions eased. The company said that in December last year it had extended a \u00a3500m borrowing facility for five years to 2027 and secured further lending of up to \u00a3200m for three years."

            "date": "2023-08-04T15:16:45Z",
            "content": "Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, Star Hobson, Finley Boden and Jacob Crouch were killed during a seven-month period in 2020 after being subjected to sustained abuse by adults who were supposed to be caring for them. Arthur, a six-year-old who loved football and superheroes, was murdered by his stepmother in June 2020 after weeks of abuse and torture, including being poisoned with salt-laced drinks and forced to stand in isolation for up to 14 hours. Star, who was 16 months old, was killed by her mother\u2019s girlfriend, an amateur boxer, in September 2020. Finley Boden, who was 10 months old, was found dead by his parents on Christmas Day in 2020, after sustaining 130 separate injuries 39 days after he was returned to their care. The latest case to make it to the courts is that of Jacob, a 10-month-old killed by his stepfather on 30 December 2020 after sustaining dozens of injuries, including at least 39 rib fractures. There is growing evidence to suggest that the Covid-19 lockdown, which began in March 2020, significantly hindered the ability of services to protect children from harm. Abigail Gill, the associate head of policy and public affairs at the NSPCC, said: \u201cWe are now starting to see the impact that lockdown has had on children\u2019s social care and vulnerable children. What these cases show is that our deepest fears did come to fruition for some children and harm was taking place behind closed doors.\u201d Government figures show there were 223 child deaths involving abuse or neglect in 2020-21, up from 188 the previous year \u2013 a figure that also includes looked-after children. Contacts to the NSPCC\u2019s helpline from adults with concerns about the wellbeing of a child increased by 23% from the previous year to a record high of almost 85,000 in 2020-21. In 2020-21, there were 536 serious incident notifications relating to children, up by 87 on the number for 2019-20, with the largest increase recorded in the first half of the year, when lockdown conditions were tightest. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in quite a few of the cases is the way in which lockdown measures were actually used as a cover by some adults who were intent on causing harm to those children,\u201d said Gill. \u201cNow that those cases are coming through the court system, we\u2019re seeing the horrible details of all of that come to light.\u201d Arthur\u2019s parents kept him off school even after lockdown restrictions were eased, while Finley\u2019s parents frequently prevented social workers from entering their home on the grounds of Covid restrictions. \u201cA lot of those eyes and ears on the ground, services like school and health visitors who would spot risk signs and alert children\u2019s social care, couldn\u2019t do so,\u201d Gill said. \u201cBut even before the pandemic, we had a children\u2019s social care system that was really heading towards breaking point, with record numbers of children going into the care system. \u201cOver the past decade, we\u2019ve seen a really significant shift from local authorities being able to spend their money on early intervention and support for families, to cuts meaning the focus is now on child protection crisis intervention. The result of that is what we\u2019re seeing now come to fruition, more and more cases of the most severe forms of abuse and neglect.\u201d Debbie Innes-Turnill, a lecturer in child protection at the University of Birmingham, said lockdown restrictions \u201cexacerbated existing faultlines in the system\u201d. She said: \u201cThere was definitely a lack of contact between families and agencies, which was a huge risk factor that wasn\u2019t considered at the time and we\u2019re seeing being played out now. \u201cBut falling government funding for organisations designed to protect children was exacerbated by Covid, and where charities and third-sector organisations have stepped in, their work was curtailed by lockdown and there was no thought as to how their work could continue.\u201d An independent review of children\u2019s social care in England, which published a report last year, concluded that an urgent, multibillion-pound overhaul was needed, but the NSPCC believes the issue is not being treated with the urgency it requires. \u201cWe\u2019re at a critical juncture now. I\u2019m sure the public are a little bit sick of hearing officials say we\u2019re learning lessons and things are going to change, because it is just case after case,\u201d Gill said. \u201cBut unfortunately, we\u2019ve seen no wholesale reform of children\u2019s social care off the back of that and no national investment, either. \u201cThere will be children being abused and neglected right now, whose cases we will hear in a few years\u2019 time, unless the government does something.\u201d"

            "content": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position: 11th (NB: this is not necessarily Jacob Steinberg\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position: 14th Prospects A summer of indecision has left West Ham struggling to build on their dramatic triumph over Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final. Declan Rice has gone, sold to Arsenal for \u00a3105m, and attempts to replace the midfielder have been complicated by the uneasy relationship between David Moyes and Tim Steidten, who was appointed as the technical director last month. Formerly at Bayer Leverkusen, Steidten has been looking in Europe for players. Moyes wants players with Premier League experience, though, and has struggled to convince West Ham to meet Southampton\u2019s asking price for the England midfielder James Ward-Prowse. With the tension rising, it is just as well that West Ham made their first summer signing this week, strengthening in defensive midfield with the addition of Edson \u00c1lvarez from Ajax. It was time to act. West Ham were abject during a 4-0 friendly defeat to Leverkusen last weekend and, for all their success in Europe under Moyes, their poor domestic form cannot be overlooked. They lost 20 league games en route to finishing 14th last season and it will not be easy for them to recover from losing Rice. Yet Moyes is used to being written off. He was close to the sack on several occasions last season and ended the season clutching silverware. There is disquiet over his style of play within the dressing room but nobody will forget Moyes\u2019s charge down the touchline in Prague after Jarrod Bowen\u2019s last-minute winner against Fiorentina. It should not all be doom and gloom. West Ham are in the Europa League again and more signings will help them move on from a tricky pre-season. The manager David Moyes went into the Conference League final against Fiorentina with uncertainty hanging over his future. Defeat in Prague may well have led to West Ham looking for a new manager and a change should not be ruled out if they start the season slowly. Moyes, though, will be full of belief after collecting the first major trophy of his managerial career. He came close to the sack on several occasions last season and yet ended the campaign on a high. However complaints over his style of football have not gone away and Moyes, who has seen two members of his backroom team depart this summer, could be in trouble if West Ham\u2019s transfer strategy backfires again. Leading the shirt sales Lucas Paquet\u00e1 became West Ham\u2019s record signing when he joined for \u00a351m from Lyon in the summer of 2022 and the Brazil midfielder did not let his head drop after a slow start to life in England. The 25-year-old knuckled down, adjusted to the pace of the Premier League and offered plenty of creativity during the second half of last season. A favourite with supporters, it was Paquet\u00e1 who provided the assist for West Ham\u2019s winner in the Conference League final. It was a decisive moment of quality and West Ham will hope that Paquet\u00e1, who scored five goals in all competitions last season, is ready to take on more responsibility following Rice\u2019s departure. Folk hero The pass came from Paquet\u00e1 and the finish came from Jarrod Bowen. The winger knew how to pick his moment. Bowen struggled at the start of last season and his indifferent form dashed his hopes of being included in England\u2019s World Cup squad. However, he bounced back and was far more effective after Christmas. Bowen, who was an excellent signing from Hull City three years ago, returned to his driving best on the right flank and he was nerveless when he ran through against Fiorentina. The 26-year-old confidently slipped the ball past Pietro Terracciano and West Ham were champions. Bowen had made himself an instant club legend. One to watch There is plenty of optimism about West Ham\u2019s kids after their triumph over Arsenal in the FA Youth Cup final. Levi Laing, Dan Chesters and Freddie Potts have had opportunities during pre-season and Moyes believes that Divin Mubama could become an important member of the first team. Mubama, an 18-year-old striker, scored once in six appearances last season and he has a chance of competing with Michail Antonio and Danny Ings for a place in West Ham\u2019s attack. \u201cDivin makes us different,\u201d Moyes says. \u201cHe makes us a completely different side with his running, his pressure and the work he does off the ball.\u201d"

            "title": "Can a WHO pandemic treaty help poorer nations in future outbreaks?",
            "date": "2023-08-10T06:00:46Z",
            "content": "Covid-19 caught the world unprepared; the scramble it prompted for treatments, tests, protective equipment and vaccines favoured the world\u2019s richest nations. To avoid the same thing happening in future pandemics, a group of world leaders has proposed a pandemic treaty, which is being negotiated in a series of international meetings hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO). The draft treaty is aimed at ensuring equity in distributing all that is needed to handle a future pandemic, instead of the coronavirus free-for-all. However, reaching an agreement is tricky, with diverging government interests, reservations on the part of pharmaceutical companies and lingering anti-WHO sentiment from those who opposed lockdowns, masks and vaccines during the pandemic. What is the pandemic treaty? The WHO\u2019s member states have agreed to work on a legally binding treaty on how to respond to the next pandemic to avoid repeating the damage caused by Covid-19, which not only caused almost 7 million deaths but, especially in poorer countries, led to increases in poverty and hunger, and disrupted health systems. The negotiations are being hosted by the WHO, but it is up to member states to reach an agreement. The most recent meetings were held in July and are being followed up with more throughout this year, with the goal of presenting a final draft to the World Health Assembly in May 2024. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has compared it to the convention on tobacco control, which came into effect in 2005 and was the first international treaty agreed under the WHO. Why is it important? Vaccines for Covid-19 were rapidly developed and rolled out to rich countries, but took far longer to reach developing countries in significant numbers. While the Covax platform was established in the first year of the pandemic \u2013 to support the research and manufacture of a range of vaccine candidates and negotiate pricing to ensure their fair distribution \u2013 the world\u2019s richest countries stockpiled vaccines through their own agreements. The resource shortages were not just limited to vaccines, poorer countries struggled to obtain crucial supplies of oxygen for patients in intensive care, personal protective equipment, and testing resources. What is being proposed?

More specifically, it calls for greater access to affordable medicine, including non-branded versions, and for greater support for local and regional production and distribution. It also calls for the WHO to be given the authority and funding it needs to support countries to minimise the risks of a pandemic. What impact will it have? The aim of the accord is to learn from Covid-19 and ensure that treatments, equipment and resources to deal with a pandemic are available to all countries on a fairer basis. It would also aim to help prevent future pandemics with improved and more transparent surveillance and early warning of disease outbreaks. How is it progressing? There have already been several rounds of talks ahead of a high-level meeting at the United Nations next month, which have produced a draft political declaration, but there are already questions about the strength of the deal. Early drafts have been condemned as weak. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u2019 Access Campaign, which fights for fairer access to medical treatments, said the draft uses ambiguous language and that the criteria are too loose, so that when it comes to taking action, countries will interpret it differently and make it difficult to trigger the accord. Even the definition of a pandemic is criticised for being too narrow: not just as an epidemic that has spread globally, but as one to \u201coverwhelm health systems with severe morbidity and high mortality\u201d and \u201ccausing social and economic disruptions\u201d. There have also been challenges from some opposed to the deal and critical of the WHO. Last month Tedros criticised claims by those with \u201cvested interests\u201d that the accord was a power grab by the WHO, which would \u201cstymie innovation and research\u201d. He likened those undermining talks, \u201cwho peddle lies about this historic agreement\u201d, to the tobacco industry\u2019s attempts to thwart the control treaty 20 years ago. He has also had to rebut claims from people such as Elon Musk that the treaty means ceding sovereignty to the WHO. Part of the call for better vaccine access involves increased production of non-branded treatments, but Tedros has said this does not mean the profits of large pharmaceuticals will be affected. During talks last month, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need to choose between equitable access and innovation. We do not have to choose between protecting public health and making a fair profit. We can strike a balance.\u201d"

            "content": "The pandemic splurge on household goods is over, with Australia\u2019s biggest home retailer, Harvey Norman, disclosing a sharp slide in sales and fall in profits. The company, which also owns Domayne and Joyce Mayne, on Thursday posted a full-year underlying net profit of $471.9m, down from $673.5m the previous year. Rising inflation and interest rates have hit retailers hard as consumers reduce discretionary spending amid surging living costs. This contrasts with the spike in sales retailers enjoyed early in the pandemic, after households increased spending due to low borrowing rates and increased levels of savings. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Harvey Norman on Thursday blamed high inflation, rising living costs and discounting for its decline in sales. \u201cAmid progressively worsening macroeconomic conditions and cost of living pressures this year, our balance sheet remains strong,\u201d chairman Gerry Harvey said. Revenue from franchisees dropped 10% after sales in its Australian stores fell 4.9% to $6.42bn during 2022-23, slicing profit margins. The pullback has continued into the new financial year, with most countries where it has operations, including Slovenia, Croatia and Northern Ireland as well as Australia, suffering double-digit sales declines. Phillip Kimber, a retail analyst at E&amp;P Capital said the result while \u201cbroadly in line with expectations, was very weak\u201d. \u201cThe Australian franchisee was better than expected, but the offshore businesses were generally worse than expected,\u201d he said in a note. \u201cSales momentum remains weak.\u201d UBS has a sell rating on the stock, according to its 12-month outlook. Harvey Norman blamed cooler than usual temperatures on Australia\u2019s east coast for lower sales of seasonal products such as air-conditioners, fans and barbecues. The annual earnings season, which comes to a formal end this week, has revealed a mix of buying habits in the inflationary period. While white goods sales have tended to be weak, JB Hi-Fi still reported a healthy appetite for mobile phones, audio, accessories and games hardware. Consumers are still buying coffee machines and air fryers, according to results released by appliance maker Breville Group, but pulling back on juicer and blender purchases. Breville noted that items such as blenders are proving to be more discretionary than an espresso machine, given the latter might be used to save money on take-away coffee. Harvey Norman\u2019s results show that although sales have eased significantly, they are still above pre-pandemic levels. The group\u2019s property portfolio, which makes up just under a quarter of total underlying profit, recorded a 25.9% profit dip. The retailer declared a fully franked final dividend of 12 cents, down from 17.5 cents the previous year.

            "date": "2023-08-18T15:00:55Z",
            "content": "The Victorian government paid the consultancy firm EY more than $30m to help manage and deliver key public health projects during the pandemic, including contact tracing and the rollout of tests and vaccines. Government contracts show the health department paid EY $17.4m for its work on the test-and-trace program, known as Operation Drasi, with EY staff seconded into the department. A deed of agreement for the secondment, signed by the department and EY, indicates what consultants were asked to do while working on the project between June 2020 and June 2021. \u201cDuring the secondment, your duties will include assisting the department during the Covid-19 pandemic response and in particular: operation planning, specifically forward planning with a strong focus on looking ahead,\u201d the signed deed said. The deed said EY would be \u201cpreparing and planning the actions that need to be done to support the response; operations management including planning and scheduling the activities that must be delivered\u201d, and undertaking \u201cproject management and coordination\u201d. Another $11.5m contract was awarded for separate and unspecified \u201cmanagement advisory services\u201d with the department between August 2020 and June 2021, with EY staff also seconded. Another $2.2m was paid to EY for \u201cCovid-19 incident management team operational planning and foresight services\u201d, which were provided on an \u201cas and when required basis\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A separate contract awarded $259,000 for the \u201cengagement of EY staff to assist with specialist Covid related special projects\u201d. Another $1.15m was spent seconding EY staff to assist with Covid operations from July 2020 to June 2021. The department declined to comment when asked for more detail on what the consultants were paid to do, how many were seconded into the department and at what level they operated. It is understood the EY consultants worked on the expansion and efficiency of testing, the vaccine rollout and contact tracing. EY said it was unable to comment due to client confidentiality obligations. Public health experts concede there was an urgent need to boost the department\u2019s workforce, but some have called for more detail on how such a large sum of money was spent. Dr Stephen Duckett, the former director of the Grattan Institute\u2019s health program who is now an honorary professor at the University of Melbourne, said it was not unreasonable for governments to hire a surge workforce. \u201cWhat is extraordinary here is the amount of money that was spent on EY with virtually no accountability, just waffle words generated by the obfuscation machine,\u201d Duckett said. \u201cThe $30m has to be recouped as Victoria went into debt during the first stages of the Covid pandemic. So Victorians are bearing the ongoing cost of these contracts and the associated debt, and it is reasonable for Victorians to know what they are paying for.\u201d Dr Julia Anaf, a research fellow at the Stretton Institute at the University of Adelaide, said it was not clear to what extent the health department had delegated responsibility for planning and operations to EY. \u201cUnlike private sector operators, governments are democratically elected to take responsibility for the health and welfare of the public,\u201d Anaf said. \u201cThere will always be a role for occasional provision of specific expertise by consultants, but the outsourcing of traditional public sector roles to private interests is a threat to democracy.\u201d The Greens senator Barbara Pocock, who is part of a Senate inquiry into the conduct of consultants, also called for more details and transparency from the state government. \u201cI\u2019d like to know the extent to which this occurred and what kind of results were achieved,\u201d Pocock said. \u201cThe lack of any apparent evaluation makes it impossible to determine whether the millions of taxpayer dollars spent represents value for money. \u201cEY made millions from outsourced Covid-related contracts, yet we don\u2019t know much at all about what they were actually doing for the Victorian government, let alone whether it was worth what was paid.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-15T11:45:54Z",
            "content": "Whether it\u2019s Harry Styles selling out multiple dates at Wembley, fans shelling out hundreds for Beyonc\u00e9 or even forgoing summer vacations to afford Taylor Swift tickets, the demand for live music has never seemed so high. Despite the cost of living crisis, consumer spending on the entertainment sector rose last month by a remarkable 15.8% year-on-year, according to recent data from Barclaycard, with the surge in demand for gigs bolstered by pre-sales for Swift\u2019s Eras Tour concerts, as well as the upcoming Foo Fighters stadium tour. In-person experiences have remained a priority for the British public. One in 10 people told the credit card company they had cut back on other expenses to be able to afford tickets to concerts or movies, while 10% said they bought a ticket in July that they \u201ccouldn\u2019t really afford\u201d. You only have to check social media when a major international artist announces a new tour to see how much of a fervour there is to secure access to one of the dates. However, with the cost of a gig ticket on the rise and shows selling out minutes after going on sale, fans are having to go to ever greater lengths to see these set-piece events. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a greater volume this year than ever before in terms of resale, which is interesting because I wasn\u2019t quite sure what this year had in store due to the cost of living crisis,\u201d says Richard Davies, founder of the fan-to-fan ticket exchange Twickets. He says the website has seen a 60% increase in ticket resales this year compared with 2022. \u201cThere\u2019s still Fomo [fear of missing out], people are still wanting to get out more after Covid, and there\u2019s still a backlog of tours, with some acts coming back a second time, like Coldplay playing again this year,\u201d he adds. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think pricing has put people off, that\u2019s for sure. We\u2019ve seen an average ticket price go up from upwards of \u00a350 to more than \u00a370. There\u2019s lots of demand out there and people are happy to pay the money.\u201d However, despite the enduring popularity of Glastonbury, Davies says resales to summer festivals have \u201cplateaued\u201d and failed to increase in line with the growing gigs market. \u201cI think maybe the rise in ticket prices there has had an impact because it\u2019s just getting so expensive now,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more choice on the festival circuit these days, be it weekend ones or day events, and there\u2019s not a lot to differentiate between them either. A lot of the same acts are playing the same festivals now, so there\u2019s no real need to get out to a specific festival as you might catch them somewhere else.\u201d One reason for the decline in popularity of traditional weekend festivals, such as Reading and Leeds or Isle of Wight, may be the growth in one-day events with multiple acts, such as the British Summer Time concerts held at London\u2019s Hyde Park. This year, all 10 days \u2013 including ones headlined by Lana Del Rey, Pink and Bruce Springsteen \u2013 sold out. Jim King, chief executive of European festivals at AEG Presents, which runs BST, says this year\u2019s series sold 550,000 tickets \u2013 up from 535,000 last year. For this summer\u2019s Take That-led event, ticket prices varied from \u00a3101.15 for general admission to VIP hospitality packages costing nearly \u00a3500. \u201cI think we are priced really well,\u201d says King. \u201cThese are for the world\u2019s biggest artists, who are sometimes playing their last ever show or sometimes touring London once every three, four, five years.\u201d While demand for huge outdoor gigs and arena tours skyrockets, the picture for smaller, local venues is very different. The Boileroom, in Guildford, has always been one of the more prominent stop-offs for touring artists over the years, helping to launch the careers of Ed Sheeran, The 1975 and Tom Odell, among others. But Dom Frazer, the venue\u2019s director, says the surge in demand at the highest echelons of the industry simply isn\u2019t filtering down to venues such as hers. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to be positive but specifically if we look at the number of artists touring regional towns like Guildford, there has been a huge decline of about 50% in terms of numbers,\u201d she says. \u201cLabels and agents and managers are looking much more to centralised touring routes than booking smaller, regional places. That\u2019s what we hear a lot of the time, artists doing the London and Brighton shows, whereas before they would have come out to Guildford and seen us as really key in building the fanbase.\u201d She adds: \u201cMaybe people are taking less risks because of the cost of living to see music they haven\u2019t heard of or seen before. I think people are maybe risk averse. If you haven\u2019t got much income, are you going to use it on something you know you love or spend some of it on something new?\u201d Even big acts have come unstuck overestimating the demand from fans. Last month images of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce performing to a half-empty Wembley Stadium at a joint headline event with Def Leppard were shared widely on social media, while Primal Scream and Sister Sledge gigs were being offered to fans for a \u00a310 admin fee. And while other forms of live entertainment such as West End theatre have been able to boast stars like Sheridan Smith breaking box office records in Shirley Valentine, other shows, such as Ain\u2019t Too Proud and Aspects of Love, have had to announce early closures of runs because of poor ticket sales. Yet fans remain willing to go the distance to see their favourites, literally. Last year, the number of music tourists \u2013 people travelling outside their local area or region for live music \u2013 reached 14.4 million, of whom 1.1 million were foreign tourists, according to UK Music. Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, chief executive of the industry body, says: \u201cOne of the questions people have had over the past two years is how much of this is a post-Covid thing or is this a new norm where there\u2019s these huge level of demand for live events going through the roof?\u201d He has seen this dedication first-hand, with a close friend giving up her annual vacation to Greece to be able to buy tickets to see Swift play in Paris. \u201cI think the pandemic probably has had a big impact on it in terms of making people realise how much they missed it. I think people realised how much they liked it when they weren\u2019t able to do it.\u201d Njoku-Goodwin says rising prices are understandable. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case that there are greedy promoters charging whatever they want, there are added costs. When VAT was brought down during the pandemic and brought back up again, we warned this will mean ticket prices would get more expensive. It\u2019s not just VAT of course, there\u2019s energy costs and in a cost of living crisis there\u2019s also an impact on businesses and suppliers\u2019 costs.\u201d And while major artists such as Beyonc\u00e9 and Swift generate billions for the entertainment economy, it seems unlikely that the clamour to see stars perform live is going to subside any time soon."

            "date": "2023-08-10T06:00:46Z",
            "content": "Covid-19 caught the world unprepared; the scramble it prompted for treatments, tests, protective equipment and vaccines favoured the world\u2019s richest nations. To avoid the same thing happening in future pandemics, a group of world leaders has proposed a pandemic treaty, which is being negotiated in a series of international meetings hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO). The draft treaty is aimed at ensuring equity in distributing all that is needed to handle a future pandemic, instead of the coronavirus free-for-all. However, reaching an agreement is tricky, with diverging government interests, reservations on the part of pharmaceutical companies and lingering anti-WHO sentiment from those who opposed lockdowns, masks and vaccines during the pandemic. What is the pandemic treaty? The WHO\u2019s member states have agreed to work on a legally binding treaty on how to respond to the next pandemic to avoid repeating the damage caused by Covid-19, which not only caused almost 7 million deaths but, especially in poorer countries, led to increases in poverty and hunger, and disrupted health systems. The negotiations are being hosted by the WHO, but it is up to member states to reach an agreement. The most recent meetings were held in July and are being followed up with more throughout this year, with the goal of presenting a final draft to the World Health Assembly in May 2024. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has compared it to the convention on tobacco control, which came into effect in 2005 and was the first international treaty agreed under the WHO. Why is it important? Vaccines for Covid-19 were rapidly developed and rolled out to rich countries, but took far longer to reach developing countries in significant numbers. While the Covax platform was established in the first year of the pandemic \u2013 to support the research and manufacture of a range of vaccine candidates and negotiate pricing to ensure their fair distribution \u2013 the world\u2019s richest countries stockpiled vaccines through their own agreements. The resource shortages were not just limited to vaccines, poorer countries struggled to obtain crucial supplies of oxygen for patients in intensive care, personal protective equipment, and testing resources. What is being proposed? The draft political declaration includes references to \u201cglobal solidarity\u201d and expressions of \u201cconcern\u201d ranging from Covid-19\u2019s disproportionate impact on low and middle-income countries and disadvantaged members of society to its impact on health systems and development. More specifically, it calls for greater access to affordable medicine, including non-branded versions, and for greater support for local and regional production and distribution.

It would also aim to help prevent future pandemics with improved and more transparent surveillance and early warning of disease outbreaks. How is it progressing?

It was a momentous day, a culmination of years of hard work, which has not come easy to year 11 students who took their exams in the aftermath of the pandemic. Top grades have fallen more than 4% on the previous year after ministers announced a return to pre-pandemic grading levels. \u201cI think I did all right,\u201d said Yousaf Babar, who got the grades to get into college. \u201cI\u2019m a bit disappointed on one but I\u2019m going to get it remarked. It\u2019s a bit of hope, innit? Overall I think I smashed it.\u201d There were few who were disappointed with their results and the teachers even managed to get smiles out of the boys, who have done better than expected. Shahir Shafqat was one of those celebrating \u2013 with a 5 in maths, higher than the 3 he had been expecting; he would not have to do resits. \u201cIt\u2019s over! No more maths!\u201d he laughed. Omar Shehata, who arrived in the UK from Egypt with his family in 2008, got 8s and 9s in his GCSEs and also received an A* in A-level maths this year. He said: \u201cI\u2019m going to celebrate, maybe with brunch with my family.\u201d The college he plans to attend has an Oxbridge programme, which he hopes will help him get to Oxford. His father, Mohamed, said his son had always been academic and studious. \u201cI\u2019m very proud. I don\u2019t push him at all, he\u2019s naturally talented and has made it easy for me,\u201d he said, beaming. He said coming to the UK had been an \u201camazing opportunity\u201d for his family, including his older son who had just received top A-level grades. \u201cWe\u2019re really appreciative,\u201d he said. The pupils come from inner-city south Manchester, many from very deprived areas, and speak 45 languages. For most of the children at the school, English is not their first language. As well as learning a demanding curriculum in the aftermath of the pandemic, some children are learning English as they go. Burnage academy is 37th in the UK for progress on boys\u2019 education, making it top in the north of England. It is rated outstanding by Ofsted. The school was keen to emphasise that academic results were only part of what the boys were there to learn. \u201cHelping each other, being kind, those are attributes we want them to have,\u201d said Helen Carter, deputy head at the school. \u201cThe results are really positive, which is testament to the hard work of the students.\u201d But she said the government\u2019s decision to return grades to 2019 levels was \u201cbizarre\u201d, as students taking their GCSEs had been severely affected by the various lockdowns \u2013 which were more severe and prolonged in Greater Manchester than most other parts of the country \u2013 in years 8 and 9. \u201cThose really are building blocks for their GCSEs, and narrowing the results to pre-pandemic levels ignores the learning impact of the pandemic.\u201d The headteacher, Karl Harrison, agreed. \u201cThey\u2019ve worked damned hard. They were massively impacted by the pandemic and now they\u2019re having their grades reduced down. It\u2019s almost like the pandemic didn\u2019t matter. It would be nice if this didn\u2019t become the forgotten year.\u201d Harrison said the number one thing schools needed from the government in the future was autonomy. \u201cSchools need to be able to take our own decisions and school leaders are best placed to understand their individual school,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone went to school so everyone has an opinion \u2013 we\u2019re constantly told \u2018this isn\u2019t right\u2019 by people who have never worked in education.\u201d He added: \u201cProfessional respect, that would help.\u201d"

The UK government bought tens of millions of Covid jabs from Moderna during the pandemic, and struck a 10-year partnership with the US drugmaker to boost research and development of mRNA vaccines in the UK, including constructing a new vaccine factory. Announcing the appointment on LinkedIn, Moderna said Van-Tam would be reporting to its chief medical officer, Paul Burton. It declined to disclose his advisory fee but said the appointment was in accordance with the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s business appointment rules. Burton said: \u201cProfessor Van-Tam\u2019s significant experience and expertise as a specialist in influenza, including its epidemiology, transmission, vaccinology and pandemic preparedness, as well as a globally renowned academic and educator, will be a vital asset to Moderna as we work to improve population health security.\u201d Van-Tam is prohibited from using privileged information from his time in government to further his business interests, as first reported by the Financial Times. He will stay on at Nottingham University as senior strategy adviser in medicine. When Van-Tam left his government role, the then health secretary, Sajid Javid, praised him for his unique approach to explaining crucial information to the public. \u201cJVT\u2019s one-of-a-kind approach to communicating science over the past two years has no doubt played a vital role in protecting and reassuring the nation, and made him a national treasure.\u201d Van-Tam became known for giving Covid updates in a lighthearted way, often using football or other analogies. In June, he was appointed chair of the Lincolnshire Football Association. A season ticket holder at Boston United, the Lincolnshire team that plays in the sixth tier of the English football league, Van Tam often turned to football to find the words he wanted. In late 2020, he told the BBC that in the early stages of the pandemic the \u201caway team gave us an absolute battering\u201d, adding: \u201cIn the 70th minute we\u2019ve now got an equaliser. OK, we\u2019ve got to hold our nerve now, see if we can get another goal and nick it.\u201d The announcement of Van-Tam\u2019s appointment to Moderna raised some eyebrows. Rose Whiffen, the senior research officer at Transparency International UK, said: \u201cWhen companies employ former officials \u2013 regardless of whether they worked in that industry before their government role or not \u2013 it raises the risk of privileged information being misused for commercial benefit. \u201cCurrently, there are only minimal safeguards against abuse of the revolving door between the public and private sector. The government should prohibit ex-senior civil servants and ministers from taking up positions where they have had substantial responsibility for policy relevant to the hiring company.\u201d Van-Tam worked at the University of Nottingham before his government role and has also been a consultant to the World Health Organization on influenza since 2004. He worked in the pharmaceutical and vaccines industries from 2000 until 2004, for SmithKline Beecham (which became part of GSK), Roche and a joint venture between Sanofi-Pasteur and MSD. He became a consultant epidemiologist and head of the pandemic influenza office at the UK Health Protection Agency in 2004 and sat on the UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) during the 2009-10 swine flu pandemic."

The state-of-the-art Vaccine Development and Evaluation Centre is based at the UK Health and Security Agency\u2019s (UKHSA) Porton Down campus in Wiltshire. Live viruses will be kept onsite in specialist containment facilities where scientists can assess pathogens that do not yet have a vaccine or ones where immunisation could be improved, for example, the flu or mpox. Prof Dame Jenny Harries said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do now is capture that really excellent work from Covid and make sure we\u2019re using that as we go forward for any new pandemic threats.\u201d She added: \u201cWhat we try to do here is keep an eye on the ones that we do know. For example, with Covid, we are still here testing all the new variants with the vaccines that have been provided to check they are still effective. \u201cBut we are also looking at how quickly we can develop a new test that would be used if a brand new virus popped up somewhere.\u201d The opening of the facility is announced after the Covid inquiry heard evidence that previous governments were ill prepared for a pandemic, with its plans focusing too much on the possibility of an influenza pandemic rather than other viruses. The former prime minister David Cameron had admitted this was a \u201cmistake\u201d. Prof Isabel Oliver, UKHSA\u2019s chief scientific officer, said: \u201cWe know that through scientific advancement, we could detect and control these spreads before they have the impact that Covid-19 had on our lives. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but we know that if we strengthen surveillance and if we accelerate the development of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, we could do so much better. \u201cWe need to be prepared for all threats, including those that have not been detected yet.\u201d The government said the centre also underlined the UK\u2019s commitment to the 100 Days Mission, a global goal set by the G7 in 2021 with the aim of deploying a vaccine against any new pandemic threat within 100 days of identification. The health secretary, Steve Barclay, said: \u201cThis new centre cements the UK\u2019s global position spearheading pandemic preparedness, vaccine development, and scientific discovery. \u201cThis state-of-the-art complex will also help us deliver on our commitment to produce new vaccines within 100 days of a new threat being identified.\u201d"

            "content": "With Covid in the UK on the rise once more, we take a look at the current situation and what the plans are for vaccination. What is the current picture around Covid cases and hospitalisations? While many of the community surveillance studies tracking Covid infection levels have been wound up, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) continues to keep tabs on some metrics of Covid. According to the most recent UKHSA report, from late July, Covid case rates and positivity rates picked up through hospital testing in England increased while hospitalisations also rose, with the latter up to 1.97 per 100,000 people compared with 1.47 the week before. \u201cHospitalisations were highest in the 85 years and over age group,\u201d the report said. Despite these increases, levels are relatively low. For comparison, in early January 2021 the hospital admission rate was greater than 36 per 100,000 while in March this year it was a little over 10 per 100,000. When was the last time most groups had a jab? The offer of an initial two doses of a Covid vaccine, which began in December 2020 and was extended to everyone aged over five, ended on 30 June this year, while the universal booster, which was first offered in late 2021 just after the Omicron variant arrived in the UK, ended on 31 March 2023. That means that for the majority of younger, healthy people who had their jabs when they were first offered, the last vaccination they would have received was more than 18 months ago. However further booster jabs have been offered to particular groups deemed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to be most at risk from Covid, with the latest round announced on 8 August. Who is entitled to jabs on the NHS now? The latest booster programme in England \u2013 which will begin this autumn \u2013 is aimed at older adults, as well as people with conditions including diabetes and chronic respiratory disease, or who are immunosuppressed or pregnant. \u201cThis is because the risk of severe Covid continues to be strongly associated with increasing age and underlying health conditions,\u201d the Department of Health has said. Among those eligible for the booster are adults aged 65 and over, residents in care homes for older adults and staff who work there, carers who are aged 16 to 64, frontline health and social care workers, people aged 12 to 64 who are household contacts of people with immunosuppression, and people aged 6 months to 64 years in one of the defined clinical risk groups. The latest booster campaign covers a larger pool of people than the spring booster programme this year, but it is not as large as previous drives over the autumn and winter \u2013 a period when the NHS is often under severe pressure. Last autumn an extra Covid jab was offered to all adults aged over 50. What\u2019s the situation with private jabs around the world? While different countries have different vaccination programmes and eligibility criteria for Covid jabs and boosters, nowhere in Europe, the US or Australia has offered the jabs for private sale. Pharmaceutical companies have said they are still fulfilling government contracts. However, the UK government has said manufacturers are not prohibited from selling the vaccines in a private market."

            "date": "2023-08-30T19:23:31Z",
            "content": "Health officials have brought forward plans for autumn flu and Covid vaccinations after detecting a highly-mutated Covid variant that is spreading around the world. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said vaccinations would be available from 11 September in England as a precautionary measure intended to protect the most vulnerable as the winter months approach. The vaccination programme had not been scheduled to launch until early October. The move comes after scientists at the agency detected the first UK case of the new variant, named BA.2.86, on 18 August and as many schools in England prepare to go back after the summer break next week. The variant has a large number of mutations and has been spotted in several countries in people without any recent travel history, suggesting that it is spreading in more than one region. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cases have been recorded in Denmark, South Africa, the US and the UK. BA.2.86 has yet to be classified a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, meaning it has the potential to drive a fresh wave of illness, but health officials decided to bring forward the flu and Covid vaccine programmes to help those at greatest risk of severe disease and reduce the potential impact on the NHS. The large number of mutations make it a contender for evading immune defences built up by previous vaccination and infection. Under the revised plan, people in care homes for older people, the clinically vulnerable, those aged 65 and over, and health and social care staff can have a Covid vaccine in September. Where possible, the annual flu shot will be made available to the same groups at the same time, the UKHSA said. \u201cThanks to the success of our vaccine programme, we have built strong, broad immune defences against new variants throughout the population,\u201d said Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UKHSA. \u201cHowever, some people remain more vulnerable to severe illness from Covid-19. This precautionary measure to bring forward the autumn programme will ensure these people have protection against any potential wave this winter.\u201d Scientists have little information on BA.2.86 so its potential impact is hard to estimate. Dame Harries said the agency would continue to monitor the variant and advise the government and the public as it learned more. It is unclear whether BA.2.86 will cause more severe illness than previous variants. So far, areas that have the variant have not recorded increases in transmission or hospital admissions compared with neighbouring areas where the variant has yet to be detected, the CDC said, though it cautioned that it was too soon to evaluate the variant\u2019s eventual impact. Genetic analysis shows that BA.2.86 has more than 30 additional mutations compared with BA.2, the Omicron lineage that dominated last year, and more than 35 extra mutations than the XBB.1.5 variant which has so far dominated 2023. The number of extra mutations is similar to when the first Omicron variant, BA.1, emerged and spread rapidly around the globe. The UK vaccination campaign was originally scheduled for October because the jabs tend to provide the best protection when there is a short gap between receiving the shot and being exposed to the circulating viruses. Following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the Covid vaccine will be offered to all adults over 65, residents of care homes for older adults, those at clinical risk, frontline health and social care workers, and people aged 12 to 64 who are household contacts of people who are immunosuppressed and so less able to fight off infections."

            "date": "2023-08-17T04:00:07Z",
            "content": "Covid vaccines should be made available for people to buy privately in Britain, leading scientists have urged, amid concerns over a new wave of the virus which could worsen in autumn and winter. Unlike flu jabs, which individuals or employers can buy for about \u00a315 from high street pharmacies, Covid jabs are only available on the NHS in the UK. This month the UK government announced that the Covid autumn booster programme would cover a smaller pool of the population than earlier vaccination drives. The age limit has been raised from 50 to 65 and above, with some younger vulnerable groups also eligible. Covid is on the rise, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Experts raised concerns the wave could continue to grow and add to winter pressures on the NHS. Prof Adam Finn, of the University of Bristol, a member of the UK\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said Covid jabs should be available commercially. Some employers might want to offer the vaccines to their staff, he added. Speaking in a personal capacity, Finn said: \u201cI think it will be a good idea for vaccines to be made available to those that want them on the private market. I don\u2019t really see any reason why that shouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d Pharmaceutical companies are not prohibited from taking Covid jabs to the private market, according to the Department of Health (DHSC). A DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cPrivate sales of Covid vaccines is the same as other private healthcare, such as private sales of the seasonal flu vaccine \u2013 it is for manufacturers and private healthcare providers to decide and agree on.\u201d Pharmaceutical companies suggested they were tied into UK government contracts, though industry data suggested they were open to offering the jabs for commercial sale. Reports suggest that private jabs could be offered as soon as this autumn in the US. In March Moderna told Reuters that it expected to price its Covid vaccine at about $130 [\u00a3102], while Pfizer last year suggested $110 to $130 per dose. Darius Hughes, the UK general manager for Moderna, said: \u201cModerna will continue to work with UKHSA to ensure we have met all orders to support the 2023-24 NHS programme for recommended groups as per the JCVI advice, and we remain open to exploring the possibility and viability of providing Covid-19 vaccines to healthcare providers for private sales.\u201d Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, said private access to vaccines was fraught with difficulties, particularly in relation to equity of access, and Covid vaccines could be unaffordable for many. But there was precedent, he said. \u201cWe accept every year that those who are not at high risk of serious complications can access a private flu jab, so why should the Covid jab be any different? \u201cWhile the Covid jab may not offer much protection against infection for the vast majority of people, it will help in preventing spread of the virus. Covid vaccination will also protect against the development of long Covid.\u201d Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said: \u201cJCVI have done their calculation in favour of a very limited vaccine offer for the elderly and immunosuppressed, leaving the bulk of the population way out from their last dose and poorly protected.\u201d Prof Stephen Griffin, of the University of Leeds, said the current policy, which appears to rely on infections to boost immunity in the general population instead of vaccines, put people at risk of illness, including long Covid. \u201cWhilst private provision is therefore less than ideal, it would at least improve the unfortunate position the UK finds itself in today,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps, with subsidy for those unable to afford them, this might reduce the impact of the predicted autumn and winter Covid waves.\u201d However, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, of the University of Oxford, said the eligibility criteria for the new booster campaign made sense. \u201cThe science is clear that from the NHS perspective, Covid-19 is no longer a problem for the healthy and young in the population and it makes sense to focus vaccine policy on older adults, especially the frail, and those with underlying health conditions,\u201d he said. Philippa Harvey, the director of the Covid Vaccine Unit at UKHSA, said: \u201cThe Covid-19 vaccination programme continues to target those at higher risk of serious illness in line with JCVI advice, as those groups are most likely to benefit from booster vaccination at this time. \u201cThe Covid-19 vaccine is not currently available to buy privately in the UK but there is no blanket restriction on private sales of licensed vaccines.\u201d"

Spending data released by the Home Office shows it hired mental health professionals referred to as \u201cresilience practitioners\u201d for UK Border Force staff who were dealing with small boats. The sessions were held this spring with border officers in Folkestone, Kent, where asylum seekers travelling on small boats often land. In social media posts seen by the Guardian, one of the resilience practitioners described the officers as dealing with a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d. Another said on their website that their sessions often involved \u201cpositive psychology and cognitive behavioural theory\u201d. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents government workers, said the workshops were offered after trauma assessments were carried out on staff by fellow trained officers. The assessment is offered to those involved in potentially traumatic critical incidents. Last October, when an immigration centre in Dover was petrol bombed, the PCS said all staff involved in the incident were offered the assessment. The Home Office has spent \u00a37,696 on the workshops for staff \u201cinvolved in the small boats activity\u201d so far this year. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: \u201cWhile we welcome workshops to support our members in the Border Force, we would prefer the government stopped putting our members in this position in the first place. \u201cRather than the prime minister continuing to promote his unpopular, immoral and failing illegal migration bill, he should instead support our call for safe passage \u2013 a humane solution to the dangerous and uncontrolled situation in the Channel.\u201d The government last month passed its illegal migration bill, which will allow the Home Office to send asylum seekers who arrive on small boats to Rwanda. Earlier this month, the government launched its \u201csmall boats week\u201d to coincide with its use of the Bibby Stockholm barge to house asylum seekers. By the end of that week, all those living on the Bibby Stockholm were evacuated after legionella was found onboard. The next day, six asylum seekers drowned after their small boat capsized during an attempted Channel crossing. Two British ships were involved in the search and rescue operation. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe take staff welfare extremely seriously and are committed to supporting our staff who work in incredibly challenging environments. \u201cWe are committed to delivering the best value for money for the British taxpayer and all spending is carefully scrutinised to make sure that every pound of taxpayers\u2019 money is spent in the most effective way.\u201d"

            "content": "Triggers for mental health breakdown and self-harm in overstretched police officers are being routinely missed, according to their representative body in Scotland. The warning comes as the Guardian reveals a \u201cstartling\u201d increase in the number of absences due to psychological disorders. On Wednesday, senior police chiefs will hear directly for the first time from officers who are unable to work because of mental ill-health, at a meeting set up by the chair of the Scottish Police Federation, David Threadgold. \u201cI wanted to really personalise this issue rather than asking them to look at more charts and figures,\u201d he said. Data obtained through freedom of information (FoI) requests shows that absences caused by mental ill-health have nearly doubled among officers across Scotland in the eight years for which amalgamated figures are available, rising from 610 in 2015-16 to 1,154 in 2022-23, accounting for about 7% of the force. Absences due to psychological disorders had nearly tripled among police staff, growing from 222 in 2015-16 to 620 in 2022-23. The data also confirms that, between 2013 and 2023 to date, 14 police officers and three police staff have killed themselves. At a meeting of Holyrood\u2019s criminal justice committee in June, Fiona McQueen, from the Scottish Police Authority, said there was \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the level of suicides among officers and staff. Threadgold described the suicides as \u201ctragic\u201d and offered his condolences to the families affected, though he cautionedthat it was not clear why these individuals killed themselves. It was crucial to understand the reasons behind the rising numbers of absences, he added. \u201cWe are missing so many triggers,\u201d he said, pointing to the erosion of the link between constables and sergeants, their first line managers, as critical. \u201cOfficers may go for days or weeks without meaningful contact with a supervisor because of the incessant demands of the job, and that has a cumulative effect. \u201cWe are not robots. We deal with people and circumstances that can be horrendous. There is no training that can prepare you for that so we have to make sure we have mechanisms to look after our people who are regularly exposed to this type of incident.\u201d The relentless demands made of officers, a recruitment freeze on support staff, reduced officer numbers, and a move to online training were all challenges to providing meaningful support, he said. Along with funding pressures \u2013 which led off-duty officers to stage an unprecedented pay protest last week \u2013 the force is under increasing scrutiny after reports of misogynistic bullying and the former chief constable\u2019s acknowledgement that Police Scotland is institutionally racist. Police Scotland said: \u201cThe wellbeing of our officers and staff is absolutely fundamental,\u201d and set out a range of training and support, including a telephone helpline for those absent with mental ill-health, the peer-to-peer wellbeing champions network, resilience assessments for high-risk roles, and sessions with a clinical psychologist for those in crisis. Threadgold said the feedback he had received from officers was that these schemes \u201cdon\u2019t have buy-in and there\u2019s still a stigma in asking for help as well as a lack of opportunity for managers to have preventative conversations with their staff\u201d. He said the federation was forced to refer officers to charities for support because the provision through existing occupational health was insufficient, a situation he described as \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d. The Scottish Conservative justice spokesperson, Russell Findlay, who has worked with bereaved families, said the tally of officer and staff suicides in the force\u2019s first decade was \u201ctruly heartbreaking\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with friends and families of officers who died from suicide and there is anger about the lack of mental health support, but also at the reluctance by the authorities to acknowledge or discuss the scale of the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s startling to also learn that the combined number of officers and staff absent from duty due to psychological issues has more than doubled in less than a decade. \u201cThese figures confirm what they\u2019ve been saying for years \u2013 that they\u2019re under immense and growing pressure, and routinely taking up the slack for other public services. This must be addressed as a matter of urgency.\u201d The deputy chief constable Alan Speirs said: \u201cWorking in policing is a job like no other and our officers and staff find themselves in situations which can be stressful, traumatic and can have a lasting impact on them. \u201cPolice Scotland is determined to continue to drive improvements to support our people.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111.

            "date": "2023-08-17T16:51:31Z",
            "content": "The Metropolitan police has won its battle to stop attending most of the mental health calls it receives after a tense behind-the-scenes row with the health service, the Guardian has learned. From 31 October the Met will start implementing a scheme that aims to stop officers being diverted from crime fighting to do work health staff are better trained for. In May, the Guardian revealed that the Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, had written to health and social care leaders setting a deadline of 31 August \u2013 leading to furious reaction from health chiefs who wrote to the commissioner protesting that it would put vulnerable people at risk. The agreement means Rowley will push his deadline for the start of the changes back by two months, before a phased introduction. Health services will not publicly criticise the police decision, and will race to put measures in place to pick up the work. A formal announcement is expected as soon as Friday 18 August after weeks of tense talks. The Met was armed with legal advice from a senior barrister \u2013 a king\u2019s counsel \u2013 arguing the law meant the force did not have to do the work of the health service and would probably win any legal challenge. Police will continue to attend calls if there is a risk to life, a danger to the public or a crime is believed to be taking place. The agreement says: \u201cThe threshold for a police response to a mental health-related incident will be to investigate a crime that has occurred or is occurring; or to protect people, when there is a real and immediate risk to the life of a person, or of a person being subject to or at risk of serious harm. \u201cThe need for this threshold to change is seen through our data. For example, we know that 78% of people detained under section 136 will go on to be discharged home following assessment, suggesting mental health is being over-policed in London.\u201d One health source with knowledge of the discussions told the Guardian the commissioner\u2019s hard line was disliked, but had worked: \u201cHe got us round the table, got our attention and got us talking. \u201cIt\u2019s not malice but the NHS is notoriously slow. If he [Rowley] did not give a deadline, we would have been here for 10 years.\u201d The scheme is called Right Care Right Person (RCRP), and has been agreed nationally by government departments and national police and health bodies. Actually implementing it is down to local areas. NHS London has already started sending guidance to staff about what the new scheme may mean. The letter sent on Thursday says: \u201cIn practice, this means that police call handlers will receive a new prompt relating to welfare checks or when a patient goes absent from health partner inpatient care. The prompt will ask call handlers to check that a police response is required or whether the person\u2019s needs may be better met by a health or care professional.\u201d Among police forces, the Met is thought to be an outlier, in effectively making a threat and giving an ultimatum, police and health sources say. Rowley\u2019s letter in May summoned health and social care chiefs to meetings, which were held at the Met\u2019s Scotland Yard central London headquarters and NHS offices in Waterloo. One health source with close knowledge of the negotiations said: \u201cThere is nothing in their presentation you could disagree with. \u201cThere has been a kneejerk reaction from health and social care, to call the police.\u201d RCRP was pioneered by Humberside police, who believe it freed up 7% of officer time to do what the police are legally responsible for. Health chiefs in London say they do not know how they will meet the new demand. A source said: \u201cThe health service is already overloaded, the winter crisis is coming, and London ambulance service already faces big performance pressure.\u201d One reason for the Met to delay, other than giving the health sector more time to prepare, is so that police call centres are better prepared to deal with the new system, a police source said. The RCRP scheme has four stages. The first the Met is expected to implement arecalls to check on welfare, for instance where a mental health patient has missed an appointment and where there is no intelligence of harm. The second stage is when a patient leaves a health facility, having been there voluntarily. The third is handing over patients to the health sector, where officers can endure long waits of up to 14 hours, and the fourth stage is transporting people to a mental health facility."

But two psychiatrists working in Victoria\u2019s public mental health sector, who requested anonymity, said they feared the department\u2019s \u201cvague\u201d guidelines about chemical restraint would spark anxiety among staff and could lead to greater workforce shortages. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what the threshold for chemical restraint is. The vagueness is confusing so any two clinicians could debate about whether something is or is not chemical restraint,\u201d one said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cI think we could struggle to retain staff if people are being asked to work in an unclear legal environment.\u201d The state\u2019s peak psychiatrist body says Victoria\u2019s health system is not ready to fully comply with the new act because of workforce gaps and a tight timeframe for understanding and implementing guidelines. Simon Stafrace, the Victorian chair of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, said the department had only provided mental health services with updated guidelines last week about restrictive intervention practices, including chemical restraint as well as physical restraint and seclusion. \u201cThe Victorian branch believes the sector is not ready to be fully compliant with the act by 1 September,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s more work to be done.\u201d Stafrace said there was uncertainty in the sector about how to implement technical elements of the legislation, particularly around the definition of chemical restraint compared with treatment. He said shortages of mental health professionals also remained a barrier to implementing the royal commission\u2019s recommendations. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to provide care that is orientated towards people\u2019s wishes \u2026 and to deliver on human rights considerations if you have time. And time comes with people,\u201d he said. He was confident the reform would improve treatment once fully implemented, but he said the sector had to ensure the transition did not have a negative impact on those who use the system. \u201cMany of us are concerned about the possibility that people will be demoralised, disappointed and distrustful if we don\u2019t get this right quickly,\u201d he said. The Andrews government has committed to stamping out seclusion and restraint in mental health facilities by 2031. This was a key recommendation of the state\u2019s mental health royal commission, which concluded some consumers had their human rights breached through compulsory treatment, seclusion and restraint. The government\u2019s interim aim is to reduce restrictive practices by 20% by April. Prof Patrick McGorry, a psychiatrist and the executive director of youth mental health body Orygen, said it was unlikely the interim April deadline would be met. \u201cWe\u2019d have to speed up the implementation of the royal commission for that to be achieved,\u201d he said. Craig Wallace, the chief executive of the Victorian Mental Illness Awareness Council, said the body wanted seclusion and restraint to end as quickly as possible. \u201cWe think a 10-year timeline is too long,\u201d he said. A 2022 report by the Victorian Mental Illness Awareness Council revealed the system was still secluding and restraining people more frequently and for longer than national averages. A Victorian government spokesperson said it was working hard to ensure the sector was ready and the workforce would be supported to deliver reform under the new legislation. \u201cThe new Mental Health and Wellbeing Act lays the foundation for delivering a transformed mental health system, embedding human rights and lived experience in every part of the new system,\u201d the spokesperson said."

            "date": "2023-08-15T17:54:21Z",
            "content": "Parents hope that when young people leave home to take up places at university they will thrive in the new environment. Often, it is teenagers\u2019 first experience of living independently. Nearly all will face some challenges. But in recent years, there have been a number of high-profile instances in which the strain has proved too much. Last week, the father of Jos Winfield, who took his own life in June, became the latest parent to issue a warning. Mark Winfield advised other parents of students to \u201ckeep a close eye on your kids\u201d studying away from home, and added his voice to a campaign to persuade universities to offer more support. Moving away to study for a degree is a rite of passage more common in the UK than many other countries. There is evidence that longstanding British convention is shifting, with one survey finding a sharp rise in the number of first-year students opting to remain in the family home, due to financial pressures. But of around 600,000 UK-domiciled young people due to start an undergraduate course this autumn, around two-thirds are expected to relocate. Earlier this year, the government rejected campaigners\u2019 calls to impose a statutory duty of care on universities. Universities UK argues that increased investment in mental health services would be more beneficial than legislation. But pressure on ministers and the sector is building. At the recent inquest into the death of Matthew Wickes, the coroner issued a \u201cprevention of future deaths\u201d report \u2013 highlighting potential risks \u2013 and suggested that there should be an early warning system to help identify students struggling with their mental health. Earlier this year, Sir Keir Starmer made reducing the number of suicides one of his key health policy pledges, and highlighted the toll of young lives in particular (men are statistically far more likely to kill themselves than women, although suicides of young women have recently risen). Such tragic incidents are widely acknowledged to form part of a bigger, and worrying, picture regarding young people\u2019s mental health and difficulty in accessing treatment. With the NHS waiting list at a record high of 7.6 million in England (around 2 million more are waiting for treatment in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales), investment in mental health services is desperately needed. But beyond the general lack of provision, and the particular stresses young people have been under \u2013 Covid caused problems for both Winfield and Wickes \u2013 there is a need for policies that pay attention to the specific needs of young adults. Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are only available up to age 18. Such limits enable bureaucratic systems to allocate resources. But older teenagers, including students, may have particular vulnerabilities \u2013 and do not automatically become mature on their 18th birthdays. Until 1969, the legal age of majority was 21, while recent science points to the continued development of the human brain until the mid-20s. With this in mind, there is a strong case for specialist young adult mental health services, not limited to universities. Meanwhile, there is a need for greater clarity from universities about their role in students\u2019 lives outside teaching hours. While academics are not counsellors, and cannot be expected to fill gaps in the health service on top of existing heavy workloads, all those responsible for the administration of higher education have a duty to think carefully about students\u2019 wellbeing. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

            "content": "An ever-worsening economic situation is hanging over Zimbabwean voters as they go to the polls in a repeat of the 2018 election pitting President Emmerson Mnangagwa against his charismatic and relatively youthful challenger, Nelson Chamisa. Mnangagwa narrowly defeated Chamisa five years ago after the coup that deposed Robert Mugabe, and pledged to to tackle the economy \u201chead on\u201d in his first term. However, unemployment, inflation and falls in the value of the Zimdollar have persisted. Eleven candidates are vying for top office but the real contest is between Mnangagwa, from the ruling Zanu-PF party, and Chamisa, of the Citizens Coalition for Change. In several poor townships of the capital, Harare, some people were at polling stations two hours before voting opened, fearing long lines. Chamisa has promised to turn around the country\u2019s fortunes and return Zimbabwe to the community of nations. He also pledged to fight corruption, and pay workers a minimum wage in US dollars. For his part, Mnangagwa claims to have made major strides towards getting the economy on track, in part by building infrastructure, and says Zimbabwe will be more prosperous if he gets another five years. Since repossessing land from white farm owners in 2000, Zimbabwe\u2019s economy has suffered a major collapse, as financial aid from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank dried up in the face of economic sanctions on Mugabe\u2019s administration. Unemployment and poverty levels remain high in the country once regarded as the bread basket of southern Africa. Despite claiming a bumper harvest, nearly 3.8 million people will go hungry this year. \u201cWe are going to restore the economy. We will get rid of the Zimbabwean dollar and put US dollars in your pockets,\u201d Chamisa said on Monday in Harare, to cheers from his supporters. About 6.6 million Zimbabweans are expected to vote for a new president, legislators and councillors in the second general election to be held since the end of Mugabe\u2019s 37-year-rule. Of the total number of voters, 1 million are be voting for the first time, most of whom have never experienced a prosperous Zimbabwe. \u201cAll I want is a decent job,\u201d Everjoy Mupazvirihwo, 26, an engineering graduate, said as he waved a yellow flag emblazoned with Chamisa\u2019s face on Monday. \u201cEver since I finished college, finding a job has been difficult. We are not asking for much.\u201d Observers have predicted an increased voter turnout in Wednesday\u2019s polls despite a crackdown on the opposition. In 2018, voter turnout was 75%, according to the electoral commission. Zimbabwe has a history of disputed and violent elections since it became independent from the UK in 1980. Human rights groups say the same factors that blighted previous elections \u2013 voter roll irregularities, public media bias, and the use of law enforcement and the courts to hamstring opposition campaigns \u2013 remain. Forty CCC supporters are in custody after being detained for attending a banned car rally last week. An opposition supporter died in early August after a group of people travelling to a rally were ambushed by suspected ruling party supporters. Human rights organisations have reported growing intimidation in rural areas, where Chamisa has described voters\u2019 choices as \u201cdeath or Zanu-PF\u201d. He told supporters on Monday: \u201cZimbabwe, try me. My hands have no blood. These hands are safe.\u201d The CCC leader claimed during campaigning that the electoral commission had refused to give him a full and searchable voters\u2019 roll and a copy of the ballot paper, among other complaints. His party has taken the commission to court over the issues, but no ruling has been made. The 45-year-old pastor and lawyer, who lost a constitutional court challenge to overturn Mnangagwa\u2019s narrow win in 2018, said he had briefed electoral observers about his concerns and that he had employed election agents to monitor the counting of ballots and avoid electoral \u201ctheft\u201d. Polling stations opened on Wednesday at 7am (0500 GMT) and close at 7pm, after which counting of votes will begin. To win the presidency, a candidate will need to get more than 50% of the vote and two-thirds of seats in parliament to claim a majority."

            "date": "2023-08-21T08:10:36Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s central bank has cut one of its key lending rates but left another unchanged, surprising economists who had expected more forceful action to support economic growth amid widespread concerns over its path. The world\u2019s second-largest economy is in the midst of a slowdown, and has slipped into deflation with prices falling year on year as slowing domestic spending weighs on the country\u2019s post-Covid economic recovery. The Chinese property industry is also in crisis, as the slowdown exposes overextended developers. Evergrande Group, once China\u2019s leading property developer, filed for bankruptcy protection in the US on Friday as it tried to restructure its large debts. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC), the central bank, has responded by cutting interest rates, but its latest move on Monday surprised economists, who had been expecting a bigger change. China trimmed its one-year loan prime rate, which is mainly used as the benchmark for corporate lending, from 3.55% to 3.45%, but left its five-year equivalent, mainly used to price mortgages, at 4.2%. Economists polled by Reuters had expected both rates to be cut, with a 0.15 percentage point reduction to both the central prediction. The central bank had surprised the market last week with a 0.15 percentage point decrease in its medium-term lending facility, a rate at which it lends to some banks. That was expected to push borrowing costs lower throughout the economy. Julian Evans-Pritchard and Zichun Huang, economists at the consultancy Capital Economics, said China was trying to balance efforts to stimulate the economy with concerns about the health of its banks. \u201cThe big picture is that the PBoC\u2019s approach to monetary policy is of limited use in the current environment and won\u2019t be enough, on its own at least, to put a floor beneath growth,\u201d they wrote. \u201cReviving demand would take much larger rate cuts, or regulatory measures to effectively restore confidence in the housing market.\u201d The pressures on the Chinese economy have been particularly evident in the property sector. As well as the heavily indebted Evergrande, its rival developer Country Garden is at risk of missing repayments on some of its borrowing, threatening the future of housing projects across China for which many households have already made payments. George Magnus, an author of several books on China\u2019s economy and an associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Centre, said the instability in the property market \u2013 about a quarter of the country\u2019s economy \u2013 could threaten financial stability and prompt social problems if developers cannot deliver pre-sold housing. \u201cFor the last 10 or 20 years, the market has been propped up by the government, and by official actions,\u201d he said on the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cEvery time the economy was weak there was borrowing to finance real estate construction and infrastructure. So this insulation of the property market from corrections is really just coming home to roost now.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-11T14:17:41Z",
            "content": "At a Politburo meeting last month, China\u2019s leaders referred to the economic recovery this year as \u201ctorturous\u201d. You won\u2019t often hear such candour coming from a Chinese Communist party institution, let alone such an elevated body. They were referring to current conditions, of course, but China\u2019s problems reveal much that is systemically out of kilter in its economic and political system. During the past few days, some of the statistics China has published have caused a stir. Consumer prices in July were lower than a year ago, suggesting it might be on the cusp of deflation, which reflects a chronic shortage of demand in the economy. And China\u2019s foreign trade in the same month showed a sharp fall in exports due to weak global demand, with a sharper decline in imports signifying weakness in demand at home. There were murky factors affecting both but the message is that something more serious is amiss in China. Indeed, China was widely expected to bounce back from the pandemic and there was a bit of a flurry early in 2023. Yet, consumption has generally been very subdued especially for big-ticket items such as cars and houses, and private investment, the backbone of China\u2019s economy, fell in the first half of this year, for the first time since such data was published many years ago. Private firms and entrepreneurs are not spending much on investment or on hiring people. Youth unemployment has topped 21%, or double what it is in the UK and almost three times the rate in the US. The annual graduation of 11-12 million students in the the summer is aggravating an already difficult situation because of the problems of finding suitable work, and also because the Chinese labour market has become one in which most jobs are in the lower-pay, low-skill, gig or informal economy compared with higher quality jobs in manufacturing and construction. It would be wrong though to pin this all on the pandemic. Most things weighing on China\u2019s economy have been building for several years, even while much of the world was wowed by China\u2019s global brands such as Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent and TikTok, property was booming, and China was leaving its footprint all over the world through the \u201cbelt and road\u201d initiative and its rising governance engagement with global entities such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization. In spite of its unequivocal accomplishments and successes, China has, during the past decade or more, spawned a mountain of bad debt, unprofitable and uncommercial infrastructure and real estate, empty apartment blocks and little-used apartments and transport facilities, and excess capacity in, for example, coal, steel, solar panels and electric vehicles. Productivity growth has stalled, and China can unfortunately boast one of the world\u2019s highest levels of inequality. It is ageing faster than any other country on the planet but with a skinny social security system in which most of its 290 million migrant workers are not eligible for most social benefits. Under Xi Jinping, moreover, it has also developed an increasingly repressive, state-centric and controlling governance system, both for political reasons and to deal with the effects of its failing development model. These are testing times for Chinese citizens, especially the fabled rising middle class whose savings have mostly found a home in an outsized real estate sector which has now entered a period of structural decline. Most of the housing stock, overbuilding, collapse in transactions and weakness in prices are not in big agglomerations such as Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai, but in hundreds of smaller cities and towns that rarely make news. China\u2019s leaders have been vocal this year about strengthening consumption and about improving the business environment for private firms and entrepreneurs, who have been pressured or punished to align their commercial interest with the party\u2019s political goals. We still await evidence that such rhetoric has substance. In the coming weeks and months, we should probably expect the authorities to ease financial and budgetary policies, housing regulations, and borrowing caps to finance infrastructure. There might even be measures that look consumer-friendly but also fail to boost the income that alone can sustain higher consumption. These things may give the economy a temporary lift over the winter but the underlying weakness of the economy and the greater authoritarianism that China features are now two sides of the same coin that seem irreversible, certainly for the time being. It is a moot point whether this sort of China in the 2020s is a bigger threat to geopolitical stability than one in which it confidently strides the world stage and is able to brush aside liberal leaning democracies and reframe global governance in its interests. But a crucial one to get right. George Magnus is a research associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Centre and at Soas, and author of Red Flags: Why Xi\u2019s China is in Jeopardy"

            "date": "2023-08-08T15:00:31Z",
            "content": "Is the Australian economy on a recessionary knife-edge or holding up well despite a dozen domestic interest rate rises and those global headwinds we\u2019ve been hearing all about? A slew of economic surveys, including several out on Tuesday, point to contradictory trends that signal either deepening despair or remarkable resilience. For Luke Achterstraat, the chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (Cosboa), \u201cit\u2019s a bit of a conundrum\u201d trying to assess the health of the economy and, hence, whether the Reserve Bank\u2019s interest rate rises are done. The group\u2019s latest quarterly small and micro business index compiled with data group Square found companies\u2019 revenue growth has been steady for some time in the face of soaring borrowing costs. Achterstraat said the survey found the labour market remained extremely tight. Anecdotally, he cited the case of a retailer of gas-fired fireplaces in inner Sydney\u2019s Marrickville which could not find a retail assistant to work on Thursday nights and Saturdays despite offering about $80,000 a year. And, counter to the doomsayers, the economy added a net 11,349 new businesses in the June quarter, rebounding in recent months, Cosboa said. NAB\u2019s monthly business survey for July also reinforced signs companies were yet to declare a big deterioration. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Overall conditions eased one point last month but remained positive (at +10 points). Trading conditions, employment and profitability were all steady and positive. Business confidence even rose 2 points to be +2. These numbers challenge \u201cexpectations that the economy would continue to cool as 2023 wears on\u201d, NAB said in its accompanying commentary. NAB is alone among the big four banks to predict another RBA rate rise. Its chief economist, Alan Oster, said the survey reinforced his prediction the central bank would hoist borrowing costs from 4.1% to 4.35%, probably in November. Westpac\u2019s surveys add to evidence of conflicting economic currents. Its business bank last month published data showing firms had built up savings and had credit lines necessary to ride out a sharp downturn should one occur. Besa Deda, the chief economist at Westpac\u2019s business bank, said companies\u2019 \u201cstarting position is a strong one \u2026 which will assist them with weathering the next cycle\u201d. Deda noted firms\u2019 capacity utilisation increased almost a full percentage point in July to 84.5%, not far shy of the all-time high of 86.2%. Any moderation in business credit growth should remain gradual, she said. That confidence, though, is not matched by Westpac\u2019s surveys of how consumers view their world. Its latest report showed another modest drop in August, with sentiment as dim as during the depths of the global financial crisis 15 years ago and the worst of the Covid pandemic. Consumers, perhaps surprisingly, reported feeling less cheery after the RBA left its key interest rate unchanged on 1 August for a second month in a row. In fact, so despondent were shoppers that two-thirds expected the central bank to lift rates further in the year ahead. Remarkably, \u201cnearly half of this group [was] expecting a rise of over 1 percentage point\u201d, Westpac said, a gloom reading beyond that of the most hawkish of economist forecasts. Paul Zahra, the chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, said his industry was already experiencing a downturn somewhat masked by broad-based assessments of the economy. \u201cBy our assessment, retail is down by every indicator,\u201d Zahra said, particularly when spending is adjusted for inflation. He said there was \u201can absolute collision\u201d between a cost-of-living crisis and a cost-of-doing-business crisis: \u201cFrom wages, to leases, to insurance, to utilities \u2013 all costs are going up.\u201d NAB\u2019s July survey of business also identified that quickening of labour cost growth, with the quarterly pace accelerating to 3.7% in July from 2.3% in June. One factor was the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decisions, which lifted some wages by 8.6%. Zahra said Father\u2019s Day on 3 September, the last big gift-giving day between now and Christmas, would be among upcoming gauges of the vitality of the retail sector. A recent survey by his association predicted spending would drop about 1.3% from last year to $860m. And if the RBA opted to lift the cash rate one more time, he hopes it doesn\u2019t come in November, as NAB, for one, forecasts. \u201cThat would be devastating for the retail community \u2026 you\u2019re really impacting Christmas sales by that stage.\u201d"

            "content": "Success in limiting global warming will spare Australia a sharp fall in economic activity but would see coal exports fall to a trickle by 2063 under a low-emissions scenario, according to the government\u2019s intergenerational report. The report, to be released in full on Thursday, will provide much greater detail on the range of impacts and their scale in a warming world than the five previous intergenerational reports. Should temperature increases exceed 2C above pre-industrial times \u2013 the upper limit of the Paris climate accord \u2013 Australia would face \u201csignificant real, tangible and direct impacts\u201d across a range of sectors. Productivity will fall because of the hotter conditions, sapping the economy of between $135bn and $423bn in today\u2019s dollars, the report said, according to an extract released by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers. Should temperature increases reach 3C, the cost to GDP could rise a further $155bn, with 16-41m additional hours of work lost. \u201cIn the absence of adaptation measures Australian crop yields could be up to 4% lower by 2063 in a scenario where global mitigation does not keep temperature increases below 3C this century,\u201d it said, adding yield reductions could be largely avoided if temperatures rises were kept below 2C. Tourism, too, would suffer in a warming world, with at least 50% of the nation\u2019s sandy coastline at peril because of rising sea levels. In addition, \u201cmany of Australia\u2019s top attractions are also in regions likely to be increasingly susceptible to natural disasters, risking travel disruption and reputational harm,\u201d it said, noting that the 2019-20 black summer bushfires triggered cancelations or postponements of 80,000 tourism activities. \u201cWe take our responsibility to address climate change very seriously,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cIn little over a year, Australia has gone from a global embarrassment to a global leader in how we\u2019re responding to the threat of global warming.\u201d The first IGR, released by then treasurer Peter Costello two decades ago, made just two references to climate change. Subsequent reports have increased their attention to the impacts of a warming world, but made little effort to model them. The 2021 IGR, presented by Chalmers\u2019 predecessor, Josh Frydenberg, noted that three nations that had committed to net zero emissions \u2013 Japan, South Korea and China \u2013 accounted for 87% of Australia\u2019s LNG export value, 74% of Australia\u2019s thermal coal export value and 55% of Australia\u2019s metallurgical coal export value. This report \u2013 the sixth IGR \u2013 said a 2C temperature limit scenario would see thermal coal exports halve from current volumes by 2063. Should warming be kept to 1.5C, the lower end of the Paris accord, such exports of the fossil fuel burnt in power stations would be just 1% of present levels. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Against that reduction, global demand for lithium, a mineral used in battery production, would be expected to expand eightfold from current levels in a 1.5C scenario. Australia\u2019s temperatures have already warmed by about 1.47C since 1910, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Should the world remain on track for a 3C warming level since 1850 by 2100, Australia\u2019s average temperatures are projected to rise 1.7C over the coming 40 years, the IGR said. However, the increase will not be uniform, with central and northern Western Australia projected to warm 1.8C while Tasmania\u2019s increase will be 1.3C. \u201cSome regional and remote communities, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, are expected to be particularly exposed to higher temperatures,\u201d it said. \u201cThis highlights the need for effective mitigation of further temperature increases and targeted investment in adaptation.\u201d Much of the impacts of global heating will come from extreme events rather than average adjustments. \u201cIncreased frequency and severity of natural disasters could increase the commonwealth government\u2019s disaster recovery funding arrangements expenditure between 3 to 3.6 times by 2063,\u201d it said. The report noted that while there was \u201csignificant uncertainty around these estimates, findings from global climate and agricultural models suggest other countries in our region may be even more affected than Australia\u201d. \u201cThis could result in heightened demand for Australian agricultural exports over time, assuming the sector is able to position itself \u2013 for example, through adjusting the types of crops grown in certain regions \u2013 to increase production,\u201d it said. \u201cWe know the world\u2019s climate emergency is not only a moral imperative but regional Australia\u2019s jobs opportunity,\u201d the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are committed to become a renewable energy superpower to provide cleaner, cheaper energy to Australians and the world.\u201d"

It was Simms\u2019s second year of a Comparative Studies degree and the university\u2019s second year of existence. The student population totalled an intimate 410 (today there are 13,000 undergrads). \u2018I hated it at first,\u2019 said Simms. \u2018I wanted to be part of a big, impersonal mass.\u2019 Now, though, she shared the collective nostalgia for the first year\u2019s \u2018country-club atmosphere\u2019. The campus was a work in progress: the library was three Nissen huts, there was only one purpose-built hall of residence and \u2018the students have to live and work surrounded by building site and mud,\u2019 the article explained. \u2018There\u2019s never any quiet,\u2019 Simms complained, but there were compensations: \u2018The freedom is marvellous.\u2019 With its diplomas poised to gain degree status, the Royal College of Art had less to prove. Alumni had already won over the likes of the Ministry of Transport (road sign design), Coventry Cathedral (stained glass) and London Transport (the Victoria line). The fine art department had incubated the whole Pop Art phenomenon (\u2018to the bewilderment of some of the staff\u2019) and the \u2018flamboyant and publicity conscious\u2019, fashion department was on a mission to \u2018pull the English trade out of dreariness\u2019. Various famous RCA alumni got a namecheck \u2013 Peter Blake, David Hockney, Bridget Riley \u2013 but there\u2019s another lurking in a pic of the painting school, back to camera in front of a canvas painted with SPIV in block letters. The caption reads \u2018Third-year student Ian Dury, pictured on the left working on his \u201cspiv\u201d.\u2019"

The Nasdaq stock index, of which Nvidia is a member, rose by 0.8%, while the S&amp;P 500 also gained 0.4%. The Dow Jones was roughly flat. Nvidia shares rose by 5%. Nvidia\u2019s performance is being driven in particular by the AI boom, which has tripled the value of its shares this year and given it a market value of more than $1tn, the Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies reports: The US gains followed the FTSE 100, which edged up by 0.2% by Thursday afternoon, and the Stoxx 600, which showed that blue-chip stocks across Europe had also gained ground. In other business news today: UK retail sales dropped at the fastest rate since March 2021, according to the Confederation of British Industry. UK interest rates will peak at 5.5% next month as Bank of England policymakers try to minimise the impact of higher borrowing costs on the UK economy and avoid a prolonged recession, economists predict. Britain faces a stark choice between paying higher taxes or accepting an inevitable deterioration in public services and the welfare state, a report says. In an in-depth study of the UK tax system, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank said the already high level of taxes and the weak prospects for growth meant voters faced a tough choice. A fifth delay on the introduction of post-Brexit import checks on food and fresh produce arriving in Britain is to be officially announced imminently. Fossil fuels benefited from record subsidies of $13m (\u00a310.3m) a minute in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund, despite being the primary cause of the climate crisis.

JJ UK to delay post-Brexit food checks \u2013 for fifth time A fifth delay on the introduction of post-Brexit import checks on food and fresh produce arriving in Britain is to be officially announced imminently, the Guardian understands. The decision to once again push back plans to enforce the controls \u2013 which have been in place for exports from the UK to the EU \u2013 is linked to concerns that the move could further fuel food price inflation during the cost of living crisis, while traders have also asked for more time to adapt to the new rules. The plan to delay the new border controls has been backed by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, according to the Financial Times, which broke the news earlier this month that the postponement was on the way. The government\u2019s post-Brexit border strategy, including inspections of animal and plant products arriving in Britain, was originally supposed to be introduced in 2021. According to the most recent timetable, import checks had been expected to introduced in three stages over the course of a year, beginning with new paperwork requirements \u2013 including health certificates for certain animal and plant products, as well as high risk food products \u2013 from the end of October this year. Meanwhile, physical checks at the UK border had been expected to begin on 31 January 2024. However, after the latest delay, the schedule has moved back by three months, according to the FT, meaning that new paperwork will not be needed until the end of January, while physical inspections of goods will not start until the end of April. You can read the full story here: More food for thought for Jerome Powell et al.: the number of people claiming US unemployment benefits fell to 236,000 last week, down from 240,000 the week before. That was 10,000 less than expected according to economists polled by Reuters. That means there is not much sign of a big increase in the number of people out of work, which might have been the thing to persuade Powell that interest rate rises have gone far enough. In other US data, durable goods orders dropped 5.2% in July, 1.2 percentage points more than expected. So that, on the other hand, is a possible sign of a slowdown. It\u2019s late August, which for most people in Europe and the US means summer holidays. But for central bankers it means something else: time for the Jackson Hole economic symposium. The gathering is held in a resort in Wyoming, and is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (which, confusingly, is in the state of Missouri). It gives central bankers the chance to talk in a slightly less formal setting than usual (and also a chance to pose in front of the mountains without ties on). Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell is the main draw at the conference this year. Economists around the world will be perusing his speech tomorrow for signs that US interest rates may have peaked. They may be disappointed, says the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott. The chair of the Federal Reserve will leave the door ajar for further increases in US borrowing costs over the coming months should inflationary pressures persist. But after sending markets into a tailspin last year by spelling out the Fed\u2019s determination to tame inflation, Powell is expected to give a more nuanced speech to an audience gathered in the Rocky Mountains resort town. Share prices fell sharply last year after he ripped up his planned speech and instead delivered a surprisingly hawkish message, but after subsequently raising US interest rates to their highest level in more than two decades, official borrowing costs are now thought to be at or close to their peak. The usual lack of much else going on in global markets means that the speeches can move markets quite significantly. The below charts from Scotiabank show that those moves can go either way, and the S&amp;P 500 share index once lost 3% on the first day of the gathering. Ikea has delayed the opening of its new store on London\u2019s Oxford Street because of issues with renovating the listed building it has chosen. The world\u2019s biggest furniture retailer bought the building that once housed clothing retailer Topshop\u2019s flagship, in something of a departure from its usual focus on huge out-of-town stores. But the refurbishment has been delayed by a year, the company said on Thursday. Ingka Investment, the investment arm of the retail group, bought the Grade II listed building at 214 Oxford Street after Topshop owner Arcadia fell into administration, Press Association reports: The renovation project at the site is creating a new 82,000 square feet store covering three floors, along with four floors of office space. The new store, offering around 6,000 different products, will include a showroom, market hall, and a Swedish deli serving Ikea\u2019s famous meatballs. Ingka Investments managing director Peter van der Poel said: When refurbishing this over 100-year-old historic landmark, it\u2019s important for us as an investor to treat the building with care and to preserve its characteristics and atmosphere. At the same time, we want to upgrade it to today\u2019s standards with the best possible sustainability credentials. To ensure all of this, the extensive refurbishment will take more time than initially anticipated and Ikea Oxford Street city store is now expected to open in 2024. European gas prices have dropped back sharply after a deal to avert a strike at one of Australia\u2019s key supply facilities. The price of benchmark Dutch transfer title facility (TTF) futures dropped by 6% from highs of \u20ac54.90 per MWh to \u20ac52.03. It had earlier fallen as low as \u20ac48.50. Reuters reports: Woodside Energy on Thursday reached an in-principle agreement with unions at Australia\u2019s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, potentially averting a disruption to supplies from one of the world\u2019s biggest exporters of the super-chilled fuel. The project in Western Australia, along with the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG facilities of Chevron Corp, account for about one-tenth of global supplies. Both Woodside and the union alliance representing workers at the offshore platforms of its North West Shelf facility announced the initial deal in separate statements after a round of talks both sides deemed positive. The move down will be a relief for European gas consumers, who are increasingly reliant on imports from non-Russian sources after its invasion of Ukraine. The below chart shows the chaos caused in the European gas market as countries scrambled to find other sources of LNG. Here is the CBI\u2019s retail sales chart, which illustrates the struggles of the retail sector and the UK consumer: The pandemic lockdowns obviously wreaked havoc on retail sales patterns \u2013 people spent a lot less on non-food items when locked in at home. But compared to the pre-pandemic period, even during the years of austerity and stagnating wages, the balance of retailers seeing falling sales only dropped as low once. The latest struggles are likely an effect of the cost of living crisis, caused by persistent inflation. In the last 25 years, UK inflation had only briefly risen above 5% for two brief periods. But the energy crisis, exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, pushed it above 11% last autumn, its highest in 40 years. UK retail sales volumes dropped in the year to August at the fastest pace since coronavirus pandemic lockdowns in March 2021, according to new data from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The balance of retailers that reported a sales decline rose to 44%, a level seen only once between the pandemic and the global financial crisis in 2008, according to a weighted poll of CBI retailer members, which is concentrated among the largest companies (albeit with significant changes since the scandal over sexual misconduct). Sales are expected to continue to contract next month, but at a slower pace, the survey found. Martin Sartorius, the CBI\u2019s principal economist, said: Retail sales in August fell at their quickest pace in over two years, culminating a summer that many retailers would rather forget. Against a backdrop of rising interest rates and weak demand, retailers foresee cuts to investment over the next year, while employment is expected to fall again next month. While the economists polled by Reuters may be thinking that the Bank of England\u2019s key rate will peak at 5.5%, financial traders are still betting on a slightly higher and later top. Trading data shows that there is an 89% chance of a rate hike at the next meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee on 21 September. But financial markets are still pricing in a 75% chance that bank rate will rise once more after that \u2013 to 5.75% on 2 November. Interest rate derivatives (which people use to manage the risk of rates rising/speculate) are handy for showing what traders believe is coming down the track. The below table is a bit dense, but bear with us: the right-hand side shows the implied probability for each level of interest rates at each scheduled meeting for the next year. The table tells us that markets are still pricing in a one-in-three chance that rates will rise as high as 6% by February. It could be a tough winter for the UK economy (although monetary policy has a lag of about 18 months, so it would mostly be the effects of previous hikes affecting the economy by then). Of course, these probabilities aren\u2019t gospel: it is just the bets of millions of traders around the world. They can all be wrong \u2013 and everything could be tipped by an odd word from Andrew Bailey. UK interest rates will peak at 5.5% next month as Bank of England policymakers try to minimise the impact of higher borrowing costs on the UK economy and avoid a prolonged recession, economists predict. A fresh poll of economists by Reuters suggests the Bank will approve a 15th consecutive increase in interest rates at its next meeting on 21 September as part of efforts to combat price inflation, which is still more than three times higher than its 2% target. All but one of the 62 economists surveyed said they expected the Bank\u2019s base rate to rise by a quarter of a percentage point next month, taking rates from 5.25% to 5.5%. The only outlier expected a half-point hike, which would take rates to 6%. The Bank has been raising rates at a clip in an effort to lower surging inflation, which peaked at 11.1% last October and has since eased to 6.8% in July. You can read the full story here: The Nasdaq stock index is expected to jump by 1.2% when it opens later, according to futures trading. The blockbuster Nvidia results are the key driver, with the S&amp;P 500 blue-chip index also due to gain 0.6%. Nvidia is itself listed on the Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted towards big tech stocks. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, an investment platform, said: The chip specialist has been one of \u2018The Magnificent Seven\u2019 stocks driving US markets this year, with its shares up 243% since the start of 2023. It\u2019s been one of the market superstars and given investors hope that it is still possible to make good money from equities in an environment where interest rates continue to go up and inflation remains sticky in places. Any disappointment in its latest results would have gone down like a lead balloon. It could have hurt investor sentiment and caused contagion elsewhere in the markets. Fortunately, it\u2019s pulled another rabbit out of the hat and given investors everything they wanted and more. This appears to have sprinkled some magic dust on the markets and provided new impetus to share prices. The rest of the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla) all saw their shares rise in after-hours trading following Nvidia\u2019s results, and on European markets we\u2019ve seen tech-related stocks such as ASML and Scottish Mortgage move higher. The Unite union has called off strike action by bus drivers at Gatwick airport this weekend after accepting an improved pay offer, it said. Members of the union working at ground handlers Red Handling and Wilson James, who transported passengers to planes, have agreed to pay rises worth 14% and 16% respectively, plus better sick pay and other benefits, Unite said. The union said there is no other strike action scheduled at the airport, as the end of the summer holiday season approaches. A record number of people in the UK have asked for help with their energy bills before winter has even begun, according to Citizens Advice, in a worrying sign of the difficulties facing British households. The charity said that it estimates that 7.8m people in the UK had to borrow to pay their energy bills in first six months of 2023. The UK\u2019s energy regulator, Ofgem, is due to publish its latest energy price cap tomorrow. The average annual household energy bill is expected to fall to about \u00a31,823, according to forecaster Cornwall Insights. But that will not provide much help households who are already struggling to pay bills in summer, outside the heating season. Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the government should help people with their bills through the winter ahead. What we saw last winter must never be repeated. Struggling households unable to pay their energy bills, people unable to top up their prepayment meter, and record numbers coming to us for crisis support. With increasing numbers of people we help facing a negative budget, where they simply don\u2019t have enough to cover their essential bills, there is a real risk this winter will be worse. Here is the background on the energy price cap (which is better thought of as a maximum price per unit of energy) from our story last week: The energy price cap was introduced in January 2019, and before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine accelerated a global energy crisis it had always sat at below \u00a31,300 a year. Its rapid rise ever since, which prompted the government to supersede the cap with an energy price guarantee, has reignited concerns that bills are unaffordable for millions of household living in fuel poverty and has prompted fresh calls for a cheaper \u201csocial tariff\u201d for the most vulnerable. Absent the energy price guarantee \u2013 a subsidy for every household \u2013 average bills will actually be higher this winter between January and March, Citizens Advice said: it was \u00a3141.33 this year but will rise to \u00a3173.55 in 2024 if current forecasts hold. Disabled people, single parents and low-income households earning less than \u00a329,000 will be the hardest hit this winter, it added. If Nvidia and computer chip stocks are on the crest of an artificial intelligence wave, here is an example of a stock whose wave has certainly broken: exercise bike company Peloton. Peloton was once the darling of the coronavirus pandemic-era stock market, with a market value approaching $50bn (\u00a339bn) at the height of the bubble as investors raced to buy shares for the stay-at-home (for the middle class at least) economy. It is safe to say that bubble has burst, and its shares hit another record low last night after it missed profit expectations and said subscribers to its exercise videos \u2013 streamed through the screen attached to the bike \u2013 dropped. It partly blamed a recall of its bike seat post after US regulators raised safety fears. Shares in the company slumped by as much as a quarter as low as $5.05 on Wednesday, down from above $170 at the height of the pandemic. Also of note: European semiconductor companies are among the big winners this morning, borrowing momentum from Nvidia. ASM International, ASML, Aixtron and BE Semiconductor have each gained between 2.6% and 4.3% in early trading. European shares have gained across the board in the opening trades, as expected. Here are the snaps from Reuters: EUROPE\u2019S STOXX 600 UP 0.7% BRITAIN\u2019S FTSE 100 UP 0.7% FRANCE\u2019S CAC 40 UP 1.0%, SPAIN\u2019S IBEX UP 0.8% EURO STOXX INDEX UP 0.9%; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS UP 1.0% GERMANY\u2019S DAX UP 1% Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Stock markets have gained ground after chipmaker Nvidia late last night showed that it is still riding high on the boom in generative artificial intelligence. Shares in the chipmaker rose by 7% in after-hours trading, meaning they are likely to open at a record high later today. The top line: The chipmaker Nvidia has far surpassed quarterly expectations, raking in $13.5bn in revenue \u2013 over $2bn more than the $11.2bn Wall Street analysts had predicted \u2013 amid skyrocketing demand for its computer chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The blockbuster second quarter comes at a moment of intense hype around generative AI, a mood that Nvidia has been uniquely positioned to capture. The 30-year-old company is one of the biggest winners in the AI boom and is now valued at over $1tn, with its chips powering nearly all the world\u2019s major artificial intelligence apps, including ChatGPT. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index is up 2.2%, while Shanghai Stock Exchange\u2019s composite index has gained 0.4% with a few minutes of trading to go. Futures suggest that the FTSE 100 and Germany\u2019s Dax benchmark index will gain 0.6% on opening this morning. It is not just Nvidia that has boosted the mood. In the sometimes upside-down world of financial markets, weak US and European economic data may have helped the stock market. The purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) numbers from S&amp;P Global (which bought IHS Markit) delivered a round of negative news for the global economy yesterday. Analysts at Deutsche Bank, led by Henry Allen, wrote: Concerns about a hard landing gathered pace over the last 24 hours, which triggered a major rally as speculation mounted that central banks might press pause on their rate hikes. Those fears were driven by several factors, but the biggest were the downside surprises in the flash PMIs, which suggested the global economy was quite a bit weaker in August than previously thought. US mortgage rates have also hit their highest since 2000, and US jobs numbers may also be revised lower, further denting support for more rate hikes. The key issue will be the response of central bankers, who have gathered for their annual shindig starting today at the Wyoming resort of Jackson Hole. If they indicate that their appetites for higher interest rates may be waning, then expect that to light the touchpaper for a further share price rally.

But all I\u2019ve managed to transmit is a violent fear of rodents, and even that, to only one of them. I didn\u2019t realise how successful I\u2019d been until a couple of years ago, when we saw a mouse in my son\u2019s bedroom. I screamed; he screamed. I jumped on the bed; he jumped on a chair \u2013 but it was a revolving one, so he started spinning round, screaming, and I screamed more. Mr Z ran in expecting an intruder, though I notice he didn\u2019t bring anything to use as a weapon. As much as I reviled it, I felt a bit sorry for the mouse. It was all so ultra. Consequent to this very noisy, melodramatic phobia, it pleases my associates to tell me stories about mice and rats, which, generally speaking, aren\u2019t true. My brother-in-law told me that, if they have a rat problem on a building site, they contain all the rats in a zone where the only food source is each other, until finally they have one giant rat, and they shoot it in the head. It stalks my dreams, this mutant rat cannibal, even though it makes no sense. On holiday, my friend told me there was a rat in the kitchen, and while I could recognise this at 50 paces as the title of a popular song, I nevertheless believed that there was also a real rat, in the kitchen. This is the backdrop to just another Friday night in a pub garden, when a character I didn\u2019t see, as I had my back to him, streaked across some flower pots, almost exactly at the level of our necks. He \u2013 rats are only ever male in my neurotic imaginings, mice are only ever female \u2013 was as big as a cat, and as fearless as a wolf. This was all described to me in florid detail by those around the table who saw him, who I chose not to believe, as I\u2019ve been fooled so often. The problem with rats is that you can only smell them once they\u2019re dead. It would be much more useful, from an avoidance perspective, to be able to smell them when they\u2019re alive. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"

            "date": "2023-08-25T12:27:09Z",
            "content": "A \u201csignificant minority\u201d of landlords and letting agents may not be following consumer protection rules, according to the UK\u2019s competition watchdog, which raised concerns including complaints about onerous guarantees, discrimination against certain types of tenants and fees charged to older people entering retirement housing. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) laid out on Friday the focus of its work on the housing market, after announcing in February it would look into the private rental and housebuilding sectors. Among the competition concerns in the market are the large amounts of land owned by housing developers but not built on, known as land banks, as well as charges for owners of properties built on new housing estates. Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: \u201cThe CMA alone can\u2019t resolve the problems in the UK housing market. But we have a role to play and will do our part to help ensure the private rental and housebuilding markets work better for people and businesses.\u201d Since launching its study into the housing market in February, the CMA said consumers and others in the industry had contacted it to raise concerns about five areas of private housing rental. The study comes at a time when private rents in Britain have reached record highs, running well ahead of inflation, and there have been reports of queues of prospective tenants for available properties. Concerns about the private rental market raised with the CMA included zero deposit schemes, where tenants are not required to pay a large deposit when beginning a tenancy but may be unaware of their liabilities. Sham licences, where tenants were told by landlords that they only had a licence to occupy a property rather than having the full consumer rights of an assured tenancy, were also raised as a concern. The watchdog is looking into onerous guarantee clauses faced by some tenants, where they faced hefty obligations when renting a property, such as having to provide extensive evidence of assets. The CMA is also reviewing unlawful discrimination against certain tenants, where some properties are advertised as not being available to housing benefit claimants, with \u201cno DSS\u201d being written on housing adverts. In addition, the watchdog has received complaints about \u201cevent fees\u201d sometimes charged to vulnerable tenants entering specialist retirement housing, which it will review to see whether certain businesses are taking advantage of elderly consumers. Cardell said the watchdog was \u201ctaking action to provide updated guidance for lettings agents so that both tenants and landlords are really clear about their own rights and responsibilities\u201d. If any agency or landlord is found to be breaching consumer protection law, the watchdog said it would not rule out launching enforcement action. In addition, the CMA is investigating the economic conditions affecting the housebuilding sector, as well as looking into concerns raised by campaign groups, councils and housing developers. The watchdog is investigating the huge swathes of land held by the UK\u2019s largest housebuilders, and analysis shows that these have grown in size in recent years, prompting concerns that this might be limiting competition or slowing the rate of housebuilding in some areas. It will also look into whether complex planning rules and uncertainty about decision-making is hindering the building of new homes, especially those from smaller housing developers. It will also consider whether there is enough competition among housebuilders in certain areas, and whether smaller and medium-sized companies are able to compete. Among other issues raised were estate management charges, which have to be paid by owners of properties built on new housing estates built over the past five years and not \u201cadopted\u201d by their local authority, meaning that amenities including roads, parks and street lights have to be maintained by a private management company. Cardell said once its housing work was complete, it would consider \u201cwhat actions the CMA can take to tackle any concerns identified or whether there are more effective ways to deal with those concerns, such as through recommendations to government for legislative change\u201d. The CMA will provide updates on its work in the private rental and housebuilding sector in the autumn."

            "title": "UK jobs market is cooling despite record pay growth",
            "date": "2023-08-15T08:31:51Z",
            "content": "After months in which it has defied gravity, a prolonged period of flatlining growth has finally caught up with the UK labour market. The latest bulletin from the Office for National Statistics shows unmistakeable signs of weakness. Employment and job vacancies were down, while unemployment and redundancies were up. These are all evidence of the labour market softening and will be seen by the Bank of England as proof that the 14 increases in interest rates since December 2021 are having an impact. There was a fall of 66,000 in employment in the three months to June, and while the ONS cautions against reading too much into the monthly figures, there was a massive drop of 567,000 in employment in June alone. Despite a fresh increase in the number of people inactive because of long-term sickness, more people have been looking for jobs in recent months in response to the squeeze on household budgets caused by the cost of living crisis. The combination of weaker demand for labour and a rise in the supply of workers meant the unemployment rate rose by 0.3 percentage points to 4.2% between the first and second quarters of 2023. The jobless rate in June was 4.6%. The one exception to this evidence of a cooling labour market was annual pay growth, which at 7.8% was the highest since modern records began in 2001. Including bonuses, the figure was even higher at 8.2%, although that was mainly because of a one-off payment to NHS staff. That level of earnings increase may well persuade the Bank of England to announce yet another increase in interest rates when its monetary policy committee (MPC) meets next month. For the first time since inflation started to soar, growth in total pay is running ahead of price increases. The question for the Bank is whether that level of earnings growth is likely to be sustained as jobs become harder to find, given that the official data for earnings reflects conditions as they were a few months ago rather than current demand for workers. Samuel Tombs, a UK analyst at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says it usually takes time for changes in the labour market to feed through to wage growth, and that earnings growth may well have topped out. Several survey indicators now point to slowing wage increases, Tombs notes. \u201cFor instance, the net balance of recruiters reporting that salaries are rising for new hires fell to a 27-month low in July, and now is below its average in the second half of the 2010s, according to the report on jobs survey.\u201d Even with the labour market turning downwards, Tombs thinks the MPC will push up rates from 5.25% to 5.5% in September. Ruth Gregory, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, agrees. Both, though, think that will be the peak. The risks of interest rate overkill are rising fast."

            "content": "There is a chart in the Bank of England\u2019s latest report on the economy which illustrates that price gouging may still be a factor in pushing up inflation. What unions and academics have complained about for more than two years \u2013 and policymakers at the central bank have downplayed \u2013 is that corporate profits could be pumping up inflation as much as rising wages. The chart tells us that prices in the shops are rising when the costs of production remain much the same. Customers are paying 8% more for their goods than last year, despite an easing of supply chain pressures and a fall in commodity prices that mean it costs no more to produce goods now than it did in the summer of 2022. Producer price inflation is close to zero. It is the first time such a gap has opened up since the 2008 financial crash, and the Bank says it is struggling to find an answer. Usually, a competitive market for goods means that a fall in the wholesale price leads to a fall in the retail price. As the Bank says in the report: \u201cThat relationship would suggest that goods price inflation could decline sharply in the near term.\u201d But its forecasts appear to accept the gap will continue, because it thinks other factors are at play \u2013 and not just greedy businesses, mostly large and with a strong marketing presence, making sizeable windfall profits. Chief among the other factors are energy costs, which the figures for factory prices exclude. The report argues that while the price of gas and electricity has fallen steeply this year, it is possible a majority of companies were panicked into buying long-term, fixed-price energy contracts when prices were high, and those contracts have yet to run out. Manufacturers are heavy users of gas and electricity, and so it could be that their costs are high compared with a year ago and it is legitimate for them to continue passing on the difference to their customers. The data also excludes the impact of rising import prices, leaving companies that rely on foreign partners for components in a worse position than those that source components from domestic suppliers. Officials at the Bank think these reasons are more likely than price gouging, although they concede firms may be jacking up prices for a last hurrah before consumers cotton on to the idea that inflation is not a thing any more and that price rises should not be tolerated. \u201cIt is possible that consumer-facing firms have sought to rebuild margins. But there is not much evidence at the whole-economy level that firms have increased their margins so far,\u201d the Bank says. That would seem to flatten the idea of greedflation. Margins are the same, so nothing to see here. Yet margins being the same is a huge boon for businesses. To have maintained margins in a period as difficult and uncertain as the last three years is a colossal victory. And stable profit margins must mean higher prices above and beyond the increase in running costs. Otherwise margins would fall. Nestl\u00e9 and Procter &amp; Gamble, which fill UK supermarket shelves with their products, are the clearest examples of firms that have maintained or improved margins, allowing them to maintain dividends throughout the crisis period. There are plenty more highlighted in research by the Unite union, based on analysis of company reports. In the spring, Which? made an assessment of supermarket food prices and found Aldi and Lidl were to blame for the steepest increases in everyday groceries. The price of some items had doubled in a year, the consumer champion said. Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Waitrose all took their lead from the German discounters. They are cutting prices now, and margins are suffering a little, but not to the extent that they have fallen to anywhere near pre-pandemic levels. The Bank of England doesn\u2019t ask questions about the profits made by businesses that make the goods and services that drive inflation. It waits to see data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) about company profitability before making a judgment. The ONS will produce the latest wages data this week for the year to June. By contrast, the profitability data is eight months out of date. Nevertheless, it shows margins stable over the two years to the end of December 2022 \u2013 a period when household incomes were falling. There must be a reason the Bank focuses on labour and not capital when it makes its assessment of prices across the economy, and it won\u2019t be the timeliness of the data. Governor Andrew Bailey must have called for wage restraint 10 times for every one he has mentioned companies and their profits. It\u2019s a bias that deflects from one of the main causes of inflation and should be corrected."

            "content": "Tourist attraction, backdrop to millions of selfies and one of the world\u2019s most easily identifiable landmarks. Cape Town\u2019s Table Mountain is all of these things, but now it has found a new role: as a guide to what will happen to UK interest rates. For Huw Pill the opportunity was too good to pass up. Invited by South Africa\u2019s central bank to speak at a high-level conference, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist said there were two ways for Threadneedle Street to bring UK inflation back to the government\u2019s 2% target. One was the Matterhorn model, named after the jagged 4,478-metre high peak in the Alps, under which interest rates would go up sharply and come down sharply. Alternatively, the Bank could go down the Table Mountain route. This approach would involve a lower peak (the mountain rises to 1,085 metres) but then stay at a high altitude for a considerable period. The flat plateau above Cape Town is approximately 1.9 miles (3km) from side to side. Pill said his preference was for Table Mountain over the Matterhorn. The Bank\u2019s prime task, he explained, was to \u201csee the job through\u201d on inflation. But its nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) was mindful of the fact that 14 interest rate rises since December 2021 were starting to hurt and it was aware of the risk of causing needless pain. \u201cThere may be multiple paths that get you to where you want to be,\u201d Pill said in his speech. \u201cSome of them have rates rising rapidly and falling rapidly in what is sometimes known as the Matterhorn profile. \u201cThe alternative would be to hold restriction for longer in a more steady and resolute way with a profile for interest rates that looks more like the Table Mountain. I would tend to favour the latter.\u201d Pill\u2019s comments suggest he will be voting for official borrowing costs to be raised again \u2013 from 5.25 to 5.5% \u2013 when the MPC meets later in September but then may well opt for them to stay on a plateau for some time to come. While the headline inflation rate has fallen from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022 to 6.8% in July, Pill said core inflation \u2013 a measure of the cost of living that excludes items such as food and energy \u2013 remained stubbornly high and was yet to show an obvious downward trend. \u201cThe key element is that we on the MPC need to see the job through and ensure a lasting and sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target,\u201d he said. \u201cAt present, the emphasis is still on ensuring that we are \u2013 in the words of the MPC\u2019s last statement \u2013 sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to ensure that we have that lasting return to target.\u201d Meanwhile, the latest data from the eurozone showed inflation was higher than expected in August at 5.3%, unchanged from July. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to fall to 5.1%. Pill acknowledged the risk of pushing UK rates too high. \u201cNow that policy is in restrictive territory, there is the possibility of doing too much and inflicting unnecessary damage on employment and growth,\u201d he said. But he said there was no room for complacency and that the Bank needed to see a \u201clasting and sustainable\u201d reduction in inflation to the government\u2019s 2% target."

            "date": "2023-08-24T08:30:03Z",
            "content": "Tens of thousands of teenagers have been forced to rethink their future options after GCSE results fell in England as ministers forced through plans to eradicate grade inflation accumulated during the pandemic. Top grades in England were down more than four percentage points on last year\u2019s results, leading to disappointment for many pupils \u2013 with 22.4% of results for 16-year-olds at grade 7 or above, equivalent to an A. Results were expected to fall after the government announced plans to return grades to 2019 levels, though this year\u2019s results still hovered slightly above pre-pandemic levels when 21.9% of grades were 7 and above. At the peak of grade inflation in 2021, 30% of entries were awarded top grades. In English and maths \u2013 both compulsory for 16-year-olds in England \u2013 boys performed surprisingly well compared with pre-pandemic results. For boys, substantially higher proportions of entries gained grades 7 and above in English, up by two percentage points to 14.5% compared with 2019. The proportion of girls gaining a grade 4 pass or better fell slightly to 77.5%. In maths it was a similar picture, with boys outperforming their 2019 benchmarks and girls doing slightly worse in the proportion gaining grade 4 or above. While 72.6% of 16-year-old boys gained a 4 or better in maths, only 71.9% of girls did the same. The record decline in top grades was not as sharp as in last week\u2019s A-level results, where grade inflation during the pandemic was greater than at GCSE level. The number of GCSE results registering a fail grade also returned to pre-pandemic levels. The proportion of entries receiving a grade 3 or below \u2013 prompting a retake in English or maths \u2013 increased to 30% this year, similar to the 30.1% seen in 2019, which is five percentage points up on last year\u2019s figure of 24.7%. State schools in England, including academies, comprehensives, secondary moderns and grammar schools, outperformed their pre-pandemic results in top grades and in pass rates in most cases, while independent schools results were worse than 2019. Grammar schools saw 59% of their entries gain 7 or above, while only 46% of entries from private schools gained the same. However, most independent schools take a mix of GCSE and other equivalent qualifications that are not included in Ofqual\u2019s data, making comparisons difficult. Among 16-year-olds in England the three science subjects, chemistry, biology and physics, all had slight falls in pass rates and in top grades compared with 2019, as did Spanish language. While the top 10 most popular subjects remained the same, entries for business studies increased by 14.8%, while computing went up 11.6% and Spanish 11%. Overall, GCSE entries to modern foreign languages increased by 5.1% compared with last year, and 9.2% compared with 2019. Among the high flyers, 1,160 16-year-olds got all grade 9s in England, two-thirds of them girls, while 120 pupils managed 11 or more 9s. This year\u2019s results also highlighted widening regional differences, with pupils in London once again outperforming those in the north of England. In the north-east, 17.6% of entries were awarded a grade 7 or above, up from 16.4% in 2019. In London 28.4% of entries were awarded top grades, up from 25.7% before the pandemic. Headteachers expressed concern about the impact on pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, who were disproportionately affected during the pandemic and the subsequent cost of living crisis. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cIt is likely that the outcomes for many of these young people will be affected by these factors and this may also impact on the results of schools which serve disadvantaged communities.\u201d He added: \u201cThe government has failed to grasp the gravity of this issue. It did not invest sufficiently in education recovery from the pandemic \u2013 causing its own recovery commissioner to resign in protest \u2013 and it has failed to address the high level of child poverty in the UK. We are concerned that this will lead to a widening of the attainment gap between rich and poor.\u201d In Wales, which adopted a different approach to grading this year, there were falls in the proportion of 16-year-olds getting A and A* grades, dropping from 26% of entries last year to 22% this year. Northern Ireland recorded a 2.5-point fall in top grades. Jeremy Miles, Wales\u2019s minister for education, said: \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring to see what our learners have achieved. These learners have had to face immense challenges impacting on their learning opportunities over the past few years as they\u2019ve progressed through their secondary schooling and on to their GCSEs.\u201d In England, much of the additional support put in place last year for the first cohort to sit exams after the forced interruption caused by Covid was stripped away this year, though in maths and some science papers, students were given formulae and equation sheets. More than half a million students in England picked up their results for GCSEs, while more than 390,000 certificates across 130 vocational and technical qualifications (VTQs) were awarded. According to England\u2019s exams regulator, Ofqual, there is still some grading protection in place and allowances have been made where the quality of student work is a little weaker than before the pandemic. The overall improvement in England\u2019s maths and English results was boosted by Ofqual\u2019s decision not to apply feedback from its national reference tests, which it uses to calibrate annual grade changes. This year\u2019s reference tests showed significantly lower results in English than previous years, while results were also slightly lower in maths Ofqual defended its decision, saying: \u201cWhile outcomes in English are statistically significantly lower than in 2017 at grade 4, the chief regulator decided not to implement a downward change because this would be counter to the wider policy intent of providing protection for students.\u201d Jo Saxton, Ofqual\u2019s chief regulator, said: \u201cToday\u2019s results mark the second year in a two-step process back to normal. We\u2019re back to normal.\u201d In England GCSEs are graded using a numerical system from 9 to 1, rather than from A* to G, with 9 being the highest grade. A 4 is roughly equivalent to a C grade and a 7 is an A. In Northern Ireland and Wales, traditional A* to G grades are used. In Scotland, results for national 5 qualifications published earlier this month showed the pass rate was 78.8%, down from 80.8% last year but still up from 78.2% in 2019."

            "date": "2023-08-16T06:03:38Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s annual inflation rate fell sharply to 6.8% in July, from 7.9% in June, as the drop in energy prices over the past year led to the smallest increase in the cost of living since February 2022. Financial markets had been braced for a marked easing in upward price pressure last month, and the figure announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was in line with their prediction. Despite the large fall in the consumer prices index (CPI), the government\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, analysts said the outlook was not improving rapidly enough to prevent further interest rate increases from the Bank of England. The drop in CPI means that for the first time since autumn 2021, prices are increasing less rapidly than wages, which rose by 8.2% year on year in the three months to June, adding to pressure on Bank policymakers to increase rates for a 15th time since December 2021 when they meet next month. The ONS said the main reason behind July\u2019s fall was that the big jump in gas and electricity bills in the same month last year had not been repeated, although there was a decline in annual food inflation last month to below 15%. Matthew Corder, the ONS deputy director of prices, said: \u201cInflation slowed markedly for the second consecutive month, driven by falls in the price of gas and electricity as the reduction in the energy price cap came into effect. Although remaining high, food price inflation has also eased again, particularly for milk, bread and cereal.\u201d There was less encouraging news for core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as fuel and food. The ONS said this remained unchanged at 6.9% last month. Service sector inflation, closely watched by Threadneedle Street as an indicator of domestically generated price pressure, picked up from 7.2% to 7.4%. Ruth Gregory, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, said the increase in service sector inflation coupled with strong wage growth meant the Bank was likely to press ahead with another 0.25 percentage point rise in interest rates from 5.25% to 5.50% next month. \u201cThere will be one more labour market and one more inflation release before the Bank of England\u2019s September policy meeting. But with wage growth and services inflation both stronger than the Bank had expected, it seems clear that the Bank has more work to do,\u201d she said. July\u2019s decline in CPI gives Rishi Sunak hope that he could hit the target he set in January to halve inflation from its then level of 10.7% by the end of 2023. The prime minister said the fall showed \u201cthe plan is working\u201d. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cThe decisive action we\u2019ve taken to tackle inflation is working, and the rate now stands at its lowest level since February last year. But while price rises are slowing, we\u2019re not at the finish line. We must stick to our plan to halve inflation this year and get it back to the 2% target as soon as possible.\u201d His Labour counterpart, Rachel Reeves, said that despite July\u2019s fall, \u201cinflation in Britain remains high, and higher than many other major economies\u201d. The shadow chancellor added: \u201cAfter 13 years of economic chaos and incompetence under the Conservatives, working people are worse off \u2013 with higher energy bills and prices in the shops.\u201d George Dibb, the head of the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank\u2019s Centre for Economic Justice, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news that headline inflation is lower, especially with energy bills coming down, but there is a very real risk that a recession may soon overtake price rises as the main economic concern. Other countries have brought inflation under control quicker than in the UK, with more support for households and workers avoiding unnecessary pain.\u201d Food prices rose by 14.9% in the year to July, down from 17.3% in the year to June. Clothing and footwear prices fell by more last month than in July 2022 as the poor weather led to more aggressive price cutting by retailers looking to sell summer stock. Separate ONS figures for producer prices \u2013 which provide an early indication of inflationary pressure in the pipeline \u2013 fell last month. Industry\u2019s fuel and raw material costs fell by 3.3% year on year, while the cost of goods leaving factory gates dropped by 0.8%. Two years ago, inflation measured by the consumer prices index stood at 2% \u2013 in line with the government\u2019s target \u2013 but it rose steadily in the months that followed and hit 6.2% in February 2022. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in that month gave an added boost to inflationary pressure by pushing up global oil and gas prices, and inflation peaked at 11.1% in October before falling back. Despite its sharp fall last month, the UK\u2019s inflation rate remained higher than that of the US (3.2%) and the eurozone (5.3%) in July."

Rejecting the idea of a \u201csoft landing\u201d, Karen Ward, a member of the chancellor\u2019s economic advisory council, said there would need to be signs of weakness before policymakers felt able to ease their tough approach. \u201cThe likelihood of a recession I think is still high,\u201d Ward told Bloomberg TV. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to get rid of inflation.\u201d Ward is a strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management but is also one of the economic experts Hunt calls upon for independent advice. While the US, eurozone and UK economies all performed more strongly than anticipated in the first half of 2023, Ward said the good news was unlikely to continue. The message from last weekend\u2019s gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, was that borrowing costs would need to be \u201chigher for longer\u201d than financial markets were anticipating, Ward told Bloomberg. Her remarks came as the latest data from Germany showed annual wage growth running at 6.6% in the second quarter of 2023 \u2013 up from 5.6% in the first quarter and the highest figure since modern records began in 2008. Ward said: \u201cMarkets bought into this idea that we could have resilient growth across the west and yet all those inflation pressures would disappear on their own and the central banks could move from tightening to easing. Sadly, I think it is going to require that weakness.\u201d Jerome Powell, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, and Ben Broadbent, one of the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governors, all told the Jackson Hole event that it was too soon to say whether interest rates had peaked. Broadbent said the knock-on effects of the surge in prices \u2013 such as pressure on employers to push up wages \u2013 were unlikely to fade away as rapidly as they emerged. \u201cAs such, monetary policy may well have to remain in restrictive territory for some time yet,\u201d he said. Giving her verdict on Jackson Hole, Ward said: \u201cThe message from all of them in different ways was that we are not confident the job is done, we are not confident we are sustainably heading back toward 2% [inflation],\u201d Ward said. \u201cUntil it\u2019s really clear that activity is loosening the labour market, that wage pressures are easing, we cannot be convinced we are back to 2%. So that does leave us in a higher-for-longer world.\u201d"

            "content": "Britain\u2019s policymakers have been put on recession alert after a closely watched measure of economic health showed the UK gripped by a Europe-wide slump in private sector activity. In a sign that higher interest rates are leading to a rapid slowdown in growth and choking inflation, the latest monthly business health checks showed weakness in the UK services and manufacturing sectors and the poorest performance since the Covid lockdown in early 2021. Problems in Britain were mirrored in the eurozone, where activity has dropped to its lowest level since November 2020. Germany, the single currency\u2019s biggest economy, is being particularly hard hit by the slump in demand for its manufactured goods. The US has so far performed more strongly than Europe but even the world\u2019s biggest economy is also showing signs of strain. Activity slowed to near-stagnation level in August and was at its lowest in six months. The warnings of problems ahead were flagged up by a series of surveys of purchasing managers, seen as a reliable guide to future trends in the economy. The surveys use 50 as the cutoff point between growth and contraction. The UK\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) conducted by S&amp;P and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply fell from 50.8 in July to 47.9 in August. Service sector activity fell from 51.5 to 48.7, while the manufacturing PMI fell from 45.3 to 42.5. Jennifer McKeown, the chief global economist at the Capital Economics consultancy, said: \u201cAugust\u2019s flash PMIs support our view that the eurozone and UK will slip into recession in the third quarter and imply that the US is now barely growing. \u201cAnd with output prices still easing gradually, the surveys strongly suggest that we are at or close to the peak in monetary tightening cycles.\u201d Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P global market intelligence, said: \u201cThe early PMI survey for August suggests that inflation should moderate further in the months ahead but also indicates that the fight against inflation is carrying a heavy cost in terms of heightened recession risks. \u201cA renewed contraction of the economy already looks inevitable, as an increasingly severe manufacturing downturn is accompanied by a further faltering of the service sector\u2019s spring revival. The survey is indicative of GDP declining by 0.2% over the third quarter so far.\u201d Williamson said companies were feeling the impact of Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis, lower export demand, higher interest rates and fears about the economic outlook. Firms were seeing their ability to raise prices curbed and inflation was on course to drop to 4%, from 6.8%, in the months ahead. \u201cA further pullback in hiring in August, meanwhile, indicates that the labour market is losing steam, which should feed through to lower wage pressures. While a further hike in interest rates in September looks to be on the cards, the August PMI data will add to speculation that rates could soon peak.\u201d The PMI for the eurozone, conducted by Hamburg Commercial Bank (HCB), showed overall business activity slipping from 48.6 in July to 47.0 in August. The services PMI fell from 50.9 to 48.3, while the manufacturing PMI rose slightly from 42.7 to 43.7. Cyrus de la Rubia, the chief economist at HCB, said: \u201cThe service sector of the eurozone is unfortunately showing signs of turning down to match the poor performance of manufacturing. \u201cIndeed, service companies reported shrinking activity for the first time since the end of last year, while output in manufacturing dropped again. \u201cConsidering the PMI figures in our GDP nowcast leads us to the conclusion that the eurozone will shrink by 0.2% in the third quarter.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-08T23:01:40Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak will fight the next election against a backdrop of an economy suffering from five years of lost growth and a widening of the gap between the prosperous and less well off parts of Britain, a leading thinktank said on Wednesday. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said it would take until the third quarter of 2024 for UK output to return to its pre-pandemic peak and that there was a 60% risk of the government going to the polls during a recession. In its quarterly update on the state of the economy, the NIESR said the poorest tenth of the population had been especially hard hit by Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis and would need an income boost of \u00a34,000 a year to have the same living standards they enjoyed in the year before Covid-19 arrived. The poorest households \u2013 hit by weak wage growth, higher debt, the need to devote more of their budgets to expensive energy, food and housing costs; and with few if any savings \u2013 would be 17% worse off by the end of 2024 than they were five years earlier. The richest households would be 5% worse off. The director of the NIESR, Jagjit Chadha, said there were signs of a return to the \u201cBritish disease\u201d of the 1970s, a period when the UK struggled with a combination of high inflation and weak growth. \u201cUntil we ignite economic growth, a substantial portion of households will struggle with high housing and food costs, poor transportation, a creaking healthcare service and dwindling savings. It is not a promising inheritance for the next government,\u201d he said. A general election must be held by January 2025 at the latest. The thinktank believes the UK will avoid recession this year, but that the economy will only grow by 0.4%. The impact of the Bank of England\u2019s 14 consecutive increases in interest rates, to 5.25%, will result in even more modest growth of 0.3% in 2024. The NIESR said there was an even chance the economy would contract by the end of 2023 and roughly a 60% risk of a recession by the end of 2024. The NIESR\u2019s deputy director for macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, Prof Stephen Millard, said: \u201cThe triple supply shocks of Brexit, Covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, together with the monetary tightening that has been necessary to bring inflation down, have badly affected the UK economy. \u201cAs a result, we expect stuttering growth over the next two years and GDP [gross domestic product] to only recover to its 2019 quarter four level in 2024 quarter three. The need to address the UK\u2019s poor growth performance remains the key challenge facing policymakers as we approach the next election.\u201d Despite the government\u2019s focus on levelling up, the NIESR found wage growth had been fastest in London. It predicted real wage growth of 7% in the capital between the end of 2019 and 2024, compared with a fall of 5% in the West Midlands. The thinktank\u2019s deputy director for public policy, Prof Adrian Pabst, said: \u201cWe are not levelling up. We are doing quite the opposite in terms of real wage growth. \u201cThe aggregate shocks to the UK economy have widened disparities of income and wealth across the household distribution and between prosperous and poor parts of the country. \u201cFalling real wages, combined with persistent inflation, are hitting the low-income households hardest, leading to lower real disposable incomes by about 17% in 2024 compared with 2019. \u201cThe increasing inequalities facing poorer families are reflected in slower wage growth and fast-rising unsecured debt. For some of the poorest in society, coping with low or no real wage growth and persistent inflation has involved new debt to pay for permanently higher housing, energy and food cost.\u201d The NIESR said 1.6 million low-income households with incomes of \u00a315,000 or less were spending an average of \u00a33,200 a year paying back debts at interest rates averaging 76%."

            "title": "UK facing \u2018high\u2019 risk of recession despite inflation dropping to 6.8% \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2023-08-16T14:10:19Z",
            "content": "A quick recap. Fears are swirling that the UK could be pushed into recession by high interest rates, despite a welcome drop in inflation this morning. The UK\u2019s annual inflation rate fell sharply to 6.8% in July, from 7.9% in June, as the drop in energy prices over the past year led to the smallest increase in the cost of living since February 2022. Despite the large fall in the consumer prices index (CPI), the government\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, analysts said the outlook was not improving rapidly enough to prevent further interest rate increases from the Bank of England. Dr George Dibb, head of IPPR\u2019s Centre for Economic Justice, warned that higher borrowing costs would hit growth, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s good news that headline inflation is lower, especially with energy bills coming down, but there is a very real risk that a recession may soon overtake price rises as the main economic concern. The financial markets are indicating that another rate hike, in September, is nailed on \u2013 probably lifting Bank rate from 5.25% to 5.5%, on the way to a peak of 6% next February. The drop in CPI means that for the first time since autumn 2021, prices are increasing less rapidly than wages, which rose by 8.2% year on year in the three months to June, adding to pressure on Bank policymakers to increase rates for a 15th time since December 2021 when they meet next month. The ONS said the main reason behind July\u2019s fall was that the big jump in gas and electricity bills in the same month last year had not been repeated, although there was a decline in annual food inflation last month to below 15%. Matthew Corder, the ONS deputy director of prices, said: \u201cInflation slowed markedly for the second consecutive month, driven by falls in the price of gas and electricity as the reduction in the energy price cap came into effect. Although remaining high, food price inflation has also eased again, particularly for milk, bread and cereal.\u201d But core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as fuel and food, was unchanged at 6.9% last month. Service sector inflation, closely watched by Threadneedle Street as an indicator of domestically generated price pressure, picked up from 7.2% to 7.4%. Here\u2019s the full story: Some economists warned that the government could still miss its target of halving inflation by the end of this year. Prime minister Rishi Sunak told ITV News: \u201cI\u2019m not complacent about this at all. \u201cWhen I set out that target, people said \u2013 that\u2019s easy, he\u2019s not ambitious enough \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was, I think it\u2019s an ambitious target. \u201cIt might make people feel better in the short term to borrow lots of money to do lots of things but it would also mean that prices stay higher for longer and mortgage rates stay higher for longer and I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt warned that the battle against inflation wasn\u2019t over, saying: While price rises are slowing, we\u2019re not at the finish line. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves pointed out that UK inflation was higher than many other major economies, adding: \u201cAfter 13 years of economic chaos and incompetence under the Conservatives, working people are worse off\u201d. Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, has flagged that the UK\u2019s inflation rate is still over two percentage points above the G20 average\u2026. but it is closing the gap\u2026. Rishi Sunak said his goal of halving inflation by the end of the year was \u201can ambitious target\u201d, as analysts question whether he will hit it. The Prime Minister told ITV News that he wasn\u2019t complacent about the goal, and echoed John Glen\u2019s argument this morning that borrowing and spending more would be inflationary. Sunak said: \u201cWhen I set out that target, people said \u2013 that\u2019s easy, he\u2019s not ambitious enough \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was, I think it\u2019s an ambitious target. \u201cIt might make people feel better in the short term to borrow lots of money to do lots of things but it would also mean that prices stay higher for longer and mortgage rates stay higher for longer and I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d The IFS aren\u2019t the only ones suggesting UK inflation might not fall to around 5% by the end of the year (as covered earlier), to hit Sunak\u2019s goal [CPI rose by 10.5% in December 2022]. The Resolution Foundation\u2019s research director James Smith said that accelerating pay growth will make even the Prime Minister\u2019s promise to halve inflation hard to meet, warning: \u201cInflation has fallen rapidly over the past six months, but the UK still has the highest rate in the G7 and the Bank faces a daunting task in further taming price pressures.\u201d The European Economics team at Nomura predict UK interest rates will peak at 5.75%, up from their current 15-year high of 5.25%. They say: The debate on Bank Rate had been for only one more hike versus two more. Yesterday\u2019s strong wage growth and today\u2019s resilient services CPI data will likely push the BoE to, in our view, hike twice more, bringing Bank Rate to 5.75%. Market pricing of approximately 6% for Bank Rate is likely too aggressive. We will have more labour market and inflation data ahead of the September meeting. While the UK risks a recession, the Netherlands has fallen into one. Data released this morning showed that Dutch GDP shrank by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2023, following the 0.4% drop in January-March. That meets the technical definition of a recession \u2013 at least two consecutive quartly falls in GDP. The contraction was mostly driven by declining international trade and household consumption, with ING saying: The main reasons for the quarter-on-quarter contraction were falling goods exports, falling consumption of households and an increase in imports. Despite the risks of recession, ratings agency Moody\u2019s predicts the Bank of England will not lower UK interest rates quickly. David Muir, senior economist at Moody\u2019s says core inflation, which stuck at 6.9% in July, will concern the Bank: \u201cHeadline inflation eased significantly in July, but the decline was driven by the update of Ofgem\u2019s energy price cap last month. For the Bank of England the main focus is on underlying inflationary pressures, and these aren\u2019t showing much sign of moderating. Meanwhile, wage growth continues to strengthen, so it seems all but certain that the BoE will raise rates again in September. Looking further ahead, we see another rate rise in November as more likely than not. And once rates peak at 5.75%, we think the BoE will be able to lower them only slowly.\u201d While London house prices are falling, rents in the capital are climbing. New ONS data shows that the average rental price in London climbed by 5.5% year-on-year in July, the highest since in the data series began at the start of 2006. Overall, UK rents rose by 5.3% in the 12 months to July, the ON says, up from 5.2% in June. Other data sources have shown a steeper rise in rents, though. Last month, property website SpareRoom said the average price of renting a room in April-June was 17% higher than a year ago. Although inflation fell in July, there were still some sharp price increases. Among food, for example, sugar prices are 54.5% higher than in July 2022 while olive oil costs 41.5% more and fruit and vegetable juices are over 20% pricier. Gas prices were 1.7% higher than a year ago, thanks to a 25% drop in prices between June and July as the lower energy price cap kicked in. Among clothing, women\u2019s shoes were 5.5% more expensive, ahead of a 4% rise in men\u2019s footwear. New cookers cost 10.5% more than last year, while glasswear was 1.9% cheaper, and new cars cost 4.4% more. Here\u2019s a full breakdown of the inflation report: House price inflation has also slowed, led by a drop in price in London. The Office for National Statistics reports that the average UK house prices increased by 1.7%, or \u00a35,000 in the 12 months to June, to \u00a3288,000. That\u2019s also \u00a35,000 below the recent peak in November 2022. Prices in London were 0.6% lower than a year ago, the ONS says, while prices were 4.7% higher over the last 12 months in the North East. But\u2026. lenders Nationwide and Halifax have both reported UK house prices fell year-on-year in June. Their reports are based on mortgage lending, while the ONS include cash buyers, so should give a clearer (if more dated) picture of the market\u2026. Newsnight\u2019s Ben Chu points out that core inflation looks \u2018worryingly sticky\u2019, and also higher than in other G7 countries: Economists at French bank BNP Paribas says the Bank of England is very likely to raise UK interest rates to 5.5% next month, although a large hike to 5.75% can\u2019t be ruled out. They say: Today\u2019s July inflation data by itself shouldn\u2019t move the needle for the Bank of England. The figures were broadly in line with its expectations and showed an encouraging further sign of cooling, on the whole. However, with yesterday\u2019s labour market figures revealing that wage growth is still accelerating, the risk is that this declining trend in price pressures proves unsustainable or short-lived. Our overall reading of this week\u2019s data therefore is that the MPC still has work to do. Another 25bp hike in September is all but nailed on and while 50bp cannot be ruled out, we think the risk is tilted towards an even longer tightening cycle. Food prices were almost flat in July, according to the inflation report, which shows a 0.1% increase in prices month-on-month. That left annual food price inflation at 14.9%. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, has warned there are \u201cpotential stumbling blocks ahead\u201d that could prevent food prices normalising faster. Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative and subsequent targeting of Ukrainian grain facilities, as well as rice export restrictions could put pressure on some global commodity prices, slowing the fall in food prices Many households will find their mornings getting cheaper, with \u201cprice drops in tea, coffee, milk, breakfast cereals and fruit\u201d, Dickinson added. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, has written a detailed thread about today\u2019s inflation report \u2013 showing that the UK still has the highest inflation rate in the G7: The drop in CPI inflation to 6.8% last month confirms that real wages are, finally, rising again. At least for some workers. Yesterday\u2019s labour market report showed that total pay rose by 8.2% per year in April-June, swelled by bonus payments to NHS staff. Regular pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 7.8%. That\u2019s still below today\u2019s RPI inflation measure, though, of 9%. Private sector pay rose by 8.2% per year, on average, while the public sector lagged behind at 6.2%. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak points out that workers have suffered a long squeeze in real earnings: \u201cWe all want to see lower inflation. But it will take more than price rises slowing for working people to feel better off \u2013 especially with food bills remaining sky high. \u201cReal wages are still worth less today than in 2008 after the longest pay squeeze in 200 years. And at the same time, unemployment and insecure work are shooting up. \u201cOur economy is far from out of the woods \u2013 too many long-run challenges remain unaddressed. \u201cWe need a credible plan to deliver decent well-paid jobs across the country. The Conservatives have yet to produce one despite being in office for the past 13 years.\u201d Julian Jessop, economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs, the right-wing tank, argues that that Bank of England should resist raising interest rates in September. Jessop says the BoE should pause, and assess the impact of its previous 14 increases in interest rates: \u201cThe inflation data shows a welcome fall in the headline rate, but core inflation that excludes food and energy remains stuck at 6.9%. The headline rate is also likely to tick up in August, reflecting higher fuel and alcohol prices, some unhelpful base effects, and the continued strength of the labour market. \u201cThere are still plenty of reasons to expect inflation to tumble over the rest of the year, notably the sharp slowdown in money and credit growth. Rising unemployment and falling vacancies suggest that wage pressures will soon peak too. \u201cUnfortunately, the Bank of England continues to look backwards at the headline data over the last month or two, rather than pause to assess the impact of the substantial tightening in policy that is already in place. This makes another unnecessary interest rate increase more likely.\u201d The Institute for Fiscal Studies, though, is not convinced that Sunak will hit his pledge to halve inflation by the end of 2023. Heidi Karjalainen, a research economist at the IFS, says the higher-than-expected core inflation (6.9% in July) suggests Sunak\u2019s promise is at risk. Karjalainen says: The Prime Minister\u2019s target to halve the rate of inflation by the end of the year was always a little odd as there is only so much the Treasury can do to influence the pace of price increases. When the target was set, the Prime Minister may have hoped he could rely on falling in energy prices to do most of the work to hit it. However, the stubbornly high rate of price inflation for goods and services other than food and energy has put the target in jeopardy. With only 4 months to go, it no longer seems at all clear that inflation at the end of the year will have fallen by enough to achieve it.\u201d Karjalainen suggests that rapid wage growth in the private sector could push core inflation rates upwards, and points out that petrol prices are also rising again this month. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, predicts inflation could \u201cfall fast\u201d in the next few months, and drop below 5% by the end of 2023. That would mean Rishi Sunak could claim victory in his aim of halving inflation this year (although, as the Today programme flagged earlier, falling prices of global oil and food must take some credit). Pickering says: UK fundamentals are now decidedly disinflationary. Monetary policy is turning ever tighter (that is, almost by definition, disinflationary), consumer inflation expectations are falling, producer prices are normalising, unemployment is rising and vacancies are down sharply. If these trends continue, inflation should fall fast over coming months towards a 4-5% yoy rate by the end of the year and to within the 2-3% range by the middle of next year. While elevated wage growth presents an upside risk to this call, the evidence suggests wages are lagging inflation rather than leading it. UK inflation will continue to decline from here as lower energy and goods prices continue to feed through, predicts Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK. Pugh explains: Output prices at factories fell by 4.8% in July \u2013 a good sign for future goods price inflation. What\u2019s more, growing slack in the labour market as labour supply improves and demand for labour ease a little should reduce wage growth over the next year, limiting the risk of a wage-price spiral. Pugh adds that the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates again next month, but the peak in borrowing costs could be close: Overall, inflation, especially core and services, is still too high for the MPC to tolerate, which, combined with fast wage growth, means another rate hike is September is a sure bet. But cooling inflationary pressures means this can be another 25bps hike and that the peak in interest rates is not far off. Petrol and diesel prices also pulled inflation down in July. The ONS reports that motor fuel prices fell by 24.9% in the year to July 2023, compared with a fall of 22.7% in June. Petrol cost an average of 143.2p per litre in July, down from 189.5p a year ago \u2013 when the surge in crude oil prices after the Ukraine invasion pushed up prices at the pumps. Diesel dropped to 145.2p per litre, on average, down from 197.9p per litre in July 2022. But on a monthly basis, petrol prices rose by 0.2p per litre between June and July, while diesel prices dropped by 0.5p in the month. Today\u2019s inflation report means that national rail fares will rise by less than 9% next year, but it\u2019s not clear yet quite how much extra passengers will pay. July\u2019s retail prices index measure of inflation, or RPI, rose by 9.0% in the last year, the ONS reported this morning. Although RPI is a discredited measure, it is used to price many price increases \u2013 and traditionally, rail fare increases have been based on the July RPI reading. However, the government said yesterday that any rail fare increase will be below RPI, matching their policy a year ago (when fares rose in line with wages). This morning, Treasury minister John Glen told Sky News that the increase for 2024 hasn\u2019t been decided yet. Glen said: \u201cWe have said that we will keep it below inflation. Obviously I will be working closely with Mark Harper, the Secretary of State, on what mechanism to use. But there are tough decisions now around how to use his budget in a way that suits commuters and suits the economy as a whole, delicate difficult decisions. We have not come to the end of that discussion yet.\u201d The Green Party has urged ministers to freeze rail prices. Their co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, said yesterday: \u201cThis government is moving in completely the wrong direction. Fuel duty has been frozen since 2011, while air passenger duty cuts this year will be a disaster for the climate crisis by encouraging people to fly more. \u201cThis is despite the fact UK rail passengers are already paying more to travel by train [2] than flying and are faced with some of the most expensive tickets in Europe. John Glen, chief secretary to the Treasury, has agreed that UK inflation is still \u2018too high\u2019. Speaking to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Glen says: I recognise that whilst this is great progress today, inflation is too high. Getting inflation down, and halving it this year, is the government\u2019s top priority, Glen says, insisting: We\u2019re on track to do that. Q: Inflation has come down because global oil and food prices have fallen. What in the government\u2019s plan has contributed to inflation coming down today? Glen argues that the government\u2019s fiscal responsibility has helped\u2026. Well, I certainly think if if I was deciding as Chief Secretary, with the Chancellor and Prime Minister, to borrow a lot more money or to spend a lot more money, it would have an effect. Q: That\u2019s something you haven\u2019t done\u2026what have you actually done that has contributed to the fall in inflation? Glen argues that keeping a grip on the financial purse strings is an active choice, when there are pressures to spend more. As he puts it: I can tell you, to hold to the budgets that we set out in the spending review in an inflationary environment when there are massive calls to spend money all the time is an active choice. Glen claims the opposition are \u201cgoing to spend a lot more, and borrow a lot more\u201d. Although inflation has fallen, the UK now faces a \u201chigh\u201d risk of recession, warns the IPPR thinktank. The IPPR fears that the recent increases in UK interest rates, to a 15-year high of 5.25%, will drag the economy into a contraction. Dr George Dibb, head of IPPR\u2019s Centre for Economic Justice, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news that headline inflation is lower, especially with energy bills coming down, but there is a very real risk that a recession may soon overtake price rises as the main economic concern. Other countries have brought inflation under control quicker than in the UK, with more support for households and workers avoiding unnecessary pain. The financial markets are expecting another increase in UK interest rates, in September, to at least 5.5%, with rates forecast to hit 6% by early next year. But, as Dibb points out, monetary policy operates with a lag \u2013 so another hike could simply \u201ckill\u201d the recovery: \u201cInterest rate hikes take up to a year and a half to fully filter through to the economy. One year from now, \u2018pass the parcel inflation\u2019 might be over, but further interest rates might also have killed the recovery - there are already signs of falling consumer confidence and rising unemployment. \u201cEven today it\u2019s important to note that while inflation might be falling, prices are not. Households are still struggling with high prices, especially those on the lowest incomes. By supporting households and businesses with energy costs, making businesses play their part, and supporting renters, countries like Spain have shown that inflation can be brought down without the economy going into tailspin.\u201d Rachel Reeves correctly flagged earlier that inflation, at 6.8%, is still higher in the UK than in many other major economies. For example, in the US, inflation was just 3.2% in July, slightly up from 3% in June. In the eurozone, annual inflation was 5.3% in July, with inflation estimated at 6.5% in Germany, and 5% in France. Japan\u2019s inflation rate was 3.3% in June, with July\u2019s figures due on Friday. While China has slipped into deflationary territory, with its consumer price index down by 0.3% year-on-year in July. Worryingly, core inflation was a little higher than hoped last month. Core CPI inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, rose by 6.9% in the 12 months to July 2023. That\u2019s slightly higher than the 6.8% which economists expected. Although annual goods inflation slowed, from 8.5% to 6.1%, services inflation increased to 7.4% to 7.2%. Oliver Blackbourn, multi asset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, warns that core inflation \u201cremains stubbornly high\u201d at 6.9% and is now slightly above the headline level. Blackbourn adds: This presents a headache for the Bank of England (BoE) as it will want to see this less volatile measure decline to suggest that cost pressures are sustainably returning to target. \u201cCore inflation suggests a stickier underlying inflation dynamic as services cost growth continued to accelerate. Inflation is measured using a wide basket of goods, to track how the cost of living changed. Here\u2019s the key changes, that pulled annual inflation down to 6.8% in the year to July. Food and non-alcoholic beverages: 14.8%, down from 17.3% in June Alcoholic beverages and tobacco: 9.4%, up from 9.2% in June Clothing and footwear: 6.6%, down from 7.2% in June Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels: 6.8%, down from 12.0% in June Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: 6.2%, down from 6.5% in June Health: 8.9%, up from 8.2% in June Transport: -2.0%, down from -1.8% in June Communication: 7.1%, down from 9.5% in June Recreation and culture: 6.5%, down from 6.7% in June Education: 3.2%, matching June\u2019s 3.2% Restaurants and hotels: 9.6%, up from 9.5% in June Miscellaneous goods and services: 6.0%, down from 6.5% in June Political reaction to this morning\u2019s inflation report is flooding in. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt claims the government\u2019s \u2018decisive action\u2019 has pulled inflation down, saying: \u201cThe decisive action we\u2019ve taken to tackle inflation is working, and the rate now stands at its lowest level since February last year. \u201cBut while price rises are slowing, we\u2019re not at the finish line. \u201cWe must stick to our plan to halve inflation this year and get it back to the 2% target as soon as possible.\u201d But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves points out that inflation is still high, and also \u201chigher than many other major economies\u201d. Reeves adds: \u201cAfter 13 years of economic chaos and incompetence under the Conservatives, working people are worse off \u2013 with higher energy bills and prices in the shops. \u201cLabour\u2019s plan to build a strong economy will make working people better off by boosting growth, improving living standards and cutting household bills.\u201d Food inflation slowed last month, but prices are still sharply higher than a year ago. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose by 0.1% between June and July 2023, compared with a rise of 2.3% between the same two months a year ago. That pulled the annual rate of inflation for food and non-alcoholic beverages to 14.8% in July, down from 17.3% in the year to June. The easing in the annual rate was widespread, with inflation falling in 10 of the 11 areas of food and drink products, the ONS says. Three of the ten classes also saw a fall in monthly price between June and July 2023, including milk, cheese and eggs \u2013 reflecting recent milk price cuts by supermarkets. The second-largest downward contribution came from the bread and cereals category, where annual inflation slowed to 9.8% from 11.4% in June. Matthew Corder, ONS deputy director of prices, says inflation \u201cslowed markedly\u201d in July, for the second month running: \u201cInflation slowed markedly for the second consecutive month, driven by falls in the price of gas and electricity as the reduction in the energy price cap came into effect. \u201cAlthough remaining high, food price inflation has also eased again, particularly for milk, bread and cereal. \u201cCore inflation was unchanged in July, with the falling cost of goods offset by higher service prices.\u201d Falling gas and electricity prices provided the largest downward contributions to UK inflation in July. That\u2019s because the UK\u2019s energy price cap was lowered at the start of July, to \u00a32,074 a year for a typical household, below the government\u2019s energy price guarantee of \u00a32,500 per year. The ONS says: Prices of gas fell by 25.2% between June and July this year, but rose by 0.1% between the same two months a year ago. Prices of electricity fell by 8.6% between June and July this year but rose by 0.4% between the same two months a year ago. On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell by 0.4% in July alone. Newsflash: The UK\u2019s inflation rate has fallen to its lowest level since spring 2022, the start of the Ukraine war. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 6.8% in the year to July, the Office for National Statistics reports, down from 7.9% in June, meeting City economists\u2019 expectations. That\u2019s the lowest inflation rate since February 2022, and further from the peak of 11.1% set last October. But it still leaves inflation well over the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. More to follow\u2026 Today\u2019s inflation report will be watched just as closely in Westminster as in the City of London. Yesterday, Rishi Sunak \u2013 who has pledged to halve inflation by the end of this year \u2013 insisted that conditions are improving: \u201cWe are making progress, the last set of numbers we had showed that inflation was falling faster than people expected. \u201cThe plan is working. I think there is light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cIf we get through this, people will really start to see the benefit in their bank accounts, in their pockets, as inflation starts to fall.\u201d But Labour got their prebuttal in early, pointing out that households have suffered badly in the cost of living squeeze. The opposition accused Sunak of overseeing a \u00a3350 increase in monthly bills for the average household since 2021/22. Shadow economic secretary Tulip Siddiq said: \u201cFamilies in Britain are worse off because of 13 years of economic chaos and incompetence under the Conservatives. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a decade of low growth, low pay and high taxes. Now families are paying the price of the Conservatives\u2019 cost-of-living crisis with higher bills and prices in the shops. \u201cIf Labour were in power today, we would introduce a proper windfall tax on the huge profits the oil and gas giants are making to help families with the cost of living. \u201cLabour\u2019s plan to build a strong economy will boost growth, increase wages and bring down bills so working people are better off.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK may get some respite in the cost of living squeeze today, but inflationary pressures are not over. The latest inflation report, due at 7am, is expected to show that prices rose at a slower rate in July, partly because households benefited from the drop in the energy price cap last month, Economists predict the annual rate of inflation slowed in July, to around 6.8%, down from June\u2019s 7.9%. That would be the lowest rate of price rises since spring 2022. Yesterday we learned that basic pay is rising at the fastest rate in at least two decades, with regular wages rising by 7.8% in the April-June quarter. So today could bring a welcome return of rising real wages. That would be a relief for workers, but could also encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates. And it\u2019s important to remember that falling inflation does not mean prices are falling \u2013 simply that they are rising less sharply, compared to a year ago. Henk Potts, market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, sets the scene\u2026 \u201cWe expect the UK July inflation print to show a further moderation in price pressures. We anticipate headline consumer price index (CPI) to ease to 6.7% year on year, compared to the 7.9% increase registered in June. In our view the deceleration should primarily be driven by an easing of energy prices and reflect the decrease in the Ofgem price cap. \u201cWe would also expect food, alcohol and tobacco price rises to continue to slow due to lower producer prices. We expect less progress to be made in services, where pricing is strong and wage growth continues to be robust. \u201cDespite the improvement in price pressures, the Bank of England is not yet in a position to declare a cessation of hostilities with its battle with inflation. We estimate that UK inflation will remain above the 2% target through 2024 and therefore expect a further quarter-point rate increase at the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s September meeting.\u201d The agenda 7am BST: UK inflation report for July 9.30am BST: UK house prices and rents data 10am BST: Eurozone GDP report for Q2 2023 11am BST: Ireland\u2019s residential property prices data 1.30pm BST: US housing starts data 7pm BST: US Federal Reserve releases minutes of its last meeting"

            "date": "2023-08-01T15:57:10Z",
            "content": "Time to recap\u2026 The UK\u2019s struggling manufacturing sector recorded its worst month of the year in July, raising fears of a recession in the industrial sector, and beyond. Factories were hit by higher interest rates and fewer new orders, while weak overseas demand hurt exports. More here. House prices across the UK have dropped at their fastest rate since 2009, down 3.8% in the year to July. The UK\u2019s biggest retailers have reported the first monthly fall in shop prices for two years, with food inflation dropping to its lowest level since December. But\u2026many alcoholic drinks will cost more from Tuesday after Rishi Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, enforced tax rises on booze. In another Brexit climbdown, the UK will retain the EU\u2019s product safety mark indefinitely as the government bowed to pressure from industry and manufacturers. HSBC more than doubled its profits in the first half of the year, as rising interest rates increased returns for the London-headquartered lender. BP has angered climate campaigners by reporting profits of $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) for the second quarter of the year as the climate crisis triggers extreme heatwaves around the world. Greggs is to open more shops in supermarkets and airports, after the bakery chain reported higher sales thanks to strong demand for its evening pizza deals. The upshot of today\u2019s manufacturing reports from Asia, Europe and the US is that the global manufacturing sector remained mired in contraction last month. July saw output at world factories decline further as the downturn in new order intakes was extended to a thirteenth consecutive month. The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, which crunches all the latest polls of purchasing managers, was unchanged at 48.7 in July, a level that shows a contraction. There was a \u201csharp downturn in the euro area\u201d, the report shows, while Asia showed signs of weakness and international trade flows deteriorated further. The report says: The main drag on output was a severe downturn in activity in the euro area, where production contracted to the greatest extent since the height of the global pandemic in spring 2020. The performances of Austria, Germany and Italy were especially weak. There were also signs of weakness developing in Asia. Japan, mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia all saw output contract. North America was a comparative bright spot, with mild growth in Canada and Mexico. A slight expansion of output in the US represented a stabilisation following June\u2019s marked retrenchment Speculation is building about what the Bank of England may decide on interest rates on Thursday. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, predicts a three-way split on the Monetary Policy Committee, with the majority voting for a small, quarter-point increase in Bank Rate to 5.25%, from 5%. Ryan explains: While we don\u2019t see an argument for the MPC to end the tightening cycle just yet, this should provide more than enough ammunition for committee members to justify a return to a 25bp hike this week. \u201cWe expect the Bank of England to revert back to a 25 basis point rate increase this week, with the June inflation miss and signs of a modest slowdown in the UK economy likely to warrant a smaller hike. \u201cOnce again, however, the MPC is unlikely to be in total agreement, and we could see a three-way split vote, where one member (Swati Dhingra) supports no change, while one or two plump for a 50 basis point move.\u201d \u201cThe communications should remain hawkish, and we expect the guidance to once again state that additional tightening is likely should inflation prove persistent. We don\u2019t expect governor Bailey to push back against market pricing for rates, although sterling would undoubtedly sell-off should he do so.\u201d Back in the City, the stock market has closed in the red and the pound has extended its loses against the US dollar. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed down 33 points or 0.43% at 7,666 points, away from Monday\u2019s two-month closing high. Banks and housebuilders were among the fallers. Sterling is down almost a cent against the US dollar at $1.2743, the lowest in over three weeks. Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets, explains how the latest economic data weighed on sterling: The pound has\u2026 lost ground after BRC shop prices fell 0.1% on a month-on-month basis between June and July, while annual prices slowed to 7.6%. UK house prices also slipped -0.2% in July and on an annualised basis by -3.8% as higher rates weighed on demand. The latest manufacturing PMI numbers also pointed to falling input prices, and slowing orders, thus dragging on expectations of future Bank of England rate hikes. Rishi Sunak has weighed in on the \u201cde-banking row\u2019 gipping the UK financial sector, arguing that the focus should be on the \u201cvalues that are at stake\u201d rather than on individuals. The Prime Minister said his \u201cprimary concern\u201d was the wider impact of the issue and how it affects other people when asked about the fallout following Nigel Farage\u2019s claim that his Coutts account was unfairly shut down, PA Media reports. Sunak refused to be drawn when asked whether current Natwest chairman Sir Howard Davies should consider his position, telling GB News: \u201cI think it\u2019s good that Nigel Farage and Coutts are in dialogue resolving the issue there, but Nigel Farage also spoke about the broader issue of this impacting other people, and that\u2019s my primary concern, because ultimately this isn\u2019t about any one individual, this is about values. \u201cValues that are important to me and important to our country\u2026 Rather than the individuals, to focus on the values that are at stake. Values of freedom of expression and privacy. I believe in those values very strongly. \u201cPeople need to be able to have lawfully held views that we might not agree with, but they shouldn\u2019t be denied financial services because of them. And they\u2019re entitled for their financial affairs to be kept private.\u201d Back in the housing sector, three large UK lenders have announced they would cut the costs of home loans this week, the Financial Times reports. The moves by NatWest, Halifax and Virgin Money followed cuts by Nationwide, Barclays, TSB and HSBC last week, offering further relief to homeowners who are still facing higher borrowing costs than in the wake of last year\u2019s \u201cmini\u201d Budget. Aaron Strutt, director at Trinity Financial, says: \u201cMore banks and building societies have been lowering their rates in recent weeks as they try to attract more borrowers. \u201cWe are starting to see acceptance criteria changes to make it easier to get mortgages and even the return of lower rates being offered for a week to tempt borrowers to take action.\u201d More here. The number of job openings in America has dropped. There were 9.58m vacancies on the last business day of June stood at 9.58 million, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports, down from 9.82m openings in May. Fewer US workers quit their jobs, suggesting fewer people switched positions for new opportunities elsewhere. It\u2019s still a high number of vacancies by historical standards, although below the highs set earlier in the pandemic. The health of the US US manufacturing sector declined in July, according to the latest PMI survey from S&amp;P Global, matching the picture in Europe today. The downturn stemmed from another monthly contraction in new orders, as domestic and external demand conditions remained muted, the PMI report shows. Backlogs of work fell sharply as new orders dropped, and with sales more challenging, firms cut back on buying new raw materials and components. The seasonally adjusted S&amp;P Global US Manufacturing PMI rose to 49.0, up from 46.3, but still below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. The newest Bank of England deputy governor has just been announced. Sarah Breeden, currently the BOE\u2019s executive director of financial stability strategy and risk, will become deputy governor for financial stability on 1 November, succeeding Sir Jon Cunliffe. Announcing the appointment, Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said: \u201cI am pleased to appoint Sarah Breeden as the next Deputy Governor of the Bank of England who brings extensive experience to the role including from her work as a member of the FPC and across monetary, economic and financial matters. Breeden has worked at the Bank since 1991, shortly after leaving Cambridge University. In the financial crisis she was responsible for the design of the Bank\u2019s liquidity assistance to Northern Rock and led the Bank\u2019s work on Northern Rock\u2019s resolution (her CV is online here) In her new role, Breeden will lead the Bank of England\u2019s work on financial stability, sit on the Financial Policy Committee, chair it when governor Andrew Bailey isn\u2019t avalable, and also sit on the Monetary Policy Committee and the Prudential Regulation Committee. I think Breeden will become the first female deputy BoE governor since Charlotte Hogg, who resigned after it emerged she hadn\u2019t disclosed her brother worked for Barclays, which is regulated by the BoE. It also takes the number of women on the interest-rate setting MPC committee to four, out of nine, with Catherine Mann, Swati Dhingra and new member Megan Greene. The Bank of England (BoE) will probably be much slower to cut rates than the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank (ECB) over the next 12-18 months, predicts Michael Saunders of Oxford Economics. Saunders, a former member of the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee, predicts that the UK\u2019s current tightening cycle is probably near its end. But, the UK\u2019s \u201crelatively high pay growth and sticky services inflation\u201d means it will be trickier for the UK to loosen monetary policy, he argues. In a new research note, Saunders explains that monetary policy acts slower than 10 or 20 years ago due to structural changes in the economy. For example, there has been a \u201cmarked drop\u201d in the share of households with a mortgage, a large shift to 5-year fixed rate mortgages rather than variable rate loans, and a higher level of household savings, especially among homeowners. He says: These changes have probably reduced the speed and scale with which changes in monetary policy affect demand through the household cashflow channel. Another factor is that, while higher interest rates lift savers\u2019 incomes, savers don\u2019t typically adjust their spending much to changes in interest rates, whereas debtors do. Over in the US, ride-hailing and food delivery company Uber has reported its first ever operating profit. After years of losses (the FT calculates a total of $31.5bn in operating losses since 2014), Uber reported income of $326m for the second quarter of this year, up from a $713m loss a year ago. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s CEO, says: \u201cRobust demand, new growth initiatives, and continued cost discipline resulted in an excellent quarter, with trips up 22% and a GAAP operating profit, for the first time in Uber\u2019s history. \u201cThese results also translated into strong driver and courier engagement, with 6 million drivers and couriers earning a record $15.1 billion during the quarter.\u201d Revenues rose by 14% year-on-year to around $9.2bn, below forecasts of $9.3bn. Total bookings were up 16% year-on-year in April to June, with mobility bookings (moving passengers around) up 25% and delivery bookings (such as Uber Eats) up 12%. On the weak pound\u2026 Chris Turner, head of markets at ING, has aid weak global manufacturing data, driven by China\u2019s faltering economy, is weighing on sentiment and boosting the safe-haven dollar. Here are some thoughts on the UK housing market from Nicholas Mendes, mortgage technical manager at broker John Charcol, after prices fell by 3.8% in the year to July. On the back of the Nationwide figures, can you say if now is a good time to buy a house? Knowing when to purchase a property will come down to personal motivations and circumstances, if you have found a property that fits the bill, and the borrowing is affordable that go for it. It is virtually impossible to second guess when the property market has dipped to and when it has turned a corner in respect to property prices starting to increase. Purchasing a property should be seen as a long-term investment, and during the period of ownership there will be points where the property market will dip. History shows, property ownership will inevitably increase over the long term. Are house prices expected to follow further this year? Property prices are expected to dip further with higher mortgage rates and borrowing constraints still prevalent, these constraints are expected to continue into 2024 which will happen demand. What do buyers need to keep in mind before committing? Anyone looking to buy at the moment would be to negotiate hard and don\u2019t feel pressurised to buy because in a falling market buyers have the upper hand. If you find a property that absolutely ticks all your boxes, affordable and you plan to live there for many years buying in a falling market can often prove an excellent decision in the long run. In better economic news, unemployment across the eurozone has dropped to a record low. The jobless rate in the single currency bloc was 6.4% in June, the lowest on record, according to statistics body Eurostat. That indicates that recent increases in eurozone interest rates have not weakened Europe\u2019s jobs market. Eurostat also revised down its estimate for eurozone unemployment in April and May, to 6.4%, meaning it has been at a record low for three months. The pound has weakened today, as the latest economic data has fuelled concerns of a possible recession. Sterling is down three-quarters of a cent against the US dollar at $1.2761, a three-week low. The pound has dropped back in recent sessions as traders have concluded that the Bank of England is less likely to agree a large increase in interest rates, of half a percentage point, on Thursday. A smaller, quarter-point, is more likely, as Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, explains: Nonetheless, a 25-bps hike to 5.25% is fully priced in, with markets expecting a further 2 rate hikes before year-end. But policy is now very restrictive, so will the BoE now signal a pause like the ECB did last week? If it does, then the pound could slump. Fhaheen Khan, senior economist at Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 body, warns that the lack of an industrial strategy is hurting British factories. \u201cToday\u2019s [PMI] results show the economy is on the glidepath to anaemic growth with industry now at risk of facing a recession. Despite supply disruptions easing and, industry\u2019s ability to meet demand nearing optimal levels, the extra capacity means little if consumers are no longer in a buying mood. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that manufacturers\u2019 expectation of the future is driving reduced activity today, with inflation and higher interest rates resulting in companies engaging defensive manoeuvres by cutting jobs and investment to protect the viability of their business. Whilst a slowdown is now more likely, industry\u2019s behaviour is only natural in the absence of a long-term strategy from Government to grow the manufacturing sector.\u201d City consultancy Capital Economics have also predicted the UK will fall into recession soon. Paul Dales, their chief UK economist, told clients today that interest rates will rise by another half of one percentage point, even though inflation is falling: Despite the easing in CPI inflation from 8.7% in May to 7.9% in June and core inflation from 7.1% to 6.9%, we think strong wage growth and the continued resilience of real GDP will mean interest rates will rise further, from 5.00% now to a peak of 5.50%. We suspect the downward trends in wage growth and services inflation will be slow and core inflation won\u2019t fall to 2% until the end of 2024. As such, interest rates will probably stay at their peak until the second half of 2024, even though we expect the economy will be in recession later this year and early next year. A quick recap. Fears of a UK recession are swirling after Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector recorded its worst month of the year in July, and as rising interest rates hits the housing sector. A closely watched gauge of the factory sector dropped to its lowest level in 2023, and its joint-worst since May 2020, continuing a year-long slump for the industry. The S&amp;P Global / CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI fell to 45.3 in July, showing a sharper downturn than in June. S&amp;P Global says: The downturn in the UK manufacturing sector took a turn for the worse in July, as rates of contraction in output, new orders and employment all accelerated. Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, warned that the UK economy could slip into recession early next year, as the real economy is hit by higher interest rates. Eurozone factories also struggled last month, with production volumes, new orders, employment and purchasing activity all falling, as customers resisted buying new goods and focused on running down their stockpiles. The UK property sector is already being cooled by higher borrowing costs. House prices fell at their fastest rate in 14 years last month, down 3.8% year-on-year, according to Nationwide. Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, Robert Gardner, explained that rising interest rate have made mortgages less affordable: This challenging affordability picture helps to explain why housing market activity has been subdued in recent months. There were 86,000 completed housing transactions in June, 15% below the levels prevailing the same time last year and around 10% below pre-pandemic levels. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, warned there is a \u201creal risk\u201d that rising interest rates push the UK economy into recession. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: People are feeling the pinch from higher mortgages, companies are feeling the pinch from higher borrowing costs, and global activity is not helping. So yes there is a real risk that we may slip into recession. But despite these concerns, the Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates again on Thursday to a new 15-year high. Many economists expect a quarter-point rise, from 5% to 5.25%. UK house prices, and sales, will continue to suffer if interest rates stay high, warns Iwona Hovenko, real estate analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, \u201cThe 0.2% UK house price decline in July, according to Nationwide, may still represent a resilient outcome, especially against expectations for a 0.5% fall, given the rapid surge in mortgage rates which may have spooked many prospective homebuyers. Even the annual price drop of 3.8% - although the worst in 14 years - nevertheless remains somewhat modest against house prices still being 21% above their February 2020 level.\u201d \u201cThat said, the longer the mortgage rates remain near their current very high level - unseen since at least 2010 - the larger the potential damage inflicted on house prices and transactions going forward. Even the best-buy rates on the relatively cheaper five-year deals start at about 5.5% vs. sub-4% in early May, with cheapest two-year fixes available at about 6% (vs. just over 4% three months ago). Such high rates pose a threat to UK housing outlook and our previous expectations for a 5% decline in house prices in 2023.\u201d If you\u2019re just tuning in\u2026.UK house prices fell last month at the fastest annual rate in 14 years, as higher interest rates hamper people\u2019s ability to buy a property with a mortgage. Nationwide building society reported that prices fell 3.8% year on year, the sharpest drop since July 2009 when the global economy was in the grips of financial crisis. It compared with a fall in annual prices of 3.5% in June. The price of a typical home is now \u00a3260,828, 4.5% below the peak reached last August. Prices dipped 0.2% in July from the previous month. The Bank of England has raised interest rates 13 successive times since December 2021 in an attempt to curb soaring inflation. The Bank is expected to raise interest rates again on Thursday, from 5% to 5.25%. The drop in UK manufacturing output to its joint-lowest levels since May 2020 will concern the Bank of England, as policymakers prepare to set interest rates on Thursday. It suggests that the Bank\u2019s previous rate rises \u2013 13 since December 2021 \u2013 are weakening the economy. Richard Flax, chief investment officer at digital wealth manager Moneyfarm, explains: \u201cAhead of the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision this week, it is unwelcome news that UK manufacturing PMI has hit a seven-month low with factories seeing a sharp decline in output. July\u2019s PMI reading of 45.3, while in line with expectations, came down from 46.5 in June. The weakness reflects flagging demand and also likely a re-adjustment in inventories as supply chain constraints have eased. The data however puts UK manufacturing at its joint-weakest levels, last seen during the lockdown in May 2020 at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. July\u2019s data is also the 12th month in a row that the PMI has been below 50 \u2013 the key marker which usually signifies growth in activity. European stock markets have dropped into the red this morning, as the deterioration at factories across the eurozone and in the UK worries investors. The UK\u2019s blue-chip index, the FTSE 100, has lost almost 50 points or 0.6% to 7651 points, away from the two-month high seen yesterday. Germany\u2019s DAX, which hit a record high yesterday, has lost almost 1% today, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 1.1% Drinks giant Diageo, whose brands include Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff, has swelled its profits through price rises and drinkers turning to more expensive brands. The spirits giant posted a 7% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a34.7 billion for the year to June 30, up from \u00a34.4 billion the previous year. Diageo\u2019s organic net sales grew by 6.5%, driven by a \u201cPrice/mix of 7.3 percentage points\u201d, That means it put its prices up, passing on higher costs, and sold more of its more expensive drinks. New chief executive Debra Crew, who took over in June when former long-standing boss Sir Ivan Menezes died aged 63, said: In fiscal 23, we drove double-digit organic net sales growth in scotch, tequila, and Guinness, with our premium-plus brands contributing 57% of overall organic net sales growth. We delivered strong growth in four of our five regions, with Europe and Asia Pacific growing double-digit. North America delivered stable performance as the US spirits industry continued to normalise post-pandemic, and we lapped strong comparators, particularly in the second half of fiscal 23. BP has angered climate campaigners by reporting profits of $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) for the second quarter of the year as the climate crisis triggers extreme heatwaves. The company blamed falling oil and gas markets for the drop in profits from $8.5bn in the same period last year when Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine ignited a rise in global energy markets. BP willincrease its shareholder dividends by 10% to $2.3bn, despite the fall in profits. It will also return a further $1.5bn to investors through a share buyback over the next three months. The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, said the payouts reflected the company\u2019s confidence in its strategy and the outlook for its future cashflows. Common Wealth, the think tank, have warned that BP continues to be \u201ca cash machine for investors\u201d, even as the fossil fuel industry drives \u201cglobal boiling\u201d. UK mortgage rates have continued to rise today, despite hopes that inflation is easing. Data provider Moneyfacts reports that the average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate has risen to 6.85%, up from 6.81% on Monday. That\u2019s the highest level since 26th July. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate has risen too, to 6.37%, up from Monday\u2019s 6.34% on the previous working day. It was last higher last October, in the turmoil after the mini-budget. This will put more pressure on UK house prices, and disappoint borrowers given that several major lenders recently annouced rate cuts. The slump in UK manufacturing shows the impact that higher interest rate have on the economy, says Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK. Pugh says not hard to see the economy falling into recession early next year, judging by today\u2019s UK factory PMI report: \u2018The fall in the manufacturing PMI suggests that momentum and resilience in the private sector are starting to falter and it is not difficult to see the economy slipping into recession in early 2024 as the impact of interest rate hikes continue to feed through into the real economy. Indeed, at 46.8 the employment index suggests that the sector is continuing to shed employees. \u2018On the inflation front, goods inflation is clearly starting to ease. The input and output prices balance of the manufacturing PMI were below 50 at 43.8 and 49.0 respectively, indicating that prices in absolute terms, not just inflation, are now falling. In contrast, services inflation will prove stickier. That will be especially concerning for the Bank of England as services inflation is much more related to the labour market and the domestic economy. Here\u2019s some early reaction to the news that UK factory output shrank at the joint-fastest pace since 2020 in July: Dr. John Glen, Chief Economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply: \u201cThe outlook for the manufacturing sector darkened again in July with a sudden fall in output and one of the worst since the pandemic. Manufacturers have registered a reduction in activity in all-bar one month during the past year as new work and employment levels shrank back. The lowest orders since last November from overseas customers was particularly surprising, just when signs of improvements in global marketplace activity had started to appear, new work from the Eurozone was subdued just as domestic work dried up. Although costs for some materials were still being driven higher by inflationary rises, taking a huge bite out of business cashflow, the cost of many more inputs showed sharp drops on the back of weak demand and more availability as delivery times improved for the sixth consecutive month. This opportunity for price reductions for end consumers may take a few months to filter through as firms ensure a more stable footing for their operations for the second half of 2023. Overall, it seems that recovery has stalled. Concerns about further interest rate rises making borrowing more expensive and customers reluctant to buy had the sector running on empty for another month but more than half of survey respondents kept their chins up and remained hopeful about the next 12 months.\u201d Dave Atkinson, SME &amp; Mid Corporates head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank: \u201cManufacturers remain subdued in their outlook for the coming months. Though inflation dropped more than expected last month and specific sectors such as food and beverages are seeing input costs fall, it remains at a level that means manufacturers are having to make difficult operating decisions. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s a hope that large manufacturers are starting to turn the key to unlock growth and increase investment across the whole of the industry\u2019s supply chain. Recent announcements concerning new gigafactories and positive financial results among big players should provide some confidence among SMEs to invest in their production capabilities.\u201d The UK\u2019s manufacturing downturn has also deepened last month. UK factories were hit by a faster fall in output and new orders last month, as export demand was hit by weak global conditions This pulled the S&amp;P Global / CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index down to 45.3 in July, down from 46.5 in June \u2013 showing a sharper contraction. That\u2019s the lowest reading in the year-so-far, and the joint-weakest since May 2020. As with the eurozone (see earlier post), manufactuters struggled to sell goods because their clients had stocked their inventories when they were more worried about supply chain disruption, so are running them down. Worryingly, rhe rate of job losses accelerated to a seven-month high as factories reacted to weak demand and tried to cut costs. There is one upside, though: prices are falling in this environment of sharply deteriorating demand, with cost pressures also falling as supply chains recover. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, explains: Output fell at the quickest pace since January, as overstocked clients, rising export losses, higher interest rates and the cost-of-living crisis coalesced to create a worrying intensification of the slump in demand. Although manufacturers maintain a generally positive outlook for the sector, with over half still expecting output to rise over the coming year, other forward-looking indicators show the mire that industry is currently facing. Domestic and export demand are weakening, and backlogs of work are declining sharply, all of which likely presages further cutbacks to production, employment and purchasing in the months ahead. Just in: the downturn at eurozone factories worsened in July, with the sector deteriorating at the fastest pace since the first Covid-19 lockdowns. The latest survey of purchasing managers at eurozone manufacturing firms has found that prices charged for goods fell at the quickest pace since 2009, as demand plummeted and costs dropped. Production volumes, new orders, employment and purchasing activity all declined at faster rates than in June. Manufacturers appear to be stuck in a \u201cclassic inventory cycle\u201d, where companies have purchased too many goods during the supply chain disruption, so they don\u2019t want to buy more until they\u2019ve sold them. This pulled the HCOB Eurozone Manufacturing PMI, compiled by S&amp;P Global, down to 42.7 in July, down from 43.4 in June. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction. That\u2019s the sixth monthly fall in a row, and the worst reading since May 2020 when pandemic restrictions hit manufacturing. Excluding pandemic-related and lockdown-hit months, the reductions seen for factory output and demand for eurozone goods were the most severe since the global financial crisis in 2008-09. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, says: \u201cIt looks like the manufacturing recession is here to stay in the eurozone. Stronger declines in output, new orders and purchase volumes at the start of the third quarter back up our view that the economy as a whole is in for a bumpy ride in the second half of the year. Elsewhere today, high street bakery chain Greggs has predicted that inflationary pressures will ease this year. Greggs told shareholders that cost inflation, particularly in food and packaging commodities, \u201ccontinued to be a feature of the first half of 2023\u201d, as it reports its latest financial results. But it should \u201cease somewhat\u201d in the rest of the year, as we catch up with the \u201csignificant mid-year increases seen in 2022\u201d. Greggs says: Overall like-for-like cost inflation was 11% in the first half of 2023 and we expect this to reduce to around 7% in the second half, averaging around 9% for the year as a whole, in line with our previously communicated expectations. Greggs also reported that its total first-half sales grew by 21.5%, swelling its underlying profits by 14.2%. The company has benefited from extending its trading hours, meaning it captures more sales from people out in the evening \u2013 with pizza in high demand. More customers are using its app too, and plant-based foods are a growing part of its fod range. Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, forecasts that prices have further to fall, saying: \u201cWe think that house prices will have to fall by about 8% from their peak before demand and supply come back into balance.\u201d With the Bank of England poised to raised interest rates again on Thursday, the housing market is likely to continue to cool this year as mortgage rates remain elevated. So predicts Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, who explains: UK Nationwide house prices fell by 3.8% year-on-year in July and 0.2% month-on-month. The average house price stands at \u00a3260,828, down from \u00a3262,239 last month. According to Nationwide, a typical first-time buyer with a 20% deposit is required to spend 43% of their take-home pay on mortgage payments, up sharply from 32% last year and above the long-run average of 29%. The annual reading suffered its largest decline since 2009 as rising mortgage rates and the cost-of-living crisis dampen demand for properties in Britain. The housing market is in the doldrums with sellers struggling to achieve their desired offers and therefore are less willing list their properties. For buyers, the affordability crisis has intensified after borrowing became significantly more expensive. For homeowners, weaker house prices has resulted in a negative wealth effect by reducing the value of their prized assets. For first time buyers, weaker house prices are a positive, however prices are yet to come down significantly enough to offset the pressures from rising mortgage rates. Getting back to the drop in UK house prices\u2026 Chris Hodgkinson, managing director of House Buyer Bureau, argues that the UK is not experiencing a house price crash: \u201cThe weakest level of annual house price growth since July 2009 is sure to cause alarm for the nation\u2019s home sellers and many will be keen to sell their home quickly before the rot sets in any further. The good news is that we\u2019re not in the midst of a market crash, albeit we are seeing a downward correction. However, the real challenge at present is the heightened level of market instability, the ability to actually find a buyer in a proceedable position and, once you have, making it through to completion without the transaction falling through.\u201d Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, points out that some major lenders have recently cut their mortgage rates. \u201cWith another 25 basis points interest rate rise expected from the Bank of England later this week, we are not out of the woods just yet when it comes to rising mortgage costs. \u201cHowever, a few lenders, including HSBC, Barclays and Nationwide, have reduced their fixed-rate mortgage pricing on the back of better-than-expected inflation news. This has led to a calming of swap rates, which underpin the pricing of fixed-rate mortgages, after weeks of considerable volatility.\u201d Nicola Schutrups, managing director at mortgage broker The Mortgage Hut, warns that \u201cthe direction of travel is now pretty clear\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty among people looking to purchase a new home, so it\u2019s no surprise prices continued to edge down on both a monthly and annual basis in July. Further falls in house prices are likely for the rest of 2023 but if inflation continues to come down and the jobs market remains strong, there\u2019s still a chance for a soft landing.\u201d In the City, shares in HSBC have jumped 2.1% at the start of trading on the London stock market after it more than doubled its profits for the first half of the year. They\u2019ve hit a four-year high. Traders are pleased that HSBC has announced its second $2bn share buyback of the year, as it continues to benefit from rising global interest rates. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, has analysed HSBC\u2019s results, and reports: Overall, the release is a tour de force which has been achieved through a combination of higher income, lower costs, the reshaping of the business, all while driving growth. The announcement of a further share buyback and upgrades to its guidance leave little for detractors to focus on. Although the recovery of the Chinese economy is currently faltering, prospects remain many and varied for HSBC, which is part of the reason for the recent outperformance of the share price. The slowdown in the UK housing market has hit earnings at Travis Perkins, the UK builders\u2019 merchant and home improvement retailer. Travis Perkins has reported a 31% drop in operating profits in the first six months of this year. It blames \u201cweak market volumes\u201d in new build housing, and in the private domestic market for renovation, maintenance and improvement, as people cut back at DIY work and home development projects. Nick Roberts, chief executive officer, says: \u201cMarket conditions have been challenging, which is reflected in both our first half performance and our outlook for the balance of the year. Roberts adds that near-term trading is expected to remain difficult. There is a \u201creal risk\u201d that rising interest rates push the UK economy into recession, warns Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. El-Erian tells BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the Bank of England (BoE) risks tipping the economy into recession as it raises borrowing costs to fight inflation. El-Erian says: People are feeling the pinch from higher mortgages, companies are feeling the pinch from higher borrowing costs, and global activity is not helping. So yes there is a real risk that we may slip into recession. He also predicts that the BoE will raise interest rates at its next meeting on Thursday, and again in September. El-Erian, who is President of Queens\u2018 College, Cambridge, warns that raising interest rates risks hurting the economy and the most vulnerable, saying: I don\u2019t think the Bank of England has much of a choice, given that it has a mission to deliver 2% inflation and we are running at almost four times that level [7.9% in June]. However, if it continues carrying the burden on its own, there will be colateral damage and unintended consequences to economic growth and to the wellbeing of the most vulnerable segments of our society. These charts from Nationwide show how UK house prices have dropped around 4.5% from their peak last summer, but are still sharply above their pre-pandemic levels. Estate agent Knight Frank are hopeful that sentiment in the housing market will improve through the rest of this year. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, explains: \u201cHigher borrowing costs have knocked sentiment and forced buyers to recalculate their budgets but the property market hasn\u2019t slammed on the brakes. The bank rate is nearing its peak, which means that while sentiment will remain subdued, it will only improve in the second half of this year. That said, prices and sales volumes will come under pressure as the market descends from the highs of the pandemic and adjusts to the new lending environment. While we expect UK prices to fall by 5% this year, demand should prove more resilient than expected between now and the general election given the cushioning effect of wage growth, high levels of housing equity, lockdown savings, the availability of longer mortgage terms, forbearance from lenders and the popularity of fixed-rate deals in recent years.\u201d Property lenders also warn that affordability is hitting house prices. Tomer Aboody, director of MT Finance, explains: \u2018The declining number of transactions, combined with negativity in the market, is pushing down property prices, a trend which has been evident for several months. \u2018The constant interest rate increases are making affordability difficult for buyers, as they try to make moves, with many waiting until some stability comes in. \u2018With some better news on inflation recently, it will be interesting to see whether the Bank of England postpones the next rate rise or goes for a slight increase, giving the market some breathing space to adjust.\u2019 Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says the drop in house prices in July is disappointing \u2013 but point out that it only covers buyers taking out a mortgage. Leaf also confirms that the housing market has softened: \u2019These figures are a little disappointing considering they are reflecting what was happening in the early to middle part of this year when we saw a rebound in sales before mortgage rates rose significantly. \u2018However, Nationwide\u2019s data, though comprehensive and widely respected, can only cover activity of its customers and won\u2019t include the cash buyers who have been dominating the market recently, trying to take advantage of more favourable prices. \u2018Clearly, the softening that we have seen in recent months in our offices can take up to a year to show itself in the figures so it may be some while yet before marked differences emerge.\u2019 Nationwide also point out that expectations for UK interest rates have been \u201cvolatile in recent months\u201d. In mid-May, the markets expected UK interest rates to peak at 5%. But by early July, that had jumped to 6.5% after UK inflation remained much higher than expected. Today, though, the peak is expected to be 5.75% next spring, up from 5% today. Nationwide\u2019s Robert Gardner says: There has been a slight tempering of expectations in recent weeks but longer-term interest rates, which underpin mortgage pricing, remain elevated. Nationwide adds that \u201ca relatively soft landing\u201d in the housing market is still achievable, if the economy develops as expected. Chief economist Robert Gardner explains: In particular, unemployment is expected to remain low (below 5%), and the vast majority of existing borrowers should be able to weather the impact of higher borrowing costs, given the high proportion on fixed rates, and where affordability testing should ensure that those needing to refinance can afford the higher payments. While activity is likely to remain subdued in the near term, healthy rates of nominal income growth, together with modestly lower house prices, should help to improve housing affordability over time, especially if mortgage rates moderate once Bank Rate peaks.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK house prices have fallen at their fastest rate since July 2009 as rising interest rates cool the property market. Nationwide has reported this morning that the average house price fell by 3.8% year-on-year in July, the biggest drop since the aftermath of the financial crisis. That\u2019s an increase on the 3.5% annual drop in house prices in June, and takes the price of a typical home down to 4.5% below the August 2022 peak. Prices dipped by 0.2% in July alone, on a seasonally adjusted basis, to an average of \u00a3260,828, down from \u00a3262,239. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, says the increase in interest rates in recent months have made it more challenging for prospective buyers to afford a mortgage on a new home. Gardner explains: For example, a prospective buyer, earning the average wage and looking to buy the typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit, would see monthly mortgage payments account for 43% of their take home pay (assuming a 6% mortgage rate). This is up from 32% a year ago and well above the long-run average of 29%. Moreover, deposit requirements continue to present a high hurdle \u2013 with a 10% deposit equivalent to 55% of gross annual average income. This challenging affordability picture helps to explain why housing market activity has been subdued in recent months. There were 86,000 completed housing transactions in June, 15% below the levels prevailing the same time last year and around 10% below pre-pandemic levels. More timely mortgage approval data showed a slight increase in activity in June, though most of these applications will pre-date the more recent rise in longer term interest rates. Moreover, activity is still c20% below 2019 levels. Data from the Bank of England yesterday showed that mortgage approvals in the UK rose to their highest level since October 2022 last month. That indicates borrowers were scrambling to secure home loan deals earlier this year before interest rates rose higher. Also coming up today UK food inflation has dropped to its lowest level this year. Food inflation decelerated to 13.4% in July, down from 14.6% in June, according to the British Retail Consortium. This is the lowest food inflation level since December 2022, with prices falling cross key staples such as oils, fats, fish, and breakfast cereals. Major blue-chip companies HSBC and BP are reporting results this morning. HSBC has more than doubled its pre-tax profits to $21.7bn, including a provisional gain of $1.5bn on the acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited. BP\u2019s profits have dropped, though, following the decline in oil and gas prices compared to last year. The oil giant still made underlying profits of $2.6bn for the second quarter of the year, down from almost $5bn BP made in January-March, while it made almost $8.5bn in the second quarter of 2022.

The terrible thing is that when you have children and love them very much, the abuse can be perpetuated through them. To protect them, I have kept quiet. I feel very keenly the distress of this woman who cannot tell her story, because no court has found the family abuser guilty of anything and he could sue her for defamation if he did not like reading the truth about himself (Why I could not tell my story of domestic abuse in my book \u2013 or put my name to this piece, 31 July). I have an ingenious solution. The hundreds of women who want to tell their story of domestic abuse should send their work to a collective, and the names of the authors reallocated at random, so that real stories are told, but they can be considered works of fiction as they did not happen to the designated authors. Getting the stories out there will help protect victims who do not understand that a cunning partner can beat them in more ways than one. Name and address supplied \u2022 I know exactly how the author of this article feels. My story has yet to be made public and perhaps can now be as the perpetrator is dead. But that doesn\u2019t give me the sense that I want of retribution or, at least, public shame. I have over the years told a few good friends of my abuse, and that has helped erase the stigma that one feels. But it would have been so wonderful if the perpetrator had been brought to justice in some way or at least publicly shamed. He went scot\u2011free and it has always preyed on my mind. Oh to be free of the thoughts and nightmares that occur. I hope that some day the anonymous writer\u2019s story can be told publicly with her name attached. Good luck to her. Name and address supplied \u2022 My family lived with domestic abuse from my father in all its forms for many years. My mother was regularly beaten, kept short of money, raped and psychologically abused. As children (myself, my sister and two brothers) we were witnesses and victims. We never spoke about it back then, we just internalised the trauma. My mother did contact the police when things were particularly severe, but my father just got a ticking off on the doorstep; no further action taken. My father, rather than spending his earnings on his family, would hoard and invest. After his death, I was told that he got close to being worth \u00a31m prior to the 2008 financial crash, a tidy sum for an unskilled labourer. About a year before he passed, he approached me, wanting to make amends. He wasn\u2019t ill at the time and, over the course of the coming months, we forged a civil relationship. When he did become ill and was hospitalised, he said he was eager to change his will to include his family. I arranged this for him, but he passed prior to signing. His original will left a very large sum to several charities. I appealed to them via solicitors for a percentage. I explained the circumstances of our family life and the domestic abuse, and that their donations were born out of our deprivation as children. They took it all without question.

But it\u2019s good news they did, because that You Be the Judge moment is the most engrossing of her new show Joysuck, which recounts her experience of violent assault, recovery and the sentencing of her assailant. Deol is that most unlikely combination, a standup comic and Oscar-shortlisted documentarian, for a 2010 film about female Nepalese rebels.

            "date": "2023-08-28T09:32:23Z",
            "content": "The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has taken his green diplomatic policy for a test spin in Brazil this month in the hope that \u201cclimate justice\u201d can serve as an international rallying cry for a future Labour government. In an interview with the Guardian, Lammy said a Labour victory at the next general election would allow Keir Starmer to build a partnership for radical climate action with Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, before the UN\u2019s Cop30 climate summit in Bel\u00e9m in 2025. \u201cIt could be a very exciting, progressive moment where they could jointly move forward in a deep and long-lasting way, not just for the sake of our two countries but for the sake of the planet,\u201d Lammy said. \u201cThe global community has been missing the UK being serious about these issues for some time.\u201d Lammy is attempting to put clear green space between Labour\u2019s foreign policy and that of the Conservative government led by Rishi Sunak, who was criticised for initially intending to skip last year\u2019s climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, cutting the UK\u2019s aid budget to 0.5% of GDP when he was chancellor, and approving a raft of new oil and gas drilling licences in the North Sea. Lammy, by contrast, has spent much of the past year pushing a \u201cgreen foreign policy\u201d that is intended to echo the \u201cethical foreign policy\u201d of the former Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook. He said he wanted to make the climate emergency one of the priorities of the United Nations security council, to introduce the concept of \u201cecocide\u201d into international law, to restore UK foreign aid to 0.7% of GDP and to build a \u201cclean power alliance\u201d of countries committed to renewable energy that would act as a counterbalance to the Opec oil cartel. In Brazil, Lammy has discussed these and other ideas with the foreign minister, Mauro Vieira, and senior officials from other ministries in Brasilia, as well as visiting indigenous and agro-forestry communities in the Amazon rainforest with the NGO Conservation International. \u201cWhat I detect in Brazil is that it wants a serious partner in the shape of the UK,\u201d Lammy said on a video call from Santarem. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had that in the UK. We have got a prime minister at the moment who is using the climate emergency as a political football. He has just granted a whole stack of new licences to drill oil in the North Sea. That has come up in conversation here in Brazil because it sends exactly the wrong messages from the global north.\u201d The Labour party has been accused of softening several of its green pledges. Earlier this year, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said Labour\u2019s much-vaunted \u00a328bn-a-year green prosperity plan would be delayed to the second half of a new Labour administration. Starmer also blamed the extension of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) anti-pollution scheme in London for the party\u2019s narrow byelection loss in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Labour has promised not to issue any new oil and gas licences in the North Sea but would still allow production at existing sites to continue for 20 to 30 years. That is unlikely to persuade countries such as Brazil that they should forego opening up new fossil fuel drilling sites. Lammy acknowledged his Brazilian counterparts were consistent in calling out \u201cwhat they sometimes see as hypocrisy in parts of the global north\u201d, but he said it would be too onerous for Labour to negate existing licences. \u201cI can tell you as a lawyer that those licences have huge commercial implications once granted and they are extremely costly to unpick. That makes it very difficult during a cost of living crisis in the UK and with inflation running at 6.7% \u2026 but we will not grant new licences. That is the leadership people want to see.\u201d Lammy said he had witnessed distressingly high levels of deforestation on his trip to the Amazon, and praised Lula\u2019s success in reducing the damage during his first six months as president and committing to a goal of zero-deforestation by 2030. However, he was less enthusiastic about the European Union\u2019s important contribution to achieve that target through the introduction of deforestation-free trade rules. Asked if the UK might adopt equally stringent controls, Lammy suggested a future Labour government would look more sympathetically towards Brazil\u2019s complaints that such regulations were onerous. \u201cWe are not part of the European Union and I detected from the Brazilians that this gives the UK more flexibility because there have been issues between the EU and the Brazilians. That is a discussion I am willing to have with the Brazilians,\u201d he said. Overall, he said, his aim was to boost bilateral trade, which is currently at a low level. Brazil is one of the top 10 economies in the world, yet ranks as the UK\u2019s 35th biggest trading partner. In response to the suggestion that many voters would be alarmed if an increase in trade came at the expense of strong controls on goods linked to deforestation, Lammy insisted this would not be the case. He said the focus needed to be on climate justice, job creation and opportunities to reduce inequality while improving the environment. The shadow foreign secretary, whose family roots are in neighbouring Guyana, said the key was to protect the livelihoods of the custodians of nature, who had long been under pressure from an extractive economy model that exploited people and the environment with little heed for the long-term consequences. Nature needed to be a focus of diplomacy, he said, pointing to his call for a cautionary pause on deep-sea mining and his \u201cpassionate\u201d support for the Amazon. \u201cMy foreign policy will be pursued as a green foreign policy,\u201d he said, insisting he was in step with Starmer and the shadow climate secretary, Ed Miliband. \u201cOur commitment to the environment is central to the way we look at the world.\u201d"

Malkinson and his legal team first heard that the Criminal Cases Review Commission was launching a review into its handling of his case after the Guardian contacted them about it on Thursday. Malkinson, 57, was convicted in 2004 over a rape in Greater Manchester the year before that he did not commit. The CCRC twice considered his case before referring it for appeal after fresh DNA testing linked another man to the crime. The Guardian revealed earlier this week that the commission knew during his first application in 2009 that another man\u2019s DNA had been found in a \u201ccrime specific\u201d location on the victim\u2019s clothes, but declined to do further forensic testing, request the full police file or refer the case for appeal. The CCRC\u2019s chair, Helen Pitcher, discussed the case with the justice minister, Alex Chalk, on Wednesday and announced the review on Thursday. Since then, several senior figures in the legal and judicial system have said one of the chief issues the CCRC is facing is underfunding. However, Malkinson said: \u201cThe problem at the CCRC is attitude. They were set up as an independent body to investigate suspected miscarriages of justice. \u201cThey are misconstruing independence as being independence from the prisoners like me applying to them, rather than independence [from] the agencies that wrongfully convicted us. \u201cThe CCRC have not communicated with me since my conviction was overturned. We found out that they were launching an inquiry into my case from a journalist because she had received a press release. That is the attitude problem, right there.\u201d Pitcher has not given an interview since Malkinson\u2019s conviction was overturned last month. Malkinson has called for a broader public inquiry and an apology from Pitcher. James Burley, the charity Appeal\u2019s investigator on Malkinson\u2019s case, said: \u201cAndy\u2019s case highlights institutional failings at the CCRC, including its lack of an investigative mindset and deference to the courts and police. These problems have festered because the CCRC is not accountable. \u201cFlawed CCRC decisions can only be challenged by judicial review, which is expensive and ineffective. A new free and independent tribunal is needed to ensure flawed CCRC decisions can be scrutinised and challenged by those seeking to clear their names.\u201d Prof Graham Zellick, who was chair of the CCRC until 2008, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Friday that the government had diminished the commission. \u201cThe workload has gone up very considerably since I left in 2008. Sadly, the funding hasn\u2019t risen commensurately,\u201d he said. \u201c[The] government bears considerable responsibility for diminishing in many ways the role and capacity of the commission, and that needs to be looked at.\u201d As well as running the CCRC, Pitcher is chair of the judicial appointments commission. When asked if this was a conflict of interest, Zellick told the BBC that Pitcher used to be his student and described meeting judges regularly when he was in post. Malkinson\u2019s lawyer, Emily Bolton, said: \u201cInstitutional culture is set by who you select to lead, who you hire and who you talk to. CCRC\u2019s investigation advisers are ex-police, their executives are barristers, their previous chair was a prosecutor and the current chair appoints judges. \u201cIn Today\u2019s interview with previous chair Graham Zellick, he talked about how often he had meetings with the senior judiciary when he was in post. But investigation is not about what the law is, it is about what the facts are, and about what facts have been covered up by agents of the law. \u201cInvestigative journalists have the skills that CCRC need, not barristers and judges. Their expertise is in legal decision-making and that should come last, when all the facts have been uncovered. With only half the facts, case decisions will always be flawed, whether at the CCRC level or in the court of appeal.\u201d The CCRC has been contacted for comment. A spokesperson said on Thursday: \u201cA review into the decisions taken in Mr Malkinson\u2019s case couldn\u2019t be started until we had the judgment from the court of appeal, but we have long recognised that it would be important to have one. \u201cWe will be as open as we can be within our statutory constraints with the findings of the completed review and the lessons to be learned. \u201cThis is a complex case in which many elements have informed the decisions taken. We recognise that Mr Malkinson has had a very long journey to clear his name, and it is plainly wrong that he spent 17 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. \u201cWe have already been in touch with Greater Manchester police and with the Crown Prosecution Service to offer our assistance in any of their inquiries.\u201d A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cThe lord chancellor has been clear he is committed to uncovering any lessons learned in Andrew Malkinson\u2019s case. He is carefully considering how best to get the answers Mr Malkinson deserves.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-06T08:03:05Z",
            "content": "American democracy is only as strong as its legal system. The founders of the country created the judiciary as the third branch of the federal government to keep executive power in check and prevent corruption. So it was a cause for deep concern last week when Donald Trump unleashed a verbal tantrum on his Truth Social platform, accusing special counsel Jack Smith of \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d even before he filed four federal criminal counts against the former president over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in a bid to remain in office. An identical barrage came last April when a Manhattan grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony charges for falsifying business records. That time, he also called for defunding the justice department and the FBI, even though the charges did not come from either federal agency. Both reactions were part of a long-running campaign by Trump to undermine the rule of law in the US and dismiss the multiple charges he faces, and has denied, as politically motivated. Even lawyers who once supported Trump have told me that delegitimising the law and the judiciary could destroy the country\u2019s system of government. Yet, even if he is convicted, Trump\u2019s supporters will probably remain loyal to him, convinced that the entire legal system is \u201crigged\u201d \u2013 a favourite Trumpism. On one level, it is shocking to hear the worries that US lawyers are expressing about the impact of Trump\u2019s outbursts. On another, what we\u2019re witnessing in Washington is part of a trend happening around the world. From Hungary to Pakistan, the power of judges is being reduced and legal systems are being upended. It\u2019s been painful to watch. Since 1980, I\u2019ve spent my journalism career covering the courts. Decades ago, one of my best legal sources, a highly paid partner at one of Washington\u2019s powerhouse law firms, called to tell me he was quitting his job to help the United Nations, as pro bono counsel, to design American-style constitutions for other countries at a time when global autocracies were crumbling. Now, many US voters doubt whether our democracy will survive. In Pakistan and other countries, judges have been assassinated. In Hungary, according to the Guardian, Viktor Orb\u00e1n is leading \u201chis government\u2019s assault on judicial checks and balances\u201d. In 2022, Iran arrested at least 44 independent lawyers who were representing demonstrators protesting against the ruling regime\u2019s violent crackdown on dissent. Legal freedoms previously enjoyed in countries such as India and China are in tatters. In 2020, a column by Washington Post global writer Rana Ayyub carried the headline, \u201cThe destruction of India\u2019s judicial independence is almost complete\u201d. Before the British government handed over Hong Kong in 1997, China agreed to a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, which granted Hong Kong broad legal freedoms. Beijing has abrogated those freedoms, enforcing a 2020 national security law that gave it broad new authority to silence and punish critics. In May, members of the US Congress urged sanctions against Chinese judges handling national security cases under the new law, which has profoundly changed life in Hong Kong. Even in Israel, long America\u2019s stalwart democratic ally, the power of independent judges has been curtailed, sparking furious public demonstrations. Trump\u2019s raging attacks on the US legal system come at a time when the supreme court has the lowest approval ratings in history. The court customarily follows legal precedent but in recent decisions the justices in the conservative majority have reversed past decisions guaranteeing women\u2019s right to an abortion, affirmative action in universities, gun restrictions and other established laws. The founders intended the judicial branch of the federal government to be insulated from politics, which is why federal judges enjoy lifetime tenure. But in their stinging dissent when the court reversed Roe v Wade in 2022, the three liberal justices wrote: \u201cThe court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this court has changed.\u201d During Trump\u2019s four-year term as president, he added three staunchly conservative, anti-abortion justices to the court. In an act of raw political muscle, Republicans in the Senate refused to act on President Barack Obama\u2019s final supreme court nominee, Merrick Garland, the man who is Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general and whose justice department Trump wants to defenestrate. Trump is also targeting government lawyers, although his own lawyers are the enablers of his alleged crimes. Five Trump lawyers were named co-conspirators in last week\u2019s indictment for using crackpot legal theories and unlawful ploys to overturn Biden\u2019s election as president. The most famous is the former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani who, according to the indictment, pressured state election officials to switch their electors from Biden to Trump. The disciplinary committee of the district of Columbia has recommended that Giuliani be disbarred. John Eastman, another accused co-conspirator, joined Trump\u2019s legal team later and convinced him that the vice-president Mike Pence had the legal power to declare Trump the winner on 6 January 2020 when he clearly did not. According to the New York Times, a federal judge who considered some of the evidence against the lawyer co-conspirators called their plot to overturn the election \u201ca coup in search of a legal theory\u201d. They remain uncharged, probably because Smith is more likely to get a trial before the 2024 presidential election if Trump is the sole defendant. Tanya Chutkan, the judge assigned to the case, has already given stiff jail sentences to several of those convicted for breaking into the Capitol on 6 January 2020. In polls of Republican voters, the former president holds a huge lead over all his challengers for his party\u2019s nomination. Pandering to the Trump base, some of the other GOP presidential candidates, including the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, have said they would consider pardoning Trump. Fellow Republican candidate Asa Hutchinson, the former governor of Arkansas, has called such promises \u201coffensive\u201d. What is at stake is not just the outcome and aftermath of the next presidential election in America, fateful though that is. Across the globe, the fragile relationship between the political and judicial spheres is broken or under strain, and what happens in Washington will serve both as a stark warning of the consequences of that rupture and to give licence to other anti-democratic regimes. The US used to be a beacon of good governance. It is in danger of exporting entropy. \u2022 Jill Abramson is a former executive editor of the New York Times Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2023-08-30T17:39:25Z",
            "content": "Airlines have urged reform of compensation rules after the \u201cstaggering\u201d revelation that a single wrongly input flight plan to UK air traffic control disrupted hundreds of thousands of passengers\u2019 flights. Nats, which controls UK airspace, said \u201can unusual piece of data\u201d had caused the unprecedented system failure on Monday, which led to more than 1,600 flights being axed and many more delayed. Would-be holidaymakers and returning travellers were counting the cost on Wednesday, with many missing trips or yet to fly home and having to arrange accommodation. EasyJet started additional repatriation flights from Spain and Portugal, as stranded passengers reported having to sleep on floors, amid criticism of airlines for failing to look after customers. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, reiterated calls on airlines to \u201chonour their obligations\u201d while Labour said the government should give the regulator more powers to protect passengers. Sunak said: \u201cIt is important that airlines honour their obligations to passengers with regards to accommodation and flights to bring them back home.\u201d Airlines are not expected to pay additional delay compensation to passengers for the current meltdown, as the circumstances are deemed outside their control. But industry body Iata estimated airlines could lose \u00a3100m in revenue and in the costs of alternative travel as well as accommodation and food that passengers can reclaim, and urged the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to review the system to make Nats (formerly known as National Air Traffic Services) contribute. Willie Walsh, the director general of Iata, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair because the air traffic control system, which was at the heart of this failure, doesn\u2019t pay a single penny.\u201d The row escalated as Nats\u2019 chief executive revealed that one piece of data received had sparked the system failure when it \u201cdidn\u2019t recognise a message\u201d. Martin Rolfe said that Nats\u2019 automatic flight planning had been designed to stop for safety reasons to \u201censure that no incorrect information could impact the rest of the air traffic system\u201d. He ruled out a cyber-attack, and declined to confirm or deny claims that the wrongly submitted information came from a French airline. Walsh said it was a \u201cstaggering\u201d explanation. He told the BBC: \u201cIf that is true, it demonstrates a considerable weakness.\u201d He said that the UK should \u201clook at the way passenger compensation is dealt with to ensure that the people who are responsible for the delays and cancellations ultimately bear the costs\u201d. However, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said airlines had long \u201cplayed fast and loose\u201d and ministers should \u201cstop dragging their feet and give regulators the powers they need to stand up for passengers\u201d. An investigation is ongoing and the regulator, the CAA, is due to deliver a first report to the transport secretary on Monday. About 70 flights were cancelled on Wednesday morning, primarily at London Heathrow, as operations returned near normal, after almost 400 flights were cancelled on Tuesday due to planes and crew being out of position. Some flights were still delayed for more than an hour at London Gatwick, where the biggest carrier, easyJet, cancelled virtually all international flights on Monday afternoon due to the stoppage. The airport said average delays were down from 40 minutes on Tuesday to 13 on Wednesday. The chief executive of Gatwick, Stewart Wingate, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard with our key airline partners, to make sure that we work collectively to do the right thing by our passengers.\u201d He said the airport would \u201ccertainly incur costs\u201d, but a fraction of airlines\u2019, and said \u201cat the forefront of our minds is to look after passengers\u2019 welfare\u201d. On Tuesday, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, appeared to suggest an independent inquiry. Wingate urged that any such inquiry be done quickly: \u201cWhat we\u2019ll then hopefully see are actions put in place to give us even more resilience to the Nats systems.\u201d Earlier, Rolfe said that the UK\u2019s air traffic control system was \u201cthe envy of the world\u201d due to the amount of planes it could handle. He told the Independent that the issue was first identified at about 8.30am on Monday, and engineers hoped to fix it within a four-hour timeframe that would allow backup systems to operate. However, unusually they were unable to remedy it in time. He added: \u201cThe reason for the disruption was precisely because we are absolutely wanting to guarantee everybody\u2019s safety.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-02T16:56:23Z",
            "content": "A powerful Democrat senator has called Samuel Alito\u2019s public expression of opposition to US supreme court ethics reform \u201cunwise and unwelcome\u201d, rejecting the conservative justice\u2019s contention that Congress cannot implement such measures. \u201cJustice Alito is providing speculative public commentary on a bill that is still going through the legislative process,\u201d said Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois and the chair of the Senate judiciary committee. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Justice Alito is not the 101st member of the United States Senate. His intervention \u2026 is unwise and unwelcome,\u201d he added in a statement. Last week, Alito spoke to the Wall Street Journal, often an outlet for his views and complaints. Discussing Washington scandals about rightwing justices taking gifts from donors with business before the court \u2013 most notably over Clarence Thomas\u2019s links to Harlan Crow and Alito\u2019s own fishing trip with Paul Singer \u2013 Alito said: \u201cI marvel at all the nonsense that has been written about me in the last year.\u201d Saying he was defending himself because \u201cnobody else is going to do this\u201d, the George W Bush-appointed conservative, 73, said: \u201cCongress did not create the supreme court. \u201cI know this is a controversial view, but I\u2019m willing to say it. No provision in the constitution gives them the authority to regulate the supreme court \u2013 period.\u201d Durbin, who with Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island has sought to pilot ethics reform in response to the Thomas and Alito scandals, rejected Alito\u2019s position. \u201cThe ethical conduct of supreme court justices is a serious matter within this committee\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d he said. \u201cEnsuring ethical conduct by the justices is critical to the court\u2019s legitimacy.\u201d The conservative chief justice, John Roberts, presides over a court dominated 6-3 by rightwingers who have recently delivered major rulings on abortion, gun control, LGBTQ+ rights, race-based affirmative action and other divisive issues. Roberts has also resisted calls for ethics reform, or even testimony about ethics scandals. Durbin continued: \u201cThe next time Justice Alito thinks about taking a private plane to a billionaire-funded fishing trip, he should have to ask more than \u2018Can I take this empty seat?\u2019 He should have to ask if doing so is consistent with his legally mandated ethical obligations.\u201d The push for ethics reform is unlikely to succeed. Senate Republicans oppose it and even if they did not, Republicans hold the House and are unlikely to take up the bill. Nonetheless, Durbin continued: \u201cI\u2019ve said from the beginning of this inquiry: if the court does not act on ethics reform, Congress will. We advanced a bill to do so last month, and we will continue our push to ensure that the highest court in America does not have the lowest ethical standards.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-19T05:00:10Z",
            "content": "A small stone bridge which arches across a crystal-clear stream in the Cairngorms has become the symbol of a fresh land reform battle over private financiers buying up Highland estates. Dragonflies dart under its delicate single-span arch, while meadowsweet, bog myrtle, Scottish bluebells, mountain pansy and dainty yellow trefoil add splashes of vibrant colour to the dense carpet of heather along its banks. The bridge is a scheduled monument, built on an estate known as Far Ralia near Newtonmore, in the late 1720s by General George Wade\u2019s engineers. It sits on one of the Highlands\u2019 famous network of Wade\u2019s roads, laid to help the British army reach deep into the mountains after the Jacobite rebellion of 1715. In 2021, Far Ralia was bought for \u00a37.5m by a property investment trust run by the Scottish investment firm Standard Life, now known as Abrdn, to help it offset its CO2 emissions and in time sell carbon credits. Abrdn Property Income Trust plans to plant more than a million trees over 765 hectares (1,890 acres) and restore 200 hectares of damaged peatland; in all, the estate \u2013 previously a grouse moor and deer forest \u2013 covers 1,462 hectares. Abrdn quickly became known as another of Scotland\u2019s \u201cgreen lairds\u201d, the growing group of absentee landlords snapping up Highland estates to plant new forests and woods, and to rejuvenate peatland, as large corporations invest in efforts to tackle the climate crisis. With NatureScot, the official conservation agency, having signed a deal with private financiers to invest up to \u00a32bn in woodland creation and biodiversity projects to help combat the climate crisis, partly funded by carbon credits, sensitivities about projects such as this are escalating. The Wade bridge, regarded as one of the finest surviving examples, sits on the estate\u2019s boundary. Last year Abrdn\u2019s contractors sank fence posts into the ends of its parapets to control access to the estate, to the fury of conservationists. Complaints were submitted to the Highland council by Laggan Heritage, a local history group. The gate was moved but the controversy over Abrdn\u2019s activities at Far Ralia, which sits on the western side of the Cairngorms national park, escalated. Parkswatch, an influential blog which investigates the activities of Scottish national park landowners, raised detailed complaints about a large road cut deep into the estate to carry forestry vehicles, accusing planning authorities of failing to properly enforce rural planning rules. The road, part of which covered up the Wade road, involved erecting an industrial-looking steel bridge over the burn this summer, supported by banks of bright green sandbags, only a few metres from the Wade bridge. Despite its wealth \u2013 the investment trust had a portfolio worth \u00a3437m last year \u2013 Parkswatch discovered that Abrdn had won \u00a32.56m in public subsidy to help its tree-planting, funding that includes 556,000 vole guards to protect the saplings from being eaten. Abrdn also hopes to get funding for its peatland restoration. Pete Moore, of Laggan Heritage, said Abrdn\u2019s approach to the local community seemed naive and tokenistic. \u201cThey\u2019re operating in the goldfish bowl of a national park, and their main problem is they\u2019re not setting out a very clear plan or communicating that to local businesses and the local community,\u201d he said. Abrdn, one of Scotland\u2019s largest financial firms, insists the project will follow the highest standards. It is heavily culling deer to promote natural regeneration, using the same methods as its near neighbour, the Danish billionaire conservationist Anders Povlsen. Abrdn estimates Far Ralia could sequestrate up 150,000 tonnes of CO2 by 2060. It cites a report by Prof Andy Purvis, of the Natural History Museum in London, which found the project would in time greatly boost the area\u2019s biodiversity. \u201cFar Ralia can expect strengthened resilience and ecosystem-service security,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly a successful outcome for the regeneration plan.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2023. An earlier version said that Abrdn were planting \u201cmillions\u201d of trees, when it is planting 1.2m. A picture caption also said it was a \u201cnew road on the Far Ralia estate\u201d. This has been amended to a \u201croad leading to the Far Ralia estate\u201d."

            "date": "2023-08-05T12:00:41Z",
            "content": "Tim Gioe will never forget how his Roman Catholic priest, Patrick Wattigny, used their time alone when he was a boy. It was during these moments together \u2013 during the sacrament of confession \u2013 that Wattigny began grooming him for sexual abuse, of which the clergyman was recently convicted. So now the 36-year-old Gioe and his wife, Sarah, who are raising three sons together, are advocating for schools and other parochial institutions to be formally required to obtain fully informed parental consent before priests are left alone with children to hear about \u2013 and forgive \u2013 their sins as part of what is also known as reconciliation. The Gioes would also like for it to be required to offer parents the opportunity to at least see into any space where such confessions would be heard, to reduce the chances of anything abusive taking place. \u201cMe and Sarah have had some conversations about whether we would ever allow our children to be in [confession alone] or one-on-one with a priest,\u201d Gioe said. \u201cAnd the answer, for me, is no.\u201d As the Gioes told it recently to the Guardian, it\u2019s easy to understand why the topic is an urgent one for the couple, who are nurse practitioners and run a psychiatric office together. For one, despite Tim\u2019s abuse, he and Sarah are sending their boys \u2013 ages two, five and seven \u2013 to local parochial schools because they often offer better educations than many of their public counterparts in their home state of Louisiana. The pair, who met while they were in nursing school, also still believe in their Catholic faith. Then there\u2019s the lifelong effects of the violation of trust that Gioe endured at the hands of Wattigny, 55. For the first time ever with a media outlet, Tim agreed to open up about it \u2013 along with how Sarah and other loved ones helped him survive pressing a case against Wattigny \u2013 in hopes that his experience somehow shields others from undergoing a similar ordeal. \u201cEvil does exist,\u201d Gioe said. Addressing those who may be in positions to consider reforms like the one he\u2019s suggesting, he remarked: \u201cWhat are they going to do to protect my kids, to protect their kids, and to protect their kids\u2019 kids?\u201d Gioe recalled that he was nine when he met Wattigny in the summer of 1996 in Covington, Louisiana, about 40 miles north of New Orleans. Gioe\u2019s family had just moved there from another south-east Louisiana community, and Wattigny tried to warm himself to the boy by telling Tim that he and his father had gone to high school together. Wattigny also spoke approvingly of how Tim played baseball and would offer the boy pro players\u2019 cards for him to add to his collection, according to Gioe. \u201cHe \u2026 became \u2026 very much like a friend,\u201d Gioe said of Wattigny. \u201cHe told me I could tell him anything.\u201d Soon, Gioe ended up going to confession with Wattigny, which Catholics are required to complete if they want to then engage in the sacrament of communion. Wattigny said \u201canything we talked about was confidential \u2013 that he could not tell others what we discussed, nor could I tell anyone else,\u201d Gioe recalled. \u201cThe only way to heaven \u2013 and not hell \u2013 was to be completely honest with him because God knew if I was lying.\u201d Gioe recounted how Wattigny made it a point to ask him about his sexuality and sexual development during his confessions, beginning with the first one. That made Tim uncomfortable, but he answered Wattigny\u2019s questions believing he had to so the priest would tell him what prayers he should say to gain forgiveness for his sins. Then came the day where Wattigny curtly told Gioe that he was in trouble and needed to follow him to the rectory. Gioe said he obeyed, and when they were alone, Wattigny fondled his genitals, used his fingers to rape him and told the boy he would go to hell if he told anyone what had happened. \u201cHe turned on me,\u201d Gioe said of Wattigny. \u201cI thought he was the closest thing to God \u2013 the closest thing to love and peace \u2013 but he was the exact opposite.\u201d Gioe for years abided by Wattigny\u2019s demand to keep quiet \u2013 at great personal cost to him. Even as he has pursued a career in mental healthcare and started a family with Sarah, he\u2019s had panic attacks during weddings, funerals and places where \u201cpeople gather to pray\u201d. Gioe can\u2019t help but wonder if a bout with thyroid cancer in his 20s was at all linked to his molestation by Wattigny or the emotional turmoil that it caused, citing a study which found higher rates of cancer among child sexual abuse victims. Ultimately, Gioe reconsidered his silence after news broke about three years ago that a former student at a Catholic high school in Slidell, Louisiana, where Wattigny had been chaplain reported that the clergyman had molested him in about 2013. Not only were there also reports at the time that Wattigny had sent inappropriate text messages to at least one other child at that school. After the archdiocese had sent him to therapy, Wattigny had also confessed to groping, fondling and kissing children while sexually fantasizing about students around him, too. When Gioe decided to call authorities and report what Wattigny had coerced him into keeping secret, the clergyman had been arrested in connection with the 2013 case. And he had been suspended from publicly administering masses indefinitely. But he had also been released from custody on bail, and had pleaded not guilty. The ensuing chain of events was grueling, Gioe said. He felt like the first investigator with whom he worked was overly skeptical of Gioe\u2019s recollections before another detective took over the case. Going over what Wattigny had done was so draining that he occasionally couldn\u2019t get out of bed to be with Sarah and their boys, whose sports teams he coaches. Authorities did rearrest Wattigny and charge him in connection with Gioe\u2019s report last year. But then when all indications were that he would plead guilty in June, the case was unexpectedly postponed for a month. The Gioes were in court when they realized the appointments they had canceled and the money they had spent on a babysitter for their children that day were for nothing. When everyone reconvened on 12 July, Wattigny pleaded guilty as charged to one count of molestation of a juvenile under his supervision in the case dating back to 2013. For Gioe, the clergyman entered what is known as an Alford plea, in which defendants technically stop short of admitting wrongdoing but declare themselves guilty because they acknowledge evidence against them would likely result in their conviction. Gioe read a four-page statement to Wattigny that day in which he told him: \u201cYou, sir, are not God. You never were and you never will be.\u201d Then, while Tim sat alongside Sarah and other family members, the judge overseeing the case \u2013 John Keller \u2013 ordered Wattigny to spend five years in prison and to register as a sex offender upon his release. The leniency of the punishment stung the Gioes, both said. He furthermore couldn\u2019t believe it when his attorney, Bill Arata, was told by authorities that Wattigny wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for the inappropriate texts that he had been caught sending because there is no law in Louisiana which criminalizes grooming someone for molestation. Only the abuse itself is illegal, Arata was told. Despite an order prohibiting him from ever contacting Tim or his family, he is dreading how he\u2019ll handle it when Wattigny completes his sentence \u2013 mainly because mental health experts have concluded there is no cure for pedophilia, only treatments. \u201cI can see why people don\u2019t come forward,\u201d Tim said. Yet Tim Gioe also acknowledges that many clerical molestation victims never see their abusers land behind bars. In fact, of 17 priests or deacons who were still living when the archdiocese of New Orleans added them to an internally maintained list of credibly accused abusers, Wattigny is the only one who has subsequently been convicted of a crime. \u201cI do feel lucky that he\u2019s in prison,\u201d Gioe said. \u201cBut I\u2019m still pissed.\u201d Nonetheless, the Gioes look forward. They are quick to say that they understand most priests aren\u2019t abusers like Wattigny. But they still hope their suggested changes to confession are given serious consideration by the relevant powers. And they also hope Tim\u2019s story continues to erode the skepticism that some still direct at clerical molestation survivors when they first report their abuse. \u201cThey deserve to be \u2026 respected,\u201d Sarah Gioe said. \u201cThey deserve to be believed \u2013 especially if there\u2019s a priest that\u2019s already confessed.\u201d"

British Transport Police said they were called to the line near Newark Northgate station at about 7.10pm on Thursday evening after reports of a casualty on the tracks. One man was found with non-life threatening electrocution injuries, and another man, a Nottinghamshire police officer, sustained life-changing injuries and remains in a critical condition in hospital. The two men were taken to Queen\u2019s Medical Centre in Nottingham where they remain. The incident occurred after Nottinghamshire police were called to a residential area in Balderton near Newark-on-Trent over concerns for a man\u2019s safety shortly before 7pm. Nottinghamshire Chief Constable Kate Meynell said: \u201cThis is a truly devastating incident that has left one of our officers very poorly in hospital. We are supporting his family and ensuring that he gets all the care and support he needs. \u201cThis was also extremely traumatic for all those who attended the scene, some of whom provided immediate medical assistance while the ambulance was on its way. \u201cI would like to personally thank them for their quick and dedicated response to this incident. Officers and police staff put themselves in danger every day to keep the public safe and from harm and I personally want to say how eternally grateful and proud I am of them all.\u201d Robert Jenrick, the MP for Newark, said: \u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with the police officer critically injured in the line of duty at Newark station. Terrible incidents such as this remind us of the bravery of those serving in Nottinghamshire police and police forces across the country. \u201cRisking your life to try to save someone else is the epitome of public service.\u201d Simon Riley, chair of the Nottinghamshire Police Federation, said the organisation was \u201csupporting a number of officers involved in the incident and will continue to do everything we can to support all of our members at this time\u201d.

            "date": "2023-08-11T08:00:32Z",
            "content": "The devastating fires in Hawaii, where at least 55 people have died after a conflagration that engulfed the historic town of Lahaina, were worsened by a number of factors including the climate crisis, scientists have said. Rising global temperatures and drought have helped turn parts of Hawaii into a tinderbox ahead of one of the deadliest fires in modern US history, with these conditions worsened by strong winds from a nearby cyclone. Katharine Hayhoe, the chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, said that global heating is causing vegetation to dry out, priming it as fuel for an outbreak of fire. \u201cClimate change doesn\u2019t usually start the fires; but it intensifies them, increasing the area they burn and making them much more dangerous,\u201d Hayhoe tweeted. Nearly a fifth of Maui, the Hawaiian island where the fires have occurred, is in severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. The island has experienced other serious fires in recent years, with blazes in 2018 and 2021 razing hundreds of homes and causing the evacuation of thousands of residents and tourists. Experts say that wildfires in Hawaii are now burning through four times the amount of area than in previous decades, in part due to the proliferation of more flammable non-native grasses but also rising global temperatures. \u201cWe can say there are conditions that are consistent with wildfire, wildfire size and expansion that are changing as climate changes,\u201d Erica Fleishman, a climate scientist at Oregon State University told CNN. \u201cAnd some of the things that we\u2019re seeing with this wildfire in Maui are consistent with some of the trends that are known and projected as climate changes.\u201d Hawaii is experiencing increasingly dry conditions, with scientists calculating that 90% of the state is getting less rainfall than it did a century ago, with the period since 2008 particularly dry. The growing susceptibility of Hawaii to major fires was highlighted by a 2015 study that found that rainfall has been 31% lower in the wet season since 1990, in selected monitoring sites on the islands. The state, known for its volcanoes and lush forests, is in parts drying out as global heating continues to escalate. The flames that tore through Lahaina, meanwhile, were fanned by winds from the passing Hurricane Dora and the climate crisis is causing an overall increase in strong cyclones in the central Pacific. The influence of the cyclone upon the fires surprised scientists, given that Dora was churning around 500 miles away from Maui. \u201cHurricane Dora is very far away from Hawaii, but you still have this fire occurrence here,\u201d said Pao-Shin Chu, Hawaii\u2019s state climatologist. \u201cSo this is something we didn\u2019t expect to see.\u201d Those concerned about the climate crisis, meanwhile, called for further efforts to combat global heating from Joe Biden, who has declared a federal disaster in Hawaii. \u201cWe need to take action immediately or else it will get even worse,\u201d said Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator. \u201cThe extreme wildfires in Lahania, in this summer of climate disasters, are yet more proof that we are in a climate emergency and this crisis is killing us,\u201d said Kaniela Ing, a climate activist and Indigenous leader in Hawaii."

            "date": "2023-08-29T17:58:59Z",
            "content": "\u201cClimate change is a very complex topic that is not just about data and information and physics, it\u2019s about culture and politics and psychological responses,\u201d the author and newly minted museum curator Jeff Goodell said to the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we choose to live, what we value. The science part of it is a small sliver of the larger conversation \u2013 it\u2019s really important, but it\u2019s just the beginning of the conversation. There are vast dimensions of thinking about this subject that we have not really begun to approach.\u201d He\u2019s speaking from Austin, Texas, where he\u2019s putting the finishing touches on a new show at the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas. Called If the Sky Were Orange, it seeks to bring complexity and curiosity to a climate change discourse that is often reduced to political polarization and degrees fahrenheit. Goodell hopes in talking about climate change in ways that are often not heard, the show will generate new thinking that might move us beyond the familiar impasses. If the Sky Were Orange germinated over months of conversations, eventually becoming a sort of experiment in bringing together art and science and literature. The show collects an idiosyncratic and impressive grouping of nearly 60 works from as far back as the 17th century, combining them with specially commissioned writing from celebrated climate change writers. Among the writers here are the New Yorker journalist and Pulitzer prize winner Elizabeth Kolbert, the celebrated Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh, the Canadian John Vaillant, whose recent book Fire Weather seems eerily predictive of the rampant wildfires currently burning across North America, and the Native American writer Julian Brave NoiseCat, a longtime journalist and advocate on how climate change affects Indigenous people. \u201cI was impressed at how eager and thrilled all the writers were to participate in this,\u201d said Goodell. \u201cThey\u2019re really an A-list of the best climate writers in the world. That made me think about how needed this collaboration was, because I really think there\u2019s a lot of partitioning in this conversation about climate change. There\u2019s this opportunity to try to reach more broadly and connect with people from very different disciplines.\u201d True to that aspiration toward broadness and connectivity, If the Sky Were Orange looks at climate change as an issue that goes all the way back to our species\u2019 earliest relationships with energy. Sandra M Sawatzky\u2019s Black Gold Tapestry \u2013 over 220ft in length \u2013 connects us to this enormous history by narrating humanity\u2019s relationship with energy through nine centuries, from the 11th up through the 19th. \u201cThe tapestry is a wonderful piece,\u201d said Goodell. \u201cIt uses an ancient and very traditional medium, very reminiscent of the Renaissance, to tell the story of the evolution of oil. It\u2019s really lovely in that it\u2019s a kind of storytelling about the long human history and connection around energy.\u201d Paired with this tapestry is Amitav Ghosh\u2019s thoughtful reflection, arguing that the tapestry \u201ccreates a genealogy for humanity\u2019s present predicament by placing it within history\u201d. Ghosh goes on to say that this historicization of the climate struggle contradicts notions of the Anthropocene, which often try to say our own era is something completely broken off from the rest of human history. Reflections such as Ghosh\u2019s are welcome amid the often unhelpfully overheated rhetoric surrounding catastrophic weather and global disruptions \u2013 as he notes, these tell us to think only of the future, thus making us forget our past. Goodell is very much aware that Texas is a pointed place in which to stage a major exhibition around climate change: the state is of course one of the birthplaces of the fossil fuel industry in the US, and it remains the nation\u2019s largest producer of crude oil. It has also borne much of the brunt of the climate crisis in the US. \u201cFrom a climate change point of view,\u201d said Goodell, \u201cTexas is the belly of the beast. Houston was devastated by Hurricane Harvey and is very vulnerable to sea level rise. All of Texas this summer has shown breaking heat records. In my book I talk about crop failure. And drought is a huge issue in Texas.\u201d Goodell added that Texas itself was making a substantial transition to new kinds of energy, and this is also something he wants to portray in the multifaceted story he\u2019s telling. \u201cTexas is a leader in the nation in both wind and solar right now \u2013 we\u2019re getting about 30% of power from renewable. The show tried to capture both the legacy and the responsibility that Texas has for the complex and compounding facts of climate change, as well as how it represents a kind of hope and energy for the future.\u201d In addition to talking about the long history of climate change, and concrete, contemporary issues around it, If the Sky Were Orange looks at the very epochal nature of the Earth transformations that are under way \u2013 indicating just how small we are by comparison. A video from Julian Charri\u00e8re\u2019s Towards No Earthly Pole, which shows a massive glacial landscape slowly melting in the depth of night as drone lights offer sporadic and partial illumination, gives audiences a confrontation with the impacts of climate change that is largely separated from cultural referents. For Goodell, this video hits an altogether different note than anything else in the show. \u201cTowards No Earthly Pole talks about time and history in a different way. Our understanding of the poles is very thin, so the history that is captured in this video, with these mysterious lights that shine on the ice, really suggests this deep time of this place that we know almost nothing about. And yet we are melting it, destabilizing it. That\u2019s one of the basic tensions of the show.\u201d Ultimately, Goodell is excited and slightly relieved to be done with such a huge effort, and he is hopeful that If the Sky Were Orange will resonate. \u201cOne thing I learned from doing this,\u201d he laughed, \u201cis how hard putting together a museum show is. For sure I\u2019ve never done anything like this before. Getting the tone right is really important. It\u2019s not about scaring anyone, but it\u2019s also not about soft-pedaling anything. Telling truths about this moment and exploring in new and different overlapping voices \u2013 that\u2019s a difficult thing on such a polarized subject.\u201d If the Sky Were Orange: Art in the Time of Climate Change is on display at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, from 9 September until 11 February 2024"

            "title": "Longer life, ageing population, climate change: seven key takeaways from the intergenerational report",
            "date": "2023-08-24T04:59:16Z",
            "content": "The Australian government released its sixth intergenerational report on Thursday which attempts to map the country\u2019s \u201cfuture to 2063\u201d. Here are seven of the top takeaways: 1. Gross national income up 1% per person The Australian economy, like other advanced economies, is projected to grow at a slower pace over the next 40 years than in the past 40 years. Real GDP is projected to grow at an average annual pace of 2.2% \u2013 0.9 percentage points lower than the past average. After increases in population are accounted for, the average annual growth rate of income per person is projected to be 1%, compared with 2.1% over the past 40 years. 2. We\u2019re living longer Australians are living longer, with more years in full health and more time using government-funded services. Over the next 40 years, life expectancy at birth is projected to continue to increase, from 81.3 years for men and 85.2 years for women in 2022-23, to 87 years for men, narrowing the gap with women, who are projected to have a life expectancy of 89.5 years by 2062-63. 3. Slowing population growth Australians are expected to continue living longer and remain healthier to an older age, while having fewer children. This is leading to an ageing and a slower-growing population. The average annual population growth rate is projected to slow to 1.1% over the next 40 years, compared to 1.4% for the past 40 years. This is a similar population growth rate to the 2021 IGR projection. Australia\u2019s population is projected to reach 40.5 million in 2062-63. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup 4. Decline in working age population The participation rate \u2013 the proportion of the working age population in a job or looking for one \u2013 is expected to gradually decline from 66.6% in 2022-23 to 63.8% by 2062-63. The gender gap in participation is expected to continue to narrow, with men\u2019s participation just seven percentage points higher than women in 2062-63. 5. Tax changes as EVs increase and smoking rates decrease Indirect sources of revenue are expected to decline as increased uptake of electric vehicles hits petrol excise tax and decreasing smoking rates reduce tobacco excise. Company tax, goods and services tax (GST), and other taxes are projected to broadly track economic growth. Personal income taxes are projected to increase as a share of GDP, reflecting rising incomes and wages and continued population growth but are limited by the technical assumption for the tax-to-GDP ratio. That means at some point the government expects it will have to cut income taxes to hand back some of the \u201cbracket creep\u201d, to counteract rising nominal wages pushing income earners into higher brackets. 6. Government debt Gross government debt is projected to decline to 22.5% of GDP in 2048-49, before rising to 32.1% of GDP by 2062-63. The IGR found that in 2060-61 \u201cgross debt-to-GDP is projected to be 11.3%\u201d better than was projected in the 2021 report. It credited \u201cfaster-than-expected recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and disciplined fiscal policy including decisions in recent budgets to direct tax upgrades to budget repair\u201d. 7. Impact of climate change Treasury bases its projections on three scenarios \u2013 the world sharply cuts greenhouse gas emissions (for a sub-2C warming path), moderated cuts (sub-3C), and a third where warming exceeds 4C. At the hot end, productivity declines alone will cost $423bn in today\u2019s dollars over the four decades. But as Treasury notes, it cannot pick tipping points that may trigger climate chaos (and mass migration that does not get mentioned), and its own disaster recovery estimates exclude heatwaves and drought."

            "date": "2023-08-12T13:48:42Z",
            "content": "Aberdeen is arguably best known for two things: granite \u2013 found in nearby quarries and used to construct almost all of the coastal city\u2019s buildings \u2013 and oil. After the discovery of a significant reserve in the North Sea in the 1970s, Aberdeen became known as Europe\u2019s oil capital and a thriving oil and gas industry sprang up in Scotland\u2019s north-east. At the centre of the boom was the multinational company Shell, which built a five-storey modernist headquarters in the city\u2019s Tullos area, from where it operated for half a century, before moving this year. Now the building has become the subject of a bitter row after Shell announced its intention to demolish rather than upgrade and repurpose it. The company notified Aberdeen city council of its plans in mid-July. Since then, an open letter has been signed by more than 40 local architects, academics and climate activists raising concerns about the carbon emissions associated with destroying rather than reusing the building. Shell has not yet revealed its plans for the site. \u201cThe environmental impact assessment conducted for Shell fails to measure or consider the carbon emissions relating to demolition in any way,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cYet the emissions involved in processing, recycling and transporting all the elements of the demolished building will be vast, especially given the huge amount of concrete in the existing structure.\u201d Last month, the letter points out, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, Michael Gove, overruled the planned demolition of the flagship Marks &amp; Spencer store on London\u2019s Oxford Street, in part because of the carbon footprint and environmental implications of destruction. Doing so saved an estimated 40,000 tonnes of carbon, an amount which could only have been offset by the planting of 2.4m trees. And while Shell and the council have referred to an assessment which determined demolition as the only feasible plan for the building, this has not been made publicly available, the letter\u2019s signatories claim. Matthew Clubb, owner of Aberdeen-based architectural design practice mwclubb, and the original writer of the letter, said it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that Shell wanted to demolish the building. The company has \u201cabandoned a transition to renewable energy in any meaningful way, in favour of climate-wrecking profits,\u201d Clubb said. \u201cSo failing to even measure the emissions from their buildings and construction projects is entirely consistent with that mentality.\u201d He added: \u201cTo me, it seems that there are too many people trying to solve the global problem of climate emissions without thinking on the local scale. \u201cEven if we are to eventually demolish this building, where will we plant the 3m trees that will offset the emissions incurred? How can we delay this action to avoid the short-term emissions spike? We must think long term, beyond the election cycle and beyond the financial forecasts.\u201d Clubb said his firm worked solely on retrofit projects because of the need to reuse existing buildings if carbon emissions were to be cut. Another signatory, Richard Laing, professor of urban collaboration at Northumbria University and honorary professor at Aberdeen\u2019s Robert Gordon University, said the carbon emissions associated with demolishing rather than reusing the building were \u201cneither affordable nor acceptable\u201d. \u201cWe need to rapidly move away from an endless cycle of building and demolition and urgently find creative ways in which to repurpose vacant property,\u201d he said. Both Aberdeen city council and Shell UK have publicly committed to reaching net zero. In March, the council joined a growing number of local authorities in declaring a climate emergency, with council leader Ian Yuill stating it was \u201ccommitted to playing a full role in tackling these emergencies\u201d. The letter\u2019s signatories have called for the planning application to be delayed or rejected until further information is made available, including the assessment that determined redevelopment was unfeasible. They have demanded that Shell carry out another environmental impact assessment, as well as a \u201clife cycle assessment\u201d of all available options for the site. And they have said the public should be invited to submit design and reuse suggestions. In response, Simon Roddy, Shell UK\u2019s senior vice-president, said: \u201cFor decades Tullos was a fantastic home for Shell in Aberdeen. \u201cAfter completing our move to the Silver Fin Building on Union Street we are evaluating options for the future use of the Tullos site. Removal of the buildings will help unlock the potential of the site to make a positive contribution to the city.\u201d A council spokesperson said demolitions of this nature might not require planning consent. They said planning officers had taken part in initial discussions about the site, but not a full assessment of its suitability for reuse. \u201cThe council are in receipt of an environmental impact assessment screening report, which officers are currently working through and will respond to in due course,\u201d the spokesperson said. Demolition rows Across the country, a number of debates have emerged about the climate implications of demolishing buildings rather than retrofitting and repurposing them. Marks &amp; Spencer, London In March 2021 the retail giant announced plans to demolish and rebuild its largest UK store, on the western end of London\u2019s Oxford Street, following a shift to online shopping during the pandemic. But opposition quickly emerged among architects, climate activists, and even the author Bill Bryson, over the estimated 40,000 tons of carbon which a demolition would release into the environment. Levelling up secretary Michael Gove announced an inquiry into the plans in 2022, and in July this year he rejected them, suggesting that the company had not sufficiently explored alternatives to demolition. Wyndford Flats, Glasgow Plans to knock down four 1960s tower blocks in the north-west of the city have also sparked debate about carbon emissions, with leading Scottish architect Malcolm Fraser among those sounding the alarm over a potential 47,000 tons of embodied carbon. Last month, housing association Wheatley Homes was given permission to proceed with the demolition \u2013 but campaigners have announced their plans to pursue a judicial review of the decision. County Hall, Cardiff Cardiff council announced its intention in June to replace its current headquarters at County Hall in the city\u2019s Butetown with a smaller building. Opposition quickly followed, with the Twentieth Century Society, a campaigning group which aims to protect Britain\u2019s modern architecture, telling WalesOnline: \u201cthe enormous carbon cost of large-scale demolition is simply not compatible\u201d with the council\u2019s climate commitments. The council said that it continued to explore options. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 12 August 2023 to more accurately reflect the concerns being reported. Also, Shell moved to its new headquarters this year, not last year as an early version said."

            "date": "2023-08-27T17:30:13Z",
            "content": "Tunisia is one of the driest countries in Africa, and has just suffered three years of drought. Yet the EU sees the country as key to producing \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d for export to Europe. The trouble is, this fuel is obtained by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen with electricity generated by renewable sources. Tunisia has lots of sun but precious little fresh water. The only way of producing the raw material needed for green hydrogen is sucking up Mediterranean water and desalinating it. But a report last year for the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, affiliated to Germany\u2019s green political movement, warns that this would be a dirty, energy-intensive, water-guzzling process \u2013 and put the high cost of decarbonising the rich world on to the shoulders of poorer nations. Many sun-drenched countries, especially in the Maghreb, have been sold a future as export hubs for green hydrogen. The pitch is seductive. As 1kg of hydrogen contains about three times as much energy as 1kg of petrol, it is no wonder that hydrogen is being touted as a fuel of the future. Europe\u2019s green deal, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the end of the decade, relies on green hydrogen production in north Africa and Ukraine. Producing green hydrogen in Europe is not impossible. But it is expensive compared with fossil fuels, with even wind-based generation needing larger subsidies. Without big government support packages, it remains an open question whether European consumers would be prepared to foot the very significant price rises needed to go green in this way. Last year, the EU proposed doubling green hydrogen imports by 2030 to 10m tonnes a year. The continent\u2019s heavy industries cannot use electricity, however environmentally friendly, for all their requirements; they need fuels for high-intensity heat. So to make sure that these energy sources are less carbon-intensive, Brussels is pushing industries \u2013 such as steel or petrochemical manufacturers \u2013 to adopt green hydrogen. The benefits of such a strategy \u2013 with the desirable goal of low carbon emissions in Europe \u2013 cannot come at the cost of environmental destruction abroad. Raoudha Gafrej, one of Tunisia\u2019s top water experts, warned in the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation report that the degradation of marine ecosystems from the toxic sludge produced by desalination plants would be irreversible. Hydrogen produced by renewable energy has a role to play in future energy systems. Its \u201cgreen\u201d version can be converted to ammonia, a key feedstock for fertilisers, with other uses in shipping fuel, power generation and steelmaking. There are also significant energy losses to consider: about a third of the energy used to produce the gas through electrolysis is lost. Transporting hydrogen requires additional energy, equivalent to 10% of the energy of the fuel itself. From the perspective of African nations, as the recent Just Transition report points out, that energy could be used locally to address immediate needs rather than being directed to produce hydrogen for use in Europe. Less than 0.04% of total hydrogen production is \u201cgreen\u201d. This proportion is bound to grow as governments worldwide wager that it will play a key role in cutting carbon-heavy emissions in industries such as cement manufacturing. With the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere already at 422 parts per million (ppm) \u2013 much higher than the 350 ppm generally considered a relatively safe level \u2013 there is no scope for worsening the problem. Transitioning to net zero emissions globally should not mean the rich gain at the expense of the poor. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "title": "Amazon\u2019s emissions \u2018doubled\u2019 under first half of Bolsonaro presidency",
            "date": "2023-08-23T16:22:41Z",
            "content": "The first half of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency was so destructive for the Amazon that it was comparable to the record 2016 El Ni\u00f1o drought and heatwave in terms of carbon emissions, according to scientists. Annual emissions from the world\u2019s largest rainforest roughly doubled in 2019 and 2020, compared with the 2010 to 2018 average, according to a new study published in Nature, as swaths of forest were deliberately cleared and burned for cattle ranching and farming during the first two years of the far-right leader\u2019s time in office. While the amount of carbon that the Amazon absorbs and emits changes with weather cycles, generally sucking in more in wet years and less in dry periods, the study found that the rise in emissions under Bolsonaro had little to do with natural processes, but was instead caused by the systematic removal and downgrading of environmental law enforcement in Brazil. Under Bolsonaro, the number and severity of fines for illegal deforestation by Brazilian authorities fell dramatically while fires and land-clearing soared, the study found. Carbon emissions increased from an annual average of 0.24 gigatonnes from 2010-18 to 0.44GtC in 2019 and 0.55GtC respectively. The analysis, produced by many of the scientists who first established that the Amazon is now emitting more CO2 than it is able to absorb, warns that new areas of the forest have become a rising source of emissions, particularly the western Amazon, one of the most pristine parts of the basin, which has been targeted by land invaders and illegal miners. It adds to fears that the Amazon, which plays an important role in regulating the world\u2019s climate, is approaching a tipping point after which it will no longer be able to sustain itself, which would have profound consequences for biodiversity and the climate. Luciana Gatti, at the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil, who led the research, said: \u201cBolsonaro was a Brazilian El Ni\u00f1o. The analysis suggests there is no reason for the big emissions from the Amazon apart from the dismantling of law enforcement. \u201cIn this paper, we bring together the science measuring carbon emissions, the deforestation and fire monitoring, law enforcement and economic factors: everything that is involved in the process of destroying the Amazon. After we observed all these factors, it was just a simple step to say, \u2018You are the guy, you are the responsible one for these big emissions from the Amazon.\u2019 It\u2019s an amazing and a very sad story,\u201d she said. The research is based on vertical profile measurements of emissions from small planes at four sites in the Brazilian Amazon, taking CO2 readings from 500m to 4,500m. \u201cAgribusiness in Brazil is looking to the Amazon to turn the country into the farm for the world. This is a terrible plan, not only for Brazil but for the whole world. The Amazon is a buffer for climate change,\u201d said Gatti, who is a member of the Science Panel for the Amazon, which is dedicated to the region\u2019s conservation. The analysis does not include the second half of Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency, which saw even higher deforestation rates and fires. While there is widespread concern about the future of the Amazon, co-author Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil\u2019s leading climate scientists, told the Guardian earlier this month that there was a moment of opportunity to protect the world\u2019s forests amid falling rates of forest loss in some countries around the world. It came after falling deforestation rates under the new Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has pledged to end deforestation in the country by 2030. He held a pan-Amazon summit with leaders earlier this month but they failed to agree a regional target on halting forest loss amid disagreements on oil and gas exploration. \u201cI can see a greater political movement all over the world to reduce deforestation \u2013 Indonesia, some countries in Africa, many countries in the Amazon. In Brazil, there was a significant reduction in deforestation in June. Ideally speaking, I hope when you compute 2023 compared with 2022, there may be a 50% reduction, which would be very good. If Brazil wants to reach zero deforestation by 2030, getting a 50% drop would be very good news,\u201d Nobre said.

            "title": "Carbon credit speculators could lose billions as offsets deemed worthless",
            "date": "2023-08-24T18:00:00Z",
            "content": "Carbon credit speculators could lose billions as scientific evidence shows many offsets they have bought have no environmental worth and have become stranded assets. Amid growing evidence that huge numbers of carbon credits do nothing to mitigate global heating and can sometimes be linked to alleged human rights concerns, there is a growing pile of carbon credits equivalent to the annual emissions of Japan, the world\u2019s fifth largest polluter, that are unused in the unregulated voluntary market, according to market analysis. From Apple to Disney, Gucci to Shell, many of the largest companies in the world have used carbon credits for their sustainability efforts from the unregulated voluntary market, which grew to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) in size in 2021 and saw prices for many carbon credits rise above $20 per offset. The credits are often generated on the basis they are contributing to climate change mitigation such as stopping tropical deforestation, tree planting and creating renewable energy projects in developing countries. Proponents say they need to massively increase in size and scale to help meet the Paris agreement to limit global heating. But repeated scandals about their true impact and a crackdown from regulators on claims of \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d have meant that demand and prices for offsetting have slumped, with signs that some carbon credit traders are writing off investments that would have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars as recently as last year. In the US, the derivatives market regulator has issued a whistleblower alert relating to fraud and misconduct in carbon markets and has created a new environmental fraud taskforce. \u201cIt\u2019s currently a buyer\u2019s market and buyers are, rightly, prioritising quality. There are over a billion tonnes of issued but not retired credits in the market \u2013 this suggests lots of credits can be written off, and there will remain a large supply for buyers to tap into,\u201d said Anton Root, head of research at AlliedOffsets, who said buyers were waiting for the final results of initiatives to improve carbon credit quality. \u201cA correction like that could help to orient the market toward fundamental supply-demand dynamics, which we don\u2019t currently tend to see, and drive up the price for credits that are deemed to be above the quality threshold,\u201d he added. Hannah Hauman, a former oil trader who is now global head of carbon trading at Trafigura, the world\u2019s largest trader of carbon removal credits, said the current uncertainty was inherent in carbon markets. \u201cComing from oil trading, it is strange to see units in carbon markets become invalid overnight. But I think it is in their nature to be constantly evolving with science. It is inherent in the asset class. As much as commodity traders want static, consistent policies for the long term, it is not what the energy transition actually requires. The carbon market needs to be progressive and contracts need to anticipate that,\u201d she said. A new study in the journal Science has found that millions of forest carbon credits approved by Verra, the world\u2019s leading certifier, are largely worthless and could make global heating worse if used for offsetting. The research by scientists and economists at the University of Cambridge and VU Amsterdam was one of the three studies used in a January investigation into rainforest offsets by the Guardian, Die Zeit and Source Material. The Science study was used in a pre-print form while awaiting peer review, which it has since passed. The analysis, published on Thursday, found that 18 big forest offsetting projects had produced millions of carbon credits based on calculations that greatly inflated their conservation impact. The schemes, which generate credits by avoiding hypothetical deforestation, were found not to reduce forest loss or to reduce it by only small amounts, far less than the huge areas they were claiming to protect, rendering the credits largely hot air. The findings follow a 2020 study of 12 projects in the Brazilian Amazon by the same group, which found they had a negligible impact on stopping deforestation despite generating credits on the basis they were preventing large areas from being destroyed. A 2022 study of 40 Verra-approved projects led by University of Cambridge researchers found that while some projects did stop deforestation, most stopped none or small amounts. Verra has strongly disputed the new study\u2019s findings but said it welcomed input from the scientific community and recognised there were areas for improvement in the current system. It was in the process of replacing its methodologies for generating credits, which should be released later this year. \u201cThis information is not new. We provided detailed feedback to the pre-publication version of this paper in a January 2023 technical review after it was covered by the media. Our initial analysis of this version indicates that, despite some minor changes, the overall methodology, results, and conclusions are the same \u2013 and, therefore, the significant concerns we flagged earlier this year still hold,\u201d the group said. In May, Verra\u2019s longtime CEO stood down after concerns about the carbon credits. The voluntary carbon market had already been experiencing falling prices. Hauman said that if governments could decide what counted as a Paris-compliant credits, that would provide greater certainty. \u201cThe biggest question I get from customers is: where does this uncertainty end? They say they cannot meet their net zero commitment within their own decarbonisation path without carbon credits. One of the things that is going to give us much greater certainty is article 6 of the Paris agreement, which will define Paris-compliant carbon credits for the private sector alongside sovereign actors. We want to see the onus to be on the seller to deliver the agreed quality and that should help buyer confidence a lot,\u201d she said.

            "title": "Australia may impose carbon tariffs on steel and cement imports from countries with lower climate goals",
            "date": "2023-08-15T01:22:14Z",
            "content": "The federal government is considering whether Australia should follow the European Union and impose tariffs on some imports from nations with less ambitious climate goals. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said his department would begin two rounds of consultation on whether Australia should adopt a so-called cross-border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to avoid disadvantaging domestic companies. Steel and cement would be the first two products to be considered. \u201cWe know of the potential for production to shift from countries with more ambitious emissions-reduction policies to those with lower emission-reduction policies, and potentially resulting in increased global emissions,\u201d Bowen told a meeting of the Australian Business Economists in Sydney. \u201c[This] undermines national and international climate action and has long been a key consideration in the development of climate policy across the world.\u201d The EU will implement its own CBAM from 2026. Bowen said he wants a final report prepared with the help of academics by the third quarter of 2024 as to whether Australia should implement a similar policy or take other steps. \u201cEverybody understands, including in my discussions with industry, that this is a big and complicated process which can\u2019t be rushed,\u201d Bowen told Guardian Australia after his speech. \u201cThe EU gives us a model, and we\u2019ll look at it closely in the Australia context.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government\u2019s legislated safeguard mechanism to reduce the carbon emissions from the 200-odd largest industrial emitters began taking effect from 1 July. Industries such as steel and aluminium will have some protection if they are deemed \u201ctrade-exposed\u201d to competitors that don\u2019t face similar carbon constraints. Still, the government is keen to ensure other protections are in place to avoid undermining local producers\u2019 competitiveness. Bowen added that border limits such as a CBAM may serve other industrial goals. \u201cIt\u2019s a potentially important mechanism to ensure domestic sovereign capability and supply,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the biggest challenges we face is supply-chain crunches and any measure which helps us deal with that is a positive thing for the transition [off fossil fuels],\u201d he said, adding that any mechanism would have to be \u201csensibly designed\u201d to limit any impact on costs. Bowen said it was important that Australia\u2019s biggest emitters did their \u201cfair share\u201d, with the safeguard changes cutting more than 200m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. \u201cImportantly, 80% of safeguard companies, and 86% of covered emissions, are covered by corporate net zero commitments,\u201d he said. The EU\u2019s CBAM will initially apply to imports in five emissions-intensive sectors deemed at greater risk of transferring emissions offshore: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and electricity. The government review look at these industries and policy options to address them, including a CBAM for steel and cement. \u201cThe team will engage with key stakeholders including industry, peak business groups, experts and researchers, commonwealth and state and territory government agencies, international trading partners, relevant international bodies and the broader community,\u201d Bowen said. Detailed design of any agreed policy options would be taken into account in the government\u2019s Net Zero 2050 plan. Key issues for consideration would be the measurement of emissions embedded in traded goods, carbon costs in countries of origin, how to adapt to policy changes over time and nature of obligations on importers and exporters, he said in his speech. Australia would also need to consider its trading relationships, consistency with international trade rules and interoperability with other schemes such as the EU."

            "date": "2023-08-29T23:01:01Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s cybersecurity agency has warned that chatbots can be manipulated by hackers to cause scary real-world consequences. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has said there are growing cybersecurity risks of individuals manipulating the prompts through \u201cprompt injection\u201d attacks. This is where a user creates an input or a prompt that is designed to make a language model \u2013 the technology behind chatbots \u2013 behave in an unintended manner. A chatbot runs on artificial intelligence and is able to give answers to prompted questions by users. They mimic human-like conversations, which they have been trained to do through scraping large amounts of data. Commonly used in online banking or online shopping, chatbots are generally designed to handle simple requests. Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s AI chatbot Bard, are trained using data that generates human-like responses to user prompts. Since chatbots are used to pass data to third-party applications and services, the NCSC has said that risks from malicious prompt injection will grow. For instance, if a user inputs a statement or question that a language model is not familiar with, or if they find a combination of words to override the model\u2019s original script or prompts, the user can cause the model to perform unintended actions. Such inputs could cause a chatbot to generate offensive content or reveal confidential information in a system that accepts unchecked input. This year, Microsoft released a new version of its Bing search engine and conversational bot powered by LLMs. A Stanford university student, Kevin Liu, was able to create a prompt injection to find Bing Chat\u2019s initial prompt. The entire prompt of Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat, a list of statements written by Open AI or Microsoft that determine how the chatbot interacts with users, which is hidden from users, was revealed by Liu putting in a prompt that requested the Bing Chat \u201cignore previous instructions\u201d. The security researcher Johann Rehberger found that he could force ChatGPT to respond to new prompts through a third party that he did not initially request. Rehberger ran a prompt injection through YouTube transcripts and found that ChatGPT could access YouTube transcripts, which could cause more indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities. According to the NCSC, prompt injection attacks can also cause real-world consequences if systems are not designed with security. The vulnerability of chatbots and the ease with which prompts can be manipulated could cause attacks, scams and data theft. LLMs are increasingly used to pass data to third-party applications and services, meaning the risks from malicious prompt injection will grow. The NCSC said: \u201cPrompt injection and data poisoning attacks can be extremely difficult to detect and mitigate. \u201cHowever, no model exists in isolation, so what we can do is design the whole system with security in mind. That is, by being aware of the risks associated with the ML [machine learning] component, we can design the system in such a way as to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities leading to catastrophic failure. \u201cA simple example would be applying a rules-based system on top of the ML model to prevent it from taking damaging actions, even when prompted to do so.\u201d The NCSC says that cyber-attacks caused by artificial intelligence and machine learning that leaves systems vulnerable can be mitigated through designing for security and understanding the attack techniques that exploit \u201cinherent vulnerabilities\u201d in machine learning algorithms."

            "date": "2023-08-07T15:00:43Z",
            "content": "Australians are more concerned than ever over the handling of their personal information and want tough laws to protect them after the Optus and Medibank cybersecurity breaches, a new study has found. The latest Australian Community Attitudes to Privacy Survey, released on Tuesday by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), found three-quarters of Australians feel data breaches are one of the biggest risks to privacy they face. That is an increase of 13% since the survey was last conducted in early 2020. The information commissioner, Angelene Falk, said privacy was more front in mind after the past three years, after the pandemic and the Optus and Medibank data breaches, which affected tens of millions of Australians last year. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWe\u2019ve had the experience of the centrality of personal information in the pandemic response to contact tracing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had major data breaches over the last year with millions of Australians being affected by those breaches, as well as community debate and focus on the use of technology and artificial intelligence.\u201d The growing number of data breaches has not led to fatigue on privacy \u2013 or an expectation that people\u2019s personal information will be breached in some form. The survey found 78% of Australians place a high level of importance on privacy when choosing a product \u2013 the third-most important factor behind quality and price. Protection of their personal information was seen as a major concern in life for 62% of people, but 57% of people do not know what to do to protect it. Despite the Medibank breach, health providers were the most trusted for data, while social media companies were the least trusted. As the federal government looks to overhaul Australia\u2019s privacy laws, nearly nine in 10 respondents said they want the government to legislate to protect privacy more, including the right to ask a business to delete personal information (93%), object to data collection practices while still being able to use a service (90%) and seek compensation in the courts for a breach of privacy (89%). The survey was carried out in March 2023, with a national representative sample of 1,916 unique responses from people aged 18 and older. The OAIC was allocated $5.5m over two years in May\u2019s budget to investigate the Optus data breach, which it announced in November last year. But despite the funding, the case has not been finalised in the 10 months since it was announced. In the federal court last week, in a hearing of a class action case against Optus over the same breach, Justice Jonathan Beach expressed frustration at the delay in investigating the case. He ordered the OAIC to be represented at the next case management hearing for the case in mid-September, indicating that the OAIC might be required to produce the complaint it received for Optus. Falk told Guardian Australia the OAIC seeks to make decisions in the most fast and effective way, but the Optus investigation is complex. \u201cThese representative complaints are raising very complex issues where we have multiple parties seeking to make representative complaints and a piece of legislation that doesn\u2019t set out clear processes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we are working that, through there are legal complexities, and there should be a decision forthcoming shortly.\u201d Falk said one of the proposed reforms to allow individuals to take court action against companies for privacy breaches might be one method to improve the current system, and one that had overwhelming support according to the survey. \u201cThat would allow these class actions that are raised in other areas of law like consumer competition, contract negligence, to be heard in conjunction with privacy breaches,\u201d she said."

            "title": "Billion Dollar Heist review \u2013 cybercrime documentary relives tech chaos",
            "date": "2023-08-14T18:26:56Z",
            "content": "Cybercrime, on top of being difficult to detect and even more so to prove, is notoriously tricky to visualize. The impact may be tangible, even devastating \u2013 nuclear plants damaged, hospitals disabled, pipelines shut down \u2013 but the perpetrators are shadowy and inscrutable, the crime unseen and insidious, the methods vague and indecipherable to lay people without a knack for computer science. Billion Dollar Heist, a new feature-length documentary, attempts the formidable challenge of turning one of the biggest financial crimes in history \u2013 the February 2016 cyber heist of $81m from the US Federal Reserve accounts for the central bank of Bangladesh \u2013 into informative entertainment. Director Daniel Gordon employs a range of cinematic techniques \u2013 some illuminative, some overly cliched \u2013 to get at a highly sophisticated cyber crime involving several countries, time zones and financial institutions. Among them: animation, dramatic recreation, stock footage of beeping ones and zeros, archival footage on the relatively brief history of hacking, ominous narration from British broadcaster and cybersecurity journalist Misha Glenny. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this scattershot approach has its limits for understanding both the history and execution of ransomware attacks, though it does tell a moderately entertaining story that makes life as we know it \u2013 our power, medical, financial and communication systems dependent on networks connected to the internet \u2013 seem perilously fragile. As Glenny somewhat dramatically puts it, the human race faces four existential threats: pandemic, weapons of mass destruction, climate change and cyber. Cyber, specifically ransomware attacks, may indeed threaten humanity in seen and unforeseen ways, though the film\u2019s survey of cyber history and financial crimes spans only a few minutes and mostly consists of stitched together videos of news anchors saying \u201ca new virus\u201d in serious tones. Numerous cybersecurity experts, such as Mikko Hypp\u00f6nen and Eric Chien, explain how beginning around the year 2000, cybercrimes morphed from fame-seeking hackers to an organized, faceless havoc, exploiting weaknesses in an internet never designed for privacy. The titular billion-dollar heist targeted the global Swift financial transaction system, which communicated massive transfers from the US Federal Reserve, via a more relatively porous institution, the central bank of Bangladesh in Dhaka. (Somewhat hilariously, the first sign that something was amiss at the Bangladesh central bank was a malfunctioning printer, that most tangible and intransigent of devices; it\u2019s hard not to fault Gordon\u2019s decision to dramatize this with actors, though it does cheapen what can otherwise be slick storytelling.) The film swiftly recounts how the unknown hackers picked on certain Bangladeshi employees with phishing emails; how they jumped from computer to computer within the network; how they timed their attempted billion-dollar heist to national holidays and weekends in three different countries. There\u2019s great relish in explaining how a typo and an unlucky account name kept a billion in requested illicit transfers down to just $101m, and how the thieves made off with $81m via an elaborate laundering scheme at a Filipino casino. Some of the dramatic flourishes work well, particularly the comparison of the hackers, suspected to be a shadowy semi-formal organization known as the Lazarus Group, to Ocean\u2019s Eleven, down to the delineation of roles (the social engineer, the digger, the fence, the thief) and the casino caper, rendered in animation. A visualization involving early video game graphics succinctly conveys the basic premise of the group\u2019s intra-network hacking. Other methods, such as staging recreations of Bangladeshi bank employees frantically poring over papers on the bank floor or frequent animations of the stock faceless male hacker in a hoodie, feel overdone and hackneyed. It could be true that the members of the Lazarus Group are hoodie-clad hackers hunched over computers, but the film gives us curiously little characterization of the criminal association credited with everything from the 2014 Sony hack to the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, and, according to the internet (if not the film, at least explicitly), is associated with North Korea. Billion Dollar Heist, instead, refers to the group\u2019s activities as \u201con the level of nation-state\u201d. This could be a smart decision appropriate to what we know about the crime \u2013 I am not a cybersecurity expert, and the film-makers worked with several people who are. But it\u2019s impossible to tell \u2013 the film\u2019s approach to the Bangladesh bank heist story is often vague and sweeping and hampered by frequent invocations of perpetrators who remain, at least to viewers, unknown and without motive. I left the film convinced that cybercrimes do indeed pose a serious threat to anything from medical records to peace of mind. But I\u2019m light on specifics. Billion Dollar Heist is now available to rent in the UK and is available to rent in the US on 15 August"

            "date": "2023-08-11T11:32:54Z",
            "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s brutal. People are wondering if they should resign, or move house, or get fortified gates. You can feel the anger.\u201d The comment from a former officer in the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) underlines the real-life consequences of an all-too frequent occurrence: a data breach. The UK data watchdog received reports of more than 9,000 personal data breaches last year but the vast majority do not generate public debate, perhaps because the impact is not immediately obvious or the population has become inured to a degree of data loss as an everyday cost of modern digital life. Two incidents this week will have made people think again about what is happening with their data. On Tuesday the PSNI, in a bungled response to a freedom of information (FoI) request, released an Excel spreadsheet containing details of more than 10,000 officers and employees. It was published on an FoI website called WhatDoTheyKnow for about two and a half hours before the PSNI realised the error and had it removed. On the same day, the Electoral Commission revealed it had been hit by a cyber-attack resulting in the perpetrators accessing the names and addresses of anyone in the UK registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, equating to the data of 40 million people. The security threat implicit in the PSNI breach is clear, particularly after the chief constable said on Thursday that dissident republicans claimed to possess some of the information. In February, masked gunmen seriously wounded a senior officer in Omagh, County Tyrone. A PSNI board member said this week that further attacks may follow in the wake of the breach. The consequences for the breach at the Electoral Commission, an independent body that oversees UK elections, are less clear. It says it does not know whether the data, primarily reference copies of the electoral registers, has been downloaded. It also said its email system was breached, meaning any data contained in emails to the commission \u2013 such as email addresses, images of documentation and phone numbers \u2013 could have been taken. The identity of the cyber-attackers is not known, but the commission has described it as a \u201ccomplex\u201d attack, and former UK spy heads have said Russia, with its record of attempted electoral interference, is a strong suspect. Working on the assumption that the electoral register copies have been taken, some experts say the data could be combined with other available data to profile users and potentially target them with, for instance, artificial intelligence-generated disinformation around election time. Harjinder Lallie, a senior academic in cybersecurity at the University of Warwick, described the information exposed in the commission hack as potential building blocks for a manipulation campaign, operated by a hostile state, that could be carried out via email, post, WhatsApp groups or social media platforms. \u201cAs far as state actors are concerned, the building blocks to enable them to build [disinformation] campaigns are names and addresses. It helps identify people in terms of race, possibly in terms of their financial circumstances, and if combined with other means of data gathering, such as social media profiles, state actors can use that information to build neo-electoral campaigns,\u201d he said. The commission has reassured voters about the integrity of the largely paper-based electoral system and said that much of the data exposed was \u201calready in the public domain\u201d, for instance people, organisations and companies can already buy the open electoral register, which contains the same information. While some experts have said the data could be allied with the power of generative AI \u2013 tools that can mass produce plausible text, images and even voice \u2013 to make and send misleading communications at scale, others said this would be ambitious, even for a hostile state. John Hultquist, the chief analyst at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said this week that intrusion into an electoral network was \u201cnot tantamount to manipulation of the vote\u201d. He added, however, that the data could be targeted for different reasons, such as \u201cassembling this information into a database that can be used to identify, track and even exploit persons of interest\u201d. Personal information is available publicly (on social media profiles, for instance) or on the dark web, the term for areas of the internet accessible only via a specialised web browser. A cursory check on sites such as https://haveibeenpwned.com/ can show whether people\u2019s emails, and other data, has been exposed in breaches. Caroline Carruthers, who runs a data consultancy and is a former chief data officer at Network Rail, said data on people could be available from high-profile breaches, such as that of British Airways in 2018, or from legitimate sources, such as data brokers who compile data about individuals from a number of sources \u2013 including the open electoral register \u2013 and sell it to third parties. She said social media profiles alone could offer a trove of information. Carruthers recounted a former East German national showing her a secret police report of a dinner party he attended that was limited to a sheet of paper, and she compared that with a friendship group on Facebook discussing a meal she recently attended that contained far more detail. \u201cThere was so much more potentially useful information on Facebook than there was in the Stasi report.\u201d Carruthers said she hoped the PSNI and Electoral Commission incidents galvanised people\u2019s attitudes towards protecting their data from commercial and criminal misuse. \u201cI would really hope this is a wake-up call. I have grave concerns about how we don\u2019t take our data, and what it is being used for, seriously enough.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-08-04T12:32:58Z",
            "content": "US employers added 187,000 jobs in July, less than expected and a sign that the labor market is cooling after a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have driven rates to their highest level in 22 years. The jobs market has continued to add at least 200,000 new jobs each month this year, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). But that compares to an average monthly gain of 400,000 in 2022. July\u2019s gains were just 2,000 more than the jobs added in June. The BLS revised June\u2019s job gain down to 185,000, a cut of 24,000 jobs. It also cut May\u2019s jobs number. Together, June and July represent the two weakest monthly gains in two and a half years. While the jobs market remains robust, July\u2019s gains represent a considerable dip compared to January of this year, when 472,000 jobs were added. The unemployment rate has remained stable at 3.5%, the same rate seen in June and close to the historically low rates seen before 2020. Healthcare and social assistance accounted for the most new positions in July, adding 87,000 new jobs. The government added 15,000 new jobs. Black unemployment had risen for the last two months, often a sign of trouble ahead. The rate dipped in July from 6% to 5.8% \u2013 still far higher than the 3.1% unemployment rate for White Americans. Wage gains continued to outpace inflation \u2013 rising 4.5% from April to June compared to a year ago. But the pace of rises slowed from 4.8% in the previous quarter. Angela Hanks, chief of programs at Demos and former acting assistant secretary at the Department of Labor, said the figures showed the job market remained \u201cresilient overall\u201d. \u201cWe saw in June that wages were finally beginning to outpace inflation, and this month\u2019s report shows that trend continues. Which means that people are actually getting to feel those wage gains,\u201d she said. But she said there was Black unemployment rate was still troubling. \u201cIt remains nearly double the white unemployment rate, and above the historic lows it hit earlier this year. There\u2019s still room to improve on this front, and this remains the number to watch in subsequent reports.\u201d July\u2019s job figures, along with these other economic indicators, suggest that the Fed may be able to pull off a \u201csoft landing\u201d \u2013 bringing down inflation without causing a recession, as some economists expected to happen as soon as later this year. In June, the annual rate of inflation reached a two-year low at 3%, three times lower than it was a year prior. Many economists are expecting the Fed to stop its rate hikes soon as it allows the economy to stabilize. That job figures have continued to be strong represents a sign of the resilience of the economy, but the economy may not fully yet have fully responded to the impact of high rates. \u201cWe\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt,\u201d Fed chair Jerome Powell said after the interest rate hikes were announced. As Powell has said over the last year, he also said that getting inflation to the Fed\u2019s target of 2% \u201chas a long way to go\u201d. Hanks warned the Fed\u2019s actions could still harm the economy. \u201cWhile these numbers are positive, there\u2019s still reason to worry that the Fed\u2019s actions \u2013 including resuming rate hikes in July \u2013 could have a negative impact on the labor market. While the Fed is no longer predicting a recession, its own actions could continue to threaten one,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2023-08-06T12:00:10Z",
            "content": "Unemployment is at historic lows. Inflation is receding. The stock market is approaching its all-time high. Gross domestic product is healthy. Household savings are near peak levels. There are more travelers passing through our airports than in 2019. Retail sales continue to grow. The restaurant industry is booming. Corporate profits remain strong. Wages are outpacing inflation. It seems like the economy\u2019s doing pretty darn good, right? And yet according to the most recent monthly data from the National Federation of Independent Businesses \u2026 optimism among small business owners is at a 10-year low. Why? If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from running a business for over 20 years, it\u2019s that it\u2019s never one thing. There are 33m small businesses in the US, with about 6m of them employer-owned. Each of these people has their own reasons for feeling less confident about the economy. But this is what I\u2019m hearing the most from my clients: \u2018I\u2019m still struggling with higher costs\u2019 Inflation has been receding but most of my clients are still trying to absorb double-digit increases in their core costs \u2013 construction materials, industrial chemicals, food, labor, machinery parts \u2013 that have occurred since the end of the pandemic. Thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to tame inflation, the national prime interest rate is about 8.5% which means that most smaller companies, who are not considered \u201cprime\u201d customers, are paying anywhere from 9-12% for new loans, assuming they can get them. Not all of these higher costs can be passed down to customers and many small business owners have cut overhead to the bone. So margins and profits are squeezed. \u2018It\u2019s an anti-business climate\u2019 Few can argue that the Biden administration is pro-worker. Taking a cue from Washington, blue states are increasing minimum wages and racking up employee-friendly requirements. Meanwhile, new regulations from pay transparency to worker classification rules are being drawn up, approved and implemented and emboldened workers are refusing to return to the office and demanding higher wages and more benefits. \u2018There\u2019s a recession coming\u2019 We\u2019ve been hearing that story for months and yet we\u2019re still not seeing it. But that hasn\u2019t stopped some of my clients from blaming even the slightest drop-off in orders on an economic downturn, rather than their own unsuccessful sales efforts or customer service stumbles. In the US, which has the world\u2019s largest economy, there\u2019s always a recession somewhere. This year businesses in the technology, commercial real estate and manufacturing industries are struggling. Yet, retail, residential construction, and services are booming. My smarter clients who have run businesses for a while recognize the cycles of the economy. Others fear a downturn, no matter how small. Uncertainty is at the very core of running a business. But hen are things ever certain? \u2018I don\u2019t like Biden\u2019 No matter how great things are, people aren\u2019t going to give the current president credit if they don\u2019t support his party. Democrats didn\u2019t recognize former president Donald Trump\u2019s economic accomplishments either. However, most small business owners tend to lean to the right with a majority even supporting Trump in 2020. So when asked about their confidence human nature takes over. Why not take a jab at that guy in the White House? \u2018The world is going to hell\u2019 People today fear the war in Ukraine, tensions with China, climate change, AI, the next Covid and the moral decay of the nation\u2019s youth. Business owners in 1970 feared nuclear war, cancer, computers, pollution and the moral decay of the nation\u2019s youth. Shopkeepers in ancient Pompeii feared earthquakes, disease, war, corruption and, yes, the moral decay of their youth. The world is always going to hell, and when you live long enough you learn to accept that people will always deathly afraid of something. Unfortunately, some business owners still say those fears inhibit them from feeling confident. So why are so many small business owners not feeling confident, despite a good economy? There\u2019s no one answer. With all due respect to the NFIB and the countless other organizations \u2013 and just like all those dubious studies that try to measure happiness \u2013 measuring consumer and business \u201coptimism\u201d is a tricky and flawed business in itself. Maybe that\u2019s the real answer."

            "date": "2023-08-05T23:05:01Z",
            "content": "Engine of the eurozone, industrial powerhouse, export world champion \u2013 just some of the ways Germany\u2019s economy has been described over the years. However, recent figures have indicated that the good times have come to an end, with Europe\u2019s largest economy stuck in recession. With economists looking for clues as to how long this could last, all eyes will be on the final reading for Germany\u2019s July inflation figure when it is released on Tuesday morning. The year-on-year consumer prices index (CPI) rate is forecast to come in at 6.2%, just slightly lower than the 6.4% recorded in June. Industrial production figures for June, out on Monday, will also give more insight into what is going on in the nation\u2019s manufacturing backbone, which includes global carmakers such as Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes, as well as the network of small and medium-sized engineering businesses known as the Mittelstand. If the July inflation comes in as anticipated, it would mean Germany\u2019s price growth remains some way above the headline level for the eurozone, which was 5.3% in July. The picture is even worse compared with Spain, where inflation was just 2.3% last month. Sticky inflation is proving part of Germany\u2019s current economic woes, especially when coupled with stagnant growth. \u201cSlowcession\u201d is the result, according to one economist. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macroeconomics at the Dutch bank ING, describes the German economy as being \u201cstuck in the twilight zone between stagnation and recession\u201d. It was May when the country\u2019s economy was confirmed as being in recession. Revised official figures showed its performance was worse than originally thought and that it had in fact shrunk by 0.3% between January and the end of March, after a contraction in the final three months of 2022. Higher prices had forced households to rein in their spending at the start of this year, which had a bigger impact on growth than originally thought. The second quarter, from April to June, was not much better. Forecasts had anticipated a small bounce-back in growth; instead it stagnated, coming in at an underwhelming 0%. Hence the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d. Again, weaker purchasing power among cash-strapped consumers was one of the main reasons, along with higher interest rates \u2013 currently 3.75% for the main deposit rate in the euro area, as set by the European Central Bank. Germany\u2019s companies are also feeling gloomy: the closely watched business climate index from the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute dropped for the third consecutive month in July. Brzeski puts this down to ongoing monetary tightening from the ECB, fears about the US economy, and a weaker-than-anticipated reopening in China \u2013 the market for many German exports, from fast cars to machinery. To shake off the shadow of stagflation, Brzeski is calling on German ministers to urgently introduce a reform agenda. That may not be forthcoming anytime soon, in part because the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and German parliamentarians are, like much of the continent, currently on their summer break. Responding to the latest quarterly growth figures just over a week ago, the economy minister, Robert Habeck, called the figures \u201canything but satisfactory\u201d, despite the slightly positive trends in private consumption and investment. However, Habeck showed little appetite for an economic stimulus package, saying this would only further fuel inflation. \u201cWhoever distributes money with a watering can in times of high inflation only brings one thing to growth: inflation,\u201d he said. The German government may yet strike it lucky, and find the situation has improved somewhat while they were enjoying their holidays. The labour market continues to hold up well, with a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 5.6% in July, lower than the level seen in June. There was also some surprising data on Friday, when German factory orders defied all expectations with the biggest monthly jump in the past three years. Economists were surprised when the figures showed a 7% rise from May to June, thanks to a pick-up in major orders, including for machinery and aircraft. Airbus, which has a large factory in Hamburg as well as other smaller plants across the country, said it had seen a surge in aircraft orders in June. For now, it is unclear whether this is a temporary respite or a sign that the eurozone\u2019s largest economy is finally beginning to rebound from its recent troubles."

Evergrande, the world\u2019s most indebted property firm with liabilities of $328bn (\u00a3260bn), has lost more than 99% of its share market value over the past three years. The company resumed trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday after a 17-month suspension that Evergrande used to try to restructure its offshore debt. However, investors immediately wiped more than four-fifths off the market value of the company, which last month reported a combined loss of $81bn for 2021 and 2022. On Sunday, the company, which is at the centre of a real estate crisis as fears grow over the wider state of the world\u2019s second largest economy, reported a 33bn yuan ($4.5bn) loss for the first six months of the year. Evergrande, which is facing more than 2,000 lawsuits involving about 535bn yuan, has delayed for another month meetings with international creditors that were expected to lead to a vote on a restructuring plan this week. The company, which defaulted in 2021, laid out a plan earlier this year to compensate investors with notes linked to its listed Hong Kong subsidiaries, which include an electric vehicle company and a property management business. Earlier this month, Evergrande filed for chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in New York to protect its US assets as the company hopes to restructure its finances. With the world\u2019s biggest property market in disarray as developers including Evergrande fail to complete projects, leaving suppliers unpaid and homebuyers out of pocket, China\u2019s wider economy is coming under increasing pressure. China is the world\u2019s biggest property market and there are fears financial difficulties could spread to other parts of the economy. The country\u2019s post-Covid economic recovery has been flagging across many sectors, with youth unemployment at a record high and weak retail sales. The economy has fallen into deflation for the first time in two years. Earlier this month, Country Garden, once China\u2019s largest private developer by sales, missed payments on its international bonds, triggering a 30-day grace period. On Tuesday, the company asked creditors for a 40-day extension to pay an outstanding principal on a 3.9bn yuan bond. Country Garden, which has liabilities of almost $200bn, is holding a meeting on the 31 August to vote on the extension to the payment due on 4 September. The company missed interest payments of $22.5m on two $500m international bonds earlier this month."

            "date": "2023-08-25T15:51:56Z",
            "content": "Mugshots define eras. Bugsy Siegel peering malevolently from beneath his fedora in a 1928 booking photo summed up the perverse romance of gangsters in the prohibition age. Nearly half a century later, mugshots of David Bowie, elegantly dressed but dead-eyed after his arrest for drug possession, and a dishevelled Janis Joplin, detained for \u201cvulgar and indecent language\u201d, spoke to the shock waves created by 1960s counterculture. Now comes what Donald Trump Jr described as \u201cthe most iconic photo in the history of US politics\u201d before the booking picture of his father glaring into the camera was even taken. But whether deeply divided Americans view the first ever mugshot of a former president as that of a gangster or a rock star is very much in the politics of the beholder. Trump\u2019s hostility shines through as he turns his eyes up toward the camera above him and in his taut, downturned mouth as he is booked into the Fulton county jail on charges of trying to steal the 2020 presidential election. Dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie, he makes no attempt to put on a smile like some of his co-defendants in their mugshots. The picture does not flatter but it does convey the message many of Trump\u2019s supporters want to hear \u2013 belligerence. The six-pointed star of the Fulton county sheriff\u2019s office badge and the name of the sheriff, Patrick Labat, sits in the top left hand corner of the picture. But some will be disappointed that Trump is not seen in the classic pose holding a board in front of his chest with his name and date of arrest. Still, the mugshot will now enter the pantheon of famous-name booking photos, alongside Frank Sinatra looking unperturbed after his arrest in 1938 for \u201ccarrying on with a married woman\u201d, and Hugh Grant after he was found with a sex worker on Sunset Boulevard. Trump has some way to go to catch up with the American actor Lindsay Lohan\u2019s eight-year run of mugshots for theft, drugs and driving offences. The former president\u2019s supporters are already embracing the booking photo as a badge of honour and defiance. It will be held up as evidence that their man will not give up the fight against a system his followers see as ever more determined to bring him down and prevent him returning to the White House. Far-right congresswoman Lauren Boebert led the way with a tweet proclaiming: \u201cNot all heroes wear capes.\u201d The president\u2019s detractors, on the other hand, will see the booking photo as evidence that even a man who was once the most powerful person in the land cannot escape the might of the justice system. Some will welcome anything that makes him look even a little bit more criminal as a confirmation that sooner or later he is going to prison. The accused may be presumed innocent until a plea or a jury says otherwise but mugshots can have a way of conveying guilt. For Trump though, the picture is likely to prove yet another money spinner. Within hours, his campaign fundraising website was advertising T-shirts, bumper stickers and coffee mugs glorifying a martyred Trump with the booking photo above the words \u201cnever surrender!\u201d. Sales are likely to be brisk given the enthusiasm with which the former president\u2019s supporters now treat each public humiliation as an accomplishment. Two impeachments and four sets of indictments, from financial fraud to a slew of charges over the 2020 election, have done little to damage Trump\u2019s standing among the true believers, and have only bolstered his run for the Republican presidential nomination. Such is the strength of that belief that a recent CBS poll showed Trump voters trust him more than their own family members and religious leaders. Ordinary Americans have already got creative in response to the flood of indictments by mocking up pictures of the former president in an orange jump suit a la Guant\u00e1namo prison and in printing T-shirts with Trump in various states of detention with slogans declaring \u201cTrumped up charges\u201d, \u201cGuilty AF\u201d, \u201cGuilty of winning\u201d and \u201cLegend\u201d. There will be plenty who will challenge Don Jr\u2019s claim that the mugshot has instantly become the most iconic photo in US political history. Pictures of John F Kennedy\u2019s assassination or Martin Luther King Jr leading the march for freedom or a host of other historic moments will surely prove more enduring. But as with the gangsters and rock stars, Trump\u2019s booking photo may come to define an era \u2013 one of unusual political turmoil that has yet to resolve whether his next mugshot is as an inmate."

The race to succeed him pitted the current vice-president, Hubert H Humphrey, against a previous VP, Richard Nixon. An anti-establishment third-party candidate, George Wallace, a segregationist former governor of Alabama, was attracting unexpected support, amid backlash to Johnson\u2019s Great Society reforms. Graham\u2019s message to Johnson came from Nixon and contained an unorthodox proposal. If elected, Nixon offered to make a variety of conciliatory gestures to Johnson, from avoiding criticism to meeting him for consultations, even crediting him with a role in ending the Vietnam war, once it was finally over. This is one of many revelations in a new book, The Year That Broke Politics: Collusion and Chaos in the Presidential Election of 1968, by Luke Nichter, a professor of history at Chapman University in California. In sum, Graham promised \u201ceverything Nixon could do to give LBJ a place in history\u201d, Nichter marvels. \u201cImagine something like that leaking out. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d It also continued some surprisingly conciliatory behind-the-scenes behavior between ostensible rivals, much of it mediated by Graham. In his diary, the evangelist quoted Johnson: \u201cI don\u2019t always agree with [Nixon] but I respect him for his tremendous ability.\u201d Graham asked if he could let Nixon know. LBJ said yes. The incumbent was hardly as supportive to his own vice-president. As Humphrey said: \u201cI\u2019ve eaten so much of Johnson\u2019s shit in this job that I\u2019ve grown to like the taste of it.\u201d The 1968 election unfolded during a year of seemingly endless challenges. In Vietnam, the Tet offensive convinced many Americans of the futility of the war. On 1 March, Johnson stunned the public by dropping out of the race. On 4 April, Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis. On 6 June, another assassination rocked America: the New York senator and Democratic presidential contender Robert F Kennedy, whose brother, President John F Kennedy, had been killed just five years before, was shot dead at an LA hotel. Race riots erupted, from Newark to Detroit and Washington. At the Democratic national convention in Chicago, demonstrators and cops squared off. Yet in his 15 chapters, Nichter manages to upend conventional wisdom. \u201cThis is a lesson about the essence of history itself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s never really over.\u201d As Nichter explains, the traditional 1968 narrative posits that Johnson stayed out of the picture; that Humphrey rode a late surge based on his call for an unconditional bombing halt in Vietnam; and that Nixon employed questionable methods to win, from a \u201csouthern strategy\u201d targeting racist white voters to trying to sabotage peace talks in Vietnam. Nichter questions this entire account, often on the basis of evidence he uncovered, whether in Graham\u2019s diaries or in a conversation with a former Humphrey adviser, Vic Fingerhut. He even spoke to Anna Chennault, the Washington socialite at the heart of the Chennault affair, in which she was accused of encouraging the South Vietnamese to avoid peace talks, based on promises of better treatment under Nixon. \u201cI sort of assumed it was true,\u201d Nichter reflects. \u201cA lot of people have reported it over the years.\u201d Yet, he says, \u201cthe first thing I noticed right away as a red flag was that nobody I talked to actually interviewed Chennault or the South Vietnamese. I\u2019m not a journalist, but a historian. I\u2019m trained to look at dusty records in archives. But all of this didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Nichter does have extensive experience in the subject area, not only as the author of multiple books but as the editor of the nixontapes website, where the public can access 3,000 hours of secret recordings. A member of the Freedom of Information Act advisory board, Nichter has conducted hundreds of hours of research in the US and Vietnam, calling the latter one of the friendliest destinations an American can now visit. The Year That Broke Politics germinated from a conversation with Walter Mondale in December 2017. Between 1977 and 1981, Mondale was vice-president to Jimmy Carter. In 1968, he was Humphrey\u2019s campaign co-chair. To Nichter, he hinted that LBJ had leaned toward Nixon. The following February, Graham died at 99. Nichter traveled to the evangelist\u2019s alma mater, Wheaton University, outside Chicago. He gained access to Graham\u2019s diaries, a trove of information about conversations with presidents from Harry Truman to Barack Obama. Nichter calls the diaries \u201ca potential whole new window on the entire American presidency\u201d, with \u201ccontent that\u2019s not in the National Archives or any presidential library\u201d. Graham enjoyed relationships with all four principals in the 1968 campaign \u2013 Johnson, Humphrey, Nixon and Wallace \u2013 while professing an apolitical stance. When Johnson decided not to run, Graham asked if he could let Nixon know in advance and got the OK to do so. When Nixon wanted to send Johnson his September proposals, he entrusted Graham with the message. At the chaotic Democratic convention, while protesters and Mayor Richard Daley\u2019s police fought outside, Graham reportedly had a fateful behind-the-scenes influence, talking the Texas governor, John Connally, out of being Humphrey\u2019s running mate, promising a cabinet role under Nixon. Had Connally accepted Humphrey\u2019s offer, it \u201cmight have been enough to deny Nixon a victory, divide the conservative vote [and] balance the ticket geographically\u201d, Nichter says. By the fall, Humphrey was struggling. On 30 September, in a speech in Salt Lake City, he promised to halt the bombing of North Vietnam. Although this speech is widely credited for Humphrey\u2019s revival, it didn\u2019t close the gap in the polls, Nichter says. What proved more persuasive, Nichter finds, were appeals to traditional Democratic domestic issues from jobs to social security, and a get-out-the-vote push from organized labor that siphoned blue-collar voters from Wallace. These late moves by Humphrey narrowed the gap, but not enough. Nixon, once vice-president to Dwight Eisenhower, completed a remarkable comeback. On the campaign trail, he had promised to essentially continue LBJ\u2019s Great Society programs. Nichter notes that many of Nixon\u2019s policy achievements \u2013 visits to China and the USSR, the founding of the Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 were initially considered under Johnson. As for Wallace, he showed surprising strength, topping out at 23% in the polls, making the ballot in every state and finding support among disaffected working-class white voters that set a precedent for future populists. \u201cHis 1968 message was more sophisticated,\u201d Nichter says. \u201cRace was folded into a broader set of grievances. He got a little Trump-like: anti-elite, anti-media, anti-establishment. He never used the words \u2018drain the swamp\u2019. If it had occurred to him, he probably would have. \u201cI think all populist candidates on both sides of the aisle, Democrat or Republican \u2013 more recently, clearly Republican, because of Trump \u2013 have brought Wallace\u2019s rhetoric [and] message [to] target voters [from the] blue-collar, lower-middle class. \u201cTrump is the most aggressive to go after them. The most fascinating takeaway for 2024, the thing to watch for, is who is going to be the preferred candidate of this voting bloc.\u201d The Year That Broke Politics by Luke A.

            "title": "Reese Witherspoon for president! Election, a comedy from a time when US politics was amusing",
            "date": "2023-08-29T15:00:10Z",
            "content": "Reese Witherspoon may have got her Oscar for Walk the Line but she has never been as iconic as she was in what should be considered the real highlight of her career: Election. Alexander Payne\u2019s spiky and smart 1999 movie is set at an average American high school in a town where the most defining characteristic is its banality. Nothing extraordinary is supposed to happen in Omaha, Nebraska and, in some ways, nothing did. The drama in Election is the race for school president but the real war is between well-liked teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) and high-achieving student Tracy Flick (Witherspoon). Armed with \u201cPick Flick\u201d campaign cupcakes, her Jansport backpack and an unerring belief in her bright, successful future, Tracy\u2019s unopposed pursuit of the presidency is thwarted by Jim when he eggs on Paul (Chris Klein), a sweet but dumb athlete, to run against her in the election. The battle royale is complicated further by the entry of Paul\u2019s sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), whose anarchic \u201cWho cares?\u201d platform promises to dismantle the student government. The election campaign unfolds in hilarious and bizarre beats \u2013 including a wildly funny scene involving a bee sting \u2013 and culminates in a vote-stealing scandal that is both shocking and not shocking at the same time. Election masquerades as a familiar high school comedy, but it is astute and keenly observed. Like Wag the Dog and Primary Colors, it tapped into the now almost-quaint Clintonian era of the 1990s. There was partisanship and sex scandals, but US politics still managed to amuse as well as enrage, when compared with the terrifying hellscape it morphed into. At the heart of the film is Tracy, the kind of earnest try-hard you just want to see taken down a notch, or three. When she surreptitiously discovers she won the election, the sight of her ecstatic, contorted face is forever captured and amplified in freeze frame. It remains an indelible image in cinema: Tracy, in that moment, is every person you\u2019ve ever met that struck you as just a little too ambitious, just a little too sanctimonious and just a little too annoying. Tracy is not blameless \u2013 she rails against \u201csubversive elements\u201d, she lies and stands in judgment of others. Still, it reveals a lot about our own neuroses and complexes that we pour scorn on ambitious souls like her. Why do we find their unabashed aspirations so grating? Why do we roll our eyes at the person \u2013 and it\u2019s always the same person \u2013 who volunteers every year to organise the charity morning teas? Especially if they\u2019re a woman? When you\u2019re laughing at Tracy, Payne\u2019s movie grounds you in Jim\u2019s perspective. You convict her because he convicts her. It\u2019s only later when Jim is revealed to be flawed, manipulative and a love rat that you are forced to ask yourself why you saw Tracy as the antagonist. Rewatching Election now, it\u2019s hard to ignore how those judgments about female ambition have played out in real life. When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, she was compared to Tracy Flick, all grown up. On that note, Witherspoon is set to reprise the role again in an Election sequel directed by Payne, which will follow the adult Tracy Flick as she battles to become the principal of a suburban high school. While you\u2019re laughing at those silly mechanical seatbelts that seem to be in every car in Omaha, or at Klein\u2019s voiceover delivery of rich kid Paul\u2019s existential crisis, Election will confront you with serious ideas about political systems, predatory behaviour and entitlement. Who gets to decide who gets to rule? Why should anyone have more say than anyone else? This biting black comedy is a microcosm of the questions that still plague institutions of power and those subjected to its inequities. It just does it with a plucky attitude.

            "date": "2023-08-30T01:04:29Z",
            "content": "The social media company formerly known as Twitter said on Tuesday it would now allow political advertising in the US from candidates and political parties, reversing previous policies and raising concerns over misinformation and hate speech ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Before the billionaire Elon Musk acquired the company, now called X, in October 2022, Twitter had banned all political ads globally since 2019. In January, the platform lifted the ban and began allowing \u201ccause-based ads\u201d in the US that raise awareness of issues such as voter registration, stating that it planned to expand the types of political ads it would allow on the platform. The move to allow all political ads in the US could help X grow its revenue at a time when many advertisers have fled or reduced spending on the platform for fear of appearing next to inappropriate content. It also comes as Musk has attempted to position X as a \u201ctown square\u201d for elections, hosting Ron DeSantis\u2019s campaign announcement in May. In a blog post on Tuesday, X said it would grow its teams to combat content manipulation and \u201cemerging threats\u201d. The company said it would create a global advertising transparency center, which would let users see what political ads were being promoted on X, and added it would continue to prohibit political ads that spread false information or seek to undermine public confidence in an election. This is in keeping with the company\u2019s goal of \u201cseeking to preserve free and open political discourse\u201d, the blog post said. Since Musk\u2019s acquisition, X has faced questions about its readiness for the US presidential election after laying off thousands of employees, including those who had worked on the trust and safety team. The platform, like other social media companies, has long been criticized by researchers and lawmakers for not doing enough to prevent misleading or false content during major elections. Those criticisms intensified surrounding the 6 January 2021 events, in which the former president Donald Trump used Twitter extensively to rile up his supporters, who ultimately stormed the US Capitol. Trump was removed from the platform after the incident, but Musk unilaterally lifted the ban in November 2022. Despite the reactivation of his account, Trump remained silent on Twitter until last week, when he shared a picture of his mugshot after surrendering at a Georgia county jail on racketeering and conspiracy charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. His official return has sparked concern from a number of misinformation experts, and civil rights advocates had previously warned that Trump\u2019s return, accompanied by a loosening of content moderation policies, would \u201copen the floodgates of disinformation\u201d and abuse. Twitter, now called X, did not respond to request for comment."

            "date": "2023-08-06T18:03:44Z",
            "content": "Almost 18 months after the furore of the Owen Paterson scandal led to promises of a crackdown on MPs having second jobs, their income from work outside parliament has continued to rise, Guardian analysis has found. The analysis looked at all MPs who had made more than \u00a31,000 in the past year, excluding income from completing surveys, and found that they had collectively made \u00a310m in this period, driven largely by a figure close to \u00a35m made by the former prime minister Boris Johnson in his final months as an MP. While some MPs gave up well-paid consultancy work in 2021 after the anger about Owen Paterson\u2019s lobbying on behalf of a company that paid him, others have begun building up portfolio careers in the past 12 months. October 2021: the Owen Paterson scandal The former Tory cabinet minister Owen Paterson is found to have breached parliament\u2019s rules after using his position as an MP to lobby ministers and government departments on behalf of two companies that employed him as a consultant. Paterson\u2019s proposed sanction from the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards is a 30-day suspension from the House. However, this is delayed by a government motion (led by then-PM Boris Johnson), which proposed redesigning the disciplinary process for MPs. This is widely seen as an attempt to save Paterson\u2019s career. The government later U-turns on its decision, and Johnson describes it as a \u201ctotal mistake\u201d and calls for there to be \u201creasonable limits\u201d placed on how much time an MP can spend on a second job versus their day-to-day role. Soon after, Paterson resigns. November 2021: the Geoffrey Cox furore The focus soon shifts to the former UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox. Guardian analysis of the MPs\u2019 register of interests finds he has made nearly \u00a36m from his work as a barrister outside parliament in the 16 years since he became a Conservative MP. An investigation by the Guardian finds that a quarter of Conservative MPs hold second jobs. In an attempt to silence increasingly critical headlines, Boris Johnson writes to the Commons Speaker proposing rules that would update the code of conduct for MPs and ban MPs working as paid political consultants or lobbyists. Ministers say they will back reasonable limits on outside earnings and it is suggested that around 10-15 hours a week would be fair. March 2022: plans to cap UK MPs\u2019 income from second jobs are dropped But six months later ministers tell the Commons standards committee that a time limit or ceiling on such earnings would be \u201cimpractical\u201d. Steve Barclay, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, say: \u201cThe imposition of time limits would not necessarily serve to address recent concerns over paid advocacy and the primary duty of MPs to serve their constituents. It could be possible, for example, for a member to conduct work within the accepted time limits but that does not necessarily mean such work is \u2018appropriate\u2019 even if it did not constitute \u2018paid advocacy\u2019.\u201d They add: \u201cEarnings from activities such as writing books for example, would not preclude members from meeting their principal duty to their constituents.\u201d May 2022: plans to limit the amount of time MPs can spend on second jobs are dropped Changes to the MPs\u2019 code of conduct were considered by the Commons standards committee after outcry over the Paterson and Cox scandals but they agree that without cross-party agreement on reform, the system should stay as it is. January 2023: Keir Starmer proposes a ban on second jobs The Labour leader calls for a ban, but adds that there may be some \u201cexceptions\u201d. In this same month, the Guardian reports that Tory MPs have been paid \u00a315.2m from second jobs since the 2019 general election, dwarfing the combined income of politicians who represent other parties. The former prime minister Theresa May is the biggest recipient at this point, with her office receiving \u00a32.5m on top of her parliamentary salary, mainly from giving speeches to organisations in the US such as JP Morgan bank and the private equity firm Apax Partners. March 2023: new MPs\u2019 code of conduct comes into effect The refreshed code introduces an outright ban on paid parliamentary advice, tightens loopholes and improves transparency. For the first time, the code now explicitly prohibits members providing parliamentary advice to an outside employer. This includes providing or agreeing to provide services as a parliamentary adviser, consultant or strategist. It also requires MPs to have a written contract for any outside work, stating that they cannot lobby for their employer or give paid parliamentary advice, and that their employer cannot ask them to do so. July 2023: head of ethics watchdog calls for limits on MPs\u2019 second jobs Lord Evans calls for some form of limit on MPs\u2019 second jobs, telling Sky News it is \u201chard to argue\u201d some politicians are putting parliament first. The crossbench peer, who spent his career in the secret service and was head of MI5 for six years, says MPs should be given an \u201cindicative\u201d ceiling on how much time to spend on their extra-parliamentary roles."

            "date": "2023-08-16T23:24:23Z",
            "content": "Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney in Georgia who is prosecuting Donald Trump and 18 other allies over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, is facing a flurry of racist online abuse after the former president attacked his opponents using the word \u201criggers\u201d, a thinly veiled play on the N-word. Hours after Willis had released the indictments on Monday night, Trump went on his social media platform Truth Social calling for all charges to be dropped and predicting he would be exonerated. He did not mention Willis by name, but accused prosecutors of pursuing the wrong criminal targets. \u201cThey never went after those that Rigged the Election,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey only went after those that fought to find the RIGGERS!\u201d Willis is African American. So too are the two New York-based prosecutors who have investigated Trump, the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg who indicted him in April over alleged hush-money payments, and Letitia James, the state attorney general who is investigating Trump\u2019s financial records. Trump\u2019s allusion to the racial slur was immediately picked up by his supporters on far-right platforms including Gab and Patriots.win. The sites hosted hundreds of posts featuring \u201criggers\u201d in their headlines in a disparaging context. The word has also been attached to numerous social media posts to Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss. The two Black poll workers from Atlanta were falsely accused by some of the 19 defendants in the Fulton county case of committing election fraud during the 2020 vote count, and the indictment accuses Trump allies of harassing them. Calls to violence have proliferated across far-right sites since the charges were made public on Monday night. Several Gab posts reproduced images of nooses and gallows and called for Willis and grand jurors who delivered the charges to be hanged. And posts on Patriots.win combined the wordplay with direct calls to violence. Earlier this month, Willis wrote to Fulton county commissioners and judges to warn them to stay vigilant in the face of rising tensions ahead of the release of the indictment. She told them that she and her staff had been receiving racist threats and voicemails since she began her investigation into Trump\u2019s attempt to subvert the election two years ago. \u201cI guess I am sending this as a reminder that you should stay alert over the month of August and stay safe,\u201d she said. As Willis\u2019s investigation approached its climax, Trump intensified his personal attacks on her through social media. He has accused her of prosecutorial misconduct and even of being racist herself. Willis, who on Wednesday said she wanted to take the case to trial in March 2024, has rebuffed Trump\u2019s claims as \u201cderogatory and false\u201d. Trump has also unleashed a barrage of vitriol against Jack Smith, the special counsel who earlier this month brought four federal charges against Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump has referred to the prosecutor, who is white, as \u201cDeranged Jack Smith\u201d. The judge in the federal case, Tanya Chutkan, has warned him to be careful not to make inflammatory public comments about the proceedings, saying she would \u201ctake whatever measures are necessary\u201d to prevent intimidation of witnesses or contamination of the jury pool."

            "date": "2023-08-25T03:05:34Z",
            "content": "In a lightning visit to Atlanta, Donald Trump was formally arrested after being indicted by Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis for trying to overturn the 2020 election, then released after posting a $200,000 bail bond. The visit to the county jail \u2013 a pilgrimage many of his co-defendants made this week \u2013 produced an image that will no doubt endure in American politics: his mug shot, the first ever taken of a former US president. Trump embraced the scowling portrait, even deploying it on Twitter in his first post since two days after the January 6 insurrection, when the platform temporarily booted him. That may be the biggest news of all. Trump used Twitter like no other politician during his successful White House run in 2016, and throughout his four years in office. We\u2019ll be watching to see if he tries to repeat the trick as he runs for president once again. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Willis asked a judge to start the trials in her case on 23 October \u2013 a speedy deadline that Trump is likely to fight. But Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who assisted Trump as he looked for ways to prevent Joe Biden from taking office, will go to trial on 23 October, after he asked that his case be resolved quickly. House Republicans are running interference for Trump once again by announcing an investigation into Willis. Mark Meadows, who was Trump\u2019s chief of staff around the time of his election loss and was indicted in Georgia, wants his trial moved to federal court. One thing we learned from last night\u2019s Republican presidential debate (which Trump skipped): opinions on abortion access range more than one might expect among the candidates. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is putting his mug shot to use wherever they can, but Chris LaCivita, a senior advisor to his presidential campaign, is warning other parties against using it: Donald Trump is free to tweet his mug shot because he posted a $200,000 bond that will allow him to stay out of jail while his case in Georgia is resolved. The Washington Post interviewed a Georgia bail bondsman at a company called Red Eye Bail Bonds (who asked to stay anonymous, citing privacy concerns and the headaches that can come with weighing in on American politics). While the bond was in the \u201ctop tier\u201d of what he deals with, the bondsman said Trump\u2019s case isn\u2019t as unusual as it may appear, at least from the perspective of a bondsman: In general, the manager said, Red Eye requires that a client provide 10 percent of the total bond. If the person under arrest is deemed to be a higher risk, that percentage increases. If the risk is higher, the company also will do more on the front end to establish whether resources exist to recoup the full value of the bond. Does the client own a house? Things like this. After all, while Red Eye requires only 10 percent, the county requires the whole thing. That doesn\u2019t mean that the firm has to put up $200,000 in cash. The whole point of involving a bondsman, after all, is that the firm serves as a proxy of trust on behalf of clients. There is a specialized power of attorney that is granted the firm, and when Red Eye decides to act as a guarantor for a client, a sum reflecting the total bond is frozen with the firm\u2019s insurer. I asked whether Trump\u2019s $200,000 was unusually high. The manager thought about it for a moment before determining that it was in the \u201ctop tier\u201d of what he usually sees. The midrange is about $100,000 or $110,000, he told me, but in cases involving more serious charges, costs could run higher. He was also not fazed by the unique circumstances of Trump\u2019s situation. He often has clients who are facing more than one indictment; that shows up in the initial analysis of the case and factors into the consideration of the arrestee as a flight risk. It is also not unusual for one party to live out of state, as Trump does. (He used the example of a college kid getting arrested and his parents posting bond remotely.) This, too, would on other occasions give him pause. But he wasn\u2019t really worried about Trump. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think he\u2019s just outright not going to show up in court,\u201d he said. This wasn\u2019t just about Trump; in other \u201chigh-end cases like that, most likely or not the families are not going anywhere.\u201d (I didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s recent social media post about moving to Russia.) Citing two sources, CNN has more details on why Donald Trump opted to pose the way he did in his mug shot: Twitter banned Donald Trump two days after the January 6 attack, citing \u201cthe risk of further incitement of violence\u201d. That all changed about a year-and-a-half later when, after a tortuous process that nearly went to court, billionaire Elon Musk bought the influential social media platform. Musk, who recently renamed the platform X, was already a prolific tweeter and after buying the site held a poll asking whether Trump should be let back on. A slim majority said yes, and Trump\u2019s account was reinstated last November, but the former president did not use it \u2013 until today. Donald Trump has used his Twitter account for the first time since two days after the January 6 insurrection to share a photo of his newly taken mug shot: It seems Donald Trump was happy with the mugshot authorities took at the Fulton county jail during his appearance there this evening. It\u2019s on the front of his main fundraising page, and his campaign is already selling t-shirts with the photo on the front and the words \u201cNEVER SURRENDER!\u201d on the back. For all the spectacle the arrest of Donald Trump and his co-defendants provided in Georgia, the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports that it is unlikely to change the basic dynamics of next year\u2019s presidential election: One by one this week, they\u2019ve made their way to 901 Rice Street, the address of the notorious Fulton county jail. Lawyers, government officials, a former state party chair and others have all surrendered to authorities after being charged as part of an alleged criminal effort to overturn the 2020 election. On Thursday, the head of that enterprise, Donald Trump, himself surrendered, marking another historic moment for a president who has reshaped the rules of American politics. This is the closest that Trump has been to a jail cell to date and serves as a blunt reminder that no American or former president is above the law. Like nearly everything Trump does, his surrender was orchestrated to be a spectacle. He deliberately timed his surrender, 7.30pm, to maximize cable news coverage. Reporters camped outside the jail all day on Thursday as temperatures reached mid-90F and Trump supporters gathered for a demonstration. There was wall-to-wall news coverage of Trump\u2019s motorcade and arrival at the jail. While politicians typically try and shift attention away from their criminal legal troubles, Trump has embraced it, feeding into the circuit by advertising his surrender time. Donald Trump\u2019s hostility shines through in the mugshot taken at the Fulton county jail as he was booked on charges of trying to steal the 2020 presidential election. The former president turns his eyes up to glare toward the camera above him. Dressed in a blue suit, white shirt and red tie, he makes no attempt to put on a smile like some of his co-accused in their booking photos. Instead, his mouth is taut and downturned. The picture does not flatter, but it does convey the message many of Trump\u2019s supporters want to hear \u2013 one of belligerence. The six-pointed star of the Fulton county sheriff\u2019s office badge and the name of the sheriff, Patrick Labat, sits in the top left-hand corner of the picture. But some will be disappointed that Trump is not seen in the classic pose holding a board in front of his chest with his name and date of arrest. For all that, the former president\u2019s supporters are already embracing the booking photo as a badge of honour and defiance. It will be held up as evidence that their man will not give up the fight against a system his followers see as ever more determined to bring him down and prevent him returning to the White House. The mugshot\u2019s rapid appearance on T-shirts, posters and, well, mugs glorifying a martyred Trump can be expected. The president\u2019s detractors, on the other hand, will see the booking photo as evidence that even a man who was once the most powerful person in the land cannot escape the might of the justice system. Some will welcome anything that makes him look even a little bit more criminal as a confirmation that sooner or later he is going to prison. The accused may be innocent until a plea or a jury says otherwise, but mugshots can have a way of conveying guilt. Donald Trump\u2019s plane has now departed Atlanta, but the former president will undoubtedly be back. The question is: when? Expect Trump\u2019s lawyers to do everything they can to delay his trial on the indictment brought by Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis. For a taste of his likely strategy, take a look at the pre-trial motions in the federal case brought against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election, where Trump\u2019s lawyers have proposed a trial date in 2026. A judge has yet to decide the matter. Here is the mug shot of Donald Trump that was taken when he was arrested at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta: No former US president has ever had his mug shot taken. Here\u2019s a video clip of Donald Trump\u2019s brief remarks to reporters before departing Atlanta: Before boarding his plane at Atlanta\u2019s airport, Donald Trump spoke briefly to reporters about his arrest. \u201cWhat has taken place here is a travesty of justice. We did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong, and everybody knows that,\u201d Trump said, hewing to the line he has taken repeatedly as the investigations into his attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat have unfolded. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is election interference,\u201d he added, in a nod to his ongoing campaign to return to the White House in the 2024 polls. \u201cWe did nothing wrong at all, and we have every right, every single right, to challenge an election that we think is dishonest.\u201d He declined to answer shouted questions from the press, including about whether he would pardon himself if he is again elected president. Donald Trump is expected to speak at the Atlanta airport before he boards his private plane, CNN reports. The former president made remarks from the tarmac in Washington DC earlier this month, after appearing in federal court to answer charges related to the plot to stop Joe Biden from taking office and the January 6 insurrection. Just before he arrived in Atlanta, Donald Trump (or whoever writes his messages for him) sent an email to supporters that begins: \u201cThis will be my last email to you before I enter the Fulton County Jail to be ARRESTED as an innocent man.\u201d It\u2019s a gripping opening line, and indeed, this was a big moment: Trump\u2019s trip to jail was something no former president has ever gone through. The 250-plus words that follow are filled with dire proclamations. \u201cThe people of our country will watch in shock and horror as a former President \u2013 and the LEADING OPPONENT to the current regime \u2013 gets WRONGFULLY ARRESTED in a notoriously violent jail at the hands of the ruling political party\u201d, Trump protests in a typical line. \u201cI\u2019m now about to enter Fulton County Jail. These are my last words to you before my sham arrest: I WILL NEVER SURRENDER OUR MISSION TO SAVE AMERICA\u201d he continues. And that\u2019s when the message\u2019s purpose becomes clear: \u201cPlease make a contribution to peacefully defend our movement as the Deep State tries to JAIL me for life as an innocent man all because I put AMERICA first.\u201d The text itself is actually a hyperlink that leads to a donation page run by WinRed \u2013 a fundraising platform with a history of ripping off consumers. Below that is a series of boxes beginning at $24 and going up to $250. Perhaps the goal is to cover the $20,000 he had to put down to bond out of the Fulton county jail. The motorcade carrying Donald Trump has left the Fulton county jail, about 20 minutes after he arrived to be formally arrested following his indictment by district attorney Fani Willis on charges related to trying to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s election victory in the state. Donald Trump had his mugshot taken during his processing into custody at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, CNN reports, citing the county sheriff. It\u2019s possible that Donald Trump will have his mugshot taken when he is processed into custody in Fulton county \u2013 as has been the case with the other co-defendants who have surrendered at the jail. Outside the jail, rightwing Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was not involved in the case but is nonetheless an enthusiastic supporter of the former president, announced she had made her own mugshot, and encouraged other Trump fans to do the same: She has indeed made the mugshot her Twitter (or X) profile picture. Donald Trump\u2019s booking details have been posted on the Fulton county jail\u2019s website. Besides listing the 13 charges the former president faces, the jail provides his identifying details: white male, 6ft 3in in height, 215lbs, blond or strawberry hair, blue eyes. Donald Trump has been officially booked into the Fulton county jail after being indicted for trying to meddle in Georgia\u2019s elections three years ago, Reuters reports. The former president plans to post a $200,000 bond that will allow him to avoid spending time behind bars before trial, but it is possible he will have his mugshot taken today \u2013 the first time this has happened in the four separate criminal cases he is now facing. Donald Trump has arrived at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, where he will be formally arrested after his indictment by the district attorney Fani Willis on charges related to his efforts to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory in the state. The former president is not expected to spend time in jail, having reached an agreement to post a $200,000 bond that will guarantee his release as his case moves through the court system. Here\u2019s the scene outside the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, where Donald Trump will soon arrive: Here\u2019s video of the moment Donald Trump disembarked in Atlanta: Donald Trump disembarked from his plane, flashing a thumbs up to a small group of reporters gathered below the boarding stairs. He made no comments before getting into one of the many black SUVs that make up his motorcade. Here\u2019s a livestream of Donald Trump\u2019s plane, which is currently taxiing at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport: Donald Trump\u2019s plane has landed in Atlanta. Next stop: the Fulton county jail, where the former president will be formally arrested, but is expected to be released after posting a $200,000 bond. Donald Trump has enlisted a local bonding company to secure his release from the Fulton county jail, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. \u201cWe will be posting his bond when he arrives,\u201d Charles Shaw, the CEO of Foster Bail Bonds LLC in Lawrenceville, an Atlanta suburb, told the paper. According to CNN, Trump paid 10% of the $200,000 bond, which was one of the conditions for his release agreed to with the Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis. When Donald Trump arrives at the Fulton county jail, he\u2019ll have company. Besides the Secret Service agents guarding him, CNN reports his newly retained lawyer will be there for his formal arrest: Trump is not expected to spend time in jail, having posted a $200,000 bond as part of an agreement that will allow him to remain free while his case moves towards trial. CNN reports that the rightwing Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene will also be waiting for Trump when he lands in Atlanta: The former president is currently in the air and expected to land at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport shortly. Georgia is far from the only state grappling with the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to stay in the White House despite losing the 2020 election. As the Guardian\u2019s Alice Herman reports, local officials in Michigan are outraged by the fake elector scandal that occurred there: When the news broke in 2020 that 16 Republicans in Michigan had signed a certificate falsely claiming to be electors for Donald Trump, Rosemary Herweyer was dismayed to find a prominent local politician, Kent Vanderwood, listed among the signatories. \u201cHis willingness to sign a fake elector paper and try to send that in and negate Michigan\u2019s actual vote speaks to his integrity,\u201d Herweyer said of Vanderwood, who was then a member of the Wyoming, Michigan, city council. \u201cHow can I trust anything he does?\u201d Vanderwood, who served on the city council for 16 years before being elected mayor of the city in 2022, now faces eight felony charges for his role as a false elector during the 2020 presidential election. Fifteen other Republicans, including the former co-chair of the Michigan GOP, have also been criminally charged. Since Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Dana Nessel, announced the charges on 18 July \u2013 making the state the first to prosecute a full slate of false electors involved in the seven-state scheme \u2013 voters and good government groups have begun a push for elected officials involved to resign. Across the state, a mayor, a school board member and a township clerk whose role includes administering elections have each been arraigned and have pleaded not guilty, and in each community, constituents are pushing for accountability. \u201cOver 2 million people voted for Joe Biden in Michigan, and Stan Grot decided that our votes didn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Alisa Diez, a Democratic party activist in Shelby Township, where Stanley Grot, one of the 16 false electors, currently serves as township clerk. After Grot was charged, the state stripped him of his ability to administer elections, but he remains in office. Donald Trump will appear on Newsmax with host Greg Kelly at 9pm tonight following his surrender at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, Georgia, the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports. Trump\u2019s Newsmax appearance later tonight will follow a post he made on his Truth Social account earlier today as he prepared to make his way from New Jersey to Georgia, which read: I have to start getting ready to head down to Atlanta, Georgia, where Murder and other Violent Crimes have reached levels never seen before, to get ARRESTED by a Radical Left, Lowlife District Attorney, Fani Willis, for A PERFECT PHONE CALL, and having the audacity to challenge a RIGGED &amp; STOLEN ELECTION. THE EVIDENCE IS IRREFUTABLE! ARREST TIME: 7:30 P.M. The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports that a federal judge has set an 18 September hearing for former Donald Trump Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark\u2019s request to remove his case to federal court. Clark has been charged alongside Trump in a 41-count indictment over efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential elections in Georgia. Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie appeared on Morning Joe following Wednesday evening\u2019s debate during which he refused to raise his hand when the presidential candidates were asked whether they would support Donald Trump if he becomes the GOP nominee. Christie spoke about the other candidates who raised their hands, saying: \u201cI can only assume it\u2019s because they\u2019re auditioning for what they\u2019re praying to be a future vice-president nomination or cabinet bid in a Trump administration.\u201d The problem for them is that Donald Trump is never going to be president of the United States again \u2026 When someone says they\u2019re willing to suspend the constitution, that they took an oath to preserve, protect and defend. That\u2019s just wrong \u2026 It\u2019s not a hard answer for them either, but they\u2019re playing a political game. As Donald Trump makes his way to Atlanta, Georgia, his former vice-president and current Republican opponent Mike Pence has urged him to join the other candidates in the next GOP debate. Speaking to the Associated Press in a new interview after Wednesday night\u2019s debate, Pence said: I believe that this country\u2019s in a lot of trouble and every man and woman who aspires to carry the banner of the Republican party owes it to the American people to get on that stage to answer the tough questions and to articulate their vision for the future of the country and let the voters decide. The legal gears continue to grind forward for the other people indicted in Georgia alongside Donald Trump, including Jeff Clark, the former justice department official who has asked to move his trial to federal court. Politico reports that the judge handling his case will hold a hearing on 18 September on the matter: This was the scene as the motorcade of Donald Trump made its way from his resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, to the airport in Newark: Squint through the gloomy Newark, New Jersey weather in this Sky News footage and you can see the flashing lights of what appears to be Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade arriving at the plane that will take him to Georgia: Donald Trump has arrived at the airport in Newark, New Jersey, where he will board his flight to face arrest in Atlanta, CNN reports. In his order to begin Kenneth Chesebro\u2019s trial on 23 October, Judge Scott McAfee noted that the schedule does not apply to anyone else. \u201cAt this time, these deadlines do not apply to any co-defendant,\u201d the judge wrote. That\u2019s good news for the 18 other people indicted by the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, including Donald Trump, whose lawyers are currently trying to get his case moved to federal court, which could delay it for months \u2013 potentially long enough for him to win his race for the White House. Kenneth Chesebro, another of Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys who advised him on his plot to overturn his 2020 election loss, requested a speedy trial after being indicted in Georgia, and it appears his wish has been granted. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that the judge handling his case has said Chesebro\u2019s trial will begin on 23 October \u2013 as Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis had proposed: When Donald Trump appears at the Rice Street jail in Atlanta this evening, the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports that he will be treated like any other defendant. That includes having his mugshot taken, and his height and weight recorded: Donald Trump was expected to surrender at the Fulton county jail on Thursday evening on racketeering and conspiracy charges over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, yielding to the criminal justice process in Georgia that will involve him being processed like any other defendant. The former president\u2019s arrival in Georgia follows a presidential debate featuring his main rivals for the 2024 Republican nomination, a race in which Trump remains the overwhelmingly dominant frontrunner despite his many legal troubles. Trump had his legal team negotiate his booking to take place during the primetime viewing hours for the cable news networks, as he sought to discredit the charges and distract from the indignity of the surrender by turning it into a spectacle. But Trump was expected to be booked by authorities without the special privileges afforded to him in his other criminal cases, being subject to a mugshot that he had desperately sought to avoid, having his fingerprints taken, as well as having his height and weight recorded. Trump faced his fourth indictment since leaving office when he was charged in a 41-count indictment by the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, last week, that described Trump and 18 allies as having engaged in a criminal enterprise to reverse his 2020 election defeat. Donald Trump has left his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort for Georgia, where he is expected to be formally arrested this evening, CNN reports. In a post on his Truth social account, Donald Trump said he expected to be arrested in Georgia at 7.30pm eastern time, and fired off his typical string of insults at Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis. Here it is, in full: 231,000,000 Views, and still counting. The Biggest Video on Social Media, EVER, more than double the Super Bowl! But please excuse me, I have to start getting ready to head down to Atlanta, Georgia, where Murder and other Violent Crimes have reached levels never seen before, to get ARRESTED by a Radical Left, Lowlife District Attorney, Fani Willis, for A PERFECT PHONE CALL, and having the audacity to challenge a RIGGED &amp; STOLEN ELECTION. THE EVIDENCE IS IRREFUTABLE! ARREST TIME: 7:30 P.M. Here\u2019s the mugshot for Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows, which Georgia authorities released following his booking today: John Eastman\u2019s bad week just got worse. A lawyer who advised Donald Trump on his legal strategy to stop Joe Biden\u2019s election victory, Eastman was among those indicted in Georgia by district attorney Fani Willis for his attempt to tamper with the state\u2019s election. On Tuesday, he was formally booked into the Fulton county jail, and Politico reports that today, the California bar is considering whether to revoke his license to practice law: Eastman\u2019s name popped up repeatedly in the January 6 committee investigation last year, which discovered that he asked Trump for a pardon days after the attack on the Capitol. Hello US politics live blog readers, things are very busy at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta and are only going to get busier as more co-defendants in Donald Trump\u2019s Georgia election subversion case negotiate bail then turn themselves in \u2013 and the former US president is due there this evening to surrender himself. We\u2019re covering all this as it happens, so do stick with Guardian US. Here\u2019s where things stand: Mark Meadows, Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff at the White House, turned himself in at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, Georgia to face racketeering charges. Jeff Clark, a former justice department attorney and a codefendant in the Georgia election subversion case, struck a $100,00 bond agreement with Fulton county prosecutors. Fani Willis, Fulton county district attorney, has proposed for the Georgia racketeering (Rico) case against Trump and his 18 co-defendants to start on 23 October 2023, according to a court filing. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, has been subpoenaed to testify at a Monday hearing examining efforts by Meadows to move the Fulton county criminal case to federal court. The Republican-led House judiciary committee launched a congressional investigation into the Willis, over whether her prosecution of Donald Trump is \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. Mark Meadows is trying to get his part of the Georgia organized crime case against him, Donald Trump and others moved from state court to federal court and had hoped to be able to avoid having to surrender at the jail in Atlanta this week with his co-defendants. Two days ago he asked a federal court in an emergency motion to block his arrest, according to court documents filed on Tuesday. He asked the court to \u201cprotect\u201d him from arrest before a Monday 28 August, hearing on his request to move the case out of the Fulton county superior court to the district court of northern Georgia. Meadows is arguing that the charges against him concern his actions as an officer of the federal government. Trump is expected to argue likewise in due course. In response, Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis unequivocally rejected the request, noting: \u201cI am not granting any extensions\u201d and that he was no different from any other defendant in a criminal case. Willis indicated that if Meadows does not turn himself in by noon on Friday, he would be arrested, writing: \u201cAt 12:30 pm on Friday I shall file warrants in the system.\u201d Early Thursday afternoon, he surrendered to the jail to be booked. Mark Meadows has turned himself in at Fulton county jail in Atlanta, just under 24 hours before the deadline of noon Friday for all 19 defendants in the Georgia case to surrender, to face the criminal charges against him Like Donald Trump and all 17 fellow co-defendants, Meadows is charged with being part of an organized crime racket in relation to working with others to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia in the 2020 presidential election. In official terms, he\u2019s charged with violating the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico) and \u201csolicitation of violation of oath by a public officer\u201d, in the latter case being accused in the indictment of \u201cunlawfully soliciting, requesting and importuning Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger \u2026 to engage in conduct constituting the felony offense\u2026by unlawfully altering, unlawfully adjusting and otherwise unlawfully influencing the certified returns for presidential electors for the November 3, 2020, election in Georgia\u2026\u201d This, in short, related to efforts from Trump\u2019s mob to persuade Raffensperger to rustle up enough non-existent Republican votes falsely that it would give the-then president the win in the crucial state. Mark Meadows, Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff at the White House, has just turned himself in at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, Georgia. He faces racketeering charges alongside Trump and 17 other co-defendants. Here are some of the latest images from the newswires taken at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, Georgia, where Donald Trump is expected to surrender this evening on racketeering and conspiracy charges. Trevian Kutti, a former publicist who was charged in the Georgia case in connection with the intimidation of an Atlanta election worker, has agreed to a $75,000 bond. A Chicago-based publicist, Kutti allegedly threatened a Georgia election worker, Ruby Freeman, with jail if she did not say she participated in election fraud. She faces three counts in the indictment: violation of Georgia\u2019s Rico Act, criminal conspiracy and influencing witnesses. Jeff Clark, a former justice department attorney, has struck a $100,00 bond agreement with Fulton county prosecutors. Clark\u2019s bail conditions include not communicating with witnesses and co-defendants, reporting to pretrial services by phone every month, surrendering by noon on Friday and not obstructing justice by intimidating witnesses. From Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney: Ahead of the surrender, Donald Trump shook up his legal team and retained the top Georgia attorney Steven Sadow, who filed a notice of appearance with the Fulton county superior court as lead counsel, replacing Drew Findling. Trump\u2019s other lawyer in the case, Jennifer Little, is staying on. The reason for the abrupt recalibration was unclear, and Trump\u2019s aides suggested it was unrelated to performance. Still, Trump has a record of firing lawyers who represented him during criminal investigations but were unable to stave off charges. Findling was also unable to exempt Trump from having his mugshot taken, according to people familiar with the matter \u2013 something that personally irritated Trump, even though the Fulton county sheriff\u2019s office had always indicated they were uninterested in making such an accommodatioin. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The other 18 co-defendants in the 2020 election subversion case appear to be receiving regular treatment based on online jail records for the former Trump election lawyer John Eastman and others, who had their height, weight and personal appearance made public. Once the booking is complete, Trump was expected to be released immediately on conditions that include stringent witness intimidation restrictions that have not been put in place for his co-defendants, court filings show, until he is due back in state court for arraignment. The Trump legal team could file a motion to remove the case to federal court before then, under a federal statute that allows for such venue changes if the case involves federal officials\u2019 actions taken \u201cunder color\u201d of their office \u2013 as in, if it was part of official duties. Trump could face major difficulties with that argument, however, since he would have to show that taking steps to change the outcome of the 2020 election in Georgia amounted to him acting in his official capacity as president, legal experts have said. Donald Trump was expected to leave this afternoon from his Bedminster club in New Jersey, where he spends his summers, and fly by private plane to Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson airport. He was then expected to travel into Atlanta by US Secret Service motorcade, a person familiar with the matter said. The schedule will involve Trump arriving at the infamously decrepit Rice Street jail, located north-west of downtown Atlanta, in the early evening and the motorcade is expected to snake around into the jail premises down a road lined with dozens of TV cameras. The strategy to turn the surrender into a made-for-television circus has been an effort to discredit the indictments, the person said, as well as to capitalize on the information void left by prosecutors after the events to foist his own spin on the charges. To that end, once Trump is done with the booking process and returns directly to the airport, Trump is weighing delivering impromptu remarks to reporters there before boarding his plane as he liked to do when he was president talking to a pool of reporters, the person said. Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis has proposed for the Georgia election subversion trial against Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants to start on 23 October 2023, according to a court filing. The scheduling request by Willis came a day after one of Trump\u2019s co-defendants, Kenneth Chesebro, filed a demand for a speedy trial in the county superior court. Mark Meadows, former White House chief of staff for Donald Trump, has agreed to a $100,000 bond deal with the Fulton county district attorney\u2019s office, according to court documents. Meadows was charged with two felony counts, including violating the Georgia Rico Act and solicitation of violation of oath from a public officer. Here\u2019s more on Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis\u2019 subpoenas for Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and investigator Francis Watson. A federal judge last week ordered an \u201cevidentiary hearing\u201d on a motion by Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff for Donald Trump, to remove the case to federal court. The hearing is expected to take place at 10am ET on Monday. Meadows, who is a co-defendant alongside Trump in the Georgia election subversion case, has sought to move his charges to federal court and push his Friday deadline to turn himself into Fulton county authorities, aruing the charges concern his actions as an officer of the federal government. On Wednesday, Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis urged a judge to deny Meadows\u2019 \u201cmeritless\u201d request to delay his arrest in the Georgia case. Willis rejected Meadows\u2019 request for an extension on the deadline, according to Meadows\u2019 emergency motion. I am not granting any extensions. I gave 2 weeks for people to surrender themselves to the court. Your client is no different than any other criminal defendant in this jurisdiction. The two weeks was a tremendous courtesy. Meadows was charged with two felony counts, including violating the Georgia Rico Act and solicitation of violation of oath from a public officer, according to Willis\u2019s indictment. Meadows was on the infamous phone call when Trump asked Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the state. He also received hundreds of text messages on 6 January 2021 alerting him and the White House of escalating violence at the US Capitol and asking Trump to intervene. Donald Trump is expected to leave his club in New Jersey later this afternoon with a coterie of aides and turn himself to Fulton county authorities this evening, the Washington Post reported, citing sources. Trump is not expected to deliver a speech, as he has done in the past after some of his previous indictments, the report says. Former Trump DoJ official Jeff Clark\u2019s lawyer has arrived at the Fulton county district attorney\u2019s office, apparently to negotiate bond conditions. A federal judge denied Clark\u2019s motion to stay his surrender before noon tomorrow while he tries to have his case removed to federal court. While former president Donald Trump was preparing to surrender at an Atlanta jail on Thursday, he was apparently also reconsidering his legal defense team. Just hours before Trump is supposed to turn himself in, reports broke that he had shaken up his team. Criminal defense lawyer Steve Sadow is reportedly going to replace Trump\u2019s existing lawyer, Drew Findling, according to the New York Times. Notably, Findling, alongside Jennifer Little and Marissa Goldberg, was key in negotiating Trump\u2019s $200,000 bond. Little will reportedly stay on the team. The Guardian has contacted Sadow for further comment. Law enforcement officers are on high alert at the Fulton county jail, where Donald Trump is expected to turn himself to be processed later today. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, has been subpoenaed to testify at a Monday hearing examining efforts by the former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to move the Fulton county criminal case to federal court, according to court filings. Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis also subpoenaed Frances Watson, the chief investigator for Raffensperger during the 2020 election. From Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u2019s Tamar Hallerman: The Republican-led House judiciary committee launched a congressional investigation into the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, over whether her prosecution of Donald Trump is \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. In a letter to Willis announcing the investigation, House Judiciary chairman Jim Jordan demanded Willis turn over information and communications with the justice department and federal officials by 7 September. The letter states: Ms. Willis\u2019s indictment and prosecution implicate substantial federal interests, and the circumstances surrounding her actions raise serious concerns about whether such actions are politically motivated. It was perhaps remarkable that the conversation between Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson was taking place at all. Just five months ago, Carlson was revealed to have said of Trump in a text message: I hate him passionately. \u201cWe are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,\u201d the then Fox News prime-time anchor said in a message to a colleague in early January 2021 as the former president continued a futile battle to remain in office. \u201cI truly can\u2019t wait.\u201d But the two men set aside their differences to jointly take on their respective enemies \u2013 Fox and the rest of the Republican primary field. Despite the array of charges he faces for trying to rig the 2020 presidential election, Trump continued to maintain the false claim that it was stolen from him by the Democrats. Trump also defended the crowd that gathered to hear him speak on 6 January 2021 immediately before the mass assault on Congress that shocked the US and the world and is now the subject of one of Trump\u2019s indictments. Trump suggested that he told the protesters to behave \u201cpeacefully and patriotically\u201d but \u201ca very small group\u201d went to the Capitol. Donald Trump suggested to Tucker Carlson, in a Twitter interview with the far-right former Fox News host staged to undermine the first Republican primary debate in Milwaukee, that he is concerned \u201cthe left\u201d will try to kill him. In a rambling interview, speckled with discussion of conspiracy theories from whether the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was murdered in his jail cell to the role of federal agencies limiting the amount of water in washing machines, Trump took aim at critics on all sides in his traditional derisory fashion. In the 46-minute interview broadcast on Twitter, Carlson asked Trump if he is concerned \u201cthe left\u201d, after impeaching and then indicting him, would try to kill him. \u201cThey\u2019re savage animals. They are people that are sick, really sick,\u201d Trump responded. You have great people that are Democrats. Most of the people in our country are fantastic. And I\u2019m representing everybody \u2026 But I\u2019ve seen what they do. Carlson, who is engaged in a protracted dispute with his former network after being taken off air, launched the interview five minutes before the Republican debate aired on Fox. If that was an attempt to upstage both Trump\u2019s rivals in the 2024 election and Carlson\u2019s ex-employer, then it would appear to have been successful. The interview had more than 80m views on Twitter within two hours of being posted. Rather than attending the GOP debate, Donald Trump chose to sit down for an interview with the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which was available on X, formerly known as Twitter, minutes before the debate began. Trump cited his standing in the polls to justify skipping the debate, mocking his opponents\u2019 struggles to gain momentum in the race. You see the polls that have come out, and I\u2019m leading by 50 and 60 points and some of them are at one and zero and two. And I\u2019m saying, do I sit there for an hour or two hours or whatever it\u2019s going to be and get harassed by people who shouldn\u2019t even be running for president? \u201cI just felt it would be more appropriate not to do the debate,\u201d he added. During his interview with Carlson, Trump suggested the US could see intensifying political violence and described the day of the January 6 2021 insurrection as one of \u201clove and unity\u201d, according to a Washington Post report. People in that crowd said it was the most beautiful day they ever experienced. There was love and unity. I have never seen such spirit and such passion and such love. And I\u2019ve also never seen, simultaneously and from the same people, such hatred at what they\u2019ve done to our country. At the conclusion of the 46-minute interview, Carlson asked the former president if he believed the country was moving toward civil war. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s open conflict?\u201d he asked. Trump replied: I don\u2019t know. Without the specter of Roe v Wade looming overhead, the eight Republican presidential hopefuls on last night\u2019s debate stage faced a new litmus test on abortion: whether or not they support a nationwide ban on the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The former vice-president Mike Pence, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson and South Carolina senator Tim Scott all pledged to support a federal 15-week ban. The question from the moderator Martha MacCallum had noted that abortion had consistently been a losing issue for Republicans in state ballots since the Dobbs decision. Nevertheless just one candidate, the North Dakota governor, Doug Burgum, decisively rejected the idea that Congress ought to regulate abortion access. Burgum, who signed North Dakota\u2019s six-week abortion ban in April, said the conservative mission to overturn Roe was predicated on the belief that states should be allowed to set their own rules on the procedure. What is going to work in New York will never work in North Dakota and vice versa. For decades, Roe v Wade offered Republican candidates a convenient boogeyman. The supreme court ruling was not just about abortion \u2013 swing state conservatives like Burgum could point to Roe as an example of federal overreach. But Wednesday\u2019s debate signaled a schism in the GOP\u2019s position on abortion. Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and Republican presidential candidates, has performed well on Google search traffic since her appearance on the GOP primary debate stage last night, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver writes. Tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who emerged in the absence of Donald Trump as a surprise focus of the debate, is also likely to rise in the polls as a result of getting more media attention, Silver says. The Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, delivered a sweeping indictment earlier this month that charges Donald Trump, along with more than a dozen co-defendants, with 41 counts including racketeering, conspiracy, solicitation and filing false statements. These are the other defendants charged in the indictment, which alleges a coordinated group effort to pressure Georgia officials into changing the outcome of the 2020 election. Brian Tevis, an attorney representing Rudy Giuliani in Georgia, said he doesn\u2019t know who paid for the private plane that Giuliani flew on to Atlanta on Wednesday. Tevis, a Georgia attorney who represented the former New York Mayor and Trump attorney in bond and surrender negotiations with the Fulton County district attorney\u2019s office, refused to discuss his client\u2019s finances during a CNN interview. He also told Kaitlan Collins it is \u201cvery premature to be saying what is the defense going to be\u201d when asked if Giuliani would be using his status as Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer as a defense in the Georgia election subversion case. Nearly an hour into the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Fox News hosts Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier asked the eight candidates on the stage whether they would still support Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee if he were convicted of the charges he faces. Six candidates \u2013 North Carolina\u2019s Governor Doug Burgum, Florida\u2019s Governor Ron DeSantis, the former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, the former vice-president Mike Pence, the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and South Carolina\u2019s Senator Tim Scott \u2013 indicated they would still support Trump. Only two candidates \u2013 the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson \u2013 said they would not. The debate came one day before Trump was expected to surrender to authorities in Fulton county, Georgia, where he has been charged on 13 felony counts related to his efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s 2020 victory in the state. The former president faces 91 total felony counts across four criminal cases. But a CBS News/YouGov survey compiled last week found that Trump now holds his largest polling lead to date, as he won the support of 62% of likely Republican primary voters. The survey showed Trump beating his next closest competitor, DeSantis, by 46 points, with every other candidate mired in the single digits. With such stalwart support for Trump among the Republican base, it remains unclear how any of the participants in the Monday debate could capture the nomination. The electoral threat of nominating a twice-impeached former president, who now faces nearly 100 criminal charges, did not escape the attention of at least one debate participant. \u201cWe have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\u201d Haley said. \u201cWe can\u2019t win a general election that way.\u201d Supporters of Donald Trump are beginning to gather near the Fulton county jail in Atlanta, where the former president is expected to appear later today to surrender to authorities in connection with his attempts to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Vivek Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old biotech entrepreneur running third in Republican polling, emerged in the absence of Donald Trump as a surprise focus of the first debate of the Republican primary, showing scant respect for other candidates and drawing heavy fire in return. \u201cWe live in a dark moment,\u201d Ramaswamy declaimed, in the distinctly Trumpian and conspiratorial fashion that has become a hallmark of his campaign. Ramaswamy\u2019s bid for the Republican nomination has been hit by recent scandals over remarks that suggested sympathy for conspiracy theories around the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the January 6 assault on the Capitol. But he has sought to portray himself as a Trump-like outsider taking on the establishment with his extreme views. All the other presidential candidates onstage in Milwaukee, Ramaswamy repeatedly said, were \u201cbought and paid for\u201d by donors. After all eight candidates declined to raise their hands when asked if they believed human behavior was causing the climate crisis, Ramaswamy jumped in, stridently rapping out: Unlock American energy, drill, frack, burn coal, embrace nuclear. Amid exchanges on crime, Ramaswamy attacked the former vice-president Mike Pence, seeming even to doubt a Republican saint, Ronald Reagan, when he said: \u201cSome others like you on this stage may have an, \u2018It\u2019s morning in America speech.\u2019 It is not morning in America. We live in a dark moment and we have to confront the fact that we\u2019re in an internal sort of cold cultural civil war and we have to recognise that. Ron DeSantis, second to Trump for months but widely seen to be struggling, stood centre stage. But the rightwing Florida governor was often reduced to an onlooker as Ramaswamy threw rhetorical punches and others hit him back, making him a frequent center of the debate. Read the full report by Martin Pengelly here. In a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, 35% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they think the climate change is a major factor in the extreme heat that the US has experienced recently, compared with 85% of those who lean Democratic. Overall, nearly two-thirds of Americans who experienced extremely hot days said climate change was a major factor. Young Republican voters, however, seem increasingly concerned about the climate crisis. A 2022 Pew poll found that 73% of Republicans aged 18-39 thought climate change was an extremely/very or somewhat serious issue. Meanwhile, the rightwing groups have been working to boost the fossil fuel industry while undermining the energy transition. Project 2025, a $22m endeavor by the climate-denying thinktank the Heritage Foundation, has developed a presidential proposal that lays out how a Republican president could dismantle US climate policy within their first 180 days in office. The GOP candidates who\u2019ve held public office have already given voters a glimpse of how they might approach the climate crisis. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, has supported projects to build sea walls and improve drainage systems as Florida faces increasingly powerful hurricanes and storm surges, as well as threats from sea level rise. But he has refused to acknowledge the role of global heating on these disasters, scoffing at the \u201cpoliticization of the weather\u201d and pushing bills banning Florida cities from adopting 100% clean energy goals. He also barred the state\u2019s pension fund from considering the climate crisis when making investment decisions. Donald Trump, who did not attend the debate, has done even more to impede climate action. As president, he rolled back nearly 100 climate regulations, according a New York Times tally. Among the candidates who do support doing anything about the climate crisis, most think that thing should be carbon capture. Nikki Haley, who as US ambassador to the United Nations helped orchestrated the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement, has presented carbon capture technologies and tree planting as a way to keep burning fossil fuels while slowing the climate crisis. The consensus among climate scientists is that while such technologies could be a tool in fighting global heating, an overreliance on them could cause the world to surpass climate tipping points. Unlike in recent election cycles, most Republican presidential hopefuls this time around didn\u2019t flat out deny that the climate crisis is real. But on the Fox News debate stage, they made clear that they\u2019re not interested in dwelling on the issues \u2013 or doing much about it. On Tuesday night, the eight candidates were asked to raise their hands if they believed in the reality of human-caused global heating. They all punted. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, immediately derailed efforts to elicit a clear yes or no response. \u201cLet\u2019s have this debate,\u201d he said, before proceeding not to have it at all, instead criticising Joe Biden\u2019s response to the fires in Maui. Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur, was notably the only candidate to full-throatedly deny climate science, making the unsubstantiated claim that \u201cmore people are dying due to bad climate change policies than they are due to actual climate change\u201d. There\u2019s no discernible trend of deaths linked to policies encouraging renewable energy. However, extreme heat \u2013 fueled by the climate crisis \u2013 killed about 1,500 people last year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention records. Researchers estimate that the true figure is closer to 10,000 people every year. Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, on the other hand, said \u201cclimate change is real\u201d but then pushed off all responsibility to take care of it on India and China. Both those countries have lower per capita carbon emissions than the US. And as of the latest figures, from 2021, no country had emitted more carbon dioxide since 1850 than the US. The South Carolina senator Tim Scott didn\u2019t offer much in terms of solutions earlier, pointing a finger at the continent of Africa, as well as India and China. Africa accounts for one-fifth of the world\u2019s population and produces about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Association, while disproportionately experiencing the consequences of climate chaos. The US is responsible for about 14% of global emissions. Eight Republicans vying for the party nomination took the debate stage on Wednesday night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, throwing punches over Ukraine, a federal abortion ban and more, hoping to increase their chances at defeating the no-show frontrunner. Absent was Donald Trump, whose pre-taped interview with the rightwing media personality Tucker Carlson simultaneously published on Twitter, now known as X, and sought to siphon away screen time from the debate housed on Fox News, which famously ousted Carlson earlier this year. But Trump\u2019s presence loomed over the debate, even as candidates seemed to somewhat hold back from criticizing the ex-president, as Fox debate moderator Bret Baier put it, \u201cthe elephant not in the room\u201d. Here are eight key takeaways from the night: During the first Republican debate on Wednesday, eight candidates attempted to cast themselves as viable alternatives to Donald Trump while, for the most part, studiously ignoring the shadow of the doggedly popular former president who declined to appear on stage. The Republicans alternatively railed on government excesses \u2013 promising, for example, to slash funding for federal programs \u2013 while debating the merits of a federal abortion ban and calling for an increasingly militarized southern border. The debate was somewhat calmer without belligerent Trump, with the exception of outsider tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who clashed repeatedly with former vice-president Mike Pence, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina. Other than his increasingly aggressive approach to immigration, Ron DeSantis \u2013 meant to be Trump\u2019s most likely challenger \u2013 remained relatively passive. The debate opened with a focus on the economy, as Fox News moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum played a clip of the viral conservative folk hit Rich Men North of Richmond, in which country artist Oliver Anthony describes his economic struggles while lamenting poor people \u201cmilkin\u2019 welfare\u201d. The candidates launched into a brief discussion of the economy \u2013 the first and last point on which they appeared to entirely agree. On the war in Ukraine, the Republicans diverged sharply in their view of the ideal role of US funding for the Ukrainian military. Ramaswamy, who accused supporters of Ukraine of neglecting \u201cpeople in Maui or the south side of Chicago\u201d, drew sharp rebuke from Christie, who said that \u201cif we don\u2019t stand up to this kind of autocratic killing, we will be next\u201d, describing in vivid detail Russia\u2019s bloody occupation of Ukraine. Pence echoed Christie\u2019s position, calling Vladimir Putin a \u201cdictator\u201d. The Republicans also used the discussion of the war in Ukraine to pivot to the topic of immigration, articulating a vision of a militarized southern US border. DeSantis, whose floundering campaign has suffered repeated false steps and who largely hung back during the debate, jumped into the fold on that topic. When moderator MacCallum introduced the thorny question of abortion, which has energized Democratic voters since Roe v Wade was overturned, the candidates raced to claim their anti-abortion bona fides while splitting over the question of a federal ban. Read the full report by Alice Herman here. Donald Trump is expected to surrender at the Fulton county jail on Thursday evening on racketeering and conspiracy charges over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. The surrender itself is expected to be mundane. At the Rice Street jail north-west of downtown Atlanta, where defendants charged in Fulton county are typically taken, the booking process involves a mugshot, fingerprinting and having height and weight recorded. Trump asked his lawyers and the US secret service to get him an exemption from being photographed, according to sources, though it was not clear whether he will get special treatment. The Fulton county sheriff, Patrick Labat, has previously said Trump would be treated no differently. The other 18 co-defendants in the 2020 election subversion case appear to be receiving regular treatment based on online jail records for the former Trump election lawyer John Eastman and others, who had their height, weight and personal appearance made public. Once the booking is complete, Trump is expected to be released immediately on conditions that include stringent witness intimidation restrictions that have not been put in place for his co-defendants, court filings show, until he is due back in state court for arraignment. Some Maga fans are worried that the pro-Donald Trump rally planned for today in Georgia is an FBI setup, according to an NBC report. On both Truth Social and X, formerly known as Twitter, Trump supporters have allegedly voiced concern that undercover law enforcement officials and antifa activists were behind the protest. \u201cWatch out for the FBI and antifa/blm to stir up a riot,\u201d one user wrote. Another said: \u201cBe careful, it could be a setup just like the J6.\u201d The social media posts were highlighted by Advance Democracy, a nonpartisan research organization. A pro-Trump rally organized by the white nationalist conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer has been planned outside the Fulton county jail where Donald Trump is expected to surrender to authorities later today. Trump posted about the protest on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, which has been planned for Thursday 10am Eastern time at the jail. A Florida activist and failed political candidate who once described herself as a \u201cproud Islamophobe\u201d, Loomer received Trump\u2019s endorsement for a Republican House primary in 2020. She has been closely linked to Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist who, with the rapper Ye, controversially dined with Trump last year. Steven Sadow, who has just been added to Donald Trump\u2019s Georgia legal defense team, is an Atlanta-based attorney whose website profile describes him as a \u201cspecial counsel for white collar and high profile defense\u201d. \u201cI have been retained to represent President Trump in the Fulton County, Georgia case,\u201d said Sadow, according to ABC. The President should never have been indicted. He is innocent of all the charges brought against him. We look forward to the case being dismissed or, if necessary, an unbiased, open minded jury finding the President not guilty. Prosecutions intended to advance or serve the ambitions and careers of political opponents of the President have no place in our justice system. Donald Trump has shaken up his legal team just hours ahead of his expected surrender to authorities in Fulton county on charges over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. Drew Findling is expected to depart the team and be replaced by Steven Sadow, a veteran criminal defense lawyer, the New York Times reported. Findling has served as lead attorney for Trump as it relates to the over two-year probe by the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, into efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election results. Another attorney, Jennifer Little, is expected to remain and work with Sadow, ABC reported. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is expected to surrender at the Fulton county jail in Atlanta today on racketeering and conspiracy charges over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. \u201cI\u2019ll be going to Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday to be ARRESTED,\u201d the former US president posted on his Truth Social platform earlier this week. The date was set during negotiations between Trump\u2019s lawyers and the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, at her office on Monday. Trump became a criminal defendant in a fourth case last week when a grand jury handed up a sprawling 41-count indictment that accused Trump and 18 co-defendants of engaging in a criminal enterprise and committing election fraud in trying to reverse his 2020 defeat. He has denied wrongdoing in Georgia and in three other indictments which have produced a total of 91 criminal charges. On Wednesday, Trump shared a screenshot of a tweet promoting a protest outside the Fulton county jail ahead of his expected surrender. The rally, promoted by the far-right activist Laura Loomer, is expected to begin at 10am Eastern time with attendees encouraged to bring their Trump-related flags, hats, shirts, signs and \u201clove\u201d to support the former president. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s shadow loomed large on the first Republican primary debate stage last night in Milwaukee, as eight candidates attempted to cast themselves as viable alternatives to the former president. Despite his absence, they seemed to somewhat hold back from criticizing Trump, as Fox debate moderator Bret Baier put it, \u201cthe elephant not in the room\u201d."

            "date": "2023-08-08T00:33:56Z",
            "content": "Junta leaders in Niger have refused to let a senior US official meet the West African country\u2019s ousted president and rejected her calls to restore democracy after last month\u2019s coup. Victoria Nuland, the US acting deputy secretary of state, described \u201cfrank and difficult\u201d talks during a two-hour meeting in the Nigerien capital, Niamey, on Monday, as the rebellious commanders again refused to give in to international pressure to stand down. Nuland told reporters that she met with officers including Brig Gen Moussa Salaou Barmou, who has been named the new military chief of staff. But the junta did not respond to her requests to meet Niger\u2019s self-proclaimed new leader, Gen Abdourahamane Tiani \u2013 or the detained elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, who is under house arrest and claims he is being held hostage. \u201cThese conversations were extremely frank and at times quite difficult,\u201d Nuland told reporters by telephone as she prepared to fly out of Niamey. Her comments came as the West African bloc, Ecowas, prepares to meet on Thursday after the coup leaders ignored a deadline to reinstate Bazoum \u2013 a move the bloc had earlier warned could lead it to authorise a military intervention. Nuland described the mutinous officers as unreceptive to the US urging them to return the country to civilian rule. \u201cThis was a first conversation in which the United States was offering its good offices if there is a desire on the part of the people who are responsible for this to return to the constitutional order,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not say that we were in any way taken up on that offer.\u201d She said she also warned there would be consequences for Niger\u2019s relations with the US if the junta does not restore Bazoum or follows the path of neighbouring Mali in calling in Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenaries. \u201cI hope they will keep the door open to diplomacy. We made that proposal. We\u2019ll see,\u201d she said. She said Barmou was well acquainted with cooperation with the United States through his past involvement with special forces. \u201cThe people who have taken this action here understand very well the risks to their sovereignty when Wagner is invited in,\u201d Nuland said. Despite the international pressure, coup leaders have seemed unwilling to back down, and on Sunday night, they closed Niger\u2019s airspace until further notice, citing the threat of military intervention. \u201cIn the face of the threat of intervention that is becoming more apparent \u2026 Nigerien airspace is closed effective from today,\u201d a junta representative said in a statement on national television on Sunday evening. He said there had been a pre-deployment of forces in two central African countries in preparation for an intervention, but did not give details. \u201cNiger\u2019s armed forces and all our defence and security forces, backed by the unfailing support of our people, are ready to defend the integrity of our territory,\u201d the representative said. The coup leaders warned any attempt to violate Niger\u2019s airspace would face \u201can energetic and instant response\u201d. Ecowas defence officials agreed a possible military action plan, including when and where to strike, if Bazoum was not released and reinstated by the Sunday deadline. On Monday, an Ecowas spokesperson, Emos Lungu, said the bloc would hold an extraordinary summit to discuss Niger on Thursday at the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Abuja. However, the bloc\u2019s unity has been shattered by support for the coup leaders from the ruling juntas in Mali and Burkina Faso, both members of Ecowas, and a pledge to come to Niger\u2019s defence if necessary. The Malian army said it would send a delegation to Niamey to show solidarity and a military plane from Burkina Faso was reported to have landed in the Niger capital at about 11.20am GMT. The coup, the seventh in west and central Africa in three years, has rocked the Sahel region, one of the poorest in the world. Given its uranium and oil riches and its pivotal role in a war with Islamist militants, Niger holds great importance for the US, Europe, China and Russia. Bazoum has urged the international community to help \u201crestore constitutional order\u201d. He was democratically elected two years ago and is seen in the west as a key ally in the fight against Islamist extremists in the region. Gen Dominique Trinquand, a former French military representative at the UN, said the junta was \u201ctotally isolated\u201d. He added: \u201cNigeria, which supplies 70% of Niger\u2019s electricity, has cut the supply. All aid has been cut while Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world.\u201d On Sunday, Paris announced it was suspending its \u20ac482m (\u00a3416m) development aid programme to neighbouring Burkina Faso, which \u2013 along with Mali \u2013 has expressed its support for the junta. Last week Niger revoked military cooperation agreements with France, which has between 1,000 and 1,500 troops in the country. The bloc\u2019s military threat has triggered fears of further conflict in a region already battling the deadly Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands and forced millions to flee."

            "title": "Reese Witherspoon for president! Election, a comedy from a time when US politics was amusing",
            "date": "2023-08-29T15:00:10Z",
            "content": "Reese Witherspoon may have got her Oscar for Walk the Line but she has never been as iconic as she was in what should be considered the real highlight of her career: Election. Alexander Payne\u2019s spiky and smart 1999 movie is set at an average American high school in a town where the most defining characteristic is its banality. Nothing extraordinary is supposed to happen in Omaha, Nebraska and, in some ways, nothing did. The drama in Election is the race for school president but the real war is between well-liked teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) and high-achieving student Tracy Flick (Witherspoon). Armed with \u201cPick Flick\u201d campaign cupcakes, her Jansport backpack and an unerring belief in her bright, successful future, Tracy\u2019s unopposed pursuit of the presidency is thwarted by Jim when he eggs on Paul (Chris Klein), a sweet but dumb athlete, to run against her in the election. The battle royale is complicated further by the entry of Paul\u2019s sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), whose anarchic \u201cWho cares?\u201d platform promises to dismantle the student government. The election campaign unfolds in hilarious and bizarre beats \u2013 including a wildly funny scene involving a bee sting \u2013 and culminates in a vote-stealing scandal that is both shocking and not shocking at the same time. Election masquerades as a familiar high school comedy, but it is astute and keenly observed. Like Wag the Dog and Primary Colors, it tapped into the now almost-quaint Clintonian era of the 1990s. There was partisanship and sex scandals, but US politics still managed to amuse as well as enrage, when compared with the terrifying hellscape it morphed into. At the heart of the film is Tracy, the kind of earnest try-hard you just want to see taken down a notch, or three. When she surreptitiously discovers she won the election, the sight of her ecstatic, contorted face is forever captured and amplified in freeze frame. It remains an indelible image in cinema: Tracy, in that moment, is every person you\u2019ve ever met that struck you as just a little too ambitious, just a little too sanctimonious and just a little too annoying. Tracy is not blameless \u2013 she rails against \u201csubversive elements\u201d, she lies and stands in judgment of others. Still, it reveals a lot about our own neuroses and complexes that we pour scorn on ambitious souls like her. Why do we find their unabashed aspirations so grating? Why do we roll our eyes at the person \u2013 and it\u2019s always the same person \u2013 who volunteers every year to organise the charity morning teas? Especially if they\u2019re a woman? When you\u2019re laughing at Tracy, Payne\u2019s movie grounds you in Jim\u2019s perspective. You convict her because he convicts her. It\u2019s only later when Jim is revealed to be flawed, manipulative and a love rat that you are forced to ask yourself why you saw Tracy as the antagonist. Rewatching Election now, it\u2019s hard to ignore how those judgments about female ambition have played out in real life. When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2016, she was compared to Tracy Flick, all grown up. On that note, Witherspoon is set to reprise the role again in an Election sequel directed by Payne, which will follow the adult Tracy Flick as she battles to become the principal of a suburban high school. While you\u2019re laughing at those silly mechanical seatbelts that seem to be in every car in Omaha, or at Klein\u2019s voiceover delivery of rich kid Paul\u2019s existential crisis, Election will confront you with serious ideas about political systems, predatory behaviour and entitlement. Who gets to decide who gets to rule? Why should anyone have more say than anyone else? This biting black comedy is a microcosm of the questions that still plague institutions of power and those subjected to its inequities. It just does it with a plucky attitude.

            "content": "Emmerson Mnangagwa has a secured second term as Zimbabwe\u2019s president in a poll marred by electoral malpractice. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) declared Mnangagwa the winner, with 52.6% of the vote, beating Nelson Chamisa of the Citizens\u2019 Coalition for Change (CCC), who trailed at 44%.

Other foreign observer missions joined SADC in criticising the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) for failing to manage the polls and for the arrest of activists. \u201cWhile election day was assessed by the EU EOM (Election Observation Missions) as largely calm, the election process overall was hampered by significant issues regarding the independence and transparency of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. The ZEC missed opportunities to increase public trust in the integrity of voting and results management,\u201d the EU electoral observer, Fabio Massimo Castaldo said. On voting day, thousands of Zimbabweans waited for more than 12 hours in queues as the electoral commission failed to deliver election material on time. Mnangagwa was forced to extend voting by another day, prompting criticism from observers. The 80-year-old\u2019s party also won the parliamentary elections with 136 seats, while the CCC garnered 73 seats. Zanu-PF however failed to secure a two-thirds majority to allow the party to institute constitutional amendments, which observers feared could be used to extend presidential term limits. After five years in power, Mnangagwa has been criticised for failing to turn around the economy. Unemployment and poverty levels remain high in the country once regarded as the bread basket of southern Africa. Despite claims of a bumper harvest, nearly 3.8 million people will go hungry this year."
