            "title": "Sun belt to October surprise: US election terms explained",
            "date": "2024-10-10T14:00:14Z",
            "content": "On Tuesday 5 November, Americans will vote after one of the most surprising and chilling election campaigns in history. President Joe Biden dropped out of the race to be replaced by his vice-president, Kamala Harris, while the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, survived an assassination attempt and was embroiled in multiple criminal cases. The outcome in the world\u2019s largest economy will have far-reaching consequences \u2013 both inside the US and globally \u2013 on the climate crisis, abortion and development. Here are the terms you need to know. Ballot measures It isn\u2019t just a choice between the Democratic ticket (Kamala Harris and Tim Walz) and the Republican one (Donald Trump and JD Vance) that voters will be asked to make in November. US ballots can also include ballot measures: statewide laws, issues or questions. This year voters in 10 US states could be asked to vote on abortion law or measures. They are Missouri, Florida, Nebraska, Montana, Arizona, Nevada, Maryland, New York, South Dakota and Colorado. Down-ballot voting Measures on the ballot other than the vote for US presidential ticket are down-ballot measures, and a third or more of the roughly half of Americans who usually turn up to vote don\u2019t fill out the entire ballot, according to the US Vote Foundation. Voters do not have to vote for any down-ballot measures for their ballots to count. Electoral college The electoral college is a group of 538 people, called electors, who officially cast their votes for the US president after citizens have voted. This is a requirement outlined in the US constitution. The electors are chosen by political parties in each of the US\u2019s 50 states ahead of the election. Different states have different numbers of electoral college votes, with the number decided based on the census. The number of votes is equal to its total congressional delegation: the number of senators plus the number of representatives. While not a state, the District of Columbia \u2013 as in Washington DC \u2013 is allocated three electoral college votes. This is why the total is 538: 100 senators plus 435 representatives plus three for DC. A candidate needs more than half \u2013 or at least 270 \u2013 of the electoral college votes to win. In most states, all of the electoral college votes from the state go to the same candidate. The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, which allocate two electoral votes to the state popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district. The party that wins a state has its electors formally vote for its candidate. This happens a few weeks after the November election \u2013 and after US states have certified their election results \u2013 on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. In 2020 Donald Trump tried to remove electors in some states before the electoral college vote but the US supreme court rejected that attempt the week before. Popular vote The popular vote is the overall number of qualified voters who voted for a given candidate: in other words, the number of ballots cast for one candidate or another. The main thing to know about the popular vote is that winning it does not mean you win the presidency. The presidency is won by the candidate who gains the majority of electoral college votes. In other words: the US election is decided by races in individual states. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump received fewer votes than Hillary Clinton but still won the presidency and in 2000, George W Bush received fewer votes than Al Gore but also won. Canvassing and certification Canvassing is the process of counting ballots and tabulating results. This includes checks to ensure the results are valid, including ensuring every ballot is accounted for, and repeatedly verifying the results. Canvassing ends with certification, where the canvassing process is signed off on. In short, it is the official confirmation of the results. County election officials certify the canvass by signing a declaration that results, reported by precincts, are a complete and accurate record of every vote cast. Certification is mandatory and codified in law, meaning officials cannot refuse to certify a result, though some have refused to do so. Though the certification process has \u201clong been regarded as an administrative afterthought\u201d, according to the Associated Press, there are fears this could happen again in November. Red state, blue state, swing state A red state is a one that tends to vote Republican, a blue state one that tends to vote Democrat, and a swing state one that swings between the two major parties from one election to the next. Swing states, or battleground states, are where campaigns tend to spend the most money trying to win over undecided voters, or voters who they hope might be convinced to switch from supporting the other team to theirs. Voters in the seven swing states are likely to decide the election this year. The states, and the number of electoral college votes up for grabs, are Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), Pennsylvania (19) and Wisconsin (10). Together they account for 93 electoral college votes, or more than a third of what a candidate needs to win. Swing states are less commonly referred to as \u201ctoss-up\u201d or \u201cpurple\u201d states \u2013 the latter referring to a mix of blue and red. Blue wall, red wall The blue wall refers to 18 US states and the District of Columbia \u2013 home to Washington DC \u2013 that voted Democrat from 1992 to 2012. In 2016 Trump won by clinching three blue wall states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The red wall is less commonly used as a phrase but once referred to the states running from South Carolina to Idaho. In 2020 Time magazine referred to it as \u201cmore like a pink curtain or pink pond\u201d because it had started to break down. Rust belt The rust belt is a collection of states in the US north-east and midwest where industries such as manufacturing and coalmining have declined \u2013 or \u201cbeen left to rust\u201d. It is an economic region rather than a geographical one. Michigan, home to Detroit, once the centre of the US automotive industry, is one of these. It is generally seen as encompassing a large part of the midwest (Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin) along with Pennsylvania, West Virginia and parts of New York, according to Encyclopeda Britannicato Encyclopedia Britannica. There are three swing states in the midwestern rust belt \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 which is why it is important in any election, including this one. Winning these states is one of Kamala Harris\u2019s paths to victory \u2013 or gaining enough electoral college votes \u2013 according to analysts who modelled the pathways based on polling. The other path to victory for Harris and the Democrats is the sun belt (more on what that refers to below). According to the model, Trump would need to capture both groups of states to earn the 270 electoral college votes necessary to secure victory. The sun belt The sun belt includes 15 states extending across the southern US, from south-west to south-east, which have a sunnier or milder climate than the northern states. It includes the four swing states of Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia. The remaining three swing states are in the rust belt. Bible belt, flyover states The Bible belt is the American south and tends to be Christian and conservative \u2013 and vote Republican. It includes the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Oklahoma. The city of Tulsa in the state of Oklahoma is known as the \u201cbuckle\u201d of the Bible belt. Flyover states, or flyover country, also known as middle America, are the states at the centre of the country, between the US east and west coasts \u2013 the country\u2019s most populous areas. A third of Americans live in just four states: California, Texas, Florida and New York. Absentee ballots or mail-in voting These are votes cast by mail, or in person, depending on a state\u2019s rules, before election day. Trump has called for an end to mail-in voting. This is partly because in the 2020 election, many Americans voted by mail because of the Covid pandemic, and more Democrats than Republicans chose this option. Seven million more Democrats than Republicans voted early in the 20 states that compile party data. Provisional ballots When a voter\u2019s name does not appear on the voter registration list at the polling place at their precinct on election day, they may be given a provisional ballot, which allows them to vote but means their vote is placed in a separate \u201csecrecy envelope\u201d rather than the ballot box. The registration status of these voters is then determined. If they are registered, their vote is counted. In 2018 a voter named Crystal Mason was sentenced to five years in prison for casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election without realising she was ineligible to vote. The case was seen as part of a broader Republican effort to intimidate people from voting. Mason was acquitted in 2024. Voter suppression Voter suppression tactics are laws, measures or misinformation designed to prevent people \u2013 for example people of colour, more of whom tend to vote Democrat, according to research from Pew \u2013 from voting or registering to vote. Voting advocates in the south told the Guardian in 2023 that they felt they were playing Whac-A-Mole, trying to educate and register voters while also having to work to defeat suppressive legislation that would impose new rules on mail-in voting or limit drop boxes or require proof of citizenship to vote. The various tactics are too complicated to go into here. But Georgia is a telling example. In 2021 Georgia Republicans enacted SB 202, a bill with sweeping voting restrictions, including a ban on giving out food or water within 150ft (45.7m) of a polling place or within 25ft (7.6m) of any voter standing in a line \u2013 which could extend well beyond the 150ft radius. Violating it is a misdemeanour punishable by up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine. Georgia had seen long lines to vote and many saw the measure as an obvious attempt to make it harder for Black voters to cast a ballot. The law was darkly ridiculed in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Path to victory The path to victory refers to how a candidate wins 270 electoral college votes \u2013 rather than, for example, the most votes overall \u2013 and therefore wins the election. It involves targeting certain states \u2013 swing states and their electoral college votes \u2013 with time, money and messaging. It often involves candidates\u2019 chances in and focus on rust belt and sun belt states, which encompass the seven swing states and their all-important electoral college votes. Surrogates Campaign surrogates are individuals who speak publicly on behalf of a political candidate, typically to promote them. Think Oprah, Obama and Joe Biden for Harris, or Hulk Hogan and Nikki Haley for Trump. October surprise This is the term for a news event that happens just before the election, in other words October \u2013 because the election is always held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November \u2013 that influences the election\u2019s outcome. For example the Access Hollywood tape, or the John Podesta emails in the 2016 election."

            "title": "The US election interference row tells us this: Starmer\u2019s political compass urgently needs resetting | Martin Kettle",
            "date": "2024-10-25T05:00:11Z",
            "content": "Gordon Brown famously brought his moral compass to the prime ministership. Boris Johnson, notoriously, did not. Under Keir Starmer, there is a moral compass in Downing Street once more. But something else has gone missing. Too often, Labour now seems to lack not a moral compass, but a fully functioning political one. It has never needed one more than it does today. Recent history suggests that any government\u2019s political compass is a powerful embodiment of its survival instinct. The compass addresses the dangers, as well as the attractions, of a course of action. It recognises that the way an action will be portrayed is a reality as powerful as the intention behind it. It prioritises grip, speed and proactive flair, as well as discipline about priorities. The most recent evidence that Labour\u2019s political compass has been lost is in the unnecessary and overwrought row about its role in the US election. Here, once again, Labour has allowed its actions to be defined by its critics. As such, it fits a pattern: the failure to spot the danger in the freebies-for-ministers revelations; the tangled rise and fall of Sue Gray; the peremptory cull of winter fuel payments. With a good political compass, all of these could have been avoided. The US election row shows how easily a small fumble can become a needlessly damaging challenge. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are already running massively well-funded campaign leviathans. They don\u2019t need Labour\u2019s assistance. But a formal Labour intervention would also be foolish, potentially embarrassing for Harris, and a propaganda gift for Trump. No one in the Labour chain of command seems to have spotted the dangers. Where was Labour\u2019s political acumen when it was needed? It is not clear whether Labour Harris campaigners were given advance legal advice about the rules on foreign involvement in US elections. Labour says the volunteers have not been paid or supported in other ways. The Trump campaign alleges they may have. The now withdrawn comment on LinkedIn by Labour\u2019s head of operations Sofia Patel that \u201cwe will sort your housing\u201d could imply some party subsidy. That Patel is a full-time Labour official could arguably be read as direct Labour involvement too. But here\u2019s the point. Where were Labour\u2019s political antennae in all this? For the last few weeks, perhaps like some of you, I have been bombarded with US emails asking me to donate to the Harris campaign. And, yes, part of me wants to do so. But, as a foreign national, I would be committing a federal offence by donating, and the Harris campaign would be doing the same by accepting one. So I cheer from the sidelines and stay within the rules. It would be surprising if nobody at the Labour party stopped to ask themselves similar questions. But they should have done. That\u2019s because Labour\u2019s responsibility goes beyond not breaking any laws. It extends to the prime minister\u2019s, the party\u2019s and the country\u2019s relations with Trump if he is elected next month. Here, in particular, is where an embarrassment should have been scrupulously avoided. Many readers will be bridling at all this. They will say Nigel Farage\u2019s US campaigning is far bigger but gets far less scrutiny. Or that the rightwing press is out to discredit anything that Labour does. Or that nothing Labour may do is remotely as dangerous as the Russian or Chinese tampering with western elections. They might go further, by saying that all UK parties get involved in US politics a bit, as ex-Tory minister Robert Buckland has acknowledged, so it is wrong to single out Labour. Or that it\u2019s useful for political professionals to get a close-up view of the latest campaign techniques in other countries. Perhaps, above all, they will say that the defeat of Donald Trump is so important that it has to be our business too. Some will also point out that this row is a textbook dead-cat manoeuvre. Throw a dead cat on the table and everyone starts obsessing about the new distraction, not something really important. On Wednesday, the environment secretary Steve Reed went on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme intending to talk about the shambolic state of the water industry, but had to talk about Labour and Trump first. Substance was ousted by marginalia. There is some truth in all of these objections. But they all miss the main one. The point is that Labour is in government. The UK and the US are allies. Allies don\u2019t mess in one another\u2019s elections. If they did, the voters would be angry, legitimately so. Imagine the indignation here if a rich megalomaniac offered UK voters the kind of rewards Elon Musk is currently deploying in Pennsylvania and other swing states. It could happen, and the UK government should look at the relevant law to make sure it does not. Getting involved in any foreign election puts the national interest on the line. Sensible governments with a strong sense of self-preservation don\u2019t mess with that. Labour has rightly tried to build a relationship with Trump, as any UK government always would. It may not work \u2013 and probably will not \u2013 but the national interest requires them to try. Stumbling into a row about a few Labour volunteers is just bad politics, even though most UK citizens want Trump to lose. Labour should not have done it. It is hard to dispute in principle that Labour activists, even employees, with an interest in US politics should be able to volunteer and learn on the campaign trail. Rightly or wrongly, many Labour people are always keen to plug themselves into a Democratic party campaign. Similarly, quite a few Tories are plugged into the Republicans. You can, even so, criticise this for being too starry-eyed and naive. There\u2019s a touch of West Wing envy in the fan trek that UK politicos make across the Atlantic every four years. Yet the longer I myself worked in the US, which I did for four years, the clearer I became that the more you know about US politics, the more foreign it feels. European countries offer just as many practical lessons. But German politics or Irish politics are not glamorous. In the end, the US election involvement row, along with the other rows that preceded it, are telling Labour something that still requires corrective action. Given how obvious it was for so long that Labour would win in 2024, it has proved remarkably badly prepared for government. This needs tackling before the next avoidable stumble occurs. Starmer is now at risk of allowing himself to be defined in the long term by stumbles over short-term issues that he considers marginal. This may well be an unfair outcome, but it is a real possibility. He cannot afford much more of it. A political compass would be telling him this. Everything now depends on trusting the compass unerringly over the budget next week. It will be a defining test.

            "title": "Hurricane misinformation signals how US election lies could intensify",
            "date": "2024-10-11T11:00:51Z",
            "content": "Alex Jones, the longtime conspiracy theorist liable for millions for defaming school shooting victims, started a broadcast this week with one of his favorite topics: weather manipulation. \u201cAll right, I did a lot of research and a lot of preparation the last 30 years for what I\u2019m going to be covering today,\u201d he said. \u201cComing up, I\u2019m going to do a big presentation for everybody on what\u2019s really going on with weather weapons.\u201d Amid two hurricanes \u2013 one of which hit two swing states \u2013 formerly fringe characters like Jones contributed to a swirl of conspiracy theories, many becoming uncomfortably mainstream. The weather was being controlled, some of the theories went, to prevent Republicans from voting and fend off a Trump victory. The misinformation since Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina and Georgia and Milton hit Florida offers a test run for how election day could go \u2013 and it\u2019s not looking good. Social media sites like X, Facebook and TikTok all gave a platform to hurricane truthers and politicians who saw an opening to spread doubt and distrust of government. That distrust in some cases then led to threats and harassment against aid workers, meteorologists and government officials. The hurricanes hit at a crucial time in the US election calendar \u2013 about a month out from November\u2019s presidential contest. Because Helene hit two swing states, turnout could be affected by the storm\u2019s devastation and affected states are considering rule changes to accommodate people who may not have transportation or identification. Those changes will become fodder for allegations that the election will be rigged. \u201cThis is the singularity of rumoring: procedure change, powerful people, aid money, location changes, swing states,\u201d said Danielle Lee Tomson, the election rumor research manager at the University of Washington\u2019s Center for an Informed Public. \u201cMy bingo card is filled up.\u201d Already, many on the right, encouraged by Donald Trump, have claimed Democrats are trying to steal the election through a variety of means, none of which are proven. \u201cAdd a hurricane to that, and you have a compounded and highly opportunistic situation to jump in and create rumors or narratives or frame certain events for political gain,\u201d Tomson said. Voters in hurricane zones are likely uncertain after losing their documents, being displaced from their homes, and losing access to reliable transportation. That uncertainty creates a vacuum where rumors can grow, and people with incentives to capitalize on the uncertainty can step in and advance their political goals. They can \u2013 as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has \u2013 double down on the weather manipulation claims. They can \u2013 as Donald Trump has \u2013 falsely claim federal disaster funds have run out because it instead went toward migrants. \u201cThere are a lot of good reasons to critique aspects of Fema from an emergency management perspective,\u201d said Sarah DeYoung, a professor at the University of Delaware who studies disaster response. \u201cBut critiquing the way the system unfolds according to the National Response Framework is a little bit different than blatantly false information about funding being diverted to support illegal immigrants instead of hurricane victims.\u201d In North Carolina, the board of elections made changes to increase accessibility for people affected by the hurricane, allowing increased use of absentee ballots and dropoff options. The Trump campaign had requested improvements for access in Hurricane-ravaged areas, many of which disproportionately hold Republican voters. Still, the move immediately drew skepticism from the right. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I love or hate these late changes in the election law,\u201d Fox host Jesse Watters said in a broadcast. \u201cBut I know Marc Elias, the Democrat election lawyer who specializes in shenanigans, loves it, so that makes me a little suspicious.\u201d The Gateway Pundit, a far-right website, contributed to the doubt cast on the rule changes, headlining its story: \u201cHere We Go: North Carolina Officials Change Election Rules in Hurricane-Devastated Counties that Mostly Voted for Trump, Fueling Republican Election Integrity Concerns.\u201d The conspiracies about the hurricanes racked up massive views on social media. In one video shared on X of clouds, a woman claims \u201cthey\u2019re chemtrailing the fricking crap out of us\u201d. It got nearly 8m impressions. Another post encouraged people in Florida to ignore evacuation orders, claiming a plot was afoot to prevent Floridians from returning to their homes after the storm. \u201cThis looks a lot like a J6-style trap to invoke an insurrection and declare martial law to cancel the election,\u201d wrote the account @healthranger, which has 245,000 followers on X. Chuck Edwards, a Republican representative from North Carolina, put out a lengthy release debunking a series of rumors about Fema, search-and-rescue efforts and weather manipulation. Fema\u2019s response has had \u201cshortfalls\u201d, he said, but \u201cnobody can control the weather\u201d. \u201cI encourage you to remember that everything you see on Facebook, X, or any other social media platform is not always fact,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPlease make sure you are fact-checking what you read online with a reputable source.\u201d DeYoung, who is originally from western North Carolina, is in a lot of local disaster recovery groups on Facebook as part of her research. One of the groups, which has more than 7,000 members, was sharing information about supplies and relief areas. After a few days, it changed its cover page to say Fema was funneling money to illegal immigrants. \u201cThat\u2019s just an example of some of the challenges we\u2019re facing, because it\u2019s become hyper-partisan, which actually gets in the way of people receiving accurate information about relief, supplies, response,\u201d she said. Abbie Richards, a video producer at Media Matters for America who studied climate change conspiracies on TikTok for her master\u2019s thesis, found a host of videos on the platform that alleged Fema was confiscating resources, blocking roads or stealing donations \u2013 all false claims the agency has confronted in Helene\u2019s aftermath. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing this misinformation, they\u2019re believing it, and they feel like Fema is against them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people call for civil war, and then I\u2019ve seen explicit calls to unalive Fema personnel, or saying that Fema personnel can be arrested or shot or hanged on the spot.\u201d Election conspiracies are baked into a lot of these videos, such as the idea that Democrats are controlling the weather or the government isn\u2019t responding at the level it should because the areas affected are Republican-led, she said.The spread of misinformation and ties to the election don\u2019t bode well for how lies or rumors will unfold on election day and afterward, she said. \u201cThe infrastructure for communication via social media has grown more complicated in the last four years,\u201d Richards said. \u201cMore people are online. More people know how to make videos. More have their phones out, recording every moment. But that just adds to the sheer volume of it, and it\u2019s quite clear that the social media platforms are not prepared.\u201d Rightwing figures are using these storms not only to sow doubt, but to rally the troops against the people they allege are trying to prevent them from voting for Trump. Mike Flynn, the short-lived national security adviser under Trump who is now a far-right figure with 1.7 million followers on X, laid out the crises facing the nation: hurricanes, fires, overseas wars, censorship, \u201cfake and real declared pandemics\u201d, \u201cstolen elections\u201d. \u201cThe globalists are pulling out all the stops,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we have them right where we want them, and oh yeah, the real storm is coming. @realDonaldTrump and the tens of millions of Americans who will #MAGA.\u201d"

            "title": "Steve Bannon released from prison a week before US election",
            "date": "2024-10-29T20:07:52Z",
            "content": "Steve Bannon, the longtime Donald Trump acolyte, was released from prison on Tuesday, following a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena in an investigation of the 6 January 2021 US Capitol attack. The far-right firebrand\u2019s release from federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, comes just one week before election day. Bannon, 70, surrendered to prison on 1 July after the US supreme court rebuffed his effort to postpone this sentence pending appeal. \u201cI\u2019m not broken, I\u2019m empowered,\u201d Bannon said upon leaving the lockup at about 3.15am local time, according to the New York Times. Bannon wasted little time in resuming his position as a pro-Trump demagogue, implying that political unrest would unfold after the election. \u201cIf people think American politics has been divisive before, you haven\u2019t seen anything,\u201d Bannon said, according to reports. He also insisted that serving time behind bars was \u201c1,000%\u201d worth the price of refusing congressional testimony. \u201cIf you\u2019re not prepared to go to prison to fight for your country,\u201d Bannon said, \u201cyou\u2019re not prepared to fight for your country.\u201d Bannon was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress in July 2022. Federal prosecutors argued that Bannon thought himself \u201cabove the law\u201d in refusing to sit before the January 6 House select committee and rejecting demands for documents in his work to subvert 2020\u2019s election results \u2013 which saw Joe Biden besting Trump. The prosecution said that Bannon \u201cchose to show his contempt for Congress\u2019s authority and its processes\u201d in flouting these subpoenas. Bannon has insisted that the convictions against him were politically motivated, similar to Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claims that law enforcement actions against him stemmed from a nefarious Democratic conspiracy. David Schoen, Bannon\u2019s lawyer, claimed that this case prompted \u201cserious constitutional issues\u201d that needed to be examined by the supreme court. \u201cQuite frankly, Mr Bannon should make no apology. No American should make any apology for the manner in which Mr Bannon proceeded in this case,\u201d Schoen said. Bannon\u2019s legal team has also argued that there was a \u201cstrong public interest\u201d in permitting him to remain out on bail in advance of the 2024 US presidential elections. Hours after his release, Bannon returned to his political proselytizing, with a live War Room podcast where he peddled election conspiracy theories. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, about 12 hours after his release from prison, Bannon railed against Nancy Pelosi, the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, and Harris, again claiming that he was a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d. \u201cThe system is broken,\u201d Bannon said, claiming the justice department was \u201cweaponized\u201d to punish Trump\u2019s backers and gut his popular podcast. Bannon also insisted that he met a lot of \u201cworking-class minorities\u201d behind bars, saying he listened to, and learned from, them. They disliked Harris, Bannon said, calling the former prosecutor as the \u201cqueen of mass incarcerations\u201d. Doubling down on his War Room claims on Tuesday morning, in which Bannon insisted that prison had empowered him, he also quipped: \u201cNancy Pelosi, suck on that.\u201d Bannon also thanked the prison for providing an opportunity for him to teach civics to about 100 students, pointing out that he had Puerto Rican and Dominican pupils. Bannon discussed his work with persons of color at several points, in a seeming effort to downplay attention on anti-Latino commentary from Trump supporters. He also toyed with the idea that Democrats would try to steal the election from Trump; Biden won the 2020 election and there is no credible evidence of misconduct that undermines the legitimacy of his win. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a reprise of 2020 where they\u2019re going to do everything humanly possible to nullify\u201d Trump\u2019s victory and \u201cdelegitimize his second term\u201d, Bannon claimed. \u201cThe working-class people in this country that support Donald John Trump are not going to let that happen. \u201cThe 2020 election was stolen,\u201d Bannon also said later. During a question-and-answer session with Bannon, an apparent interloper \u2013 it appears that he is a comedian \u2013 asked \u201cwhen\u2019s the next insurrection, and can we storm the Burger King after this?\u201d This person seemed to have been escorted out of the press conference. Bannon still faces state-level charges in New York over his alleged tricking of donors who contributed to building a US-Mexico border wall. Bannon maintains his innocence; trial in this case is scheduled for December. With reporting from the Associated Press"

            "content": "Jimmy Carter, the centenarian former Democratic president, has voted in the 2024 presidential election, his representatives confirmed on Wednesday. A statement from the Carter Center did not reveal who he voted for, but it is assumed the 100-year-old, who is in hospice care, cast his ballot for the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. \u201cHe\u2019s never voted Republican in his life,\u201d his son, Chip, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution, after revealing in August that Carter\u2019s greatest wish, more than reaching his 100th birthday, was to live long enough to support her. \u201cI\u2019m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,\u201d he said at the time. At the Democratic national convention in August, just weeks before Carter\u2019s 1 October birthday, his grandson Jason, the Carter Center chair, told delegates that the former president believed Harris \u201ccarries my grandfather\u2019s legacy\u201d. The statement issued on Wednesday at lunchtime was brief: \u201cThe Carter Center can confirm that former US President Jimmy Carter voted by mail today, Oct 16, 2024. We do not have any further details to share at this time.\u201d Some media outlets earlier reported falsely that Carter, whose single term of office was 1977 to 1981, had already voted on Tuesday\u2019s first day of early voting in Georgia. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts The Journal Constitution, confirming the correct details on Wednesday, said Carter filled out his ballot and it was placed in a drop box at the Sumter county courthouse near his hometown of Plains this morning. Carter has been \u201can especially reliable voter\u201d over the years, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The newspaper said he had routinely cast ballots in general elections as well as primary runoffs and special elections. For more than a decade, he has voted exclusively by mail in elections tracked by the state, it said. According to Jason Carter, his grandfather, the 39th US president, was in August \u201cmore alert and interested in politics and the war in Gaza\u201d. He has been in hospice care since February 2023, nine months before the death of his wife, the former first lady Rosalynn Carter. The move was widely believed to be an indication that Carter was nearing the end of his life, a perception reinforced by his decision to ask Joe Biden to deliver his eulogy the following month. Biden then suggested he might have provided that information unintentionally, telling reporters: \u201cExcuse me, I shouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d before adding Carter\u2019s medical team had \u201cfound a way to keep him going for a lot longer than they anticipated\u201d. The ultimate elder statesman of US politics, Carter became the first president in history to reach 100 years old, a milestone celebrated a couple of weeks before his birthday at a star-studded party in Atlanta. \u201cNot everyone gets 100 years. But when someone does and uses that time to good, it\u2019s worth celebrating,\u201d Jason Carter, the 2014 Democratic nominee for Georgia governor, said. After losing to the Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election and leaving the White House, Carter dedicated himself to diplomacy, and was regularly provided counsel to subsequent presidents dealing with international crises. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2002 \u201cfor his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development\u201d. He founded the Carter Center in 1982 with the intention it become a leading advocate for advancing human rights globally and alleviating famine, poverty and suffering."

            "content": "Kamala Harris addressed a boisterous crowd in North Philadelphia on Sunday, promising supporters that she would win a seemingly deadlocked presidential race with just nine days left before election day. \u201cNine days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end,\u201d the vice-president told hundreds of supporters. \u201cAnd make no mistake: we will win.\u201d Echoing a message that she has hammered at every campaign stop in recent weeks, Harris framed the election as a choice between \u201ctwo extremely different visions for our nation\u201d. Harris accused Donald Trump of waging a selfish campaign of vengeance while she and her supporters work toward a better future for all Americans. \u201cWe have an opportunity before us to turn the page on the fear and the divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe have the ability to turn the page on that same old tired playbook because we are exhausted with it, and we are ready to chart a new way forward.\u201d Harris took the stage after visiting a predominantly Black church and a barbershop in western Philadelphia, underscoring how important the city will be in her electoral strategy. Harris\u2019s ability to turn out Democrats in Philadelphia will be key to winning Pennsylvania, which could serve as the tipping point state in the electoral college. \u201cThere is too much on the line, and we must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have done in these next nine days,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe election is here, and the choice, Philly, is truly in your hands. The path to victory runs right through all of the leaders who are here.\u201d Cherelle Parker, the mayor of Philadelphia, was among several prominent Democrats who introduced the vice-president at the rally. Parker, the first Black woman to serve as the city\u2019s mayor, asked attendees to remember what it felt like to see Trump win in 2016 and urged them to do everything they can to prevent that from happening again. She reminded them that Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by just 1.2 points in 2020, four years after Trump carried the state by 0.7 points. \u201cGuess what the difference was between that 2016 vote and that 2020 vote?\u201d Parker said. \u201cMore people came out to vote in the city of Philadelphia and our neighboring counties.\u201d The rally offered at least one warning sign for Harris, however. Pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted the beginning of Harris\u2019s remarks, prompting boos from fellow attendees before the demonstrators were escorted out. Harris did not shy away from addressing the protesters and instead turned her full attention to the war in Gaza, telling the crowd: \u201cWe can and we must seize this opportunity to end this war and bring the hostages home, and I will do everything in my power to meet that end.\u201d The stakes of the election came up repeatedly in conversations with attendees of the rally, with many saying they felt the weight of their responsibility as voters in a battleground state. Brenda Exon, a 60-year-old voter from Wallingford known as the \u201cPhilly Pride Lady\u201d, attended the rally wearing her \u201ctimeline to liberty\u201d apron, which tells the story of Philadelphia from the founding of Pennsylvania to the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the civil rights movement. \u201cOur Philly story is our nation\u2019s story, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for really. We don\u2019t want Donald Trump to take this away,\u201d Exon said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up on our 250th [anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence], and who should be president celebrating that in 2026? Kamala Harris.\u201d Despite the polls showing a neck-and-neck race, Harris\u2019s supporters in Philadelphia seemed confident that she would emerge victorious. Jacob Roberts, a 26-year-old voter from West Chester who has already cast his ballot for Harris, said the enthusiasm for Trump seemed dimmer in Pennsylvania this year. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot of Kamala yard signs around,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI actually just drove out to western Pennsylvania. I didn\u2019t see a lot of Trump signs on barns or anything, so I think we\u2019re looking good.\u201d Asked whether he was disappointed to miss some of the Philadelphia Eagles football game to attend Harris\u2019s rally, Roberts said it was well worth it, adding: \u201cThis is our country we\u2019re talking about.\u201d"

            "content": "The pace of US economic growth slowed over the summer but continued its two-year expansion, according to data released on Wednesday, days before millions of voters decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump is best placed to lead it forward. US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose by 2.8% in the third quarter, short of economists\u2019 expectations of 3.1%, and down from the previous quarter\u2019s 3% reading. The increase was driven primarily by consumer spending, exports and federal government spending. US policymakers scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation two years ago. The Federal Reserve rapidly increased interest rates to tamp down prices in a move that economists feared risked tipping the world\u2019s largest economy into recession. Such effects failed to materialize. \u201cDespite earlier fears that the US economy was headed for recession, growth continued to outperform,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. \u201cOverall, the US economy appears to be doing just fine.\u201d US economic growth has been surprisingly resilient under Joe Biden, with only one quarter \u2013 the first of 2022 \u2013 in decline, as the shockwaves of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to rattle the global economy. Inflation has fallen from a generational high of 9.1% in June 2020 to an annual rate of 2.4% in September, its lowest rate in over three years. But many Americans still aren\u2019t feeling it. Almost half wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Years of rising prices continue to take their toll. In a speech in Washington on Tuesday, Harris once again tried to allay voters\u2019 fears. The Democratic candidate for president promised to assist first-time homebuyers, ban price-gouging at supermarkets and cap the price of insulin. \u201cI will deliver tax cuts to working people and the middle class \u2026 I will lead in honoring the dignity of work,\u201d she said. Trump has sought to portray the Biden administration as a \u201cdestroyer\u201d of jobs, despite US employers adding millions of jobs in recent years. Harris, Biden\u2019s vice-president, has acknowledged that the cost of living remains \u201cjust too high\u201d for many, and has pledged to take action to help. The latest GDP report was released ahead of closely watched jobs data for October, out on Friday, the last employment report before the election. Economists expect the economy to have added about 125,000 new positions over the month. That figure would be a sharp drop from the 250,000 jobs added in September, when hiring unexpectedly accelerated, and will probably reflect the strike at Boeing and the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. But there are signs that the US\u2019s resilient jobs market may also shake off last month\u2019s disruptions. On Wednesday ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, said private companies hired 233,000 new workers in October, the best month for job creation since July 2023, up from 159,000 in September and far ahead of the estimated 113,000. \u201cEven amid hurricane recovery, job growth was strong in October,\u201d ADP\u2019s chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. \u201cAs we round out the year, hiring in the US is proving to be robust and broadly resilient.\u201d"

            "content": "Uruguay is heading for a tight presidential election runoff next month after a center-left candidate came out ahead of two candidates who split the conservative vote in Sunday\u2019s first round. Voters also rejected a controversial pension reform plan in one of two plebiscites. Official results showed center-left Yamand\u00fa Orsi \u2013 a two-time mayor and former history teacher \u2013 with some 1.06m votes, ahead of the ruling conservative coalition\u2019s candidate, \u00c1lvaro Delgado, who received 644,147 votes. In third place with 385,685 votes was Andr\u00e9s Ojeda, who has pledged to back Delgado. The 24 November runoff vote will take place because no candidate got more than 50% of the first-round vote. The country of just 3.4 million people is known for its generally moderate politics, without the sharp right-left divides seen elsewhere in the region. \u201cWe are going in for these 27 days,\u201d Orsi told thousands of energized supporters waving flags and setting off flares in Montevideo late on Sunday. \u201cThe Broad Front is once again the most voted party in Uruguay.\u201d Delgado also struck a confident tone, saying he had the team to win the runoff and adding that Uruguayans now faced a binary choice between the two remaining candidates. Supporters of Orsi\u2019s Broad Front were generally buoyant, but noted the second round would be a tough contest given the combined conservative vote. \u201cA return of the Broad Front would mean a new cycle of renovation, progressive proposals ensuring economic growth, with better wealth distribution,\u201d said 53-year-old Orsi backer Gabriela Balverde. Uruguayans also voted down two binding plebiscites. The key one on pension reforms would have lowered the retirement age by five years to 60 and increased payouts. The other regarded boosting police powers to fight drug-related crime. The prospect of a change to the country\u2019s $22.5bn private pension system had dragged on local markets in recent months and prompted jitters among investors and politicians. The proposal was to scrap private pension schemes and shift to a public model, which analysts say would put a bigger debt burden on the state, create legal complexities around transferring pension funds, and put Uruguay\u2019s investment-grade credit rating at risk. In Treinta y Tres, a rural region of eastern Uruguay that has traditionally voted conservative, the 60-year-old farm worker Ramon Silveira, said he had cast his ballot for the continuity candidate Delgado, favoring stability over change. \u201cI want the trend of the last five years to continue.\u201d Miguel \u00c1ngel Chirivao, 71, meanwhile, voted for Orsi\u2019s Broad Front bloc, but was concerned the victory was narrower than hoped for and that could hurt the left in the second round. \u201cThey had a poorer result than we expected,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Kamala Harris took aim at Donald Trump\u2019s energy levels as both candidates scrambled across the battleground state of Michigan, with election day looming. Harris referenced a report that the former president was \u201cexhausted,\u201d saying \u201cbeing president of the United States is probably one of the hardest jobs in the world and we really do need to ask \u2026 is he fit to do the job?\u201d Questions about Trump\u2019s energy levels emerged after he backed out of some interviews with mainstream media outlets, including 60 Minutes and CNBC. But speaking before a rally in Detroit, the Republican candidate shot back, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve gone 48 days now without a rest \u2026 I\u2019m not even tired. I\u2019m really exhilarated.\u201d With both candidates in Michigan, focus turned to the midwestern state that promises the winner 15 electoral college votes. Polling shows razor-thin margins in the state, which Trump won by 11,000 votes in 2016. In 2020, Joe Biden beat Trump by 155,000 votes. Here\u2019s what else happened on Friday: Donald Trump election news and updates Trump was back in Detroit, Michigan\u2019s largest city, for a rally that got off to a difficult start after the former president\u2019s microphone stopped working. \u201cI won\u2019t pay the bill for this stupid company that rented us this crap,\u201d he said after the audio started working. In a Fox &amp; Friends interview earlier in the day, Trump griped about negative television ads on Fox and said he would ask Rupert Murdoch to ensure such ads are not broadcast until Election Day. Trump said he would impose additional tariffs on China if China were to \u201cgo into Taiwan\u201d, the Wall Street Journal reported. \u201cI would say: if you go into Taiwan, I\u2019m sorry to do this, I\u2019m going to tax you, at 150% to 200%,\u201d the former president was quoted as saying. Asked if he would use military force against a blockade on Taiwan by China, Trump said it would not come to that because Chinese president Xi Jinping respected him. Trump has raised more money from the oil and gas industry than at this stage of his previous campaigns for the US presidency, with a surge of fossil fuel funding coming in the six months since he directly requested $1bn from oil executives and then promised he would scrap environmental rules if elected. While the Republican nominee hasn\u2019t quite managed to get to that $1bn figure, he has received $14.1m from the oil and gas industry in the period up to 31 August, donation filings show. Kamala Harris election news and updates Harris campaign in Grand Rapids, the heart of more conservative western Michigan. She is reportedly shifting the strategy of her whirlwind campaign to win over more Republicans and men of all races. In Oakland County, Harris welcomed members of the Arab American community to her rally and touted prospects for peace in the aftermath of the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Some prominent Lebanese Americans endorsed Harris, saying in a letter that the US had been \u201cunrelenting\u201d in its support for Lebanon under the Biden administration. A number of Arab Americans and Muslims are abandoning the Democratic party over the administration\u2019s support for Israel in its war with Hamas. Elsewhere on the campaign trail A new poll has revealed that more than a third of Americans agree with Trump\u2019s warning that undocumented immigrants in the US are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of America. \u201cThis is a truly alarming situation to find this kind of rhetoric, find this kind of support from one of our two major political parties,\u201d said Robert Jones, president and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute. At a campaign event in Arizona, former president Barack Obama said: \u201cI understand why people are looking to shake things up \u2026 What I cannot understand is why anyone would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you.\u201d Barack and Michelle Obama will make their first appearances alongside Harris on the campaign trail next week, aiming to provide a powerful boost in the closing weeks of the election. Harris is scheduled to appear with the former president in Georgia on 24 October and with Michelle Obama in Michigan on 26 October.

            "date": "2024-10-28T23:58:42Z",
            "content": "Thousands of Georgians have taken to the streets in the capital, Tbilisi, to rally against the results of a contested weekend parliamentary election in which the increasingly anti-western governing party was declared victorious amid reports of irregularities and voter intimidation. The demonstration outside the parliament in the city centre was organised by the country\u2019s pro-western opposition, which has refused to concede defeat and has accused the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party of election rigging. The pro-western Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, whose role is largely ceremonial, said on Sunday she did not recognise the official results and claimed the country had fallen victim to a \u201cRussian special operation\u201d aimed at pulling it back into Moscow\u2019s orbit and derailing its plan to join the European Union. \u201cThey stole your vote and tried to steal your future. But no one has the right to do that, and you will not allow it,\u201d Zourabichvili told the crowd on Monday, who waved EU and Georgian flags. She told Reuters that she believed \u201cthe methodology used and the support of most probably Russian FSB [federal security service] types is shown in this election.\u201d Russia rejected the allegations of election interference. The FSB, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, was unavailable for comment. At the protest, several opposition leaders demanded new elections, to be overseen by an international commission, and announced that their parties would not take up their seats in parliament, setting the stage for a prolonged political crisis. The country\u2019s electoral commission announced on Sunday that the increasingly authoritarian GD secured 54% of the vote, winning 89 seats in the parliament. Voters in the Caucasus country of almost 4 million people had headed to the polls on Saturday in a watershed election to decide whether GD, which has been in power since 2012 and steered the country into a conservative course away from the west and closer to Russia, should get another four-year term. The Georgian opposition contends that the ruling party has engaged in widespread election tampering, citing stark discrepancies between the initial results and an exit poll conducted by western pollsters that showed the ruling party winning only 40% of the vote. A preliminary report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said it \u201cnoted reports of intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters\u201d, calling the conduct of the election evidence of \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d in the country. The result thwarts the opposition\u2019s hopes for a united pro-western coalition of four blocs and in effect stalls the country\u2019s aspirations for EU integration. \u201cI am here because the government rigged the elections, stealing our voices and our right to choose our future,\u201d said Kato Bochorishvili, a 21-year-old economics student. \u201cWe want the world to know that we chose Europe, not Russia. I just hope the world can hear us,\u201d she said. Support for the pro-western opposition groups generally comes from urban and younger voters, who envision their political future with the EU. GD, led by the secretive billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, has made conservative and illiberal values central to its campaign, alongside saying that the pro-western opposition would pull Georgia into a conflict with Russia, similar to Ukraine\u2019s. The US and the European Union urged full investigations of the result of Saturday\u2019s election. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, criticised \u201cmisuse of public resources, vote buying, and voter intimidation\u201d, which he said \u201ccontributed to an uneven playing field\u201d. Matthew Miller, US state department spokesperson, later added that the US was in talks with European partners on what would be an appropriate body to investigate reports of violations. He added that Washington could take action if the government does not heed calls to \u201cwalk back its anti-democratic actions and return to its Euro-Atlantic path\u201d. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry condemned \u201csignificant irregularities\u201d and France also expressed concerns over \u201cirregularities observed before and during the vote\u201d, urging a full investigation. But western officials stopped short of declaring the election stolen or falsified and refrained from calling for a boycott of the results. Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesperson, said the election result was \u201cthe choice of the Georgian people\u201d and accused the west of trying to destabilise the situation. Georgia\u2019s prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, accused the opposition of attempting to \u201cshake the constitutional order\u201d, local media reported. He said his government remained committed to European integration. In a move that angered fellow EU leaders and the Georgian opposition, Viktor Orb\u00e1n landed in Tbilisi on Monday after becoming the first western leader to congratulate the ruling GD party for its \u201coverwhelming victory\u201d. Orb\u00e1n, who has recently cultivated close ties with the GD party, was spotted entering the Marriott Hotel just steps away from where the protest was taking place. It is not immediately clear where the Georgian opposition goes from here, with many in the country visibly frustrated by what they say is a lack of western support. The election results also suggest GD retains support from a core group of Georgian voters, particularly in industrial heartlands and conservative, poorer regions where economic progress has been slow and the appeal of Europe feels distant and faint. Last spring, tens of thousands of people already protested in Tbilisi to demonstrate against a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u2019\u201d bill that critics argued was designed to stifle the country\u2019s media and NGOs. But those protests gradually faded after a police crackdown and a series of arrests. Monday\u2019s demonstrations were significantly smaller, suggesting the protest movement lacks momentum. Anton Shekhovtsov, the director of the Vienna-based Centre for Democratic Integrity, said Europe\u2019s cautious response showed it did not \u201chave the spirit and consensus to openly challenge the Georgian government. Without any clear, explicit support either from the election monitoring missions or the EU, Georgians are left alone today in their fight for a European future.\u201d On Monday, some protesters appeared deflated. \u201cGeorgian Dream has already won,\u201d said Irma Khoperia, a 55-year-old artist. \u201cThey will never give up power voluntarily. They\u2019ll turn this country into a dictatorship.\u201d GD has been accused by critics at home and abroad of plans to move the country in an authoritarian direction after Ivanishvili vowed to ban all the leading opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers if his party was re-elected. Like others at the protest that night, Khoperia called on the west to sanction the GD leader and his party. \u201cWe would like the west to support us more. They should stand by our side and speak out against this vote theft,\u201d Khoperia said. Other protesters vowed to return to the streets until a new election was held. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, but I remain hopeful \u2013 otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Tekle Makashvili, a PhD student in Tbilisi. \u201cWe will keep fighting until this country is free again.\u201d"

The Mozambican civil society election observer group More Integrity said the attack happened in the Bairro da Coop neighbourhood of the capital, Maputo, killing the Podemos lawyer Elvino Dias and the party representative Paulo Guambe. \u201cThey were brutally assassinated [in a] cold-blooded murder,\u201d said Adriano Nuvunga, the director of Mozambique\u2019s Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD). \u201cThe indications [are] that around 10 to 15 bullets were shot, and they died instantly.\u201d The EU condemned the killings \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d, calling \u201cfor an immediate, thorough and transparent investigation\u201d. \u201cIn a democracy, there is no place for politically motivated killings,\u201d its diplomatic service said, adding that its election observers were still in the country assessing the ongoing electoral process. According to the latest election tally, Frelimo is leading in all 11 provinces, and its candidate, Daniel Chapo, is widely expected to win the 9 October election, but external observers have cast doubt on the poll\u2019s credibility. They noted reports of vote-buying, intimidation, inflated voter rolls in Frelimo strongholds and a lack of transparency in collation \u2013 problems that have marred most polls since Frelimo first introduced democracy in 1994 after two decades in power. Full results are expected on 24 October, but many fear Monday\u2019s protest could turn bloody. Mozambique\u2019s security forces have opened fire on political protesters in the past, including after last year\u2019s local elections and on Wednesday at a rally welcoming Mondlane to the northern city of Nampula, according to human rights groups. Mondlane captured the imagination of many younger voters who have no memory of Frelimo winning independence from Portugal in 1975 or of its victory in a civil war that cost 1 million lives between 1977 and 1992. Dias, the Podemos lawyer, had been leading legal efforts against the disputed elections, the Human Rights Watch researcher Zenaida Machado said on X. \u201cAll of those found responsible for this crime should be brought to justice,\u201d she said.

            "title": "Elon Musk is Trump\u2019s biggest cheerleader. How could he affect election results?",
            "date": "2024-10-18T11:00:23Z",
            "content": "Less than a month before the presidential election, Elon Musk has made himself a near-constant presence in the race. At a rally for Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, Musk jumps with glee wearing a custom black Maga hat. On social media, he posts AI-generated images attacking Kamala Harris. Behind the scenes, he bankrolls one of the largest pro-Trump political action committees. The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has emerged as a unique influence on the campaign in ways that set him apart from even the most politically active billionaires and tech elite. He is all at once a vocal Trump surrogate, campaign mega-donor, informal policy adviser, media influencer and prolific source of online disinformation. At the same time, he is the world\u2019s richest man and the owner of one of the United States\u2019 most influential social networks, while also operating as a government defense contractor and wielding power over critical satellite communications infrastructure. On Tuesday, Federal Election Commission filings showed that Musk donated $75m in the last three months to his pro-Trump America Pac. The group has become a major ground game operative in battleground states, and Musk is its only donor. Although the ultra-wealthy have always tried to influence politics, few people in US history have possessed the mix of immense resources and intent to use them to sway an election that Musk does. He has become symbolic of the outsize power over democracy held by the ultra-wealthy and is relishing the spotlight that his unique position has awarded him, said Larry Noble, former FEC general counsel. \u201cHe clearly likes attention,\u201d Noble said. \u201cUnlike a lot of very wealthy people who get involved in politics who want to be in the background and want to work through dark money groups so their name isn\u2019t attached to certain things, he\u2019s out there. He wants his name out there. I think he wants to be adored.\u201d Musk\u2019s X becomes a megaphone for Trump Trump and Musk have a contentious past: Musk called Trump \u201ctoo old\u201d to seek re-election in a series of tweets in 2022 and Trump referred to Musk as a \u201cbullshit artist\u201d. But the two men have become extremely intertwined during the 2024 presidential race. Musk announced his full support for Trump in July following months of telegraphing his opposition to Joe Biden and the Democratic party. In the months since, Musk has fervently committed his money and influence to the Trump campaign. The tech mogul is fond of saying this will be \u201cthe last election\u201d if Trump doesn\u2019t win. Musk\u2019s most visible Trump support takes place on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that he bought for $44bn in 2022. Musk\u2019s account has more than 200 million followers, and he has directed the company\u2019s engineers to improve visibility of his tweets \u2013 the algorithm now boosts Musk\u2019s own tweets beyond that of other users so that more people have to see them. It was Musk who made the decision to restore Trump to the social network in late 2022. As election day nears, Musk\u2019s feed has become a constant stream of praise for Trump and vitriol against Harris. A large percentage of his tweets amplify false or misleading information, and the people who Musk interacts with on the platform are often far-right accounts with a history of spreading misinformation. Musk\u2019s AI image generator, Grok, has also become one of the most prominent sources of political deepfakes that have permeated the election. Musk has used X to help the Trump campaign, not only by echoing its talking points or amplifying the president, but by preventing the spread of material that could be harmful. Reporter Ken Klippenstein published a dossier of background information on vice-presidential candidate JD Vance in early October that was obtained through a hack of the Trump campaign allegedly by Iran. The New York Times reported last week that the campaign asked X to prevent links to the published dossier from spreading there, which X followed through on, blocking links to it and suspending Klippenstein\u2019s account. The move stands in contrast to Musk\u2019s frequent proclamations about being a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d, and to the incessant attacks by Republicans on content moderation decisions made by social media platforms that they claim are akin to censorship. Suffocating the Vance dossier also ran contrary to his own stated reasons for buying Twitter. Musk had tweeted that he would ensure something like Twitter\u2019s suppression of links to the initial New York Post story of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop would never happen again. \u201cPeople like Musk, they\u2019re the ones using their money and lawfare to try and suppress real work that\u2019s just trying to contribute to the public discussion,\u201d said Callum Hood, head of research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate. Musk sued CCDH after it published research that showed hate speech and extremism had risen under Musk\u2019s ownership. He lost the case but has appealed. Musk the mega-donor While Musk has rallied online for Trump, he has committed large amounts of money to financing on-the-ground operations and media campaigns for the former president. His spending is an escalation of a yearslong, quiet funding of Republican groups that has turned him into one of the country\u2019s largest rightwing donors. Musk\u2019s America Pac, which was founded earlier this year, is currently doing get-out-the-vote work on the ground in battleground states. Musk has in effect moved his base of operations to Pennsylvania to support the effort, according to the New York Times, and he is planning a series of events in the state following his appearance at a Trump rally there earlier this month. \u201cThat is what will decide this election, especially in Pennsylvania,\u201d Musk said at the rally in Butler. \u201cAnd honestly, you want to just be a pest. Just be a pest to everyone you know, people on the street, everywhere. Vote, vote, vote. Fight, fight, fight. Vote, vote, vote.\u201d The money is not only flowing to get-out-the-vote initiatives, though. Musk has donated to the conservative group Building America\u2019s Future, which has set up cash awards for people who bring the group evidence of election fraud. Building America\u2019s Future has also funneled money to a Super Pac that HuffPost reported has run targeted ads calling Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, \u201cAmerica\u2019s pro-Israel power couple\u201d in areas of Michigan with large numbers of Arab and Muslim voters. The Pac is simultaneously running ads aimed at Jewish voters in Pennsylvania that accuse Harris of being too pro-Palestinian. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts Musk is different from other wealthy donors in recent decades who have divided their political engagement into two styles, according to Benjamin Soskis, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute who is an expert in the history of philanthropy. One is to craft a non-partisan identity and work with people in both parties, for either strategic or personal reasons. The best example of that: Bill Gates. The other is to engage directly with partisan politics, but with a level of discretion, like the Koch brothers or George Soros. Musk falls into his own category, working in a highly partisan fashion but with virtually no discretion. He\u2019s displaying \u201ca kind of gleeful embrace of partisanship\u201d, Soskis said, embodying a style of politics that feels similar to Trump. \u201cThat feels unusual for the wealthiest individuals \u2013 the complete eschewal of discretion as a mode of political engagement,\u201d Soskis said. \u201cThat seems new.\u201d A plan to gut regulators If Trump and Musk occasionally seem like an odd pair on paper \u2013 Trump has threatened to remove an electric vehicle tax credit, while Musk is CEO of perhaps the world\u2019s most famous EV company \u2013 one point of alignment is a vehement dislike for regulators. Musk\u2019s longstanding battles with government offices like the Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Aviation Administration could shift in his favor under a Trump administration that is likely to drastically cut their resources and weaken their authority. \u201cI suspect on some level that this is just a pocketbook issue for him, that he also wants lower taxes,\u201d Noble, the former FEC counsel, said. \u201cHe wants to have his companies freed from safety regulations.\u201d Over the past several years Musk has faced investigations, fines and delays over public safety concerns on a range of his projects. The FAA alleged last month that Musk\u2019s SpaceX broke launch safety protocols, and over the years has grounded the company multiple times for violating regulations. California officials last week cited Musk\u2019s politics and falsehoods as they voted against a SpaceX plan to conduct launches in the state. Musk sued in response. The EPA has also launched investigations into SpaceX for complaints that it is dumping unsafe amounts of wastewater into the ecosystem, while the FDA has cited Musk\u2019s Neuralink brain implant company for animal welfare issues. Tesla\u2019s attempts at developing fully autonomous cars have also come under scrutiny, presenting complications for a company that has staked its future on the ability to produce a self-driving robotaxi. Tesla is facing additional investigations from federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission over its self-driving car claims, and earlier this year came under investigation from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration related to a recall of its autopilot function. These constant fights with the full alphabet of regulatory agencies has coincided with Musk making numerous public statements in favor of deregulation, as well as calling for a full-scale audit of the federal government. That idea has found purchase with Trump, who announced in September that he would launch a Musk-led government efficiency commission that would audit federal agencies for places to cut. Musk wants to call it the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, invoking one of his favorite memes, an expressive shiba inu. Although the plan is vague on details and fails to address the obvious conflict of interest in Musk auditing the regulators that oversee his companies, both Trump and Musk have repeatedly brought up the idea of Musk holding some role in a potential Trump administration. During an appearance on Fox News earlier this week, Trump said he would create a new position called \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d and appoint Musk. \u201cHe\u2019s dying to do this,\u201d Trump said. Musk\u2019s Maga support goes beyond business Musk\u2019s public rightward shift is an extension of years of allying himself with rightwing leaders around the world. In recent years, Musk has cozied up to nationalist and nativist politicians including Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Salvini, Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu and India\u2019s Narendra Modi. Some of these relationships have appeared to be in service of Musk\u2019s business interests. He has forged a friendship with Argentina\u2019s anti-regulation, far-right president, Javier Milei, who he brought on a personal tour of Tesla\u2019s Texas headquarters and repeatedly endorsed on X. Argentina, meanwhile, has some of the world\u2019s largest reserves of lithium, a key mineral used in electric vehicle batteries and one that Musk has previously demanded be processed in increasing quantities. Musk\u2019s business empire is at risk when his relationships with governments sour, as evidenced during his recent conflict with Brazilian authorities that resulted in a judge banning access to X in the country. Musk ultimately capitulated to comply with local laws. But Musk\u2019s promotion of far-right beliefs and support for Trump have also taken on a personal dimension that goes beyond business calculations. Musk\u2019s rhetoric on X has fixated on conservative grievances and he has amplified racist and antisemitic narratives through his tweets. Anti-immigration and anti-trans views have become a frequent talking point. One of his 12 children is a trans woman, and Musk claims he was \u201ctricked into\u201d signing off on her medical treatment and that he \u201clost\u201d his child in the process. He has since vowed to defeat what he calls the \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d. This increasingly overt radicalization of Musk\u2019s social and political views appears unlikely to abate following the campaign, leaving questions of how he may influence the country\u2019s politics when the election ends regardless of its outcome. After the January 6 insurrection, Twitter, under its previous ownership, permanently suspended Trump\u2019s account \u201cdue to the risk of further incitement of violence\u201d. Under Musk, the tweets that got Trump banned seem quaint \u2013 and Trump is now back on the platform, as are a host of frequent superspreaders of election lies. A big test awaits Musk if Trump loses, something he joked would land him in either legal or bodily trouble with Democrats. Will he accept a loss? Or would he use X to keep spreading conspiracies he\u2019s already promoted - that mail ballots are \u201ctoo risky\u201d or that non-citizens are swaying US elections, two of Trump\u2019s pet election issues. X, under Musk, \u201cis building now, as we speak, another fresh stolen election narrative, and we all know what the consequences could be\u201d, Hood said."

            "date": "2024-10-27T18:48:49Z",
            "content": "Georgia\u2019s pro-western opposition has called on the country to protest on Monday against the disputed parliamentary victory of the ruling, Russia-aligned Georgian Dream (GD) party. GD retained power in Saturday\u2019s pivotal election that dealt a significant blow to the country\u2019s long-held aspirations for EU membership, amid allegations of voter intimidation and coercion. The opposition refused to concede defeat and accused the ruling party of a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d, setting the stage for a potential political crisis that could further polarise the Caucasus country. At a press conference organised by the opposition on Sunday evening, Georgia\u2019s pro-EU president, Salome Zourabichvili, declared that she did not recognise the election results and asserted that the country had fallen victim to a \u201cRussian special operation\u201d. Zourabichvili, whose role is largely ceremonial, called on Georgians to protest against the results on Monday evening. \u201cThis was a total rigging, a total robbery of your votes,\u201d she said. The electoral commission announced on Sunday that GD secured 54% of the vote, winning 89 seats in the parliament \u2013 one fewer than in 2020. Four pro-western opposition parties collectively won a total of 61 seats. The result thwarts the opposition\u2019s hopes for a pro-western coalition of four blocs and in effect stalls the country\u2019s aspirations for EU integration. Voters in the country of almost 4 million people had headed to the polls on Saturday in a watershed election to decide whether the increasingly authoritarian GD, which has been in power since 2012 and steered the country into a conservative course away from the west and closer to Russia, should get another four-year term. Bidzina Ivanishvili, the shadowy billionaire founder of GD, claimed victory shortly after polls closed in what has been called the most consequential election since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. \u201cIt is a rare case in the world that the same party achieves such success in such a difficult situation \u2013 this is a good indicator of the talent of the Georgian people,\u201d said Ivanishvili, widely considered to be the country\u2019s most powerful figure. For the past three decades, Georgia has maintained strong pro-western aspirations, with polls showing up to 80% of its people favour joining the EU. In recent years, however, the government has increasingly shifted away from the west in favour of Russia, showing reluctance to condemn Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. An international observer mission on Sunday said the conduct of the election was evidence of \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d in the country. A preliminary report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said it \u201cnoted reports of intimidation, coercion and pressure on voters, particularly on public sector employees and other groups, raising concerns about the ability of some voters to cast their vote without fear of retribution\u201d. However, it stopped short of saying the elections had been stolen or falsified \u2013 a claim the opposition reiterated on Sunday. On Saturday morning, several videos circulated online appearing to show ballot stuffing and voter intimidation at various polling stations across Georgia. Electoral commission data showed GD winning by suspiciously big margins of up to 90% in some rural areas, though it underperformed in bigger cities. Western officials have expressed concern over reports of election fraud, though they too have used cautious language and refrained from calling for a boycott of the results. The European Council president, Charles Michel, on Sunday pushed for a swift and transparent investigation into alleged irregularities during the election. US secretary of state Antony Blinken joined calls from observers for a full probe into reports of election-related violations. \u201cGoing forward, we encourage Georgia\u2019s political leaders to respect the rule of law, repeal legislation that undermines fundamental freedoms, and address deficiencies in the electoral process together,\u201d Blinken said in a statement. It remains unclear if the opposition will be able to galvanise enough support in the coming days. Last spring, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Tbilisi to protest a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that critics argued was designed to stifle the country\u2019s media and NGOs. Those protests gradually faded after a police crackdown and a series of arrests. The election result suggests GD retains support from a core group of Georgian voters, particularly in industrial heartlands and conservative, poorer regions where economic progress has been slow and the appeal of Europe feels distant and faint. GD received congratulations from several foreign leaders including Hungary\u2019s hard-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, a longtime ally of Ivanishvili, who is scheduled to visit Tbilisi on Tuesday. GD has been accused by critics at home and abroad of plans to move the country in an authoritarian direction after Ivanishvili vowed to ban all the leading opposition parties and remove opposition lawmakers if his party was re-elected. The party was facing an unprecedented union of four pro-western opposition forces that had vowed to form a coalition government to oust it from power and put Georgia back on track to join the EU. The biggest opposition force is the centre-right UNM, a party founded by Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president who is in prison on charges of abuse of power that his allies say are politically motivated. From jail, Saakashvili called on Georgians to take the streets. In the aftermath of the elections, voters in Tbilisi seemed divided over the country\u2019s future course. Ana Machaidze, a 25-year-old student, said: \u201cWe have lost our country today. I don\u2019t know what to do next. I hope we can take to the streets, but if we lose, maybe I will live abroad.\u201d Support for the pro-western opposition groups generally came from urban and younger voters, who envision their political future with the EU. Irakli Shengelia, 56, a restaurant worker, said he was glad GD would remain in power because the party guaranteed \u201cpeace and stability\u201d with Russia. The government, aligned with the deeply conservative and influential Orthodox church, has sought to galvanise anti-liberal sentiments by campaigning on \u201cfamily values\u201d and criticising what it portrays as western excesses. In the summer, the parliament passed legislation imposing sweeping restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights \u2013 a move that critics say mirrored laws enacted in neighbouring Russia, where authorities have implemented a series of repressive measures against sexual minorities. In Russia, the election results were widely welcomed. As the results trickled in, state propaganda celebrated the outcome, with Margarita Simonyan, the influential editor-in-chief of the state media outlet RT, declaring that \u201cthe Georgians had won\u201d."

            "date": "2024-10-30T08:00:03Z",
            "content": "\u201cBorrowed from the excellent http://twtd.co.uk, Ipswich\u2019s nine results so far this season form a mirror image/palindrome (0-2, 1-4, 2-2, 1-1, 0-0, 1-1, 2-2, 1-4, 0-2 seeing as you ask). Longer/longest streaks please!\u201d tweets Nigel Smith. Ipswich\u2019s palindrome went pop when they lost 4-3 to Brentford at the weekend, unless they have an even longer one in mind and are going to lose 4-3 to Leicester on Saturday. The nine-match streak they inadvertently put together isn\u2019t quite a record for the top four divisions in England. We know this because of Chris Roe\u2019s Magic Database\u2122. First up, Torquay United, who had a 10-game sequence in March and April 2014: 2-1, 0-1, 2-1, 0-1, 0-1, 0-1, 0-1, 2-1, 0-1, 2-1. Torquay broke the sequence by winning 3-1 at Mansfield (the Palindrome Pools Panel had them losing 1-0) in their penultimate League Two game of the season. But it was a futile victory: results elsewhere meant they were relegated to the Conference. They haven\u2019t been a Football League team since. Portsmouth are top of this very, very, very niche list with an 11-game sequence during the 1975-76 Division Two season: 0-1, 0-2, 1-3, 1-0, 0-1, 3-1, 0-1, 1-0, 1-3, 0-2, 0-1. Unsurprisingly this symmetry wasn\u2019t headline news, overshadowed as it was by the fact eight of the 11 games were defeats. Like Torquay, Portsmouth finished bottom of the table come May. When you consider Ipswich\u2019s current predicament, maybe palindromic results aren\u2019t a good idea. Pitch battles, part two In last week\u2019s Knowledge we looked at clubs who deliberately changed pitch conditions to maximise home advantage. There\u2019s more, most of it involving deliberate waterlogging. Welcome to the world of shitH\u2082Ousery. Many of you mentioned the famous friendly between Wolves and Honved in 1954, when Wolves won 3-2 and were proclaimed \u201cchampions of the world\u201d by the Daily Mail. Honved, whose side included six of the Hungarian team that had humiliated England at Wembley a year earlier, were 2-0 up and in control at half-time. At this point the Wolves manager, Stan Cullis, instructed a number of apprentices (including a young Ron Atkinson) to water an already rain-sodden pitch. Cullis wanted the pitch to be \u201cnice and heavy\u201d to stymie Honved\u2019s passing game. \u201cHonved slowly but surely began to get bogged down in the increasing mud and Wolves with their characteristic long-ball style gradually began to grind down the Hungarians,\u201d said Atkinson years later. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that, had Cullis not ordered me and my mates to water the pitch, Honved would have won by about 10-0.\u201d You can read more in this piece from the archive. Brian Clough wanted his teams to play like Honved \u2013 no grass in the sky and all that \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t averse to an occasional bit of pragmatism. When Derby were drawn against Benfica in the 1972-73 European Cup, Clough ensured the first leg was played on a Baseball Ground bog. \u201cA team stuffed with famous Portuguese internationals, including the legendary Eusebio, skidded and floundered in the mud and soot from Leys foundry next door and the Rams won 3-0,\u201d remembers Paul Whitehead. Paul\u2019s memory is that Clough had the groundsman do the deed, but we really, really want this email from Andrew Carter to be true. \u201cBrian Clough turned the hosepipes on to the pitch then accidentally fell asleep, awaking to find the pitch resembling a bog,\u201d writes Andrew. \u201cAfter Derby had won 3-0, the then head of Uefa, Sir Stanley Rous, asked Clough how it was that so much rain had fallen in Derby, when none had fallen in the vicinity of his nearby hotel. Clough explained it was a feature of the Derbyshire weather that when some areas received torrential downpours, it wasn\u2019t unusual for surrounding locations to escape the rain altogether.\u201d Derby reached the semi-finals of the European Cup that season before losing to Juventus, but that\u2019s another story. A couple more before we move on. Neil Johnston reminds us that Southampton installed triangular blocks on the touchline to stop West Brom utilising long throws during last season\u2019s playoff semi-final. But it\u2019s only fitting that we end with John Beck, whose soggy antics at Cambridge kicked off last week\u2019s answer. \u201cWhen he arrived at my club, Preston, he couldn\u2019t grow the grass long in the corner of the pitches due to North End having a plastic pitch,\u201d begins Mark Cassidy. \u201cUndeterred, John instructed the ground staff to dump sand in each corner to slow the ball up. He also amended our home kit, by gaining the Football League\u2019s consent for the players to wear blue tracksuit bottoms instead of shorts, so as to encourage them to slide-tackle on the abrasive surface.\u201d Loaned-in captains \u201cWhile on loan at Peterborough from Rotherham last season, Peter Kioso was made club captain,\u201d mails Cameron McGlone. \u201cIs this a common occurrence? What other examples are there of players being made captain (permanently, not just for a game) while on loan?\u201d When the centre-back James McPake joined Hibernian on loan from Coventry in 2011-12, he was made captain for his debut against Rangers. Can you possibly guess what happened next? Yep, McPake was sent off after receiving two yellow cards. Maybe it was a tribute to Graeme Souness, who was famously sent off on his debut as Rangers player-manager when he nobbled the wrong Hibs mullet. McPake kept the armband when he returned from suspension and joined Hibs on a permanent deal in the summer. These players also captained their teams while on loan. As far we\u2019re aware, none of them were sent off on debut. Heurelho Gomes (Hoffenheim on loan from Spurs, 2012-13) Marco van Ginkel (PSV Eindhoven on loan from Chelsea, 2017-18) Liam Bridcutt (Lincoln on loan from Leeds, 2019-20) Knowledge archive \u201cWhile procrastinating this morning, I came across Ivorian striker Serge Dji\u00e9houa,\u201d wrote Christopher Harding in 2016. \u201cThis itinerant big man up front appears to be among the frontrunners for fastest-ever sending off, after just seven seconds on the pitch. Not only that, but those seven seconds seem to be the only seconds he ever played for his club at the time, Glyfada. Has there ever been a shorter on-field career with any given club? Obviously only counting players who have in fact made an appearance.\u201d We\u2019ve tackled the fastest red cards in football, plus the fastest debut sendings off, so it\u2019s well worth us getting on to this. \u201cIn the Arsenal v Manchester United game from 22 August 1999,\u201d writes Tom Solan of one of the first matches the Guardian ever did with minute-by-minute commentary, \u201cRaimond van der Gouw got injured right at the end of injury time when he was kneed in the face by Martin Keown. After a long delay while he was treated by the physios (where the Sky Sports clock reached more than 100 minutes) the Dutchman was replaced by Nick Culkin for his United debut. \u201cAs soon as Culkin took the resulting free-kick, the referee blew the full-time whistle, meaning the young goalkeeper\u2019s debut was over after little more than a second. He never played for United again.\u201d You can see Culkin\u2019s Manchester United career here. Culkin went on to play for QPR, Radcliffe Borough, Prescot Cables and FC United of Manchester. Can you help? \u201cEngland Under-21 winger and Bologna player Samuel Iling-Junior received rapturous applause from the home crowd, when he came on as a substitute at Villa Park last week\u201d writes Ian Clover. \u201cWhy?

            "date": "2024-10-24T10:00:08Z",
            "content": "College students formed a steady line outside a campus art museum to vote early on Tuesday at a pop-up polling place at the University of Minnesota. The one-day site, enabled by new state laws that allow for pop-up early voting, helps populations like student voters, who may not have access to transportation to get off campus, easily access the polls. \u201cWe brought the polls to them,\u201d said Riley Hetland, a sophomore and undergraduate student government civic engagement director, who helped plan the event. Hetland said the group has been going to classrooms and hosting tables around campus for weeks to get people registered to vote and help them make a plan to cast ballots. So far, they have gotten 12,000 students to pledge to vote, double their goal of 6,000, a sign of the enthusiasm young people have to perform their civic duty in the presidential election, she said. More than 600 people voted during the seven hours the pop-up site was open on Tuesday, organizers said. Across the country, college campuses and campaigns have ramped up efforts to register and energize college voters, especially in critical swing states. The Democratic party is counting on high turnout on college campuses, which tend to lean Democratic.. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign on Wednesday announced it was launching an early voting push targeting students on campuses in battleground states, including a seven-figure ad buy to primarily target students on social media. College campuses are also organizing their own get-out-thevote efforts. At the University of California Berkeley, hundreds of students came together recently for an event called Votechella, which featured music and on-site voter registration, the state university system said. The name is a nod to Coachella, the popular music festival held annually in southern California. At the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, students have reacted positively to outreach efforts on campus, where a second voting hub opened on Monday, according to CBS News. Nevaeh McVey, a student, told CBS: \u201cI come from a place where I wasn\u2019t really educated about how to vote or who to vote for, and I think getting the younger population to vote is extremely important in times like these. I just think [this initiative] makes it really easy and accessible for us students to do.\u201d The push to mobilize young voters comes as some students are facing challenges in casting their ballot. Leaders of some Republican-controlled states have worked to limit student voting, writing legislation to limit the use of student identification cards as an ID at polls and shuttering on-campus polling precincts. Proponents of these measures claim that they are necessary to prevent voter fraud, while others have railed that voting is too easy for university students. The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin has urged the US justice department to investigate text messages they believe targeted young people to dissuade them from voting. The organization received complaints from voters who received a text that read: \u201cWARNING: Violating WI Statutes 12.13 &amp; 6.18 may result in fines up to $10,000 or 3.5 years in prison. Don\u2019t vote in a state where you\u2019re not eligible.\u201d College students could prove integral in tipping swing states, as they are traditionally permitted to vote either in their home state or where they attend school. Some students have registered in the state where they believe their vote might have the most impact. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen dozens of elections up and down the ballot over the course of the last few years that have been decided by as close as one vote,\u201d Clarissa Unger, co-founder and executive director of Students Learn Students Vote Coalition, told ABC News. \u201cEvery single college student\u2019s vote can be consequential.\u201d Throughout the day on Tuesday, the line for the pop-up site in Minnesota held dozens of people who passed by between classes, came to campus specifically for the voting site or walked over from their dorms. A 30ft inflatable eagle helped set a fun atmosphere for voting \u2013 and the free pizza didn\u2019t hurt. There are election day polling places on campus, but the pop-up site is the only on-campus early voting opportunity. And it doesn\u2019t require voters to live in any specific precinct \u2013 any Minneapolis voter could cast a ballot there on Tuesday. Joslyn Blass, a senior and undergraduate student government director of government and legislative affairs, said the group has pushed for early voting because there could be various obstacles \u2013 like an exam or getting sick \u2013 that can get in the way of voting solely on 5 November. \u201cWe really prioritize the early voting site, just because you never know what\u2019s gonna happen,\u201d she said. Madelyn Ekstrand finished her class for the day and waited about an hour to cast her ballot. The 21-year-old senior said abortion access and the climate crisis were important to her, so she was voting for Harris. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see people my age getting out and voting and being proactive and not waiting till the last second,\u201d she said."

            "content": "Donald Trump has been working tirelessly to win over male voters and by some measures his efforts appear effective, but it may have come at the cost of female support. According to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll, Trump is besting Kamala Harris among men by 53% to 37%, while the Democratic candidate is winning among women 53% to 36%. But despite multiple polls showing the gender gap among voters widening to historic levels, Harris has said she doesn\u2019t see the phenomenon borne out at her rallies. \u201cWhat I am seeing is in equal measure, men and women talking about their concerns about the future of our democracy.\u201d Both Harris and her Republican challenger spent the past day at rallies across battleground states. With only days to go until the election, a poll from Bloomberg News and Morning Consult finds that the 2024 presidential race is still too close to call. Here\u2019s what else happened on Thursday: Kamala Harris election news Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama appeared alongside Harris at a star-studded campaign event in Clarkston, Georgia. The event launched the Democratic campaign\u2019s series of battleground state concerts. The actor Samuel L Jackson, director Spike Lee, senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, and actor Tyler Perry also spoke at the rally. About 20,000 people attended the Georgia event, according to the Harris campaign, which would make it her largest political rally yet. Bruce Springsteen urged voters to back Harris in the presidential election, warning that Trump is a would-be \u201ctyrant\u201d. Early voting totals have been breaking records in Georgia, with about 30% of the electorate having already cast ballots. Beyonc\u00e9 will reportedly join Harris at her rally in Houston on Friday, continuing the celebrity pile-in. Harris is rallying in Texas, a Republican stronghold, to highlight abortion rights and support the Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred, who trails the Republican Ted Cruz in opinion polls. Harris picked up the endorsement of two Republicans: one a former congressman from Michigan, the other a mayor in a pivotal county in Wisconsin. The former congressman Fred Upton said Trump was \u201ctotally unhinged\u201d, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t need this chaos. We need to move forward, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m where I am.\u201d Donald Trump election news Trump said he would order the immediate firing of the special counsel Jack Smith if he were re-elected in the clearest expression of his intent to shut down the two criminal cases brought against him. The power to fire the special counsel formally rests with the attorney general, but Trump has made no secret of his intention to appoint a loyalist in that role. Trump, campaigning in the border swing state of Arizona, called the country a \u201cgarbage can\u201d because of immigration policies under the Biden administration. He laid out a host of policies including invoking the death penalty for any migrant who kills an American citizen and hiring 10,000 more border agents and increasing their pay. Later, Trump appeared at another rally organised by the conservative group Turning Point Action in Nevada. The United for Change event in Las Vegas drew thousands of supporters. The group, founded by conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk to engage young conservatives, has been working to help turn out voters on Trump\u2019s behalf. Elsewhere on the campaign trail Mail-in ballots have been damaged after a man set fire to a postal collection box in Arizona. Phoenix police arrested Dieter Klofkorn, who admitted to the crime and said his actions were not politically motivated. Elon Musk gave another $44m to his pro-Donald Trump spending group during the first half of October, federal disclosures showed. The contributions, disclosed in a filing to the Federal Election Commission by Musk\u2019s America PAC group, come after a prior report showed he gave the group around $75m over three months between July and September.

            "content": "Most gamblers might want to sit out the US election. It\u2019s too close to call with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck and neck, according to official polls. But the former president\u2019s campaign has latched on to signs he says prove he\u2019s actually \u201cleading\u201d. In a close race, Trump and his allies claim some \u201cgambling polls\u201d, as he described them last week, put him significantly ahead of Harris. \u201cLike, 65 to 35, or something like that.\u201d The irony of touting an apparent lead in betting markets at a Believers and Ballots campaign event in Georgia aimed at Christian voters was not lost on Trump. \u201cBut nobody here gambles,\u201d he continued. \u201cDoes anybody here gamble? No, no, no, no. Great Christians don\u2019t gamble, do they? Oh no.\u201d The \u201cgambling polls\u201d Trump cited are forecasts generated by several election betting platforms, which put his chances of regaining the White House markedly ahead of his Democratic rival\u2019s. With many questioning the accuracy of political polling, supporters including Elon Musk, have started to claim such estimates are more accurate. As of Wednesday, Polymarket, one leading service, put Trump\u2019s chances of winning back the presidency at about 67%, with Harris at 33%. Another, Kalshi, put Trump at 62% and Harris at 38%. And while Trump\u2019s audience last Tuesday was not interested in gambling on the result of the presidential election, many others appear to be getting involved. High-profile legal battles, promotion by the likes of Musk and Trump, and growing media coverage, have helped propel the activity into the spotlight as the campaign gathered steam. Interest around betting on this election is \u201corders of magnitude larger\u201d than previous ballots, according to Thomas Gruca, a professor of marketing at the University of Iowa, and director of Iowa Electronic Markets, an election-focused futures market first established in 1988. America\u2019s gambling boom, led by the legalization of sports betting, \u201chas increased the number of people who like to throw away their money on things they don\u2019t understand\u201d, said Gruca. \u201cPeople think, \u2018I picked the Raiders-Jets game, therefore, I can pick a president.\u2019\u201d He also pointed to opinion polling errors at previous elections, and how many polls this time around suggest the contest is extremely tight. \u201cI haven\u2019t looked at the polls in the last 15 minutes, so I don\u2019t know who\u2019s winning. In previous years there was a lot of clarity.\u201d In the magazines and newspapers section of Apple\u2019s iPhone store, Polymarket has reigned supreme in the top spot, leaving the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and, yes, the Guardian, in its wake. Another platform, Kalshi, has likewise surged up the store\u2019s chart of financial apps. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that these markets have been becoming more popular as trust in the media has been declining,\u201d said Harry Crane, a professor of statistics at Rutgers University. \u201cThe public wants information and is looking for sources of information it can trust.\u201d Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts Should you have turned to, say, Polymarket, on Wednesday and bet on Trump, you would receive $1 for every 67 cents you wagered if he wins the election. If you bet on Harris, on the same platform, on the same day, you would receive $1 for every 33 cents wagered if she wins. These bets are bids on political futures contracts. Buying a contract drives its price \u2013 or the perceived probability of it happening \u2013 higher. This ecosystem spans far beyond the race for the White House. Other markets on Kalshi include the margin of victory in the Senate, which state will have the closest presidential election result and what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates two days after the election. But how reliable are the headline figures? \u201cI think you should take them seriously,\u201d said Grant Ferguson, political scientist at Texas Christian University. \u201cThe people who bet on these markets largely think they know more than the average person as to how things are going.\u201d Leading platforms put Hillary Clinton ahead on election day in 2016 (she did win the popular vote if not the presidency), and Joe Biden in the lead in 2020, \u201cbut by less than the polling, in both cases\u201d, said Ferguson. 2024 will be the biggest test of these predictions so far. \u201cBroadly these markets are actually quite efficient \u2013 particularly they\u2019re quite good at things that are 50:50, 60:40,\u201d said Eric Zitzewitz, professor of economics at Dartmouth College. \u201cIn the sort of circumstance we\u2019re in right now ... I take that pretty seriously.\u201d Provided a market is run \u201cefficiently, or with good rules, the prices before the event happens will reflect what the smart people think, and not just random people\u201d, suggested Gruca. The Iowa Electronic Markets allows participants to bet up to $500 on a given contract, and PredictIt, run out of Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, has a $850 limit. But other platforms do not have such tight restrictions, and big bets may have moved the odds in Trump\u2019s favor. Polymarket, which did not respond to requests for an interview, confirmed last week that one person \u2013 a French national \u2013 was behind four accounts which had placed bets on Trump worth around $28m, but insisted to the New York Times this was \u201cbased on personal views\u201d, rather than an attempt to manipulate the market. \u201cWithout limits,\u201d said Gruca, \u201cyou can have prices move away from what they should be.\u201d If one person tries to tilt the odds toward their favored candidate, those betting would quickly back the other if their odds slipped too low, Ferguson suggested. \u201cDoes it probably happen? Yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not real worried about it.\u201d There is a small, but significant, difference in the question at the heart of election surveys, and election bets. While poll respondents are indicating which candidate they want to win, those gambling on the contest are saying who they think will. Veterans of the space like to say that polling participants focus on their heart, and bettors use their head. The betting markets \u201care asking the more relevant question\u201d, argued Crane. \u201cThe polling information is in the markets. The people who are in the markets know what the polls are, but they have other information.\u201d Regulators are not happy. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which fined Polymarket $1.4m in 2022 and ordered it to exclude US users as part of a settlement, has tried to shut down PredictIt and Kalshi. But Kalshi was recently cleared to take US bets on election outcomes, when a federal appeals court ruled that the CFTC had failed to show how the agency or public interest would be harmed by its event contracts. While the CFTC is appealing, the legal breakthrough appears to have set the stage for a further increase in bets placed on who will prevail in the presidential campaign \u2013 by both individual betters, and large institutions. Polymarket is also scrutinizing activity on its platform to ensure users are outside the US, amid reports of domestic usage. \u201cThe markets are only as smart as the people trading in them,\u201d said Gruca. \u201cIf you are dumb as a rock and have a lot of money, you can move the markets in whatever direction you want by simply moving money.\u201d"

            "content": "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, spent Sunday trying to shore up political support in battleground states across the country, with polls showing them locked in a tightening race. In North Carolina, Harris attacked her rival for spreading misinformation related to hurricanes Helene and Milton. The vice-president attended a Black church in Greenville, telling the assembled crowd \u201cthere are some who are not acting in the spirit of community \u2026 lying about people who are working hard to help the folks in need, spreading disinformation when the truth and facts are required.\u201d From Arizona, Trump spoke to Fox News, telling them he could impose tariffs higher than 200% on vehicles imported from Mexico. The former president said his aim would be to prevent the selling of cars from Mexico into the US. \u201cAll I\u2019m doing is saying \u2018I\u2019ll put 200 or 500, I don\u2019t care.\u2019 I\u2019ll put a number where they can\u2019t sell one car,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s what else happened on Sunday: At his rally in Arizona, Donald Trump proposed hiring 10,000 additional Border Patrol agents and giving them a $10,000 retention and signing bonus, after he derailed a bipartisan bill earlier this year that included funding for more border personnel. In Prescott Valley, roughly 260 miles north of the state\u2019s border with Mexico, he accepted an endorsement from the National Border Patrol Council. A New York Times poll published on Sunday found that Harris is underperforming among Latino voters, when compared with the past three Democratic candidates for the White House. An NBC News poll showed the candidates in a \u201cdead heat\u201d nationally at 48% support. A man armed with guns and false press and VIP passes was apprehended near a Trump campaign rally in California on Saturday, authorities have said. \u201cThe incident did not impact the safety of former president Trump or attendees of the event,\u201d the Riverside county sheriff\u2019s office said. Police said the suspect, Las Vegas resident Vem Miller was carrying a loaded shotgun, handgun and high-capacity magazine and is believed to be a member of a rightwing anti-government organization. He was released after posting $5,000 bail. President Joe Biden surveyed battered communities and debris-filled streets in Florida, vowing to continue supporting the state\u2019s recovery from Hurricane Milton. The president reiterated his call for US lawmakers \u2013 who are on recess until after the 5 November presidential election \u2013 to return to Washington to approve more disaster funding. Republican House speaker Mike Johnson resisted White House and state lawmakers appeals to approve more disaster assistance, telling NBC News, \u201cthe states have to go and calculate and assess the need and then they submit that to Congress, and that takes some time.\u201d Trump said he spoke to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201clike two days ago\u201d. Trump was asked when last he spoke to the Israeli leader during a Fox News interview. Joe Biden also spoke to Netanyahu last week, in what was the first known conversation between the two leaders since August. Trump called the lack of conversation between Biden and Netanyahu in nearly two months \u201cpathetic\u201d. Former president Bill Clinton urged churchgoers in Albany, Georgia, to rally behind Harris\u2019 campaign. \u201cUniting people and building, being repairers of the breach, as Isaiah says, those are the things that work,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBlaming, dividing, demeaning \u2013 they get you a bunch of votes at election time, but they don\u2019t work.\u201d Georgia is one of seven states seen as pivotal in this year\u2019s presidential race, and turnout among Black voters could hold the key for Democrats to winning the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes."

Either through in-person early voting or mail-in ballots, more than 1.9 million voters have cast early votes in Georgia, where Trump lost by a mere 11,779 votes four years ago to Democrat Joe Biden, while North Carolina also set a new record of more than 1.7m despite the chaos caused by Hurricane Helene last month. At an event in Georgia, Trump celebrated the state\u2019s record-breaking vote levels, and at a separate rally urged his supporters to \u201cjust vote \u2013 whichever way you want to do it.\u201d Here\u2019s what else happened on Wednesday: Donald Trump election news A former model who says she met Donald Trump through the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein has accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993, in what she believed was a \u201ctwisted game\u201d between the two men. The Trump campaign called the allegations by Stacey Williams \u201cunequivocally false\u201d, calling it a fake story \u201ccontrived by the Harris campaign\u201d. Trump appeared in Zebulon, Georgia, with lieutenant governor and 2020 election denier Burt Jones, at a faith-focused event his campaign dubbed a \u201cBelievers and Ballots town hall\u201d. Trump praised tech mogul Elon Musk, for providing hurricane relief where he claimed the federal government did not. Trump stayed in Georgia for a rally in Duluth with guests Tucker Carlson, Robert F Kennedy Jr, and former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. He escalated his personal insults against Kamala Harris, saying she was \u201ccrazy\u201d and inviting voters to tell his opponent: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re the worst ever. There\u2019s never been anybody like you. You can\u2019t put two sentences together. The world is laughing at us because of you.\u2019\u201d The US justice department warned Musk\u2019s Super Pac that the billionaire and Tesla CEO\u2019s $1m-a-day giveaways may violate federal law, according to multiple reports. Musk, who has thrown his support behind Trump, announced on Saturday while speaking before a crowd in Pennsylvania that he was giving away $1m each day until election day to someone who signs his online petition supporting the US constitution. Writing on Truth Social, Trump assailed John Kelly as a \u201ca bad general\u201d gripped by \u201cpure Trump Derangement Syndrome Hatred\u201d. Kelly, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff and a retired Marine general, on Tuesday said he believed Trump met the definition of \u201cfascist\u201d and was \u201ccertainly an authoritarian\u201d. Two retired army officers said they agreed with Kelly, while Republicans including the governor of New Hampshire dismissed the comments. Kamala Harris election news Kamala Harris denounced Trump as a \u201cfascist\u201d who wants \u201cunchecked power\u201d and a military personally loyal to him. In a surprise speech from her Washington DC residence, the Democratic nominee jumped on Kelly\u2019s claims. Joe Biden\u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said the president also agreed with those calling Trump a fascist. Harris repeated the fascist claim during a televised town hall with undecided voters in Delaware County, outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In response to CNN moderator Anderson Cooper asking her: \u201cLet me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?\u201d, Harris answered: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d Trump was invited to attend the same town hall but declined. Harris\u2019s campaign announced she will deliver a major \u201cclosing argument\u201d address next week in the same location that Donald Trump rallied January 6 rioters before they stormed the US Capitol in 2021. Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz voted early along with his wife, Gwen, and son, Gus. Leaving the voting booth in St Paul, Minnesota, Walz said his vote was \u201can opportunity to turn the page on the chaos of Donald Trump and a new way forward\u201d. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, Harris\u2019s husband, rallied Democrats in Florida, marking a break from his recent stumping in more competitive states including Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Both parties expect the Sunshine state to once more swing for Trump, but the Harris campaign\u2019s rare foray drew attention to the close Senate race between the Republican incumbent and Democratic challenger. Elsewhere on the campaign trail The Los Angeles Times opinion editor resigned after the newspaper\u2019s owner blocked the masthead from endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Mariel Garza said she was standing up against the decision by Patrick Soon-Shiong, the paper\u2019s billionaire owner. In a social media post, Soon-Shiong wrote that the Los Angeles Times editorial board had rejected a proposed alternative to a typical presidential endorsement editorial, which he described as \u201ca factual analysis of all the POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE policies by EACH candidate during their tenures at the White House\u201d. China-linked social media bots are targeting Republicans including Marco Rubio, according to new research from Microsoft, while a senior US intelligence official said groups in Russia created and helped spread viral disinformation targeting Tim Walz. Pennsylvania\u2019s highest court allowed people whose mail ballots were rejected on technicalities to cast provisional ballots, likely affecting thousands of early voters. The decision was another defeat for the Republican National Committee\u2019s legal campaign, after it argued some provisional ballots cast during the April primary should have been rejected.

            "date": "2024-10-19T19:00:26Z",
            "content": "Australia is carrying out a review of all 66 defence-related export permits for Israel that were approved prior to the Gaza conflict. Guardian Australia understands the review is being done in a similar manner to the UK government\u2019s recent reassessment of arms licences to Israel, with the outcome to be announced \u201cin coming months\u201d. Sources said the Department of Defence was weighing up each permit on a case-by-case basis and considering how it fits with Australia\u2019s international obligations, including with respect to human rights. A Defence spokesperson confirmed the review was progressing: \u201cAs circumstances in the Middle East evolve, Australia continues to scrutinise pre-existing export permits to Israel to ensure they align with our calibrated approach.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The federal government has repeatedly stated that Australia \u201chas not supplied weapons or ammunition to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years\u201d, and it continues to maintain that position. But the government has faced criticism for failing to be transparent about what each permit covers. It has also defended Australia\u2019s supply of parts for the global supply chain for the F-35 fighter aircraft. Israel has used F-35 aircraft in Gaza. An export permit is required for any goods covered by Australia\u2019s Defence and Strategic Goods List. Defence officials told Senate estimates in June this year that Australia was \u201cnot a major defence exporter to Israel\u201d but permits were required for a range of items, including IT equipment, software, radios, electronic components and dual-use goods. Officials said Australia had issued about 247 permits that relate to Israel since 2019, of which about 66 remained \u201cactive\u201d. Shortly after those comments were made, Guardian Australia applied under freedom of information laws for an itemised list of the content of these 66 permits, but the Department of Defence did not meet the statutory deadline. The application is now subject to a review by the Information Commissioner. Defence officials hinted at the time that they would reassess existing permits, but Guardian Australia has since confirmed more details about the process. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, told the House of Commons last month that the government would suspend 30 of the UK\u2019s 350 existing arms licences to Israel because of \u201ca clear risk that they might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law\u201d. Australian officials are working their way through each active permit, looking at the export control criteria and talking to each of the companies involved. It is understood the government has not yet revoked any of these permits but intends to finalise all decisions in one batch at the end of that review process. \u201cA permit would be refused if Australia identified an export would be used contrary to the national interest, including violating human rights,\u201d the Defence spokesperson said. \u201cPermits are required for a broad range of goods and technologies, many of which have legitimate commercial and civilian applications.\u201d Guardian Australia can also reveal that Australia has now issued 12 defence-related export permits for Israel since October 2023, when the Hamas attacks triggered the Israeli military offensive on Gaza. That figure is higher than the eight permits that were previously known at the time of the estimates committee hearing in June. Defence says these export permits are required for items to travel from Australia to Israel for the purposes of repair or overhaul by Israeli suppliers before they return to Australia. The Greens have called for an end to all two-way military trade with Israel, with the party\u2019s defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, saying Australia must not do anything to \u201cembolden Israel to continue the genocide\u201d. But the Albanese government has pushed back at the idea of ending contracts with Israeli companies that supply goods for use by the Australian Defence Force and Australian police. The review comes after an application from the Australian Centre for International Justice to the defence minister, Richard Marles, in April requesting the revocation of all current export permits to Israel and to other countries which might later make them available to Israel. The centre was acting on behalf of Palestinian human rights organisations. The centre\u2019s executive director and principal lawyer, Rawan Arraf, said the government had \u201cspent the last 12 months muddying the waters\u201d about the export control regime. She said that under the Arms Trade Treaty, Australia was obliged not to approve the export of conventional arms, munitions, parts or components when there was an overriding risk that the item could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law. \u201cThe government has been put on notice, from the international court of justice, the international criminal court, the UN general assembly and other UN bodies, that Israel is committing serious violations of international law,\u201d she said. The ICC\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan KC, has previously said he had \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d two Israeli leaders and three Hamas leaders were responsible for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Israeli government has rejected the allegations in full, arguing the application for arrest warrants amounted to an attempt to deny the country\u2019s right of self-defence. The ICC pre-trial chamber has yet to make a decision on the arrest warrant applications. Israel said it had killed the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza on Thursday, meaning that all three Hamas figures named in Khan\u2019s application are now all believed to be dead. The Israeli embassy was contacted for comment."

            "content": "A military training ground with tanks charging around, explosions and gunfire hardly seems a haven for wild plants, but the Ministry of Defence\u2019s Salisbury Plain site is exceptional. The training ground is the largest remaining area of semi-natural chalk grassland left in north-west Europe, an area of 150 sq miles (380 sq km), the size of the Isle of Wight. It is home to rare plants unique to chalkland and one of the richest ecosystems for plant diversity in Europe. The military have been using Salisbury Plain for more than 100 years, so the land has escaped the ravages of intensive agriculture, including fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and ploughing. Perhaps most surprising is how tanks churning up the ground helps to create diverse habitats, especially where bare chalk is exposed and becomes colonised by specialised plants, such as kidney vetch and small scabious. It is a hotspot for the critically endangered pink flowering red hemp nettle, which grows along the edges of the tank paths, and the viper\u2019s bugloss which, with its deep blue flowers, thrives where the ground has been roughed up and the plant\u2019s seeds dispersed by the vehicles."

The Glasgow Shettleston MSP, John Mason, posted on social media in August: \u201cIf Israel wanted to commit genocide, they would have killed 10 times as many.\u201d He was reacting to former SNP MSP Sandra White, who had said: \u201cWe know what Israelis hope to achieve they are already committing genocide in Gaza,\u201d adding that \u201cinnocent children are being massacred\u201d. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s former Westminster leader, was among those who criticised Mason\u2019s comments, saying on X: \u201cYou are not fit for public office. You are an embarrassment and not fit to represent anyone.\u201d In a post on X on Sunday, Mason revealed he had been expelled by the party over his comments. \u201cVery disappointed to be expelled from the SNP over my comments on Israel, Gaza, and whether or not there has been genocide,\u201d he said in the post. \u201cI continue to believe that we should be able to tolerate a variety of views within the party as long as we are all committed to Scottish independence.\u201d After the decision to remove the whip in August, a party spokesperson said: \u201cTo flippantly dismiss the death of more than 40,000 Palestinians is completely unacceptable. \u201cThere can be no room in the SNP for this kind of intolerance.\u201d At the time, the spokesperson added: \u201cThe chief whip has today withdrawn the whip from John Mason MSP with immediate effect, pending internal parliamentary group due process.\u201d In a radio interview, Mason stood by his comments after the decision to remove the whip. He also wrote in a Facebook post that his \u201cprimary desire in relation to Israel and Gaza is that there should be peace talks, negotiations, and eventually peace\u201d. He added: \u201cToo many lives have already been lost in Israel, Gaza, and beyond and, as I said when I spoke in parliament, many people feel that Israel has moved from a position of self-defence to seeking revenge. \u201cHowever, I personally do not believe that Israel has tried to commit, has committed, or is committing genocide. \u201cThey certainly have the ability to kill many more Palestinians than they have done.

            "date": "2024-10-08T22:32:04Z",
            "content": "Israel has said it is expanding its ground operation in Lebanon with the deployment of a fourth division after another night of intense airstrikes across the south and east of the country. The reservist 146th division was sent to southern Lebanon overnight, hours after Israel announced the mobilisation of a third standing division, meaning the number of troops on the ground is now likely to number 15,000. Launching what it has called Operation Northern Arrows last week, the Israeli army said the ground offensive would involve \u201climited, localised and targeted raids\u201d to remove Hezbollah infrastructure along the disputed de facto border between the two countries, known as the blue line. However, the rapid deployment of four divisions operating across south Lebanon, alongside evacuation orders for Lebanese villages on the coast upwards of 20 miles from the blue line and the intensive bombing of the country\u2019s south and east and the capital, suggests Israel is preparing for a wider push north against the Lebanese militia. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday threatened Lebanon with \u201cdestruction\u201d such as Israel has already wreaked in Gaza. \u201cYou have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,\u201d he said in a video address directed to the people of Lebanon. \u201cI say to you, the people of Lebanon: Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end.\u201d In a defiant speech on Tuesday, Hezbollah\u2019s acting secretary general, Naim Qassem, said the group\u2019s military capabilities were still functional despite two weeks of heavy Israeli airstrikes, including Beirut bombings that killed the group\u2019s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and much of the militia\u2019s top command. \u201cYou see that our daily accomplishments are great. Hundreds of rockets and dozens of aircraft [drones], a great number of [Israeli] settlements and cities have come under rocket fire \u2026 I would like to reassure you that our capabilities are fine,\u201d he said. Hezbollah had replaced all of its senior commanders, he said, and Israeli ground troops had not made any advances after a week of fighting. However, Netanyahu, claimed the IDF had killed Hashem Safieddine, the man expected to replace the late Nasrallah. \u201cWe\u2019ve degraded Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities. We took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself and Nasrallah\u2019s replacement, and the replacement of the replacement,\u201d Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message. It was not immediately clear whom Netanyahu meant by the \u201creplacement of the replacement\u201d. Hezbollah has not confirmed Safieddine\u2019s death. The IDF said that it had also killed Suhail Husseini, responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management, the night before. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah, but about 85 projectiles were launched towards the northern Israeli city of Haifa from Lebanon on Tuesday morning. Most of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence systems. Two Israeli airstrikes hit Beirut\u2019s Shia-majority southern suburbs almost immediately after Qassem\u2019s speech. There were reports of a \u201cmassive airstrike\u201d in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley, about 30km east of Beirut, on Tuesday night, and at least four strikes on Dahiyeh, the southern suburb of Beirut where Nasrallah was killed. Elsewhere, the Syrian government said seven civilians were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Damascus, that a war monitor said targeted a building used by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah. The defence ministry said women and children were among the dead and the toll was preliminary as rescuers were still combing the rubble. None of the dead were Iranian, the Iranian embassy in Damascus said. At least 1,400 Lebanese people, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million \u2013 about a quarter of the population \u2013 have been driven from their homes since fighting escalated three weeks ago. The Lebanese health ministry said at least 36 people had been killed in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours, with 150 people being injured. Israel says the operation\u2019s goal is to allow approximately 60,000 displaced people to return to their homes across northern Israel after a year of simmering cross-border fighting. Hezbollah began firing on Israel in solidarity with its Palestinian allies a day after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack last year that triggered the new war in Gaza and now threatens to drag in Iran and the US. In a statement on Tuesday, the anniversary of Hezbollah\u2019s involvement, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN\u2019s special coordinator for Lebanon, and Lt Gen Aroldo L\u00e1zaro of Unifil, the head of the peacekeeping force on the blue line, called for a \u201cnegotiated solution\u201d to end the latest round of violence. \u201cNear-daily exchanges of fire have escalated into a relentless military campaign whose humanitarian impact is nothing short of catastrophic,\u201d the statement said. \u201cA negotiated solution is the only pathway to restore the security and stability that civilians on both sides so desperately want and deserve \u2026 The time to act is now.\u201d The region is still waiting for Israel\u2019s response to an unprecedented missile attack from Iran last week, launched in support of its Lebanese ally after Israel\u2019s ground invasion. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said in an interview with CNN late on Monday: \u201cEverything is on the table. Israel has capabilities to hit targets near and far \u2013 we have proved it.\u201d Israel is consulting Washington, its most important ally, over how to retaliate against Tehran without triggering an even stronger response. The New York Times, citing US officials, said the US believed Israel would prioritise attacking military bases and intelligence sites before nuclear facilities. A Pentagon spokesperson announced on Tuesday night that Gallant had cancelled plans for a visit to Washington to meet his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Wednesday. Netanyahu reportedly told Gallant his trip would not be approved until the Israeli prime minister has a phone call with Joe Biden to discuss the response to Iran\u2019s missile attack, and until the Israeli security cabinet approves the plan. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, earlier warned against a new Israeli attack. Fighting also continues to rage in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes killed 17 people in a refugee camp in the centre of the Palestinian territory on Tuesday, medics said. At least 15 people, including two women and four children, were killed on Tuesday in ground fighting in the Jabaliya neighbourhood of Gaza City, the nearby Kamal Adwan hospital said, after new Israeli evacuation orders for the city were issued on Monday. The IDF has intensified bombing of the area and moved in tanks. The Israeli military said it killed about 20 militants in Jabaliya and located a large quantity of weapons, including grenades and rifles. Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas\u2019s armed wing, said in a speech on the anniversary of the 7 October attack that the group would \u201ckeep up the fight in a long war of attrition, one that is painful and costly for the enemy\u201d. Hamas fired a barrage of longer-range rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday\u2019s anniversary, underscoring that the group\u2019s military capabilities are eroded but not yet defunct after a year of war. A total of 1,205 people were killed on 7 October and 251 taken hostage. Another 41,965 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliatory war in Gaza over the past year, which has also drawn in militia groups allied to Iran in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Israeli media outlets reported earlier this week that government officials have not met to discuss the stalled ceasefire and hostage swap negotiations aimed at ending the war in Gaza for more than two weeks."

            "content": "Reeves\u2019s opening remarks Rachel Reeves says the UK voted for change, and the Labour government has a mandate for a decade of \u201cnational renewal\u201d. Reeves pledges \u201cmore pounds in people\u2019s pockets\u201d and improved living standards. The only way to drive economic growth is to \u201cinvest, invest, invest\u201d, she says. The government must \u201crestore economic stability and turn the page on 14 years\u201d of Conservative government, Reeves says. The Labour party has rebuilt the UK economy before, and will \u201crebuild Britain once again\u201d. Reeves says this budget will raise taxes by \u00a340bn. She adds that she is \u201cdeeply proud to be Britain\u2019s first ever female chancellor of the exchequer\u2019. Peter Walker, senior political correspondent: Reeves sets out the political challenge \u2013 and the very big one \u2013 at the centre of her budget, and indeed the whole government: making people feel they are better off, and with better public services. And this requires investment, she says, adding some inevitable Tory-bashing for good measure, plus noting her status as the first-ever female chancellor. National insurance Employees will not pay more directly, Reeves says, but she will raise employers\u2019 national insurance contributions by 1.2 percentage points to 15% from April 2025. The government will also reduce a secondary threshold when contributions are due from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000. Those measures will raise \u00a325bn a year by the end of the forecast period, the biggest single tax raising measure in the budget. PW: This is the big fiscal hitter of the budget \u2013 \u00a325bn a year by the end of the parliament \u2013 and probably the most politically perilous choice Reeves will make. There is no doubt that public services need the extra money, and voters want better public services. But it will be portrayed as tax on jobs, and as something that could hit growth, even with the new allowances for smaller businesses. Income tax Reeves says the government will increase personal tax thresholds on income tax and national insurance in line with inflation from 2028-29, something that had been floated as a possibility. This avoids dragging people into higher tax bands. PW: If not a fully fledged rabbit yanked from a hat, then we do perhaps have a glimpse of a nose and some whiskers. The surprise move allows Reeves to argue she has kept Labour\u2019s manifesto promise to not increase taxes on working people \u2013 even if it does only start in 2028/29. Capital gains and inheritance tax Capital gains tax will be increased. The lower rate will be raised from 10% to 18%, and the higher rate from 20% to 24%. There will, however, be no increase on the 18% and 24% capital gains rate imposed on the sale of second homes. The government will extend a freeze on the threshold for inheritance tax to 2030, allowing \u00a3325,000 to be inherited tax free. From 2027 inherited pension pots will also be subject to the tax. Reliefs will be reformed for business and agricultural assets. After \u00a31m, those assets will attract inheritance tax of 20%. PW: A rise in capital gains tax was very much baked in with budget expectations, and the increases are not huge. As Reeves says, they will keep UK rates relatively low by international standards. And it will raise a relatively modest \u00a32.5bn by the end of the parliament. On inheritance tax, she has largely closed loopholes connected to farms, but even this and other tweaks will raise an eventual \u00a32bn a year. None of this is likely to be hugely contentious. The minimum wage Reeves confirms that the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, the legal minimum for over-21s, will increase by 6.7% to \u00a312.21, equivalent to \u00a31,400 a year for an eligible full-time worker. There will be a single-adult rate phased in over time to eventually equalise pay for under-21s. PW: The most recent of dozens of announcements to be briefed in advance of the budget. Paying people more is usually seen as a vote-winner, but ministers will also be wary of business voices warning about the impact this could have on job creation. Tobacco and alcohol The government will implement a levy on vapes, which will be increased in line with tobacco. Tobacco taxes will rise by 2% above retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation for the rest of this parliament, and tax on hand-rolling tobacco will increase by 10%. Taxes on alcohol will rise in line with the RPI, but Reeves announces a cut in draught duty by 1.7%, which she says is a penny off a pint in the pub. PW: On what we are obliged to call sin taxes, Reeves has, as expected, further taxed tobacco and vapes. In another sign of how this government is less worried about what might be termed nanny-state measures, it is also toughening the levy on sugary soft drinks. As a sop to the tabloids, she did cut 1p off the duty of a pint of draught beer. Fuel duty Reeves says increasing fuel duty next year would be wrong, so she extends the freeze for a year and maintains the last government\u2019s 5p cut. Fuel duty was frozen between 2011 and 2022, and cut by 5p in March 2022 after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. PW: A continued freeze to fuel duty was one of the most politically tricky decisions Reeves faced. On the one hand, as she said, the \u00a33bn cost is a lot. But the anti-fuel duty rise lobby is very powerful, and increasing it could (and would) be portrayed as a tax rise for working people. Private school fees VAT will be brought in on private school fees from January 2025. PW: Not in the least a surprise, and if you believe the polling, one of the more popular policies in both the Labour manifesto and the budget. Will it see a rush of private school students into the state sector? Time will tell, but ministers are fairly relaxed. Schools and education Reeves says the Department for Education will receive \u00a36.7bn of capital investment, a 19% real-terms increase. That includes \u00a31.4bn to rebuild more than 500 schools in the greatest need. The schools budget will increase by \u00a32.3bn to support the hiring of teachers. There will be \u00a32.1bn for school maintenance, a \u00a3300m increase. Reeves announces a \u00a31bn increase in funding for special educational needs. There will be another \u00a3300m for higher education. PW: One of the most visible and enduring legacies of the last Labour government was the many new and renovated schools it delivered. Reeves has set out her ambition to copy this. The 19% real-terms increase in investment is an instant lesson on what you can do with the changed fiscal rules. NHS Reeves promises a 10-year plan for the NHS in the spring, targeting 2% productivity growth next year. She announces a \u00a322.6bn increase in the day-to-day health budget, and \u00a33.1bn increase in the capital budget. That includes \u00a31bn for repairs and upgrades, and \u00a31.5bn for new beds in hospitals and testing capacity. PW: At risk of endlessly repeating a theme, the state of the NHS is one of the biggest factors on which Labour won the election, and on which it will be judged five years later. Will a \u00a322.6bn increase in everyday spending be enough? Not without parallel structural changes. But it\u2019s fair to say that without it, waiting lists would surely rise again. And the voters would notice. Housing The government will spend \u00a35bn on housing investment in 2025-26, including increasing the supply of affordable housing. The government will reduce right-to-buy discounts, and local governments will retain the earnings from council housing sales to allow them to reinvest. The government will hire \u201chundreds of new planning officers\u201d to accelerate housebuilding. PW: All the figures and new policies on housing were briefed in advance, and for good political reason. One of the key metrics the Starmer government has set itself is to build 1.5m new homes \u2013 and the voters are watching. Transport Reeves commits to the Transpennine Route Upgrade, improving capacity at Manchester Victoria and electrifying the Wigan to Bolton route. She also promises to support east-west rail links between Oxford and Cambridge. Reeves confirms the government will fund tunnelling of HS2 to London Euston. There will be a \u00a3500m increase in the roads budget next year to target potholes. PW: No, it\u2019s not full HS2, but the ragbag of mainly northern rail routes, and confirmation that the Birmingham-London route will end in Euston are something. And as every councillor will tell you, at length, voters are very, very interested in potholes. Energy Reeves announces \u00a33.4bn for the warm homes plan to upgrade buildings, lowering energy bills. The government will fund Great British Energy, a new body to be based in Aberdeen. Public spending There will be a 1.5% increase in real spending on government departments, and 1.7% when including capital spending. Defence Reeves announces a \u00a32.9bn increase in military spending next year, as well as funding for second world war commemorations next year. Local government There will be \u00a31.3bn for additional grant funding for local government, including \u00a3600m for social care. Greater Manchester and the West Midlands will get integrated settlements next year, allowing them to take more control of their spending. PW: This is something which bore the brunt of austerity, and the sector often most keenly felt by voters. Is it enough? Of course not. But is it a start? Yes. Public investment Reeves says more public investment is needed in the UK. A new rule will target debt falling as a share of the economy. She confirms that debt will be measured as public sector net financial liabilities, recognising benefits from investments. The rule will apply in 2029-30, and then net financial debt will fall by the third year of every forecast. There will be regular reports on government investments from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). She says the government will invest \u00a31bn in aerospace, \u00a32bn in automotive to support electric vehicles, and \u00a3500m for life sciences. Government research and development spending will reach \u00a320.4bn in 2025-26, including \u00a36.1bn in sectors such as engineering, biotechnology and medical science. PW: Politically, albeit most likely in the longer term, this could be the most significant change in the budget. To very obviously make the link between low investment and the state of public services, Reeves lists the problems of crumbling infrastructure in various sectors to a series of cries of \u201cshame!\u201d from Labour MPs. Planes and private jets Air passenger duty will increase by up to \u00a32 for each economy short-haul flight, Reeves says. Private jets will attract an extra 50% air passenger duty, up to \u00a3450 per passenger for a flight. PW: This is a largely politically-risk free change, and one which allowed the chancellor to make a few well-aimed jokes in the direction of Rishi Sunak, saying the levy would be applied on flights going to \u201csay \u2026 California?\u201d It wins plenty of laughs. Business taxes and non-doms The government will introduce permanently lower business rates for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses from 2026-27. Until then they will receive 40% relief on business rates up to a cap of \u00a3110,000. Employment allowance will be increased from \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,500, reducing national insurance for smaller businesses. Taxes on carried interest, generally paid by private equity managers, will rise from 28% to 32% from April. Reeves confirms the oil profits levy will be increased to 38% and extended. The concept of non-domicile residents will be abolished from April. Compensation schemes Reeves says the government will compensate victims of the infected blood scandal with \u00a311.8bn, and there will be another \u00a31.8bn for victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal. PW: Even Tory MPs will find it hard to argue with this. Reeves\u2019s words that the last government apologised for the infected blood scandal but failed to budget at all for compensation payments is a powerful argument. Other measures Reeves says the government will raise \u00a36.5bn through targeting tax avoidance, including by umbrella companies. OBR Reeves says Labour inherited a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d with allegedly unfunded pledges by the Conservative government. The OBR, the government\u2019s budget watchdog, has published a review saying that the previous government did not disclose details of spending. Those details would have made forecasts materially different, Reeves says. Reeves says the government will implement 10 recommendations from the OBR\u2019s review. PW: This is very nakedly partisan and in some ways familiar, not least the idea of the \u00a322bn fiscal black hole. But the idea of the OBR saying it was effectively misled by the Conservatives is very strong political cover for the coming tax rises and limited increases to public budgets. It will enrage Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, all the more. Inflation and growth forecasts The chancellor will maintain the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target for inflation. Inflation will average 2.5% in 2024, rising to 2.6% in 2025, before gradually dropping to 2% in 2029, according to OBR forecasts. Inflation was at 1.7% in September, below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, and down from 11% in October 2022. The OBR slightly upgrades its growth forecast for this year and next, but adjusts them down in later years. GDP growth is forecast to be 1.1% in 2024, then 2%, 1.8%, 1.5%, 1.5%, and 1.6% in 2030, Reeves says. At the spring budget under the then Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt the OBR had forecast 0.8% growth this year, 1.9% in 2025, and 2% in 2026. PW: The OBR\u2019s inflation and growth predictions are hardly stellar, with inflation not expeted to fall to the 2% target before 2029. But in truth, as long as it stays in the 2% range, Reeves would take it. She will, however, very much hope that the growth figures \u2013 the stated central task of the Keir Starmer government \u2013 pick up. Government borrowing Reeves announces new rules to not borrow for day-to-day spending. The current budget will be balanced within three years of forecasts. The government will run a deficit of \u00a326.2bn in 2026, but will achieve a surplus of \u00a310.9bn in 2027-28, \u00a39.3bn in 2028-29 and \u00a39.9bn in 2029-30. Public sector net debt will fall from \u00a3127bn in 2024-25, falling gradually to \u00a370.6bn by 2029-20. PW: Expect the forecasts of reduced borrowing and an eventual surplus to be much mentioned by ministers in the coming days and weeks, as they try to push back against the Conservatives\u2019 charges of fiscal incompetence. The tougher rules on day-to-day spending will be seen as a balance to the relaxation of their equivalent on investment, as already announced. Closing remarks Reeves says it is a moment of \u201cfundamental choice\u201d for the UK. She says the government will protect the NHS, protect working people and rebuild Britain. She says the Conservatives must say what choices they would make if they disagree with her decisions. They would have to cut schools and hospitals if they disagree with any tax increases. PW: Reeves\u2019s final words are an open challenge to the Conservatives, and an attempt to pre-empt their accusations of broken promises: \u2018what would you do instead?\u201d It is a fair question, even if as an opposition you sometimes get a free pass on such scrutiny. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2024. An earlier version said that the government will fund the tunnelling of HS2 from Manchester to London Euston; this should have said from Birmingham."

            "date": "2024-10-30T18:43:42Z",
            "content": "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pressed the button tax and benefits changes that will have an impact on the pound in your pocket. Through a range of scenarios we explore what it means in financial terms. Some figures rounded up to the nearest pound. In some cases different rates apply in Scotland. Single person of working age This year someone earning the UK\u2019s typical (median) wage of \u00a337,500 will pay \u00a34,986 in income tax and \u00a31,994 in national insurance contributions (NICs). This results in a monthly take-home pay of \u00a32,543 after tax, or \u00a330,520 a year. Traditionally tax brackets keep pace with inflation but they have been frozen in cash terms since April 2021 meaning as wages rise, particularly in times of high inflation, people pay tax on a bigger proportion of their income. However Reeves promised tax bands would be unfrozen from 2028-29. A 2% pay rise due in April ups our worker\u2019s salary by \u00a3750 to \u00a338,250. As a result, their income tax bill goes up by \u00a3150 to \u00a35,136, and NICs by \u00a360 to \u00a32,054. In the 2025-26 tax year their take-home pay will be \u00a32,588 a month after tax, or \u00a331,060 a year. Pensioner Once his full new state pension is combined with payments from a private one, he has a gross income of \u00a319,000. From this he pays \u00a31,286 in income tax. He no longer qualifies for the winter fuel payment, which shaved \u00a3200 from his budget this winter, and he will continue to miss each year. He benefits from the \u201ctriple lock\u201d so his full state pension will rise by 4.1% or \u00a39.05 to \u00a3230.25 a week, from April 2025, adding \u00a3470.60 to his annual income before tax. The tax bill on that is \u00a394.12 leaving him an extra \u00a3376.48 in the 2025-26 tax year. Low income pensioner couple As they are now in their late 70s, the couple receive the basic state pension. Their combined income is less than the \u00a3332.95 (\u00a3218.15 for a single person) a week, or \u00a317,313 a year, standard minimum guarantee so they receive a pension credit top-up and qualify for the \u00a3200 winter fuel payment. Next year the \u201ctriple lock\u201d sees the minimum guarantee increase by 4.1% or \u00a313.65 to \u00a3346.60 (\u00a3227.10 for a single person). This works out as an extra \u00a3709.80 a year for couples and \u00a3465.40 for singles. High earners She is a private equity executive and is due to receive a \u00a31m payment for her share of deal-making profits known as \u201ccarried interest\u201d. At the moment she would pay capital gains tax (CGT) on carried interest at 28%, which is \u00a3280,000. However, the rate on the earnings will rise again to 32% in April 2025. They have two children at private school at a cost of \u00a326,000 a year each. From 1 January, VAT at 20% will apply to fees so, if the school adds on it on in full, the annual bill for this will rise by more than \u00a310,000. Wealthy family This family have been doing some serious planning to reduce the inheritance tax (IHT) bill that the younger generation could face. They own a house worth \u00a3800,000 as well as shares. Current rules mean the married couple can combine allowances to pass on up to \u00a31m tax-free (including their home) to their offspring. However, from 2027 their children can no longer inherit their \u00a3700,000 undrawn pension pot tax-free and will have to pay IHT on it. They also own \u00a3100,000 of shares in smaller companies listed on the Aim junior market (current rules exempt Aim shares held for at least two years from IHT). From April 2026 Reeves has cut this relief to 50% \u2013 so they could be looking at a bill of \u00a320,000. Business owner This successful entrepreneur set up and runs a business valued at \u00a32m and hoped to keep it in the family. Under current rules, if they die it would not be subject to inheritance tax (IHT). However, changes to business relief mean that from April 2026 his children will have to pay IHT on anything over \u00a31m at an effective rate of 20%, which is \u00a3200,000. If he opted to sell instead, the changes to capital gains (CGT) announced and effective immediately mean this bill has increased by \u00a340,000 to \u00a3340,000 this year. The rates ratchet up again in April 2025 and 2026 when the bill would hit \u00a3380,000 and \u00a3420,000 respectively. He also holds a portfolio of listed shares and is sitting on a gain of \u00a3100,000. If he had sold up pre-budget he would have paid a \u00a320,000 CGT bill. As of budget day, his bill has increased by \u00a34,000 to \u00a324,000. Young family Our parents are both employed with a combined income of \u00a375,000. Until this year they repaid half their child benefit (worth \u00a325.60 a week for the eldest or only child \u2013 going up to \u00a326.05 next April) because the higher earner is paid a salary of \u00a355,000. However in April the starting point for repaying it was upped to \u00a360,000. The couple want to get on the property ladder but the government did not extend the stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers, which expires on 31 March (it was increased from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3425,000 and is due to revert back). They will miss out on a saving of up to \u00a36,250 if they buy in England or Northern Ireland after that date. Motorist In a budget thin on rabbits, one surprise move was the chancellor\u2019s announcement that a temporary 5p cut in fuel duty would remain in place. \u201cWhile the cost of living remains high and with a backdrop of global uncertainty, increasing fuel duty next year would be the wrong choice for working people\u201d, Reeves said. The current fuel duty rate for petrol and diesel, which includes the 5p cut, is 52.95p a litre. The cut is saving drivers about \u00a3130 a year according to the price comparison site Confused.com. Single parent The family receives universal credit (UC) and can expect their payments to rise by just 1.7% next April (a number of benefits, including UC, are increased each tax year in line with the cost of living figure for the previous September). However, there was some good news. The government has introduced a new fair repayment rate that reduces the level of debt repayments that can be clawed back from a household\u2019s UC payment each month from 25% to 15% of their standard allowance. Those who benefit will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year. Illustrations by Travis Constantine Tax and national insurance calculations provided by accountants Blick Rothenberg."

            "content": "Tuesday marks the 100th anniversary of the election that brought down the first ever Labour government, albeit it having been a minority in the House of Commons. During that century, the Conservatives had been in power for two-thirds of the time, and the Labour government elected on 4 July this year is only the fourth to have a substantial majority; the others being 1945, 1966 and the Blair/Brown government from 1997. As we contemplate the difficult tightrope balancing act that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has to navigate on Wednesday, it is worth reflecting that balancing the orthodoxy of economic stability with the imperative of progressive political change has always proved to be a major challenge. So often, Labour has been elected to clear up the mess or take on the daunting prospect of renewal from the legacy it has inherited. Bringing hope, underpinned by realism, has been the road to success and the price of re-election in the past. This week, 100 years on from 1924, could define the future trajectory of Keir Starmer\u2019s missions for our country. But there is one further twist that is worth reflecting on from that short-lived experience of government. Namely, what we now call \u201cfake news\u201d: the publication of the Zinoviev letter \u2013 supposedly from the head of the Communist International in Moscow \u2013 which purported to offer help to the Labour party. It was in fact a forgery, but did enormous damage at the time, and is a reminder of just how fragile our democracy can be.

The area is a smoking and vaping hotspot \u2013 high above the national average \u2013 and it is also in chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s constituency of Leeds West and Pudsey. \u201cHave you got any blueberry, love?\u201d one customer asked, telling the Guardian that she had been smoking since the age of 11 and was much happier vaping instead. She was not pleased to hear the price of vapes would be going up 2% above the retail prices index, but concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s still cheaper than cigs.\u201d The cashier said the shop was especially busy with older people who had quit smoking due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD. As well as having high rates of the lung condition, Bramley has above average levels of heart disease, obesity and mental health problems. An old industrial part of Leeds previously dominated by mills and factories, the ward is one of the more deprived in the city and in desperate need of Reeves\u2019s promise to \u201cinvest, invest, invest\u201d. Outside Greggs was Steve Cook, who is retired but works part time driving the \u201cHappy Cab\u201d for the charity Bramley Elderly Action, ferrying older people around for days out and shopping trips. \u201cThey go in happy and come home ecstatic,\u201d he said. Having previously loved Reeves, who got 49% of the vote in this historically Labour area, Cook said it had been \u201cknives out\u201d among his friends when the winter fuel payment was cut. \u201cWe said we\u2019re not voting Labour again,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would have been the first on the bonfire on 5 November, they would have been making a Guy of her.\u201d But with this budget he said the chancellor had \u201credeemed herself\u201d. \u201cI can see what they\u2019re doing now. Yeah, they\u2019ve won me over. They\u2019ve saved themselves by the skin of their teeth,\u201d he said. With the state pension confirmed to rise by \u00a3470 a year, it would make a difference for him as he is \u201conly really breaking even\u201d. But some of his passengers would benefit even more, he thought. \u201cI\u2019ve come to know them because I take them shopping to Morrisons and I see that what they\u2019re buying is just what they need. There\u2019s no luxuries.\u201d Samantha Krylczuk said she was a Labour supporter and liked the chancellor, having had her come to her front door during the election campaign. She said the budget would not have a large material effect on her as she was on disability benefit due to being deaf. \u201cBut I feel better knowing that people are getting good news,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cost of living crisis has been really getting people down and I think things should change now, over time. I want people to feel happy again.\u201d Though Reeves confirmed the price of beer would fall thanks to a 1.7% cut in draught duty in the pub \u2013 triggering cheers from MPs in the Commons chamber \u2013 Krylczuk said she would have preferred measures to help people have better lifestyles. \u201cI\u2019m trying to manage my weight but the healthy foods are much more expensive, so it would have been good to have some help with that,\u201d she said. The news that the minimum wage would rise 6.7%, worth \u00a31,400 a year, was positive for Francis Sawali, a support worker for people with learning disabilities. \u201cThat will be nice,\u201d said Sawali, though he said it was not necessarily a struggle to survive on the minimum wage. \u201cIt depends how you manage yourself.\u201d His friend, Shepherd Kwenda, left the army after 12 years as a vehicle mechanic and is now a mechanical engineering student. He said while it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d wages would be going up for the lowest paid, he was worried it would push prices up. He said: \u201cIt just makes you concerned that bills are going to go up. Hopefully this will help stimulate the economy but the previous government gave us the mindset that nothing good comes without a negative.\u201d At Costa Coffee, assistant manager Amelia Matthews said she was \u201cchuffed\u201d about the minimum wage rise. \u201cThat\u2019s bloody good. I\u2019m over the moon, honestly. I didn\u2019t realise it would be so much.\u201d As a mental health and counselling student in her third year, she has had to work full-time hours to support herself as her student loan only covers her rent. \u201cThis means I could do less hours,\u201d she said. \u201cI like working, I\u2019ve got no complaints there, but I have to work full-time to survive. I can\u2019t wait to tell people, everyone will be so surprised.\u201d She added: \u201cThank you for spreading the good news! Go spread some more, make people\u2019s day!\u201d"

Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves promised to deliver real change to the electorate, after 14 years of Tory rule. This week, they have broken that promise. This budget is austerity by another name. While we welcome the government\u2019s decision to invest in school and hospital buildings, it is extremely disappointing that these investments have been undermined by a swathe of public sector cuts, cruel attacks on the worst off, and a dogmatic refusal to redistribute wealth and power. These are not \u201ctough choices\u201d for government ministers, but for ordinary people who are forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table. Labour is raising defence expenditure to 2.5% of GDP while telling us there is no money to lift 250,000 children out of poverty. This is a lie. There is plenty of money \u2013 it\u2019s just in the wrong hands. The richest 1% in the UK hold more wealth than 70% of Britons. By refusing to impose a wealth tax, this government has chosen to force vulnerable communities to pay the price for years of economic failure, instead of making the richest pay their fair share. Labour\u2019s first budget shows us whose side they\u2019re on. Years of austerity and privatisation have decimated our public services and pushed millions into poverty, disproportionately impacting women, people of colour and disabled people. Making millions of children, working, retired and disabled people poorer damages our entire economy and stretches our public services. An austerity economy is a false economy. We, along with nearly 100 progressive Independent and Green politicians across the country, are calling on the Labour government to: 1) introduce wealth taxes; 2) abolish the two-child benefit cap and stop attacking welfare recipients; 3) reverse cuts to winter fuel; 4) restore the \u00a32 bus cap; and 5) invest in a Green New Deal. We refuse to believe that child poverty, mass hunger and homelessness are inevitable in the sixth largest economy in the world. A progressive movement is growing up and down the country, demanding a real alternative to this race to the bottom between Labour and the Tories, which has seen the new government perpetuate decades of austerity and rampant corporate greed. The Tories\u2019 collapse allowed Labour to come to power with the lowest vote share ever won by any single-party majority government. Labour haemorrhaging votes to progressive independents and Greens in their heartlands should be a lesson to this government: you are wrong to believe that progressive voters have nowhere else to go. Our movement is growing every day \u2013 and you ignore the demand for a real alternative at your peril.

I hoped that this would be the defining moment when the country learned what this Labour government stands for, what it believes in, and whether it has the courage and ingenuity to generate the scale of economic and social change needed to reverse years of Conservative decline. On that count this budget has clearly failed. The Treasury impact statement that accompanied the budget, however, offers some mitigating reassurances. It demonstrates that the lowest-income households benefit the most from increased investment in health and education, and that the proposed changes in taxation mean the poorest households stand to gain the most and the wealthiest households will pay the most. Overall, the budget failed the postwar Clement Attlee government\u2019s seismic shift test, but if we imagine what would have been in a Tory budget, it does begin to feel just a tiny bit that the country finally has a Labour government in power.

            "date": "2024-10-07T18:21:08Z",
            "content": "David Lammy has hailed the decision to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius as a deal to save a strategically important UK-US military base, after accusations from opposition MPs that a key asset was being given away. The government announced last week that it was going to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, ending years of bitter dispute over Britain\u2019s last African colony, but the military base on Diego Garcia will remain under UK control. In a statement to parliament, the foreign secretary said the deal had to be agreed as the status quo was clearly not \u201csustainable\u201d. Citing US support for the agreement, Lammy told MPs: \u201cIt\u2019s critical for our national security. Without security of tenure there will be no base. The deal benefits us, the UK, the US and Mauritius.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a victory for diplomacy. We saved the base, it has been secured for the long term.\u201d Lammy said the deal did not signify similar deals that would be in the offing for Gibraltar or the Falklands. \u201cBritish sovereignty on the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar and the sovereign base areas is not up for negotiation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situations are not comparable. This has been acknowledged across our overseas territories.\u201d Five years ago the international court of justice issued an advisory opinion condemning the UK\u2019s continued control over the Chagos Islands. Lammy said that if the government had not agreed the deal, a binding judgment against the UK seemed inevitable and it would risk losing the base or breaching international law. Conservative MPs heckled Lammy over the deal on Monday despite the previous government having taken part in 11 rounds of negotiations, the last held just weeks before the general election. Negotiations were initiated in November 2022 and the former foreign secretaries James Cleverly and David Cameron took part. The shadow foreign secretary, Andrew Mitchell, said that the government \u201cproposes to give away a key military asset\u201d, saying this \u201cgives succour to our enemies in a dangerous world\u201d. The former immigration minister Robert Jenrick also condemned the deal, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve just handed sovereign British territory to a small island nation which is an ally of China, and we are paying for the privilege, all so the foreign secretary can feel good about himself at his next north London dinner party. In whose interests does he think he serves: those of the global diplomatic elite, or those of the British people and our national interest?\u201d Lammy said that in return for Mauritius having sovereignty over the islands including Diego Garcia, base operations will remain under UK control into the next century \u2013 initially for 99 years with the UK having a right to extend. The agreement will allow a right of return for Chagossians, whom the UK expelled from their homes in the 1960s and 70s in what has been described as a crime against humanity and one of the most shameful episodes of postwar colonialism. \u201cThe manner in which Chagossians were forcibly removed in the 1960s was deeply wrong,\u201d Lammy said. Asked about the fate of more than 60 Tamil refugees stranded on the island of Diego Garcia for the last three years, Lammy said: \u201cOn signing the treaty this is now a matter for Mauritius.\u201d Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, which supported a protest by some Chagossians opposed to the deal outside parliament on Monday, said: \u201cChagossians have a right to be consulted about their homeland but they were not in fact consulted. The government must bring the Chagossians into these negotiations. They cannot negotiate away their responsibility towards the Chagossians.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-17T10:00:12Z",
            "content": "Senior Democrats in US cities are preparing to defend their communities in the event of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House after the former president has repeated threats that he would use presidential powers to seize control of major urban centers. Trump has proposed deploying the military inside major cities largely run by Democrats to deal with protesters or to crush criminal gangs. He has threatened to dispatch large numbers of federal immigration agents to carry out mass deportations of undocumented people in so-called \u201csanctuary\u201d cities. He also aims to obliterate the progressive criminal justice policies of left-leaning prosecutors. \u201cIn cities where there has been a complete breakdown of law and order \u2026 I will not hesitate to send in federal assets including the national guard until safety is restored,\u201d Trump says in the campaign platform for his bid to become the 47th US president, Agenda47. Trump provoked uproar earlier this week when he called for US armed forces to be deployed against his political rivals \u2013 \u201cthe enemy within\u201d \u2013 on election day next month. But his plans to use national guard troops and military personnel as a means to attack those he sees as his opponents go much wider than that, spanning entire cities with Democratic leadership. Mayors and prosecutors in several US cities are collaborating over strategies to minimize the fallout. Levar Stoney, the Democratic mayor of Richmond, Virginia, a city of over 220,000, said he was aware how difficult it would be to resist Trump given the enormous powers at a president\u2019s disposal. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to autocrat-proof your city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to have backstops, and mayors are working in coalition to ensure they can be a backstop against these divisive policies.\u201d Gillian Feiner, senior counsel of States United Democracy Center, a non-partisan group working to advance democracy and fair and secure elections, said that many organizations were evaluating the legal landscape and preparing for practical challenges should Trump win. \u201cState officials\u2019 awareness of the threat level is high,\u201d she said, noting that their alertness stood in contrast to 2016 when many states were taken by surprise by Trump\u2019s actions. Larry Krasner, the progressive district attorney of Philadelphia with whom Trump clashed several times during his presidency, said he was taking the former president at his word. \u201cIt is incredibly serious for big cities that lean strongly Democratic, as Philadelphia does, when a potential president who identifies with dictators all over the world talks about conferring on federal authorities powers they do not have.\u201d Krasner predicted that Trump would face severe blowback if he tried to carry out any of his menaces. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let somebody carry out a coup as soon as he\u2019s in office, whether with tanks or on paper. My father served in world war two, and countless Americans died to resist fascism. If anybody tries to orchestrate a coup they\u2019re going to encounter tremendous resistance.\u201d *** Trump\u2019s disdain for cities run by Democrats has been a consistent theme of his politics. In his 2017 inauguration speech he vented against the \u201ccrime and the gangs and the drugs\u201d within \u201cinner cities\u201d, dubbing them \u201cthis American carnage\u201d. During the turbulence following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, Trump sent hundreds of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers, including border patrol Swat teams from the Bortac unit, to Portland and Seattle to protect federal property in running battles with militant protesters. Democratic officials in Portland asked for the 750 officers to be withdrawn, saying they were exacerbating the crisis, and a later investigation by the DHS inspector general criticized the deployment as ill-conceived and poorly executed. A spokesperson for Portland\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, said that \u201ccity leadership and bureaus have been working for months in collaboration with our external partners to prepare for the upcoming election\u201d, but declined an interview request. Trump also deployed the national guard and Secret Service agents in the nation\u2019s capital in June 2020. Federalised officers used tear gas and flash bangs to disperse a Black Lives Matter crowd in Washington DC so that the sitting president could stage a much derided photo op in which he raised a Bible outside St John\u2019s church close to the White House. In total, federal Swat teams drawn from 16 government divisions were deployed to quell the nationwide civil unrest following Floyd\u2019s death, an audit from the Government Accountability Office found. In the build-up to November\u2019s election, Trump has made his attack on big liberal cities a central pillar of his re-election campaign. Ahead of the Republican national convention, which nominated him as presidential candidate, he called Milwaukee, host of the event, a \u201chorrible city\u201d. He has also denigrated Washington DC, telling a campaign rally last month that he would \u201ctake over the horribly run capital of our nation \u2026 clean it up, renovate it, rebuild it, so there\u2019s no longer a nightmare of murder and crime\u201d. The most searing of Trump\u2019s threats towards cities is that he will deploy the national guard, or even regular military forces, to combat urban protests and crime. He told a rally in Davenport, Iowa, last year that he would be much more aggressive in pursuing cities in a second term, saying that he would not wait to be invited in by mayors or governors but would act unilaterally. \u201cThe next time I\u2019m not waiting [for local approval]. We don\u2019t have to wait any longer. We got to get crime out of our cities,\u201d he said, specifically referencing New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. *** Trump\u2019s plans to deploy forces inside the cities depends upon his ability to bypass constitutional limits that generally forbid the military to be used in domestic law enforcement. The one exception is the Insurrection Act, which allows presidents to use the military or to federalise the national guard in order to restore order or put down a rebellion that is preventing the execution of US laws. \u201cIf I thought things were getting out of control, I would have no problem using the military, per se,\u201d Trump told Time magazine in April. \u201cWe have to have law and order in our country.\u201d Feiner said that should Trump invoke the Insurrection Act, which would put the national guard under the control of the president as commander-in-chief, there would be \u201cenormous pressure to comply\u201d with his orders. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the end of the story. State and local officials have lots of levers they can pull to protect their citizens \u2013 both legally and practically \u2013 and that\u2019s what we will see them do.\u201d In the Time interview, Trump also opened up on his plans to send federal agents into cities to round up undocumented immigrants as part of his threat to carry out mass deportations. He railed against \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, municipalities which welcome migrants and resist their police officers acting as immigration officials. \u201cThere\u2019s a pent-up demand to end sanctuary cities, because it\u2019s just not working out for the country,\u201d Trump said. In Agenda47 he threatens to withdraw federal funds from local police forces that refuse to cooperate with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s former senior White House policy adviser who is expected to make a comeback in a Trump second term, has laid out some of the plans for mass deportations in conversation with the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. Miller spoke of deputizing national guard troops as immigration officers and sending them from Republican-controlled red states into Democratic-controlled blue states whose cities have large, concentrated immigrant populations. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go into an unfriendly state like Maryland, well, there would just be Virginia doing the arrest in Maryland, right \u2013 very close, very nearby,\u201d he said. Ron Nirenberg, the independent mayor of San Antonio in Texas, said that forcing city officials to act as immigration agents would distract from their proper work. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, local law enforcement has their hands full dealing with local issues, we don\u2019t need them to be doing the jobs of state and federal authorities.\u201d The mayor added that Trump\u2019s rhetoric was already spreading fear among legal immigrants in San Antonio, whose population is 64% Hispanic. \u201cPeople who are coming to the US through a legal asylum process are being forced to live in the shadows under threat of mass deportation that sends ripples of fear through families and neighborhoods.\u201d Progressive prosecutors who fail to abide by Trump\u2019s hardline approach \u2013 whether by abolishing cash bail requirements that disproportionately hit people of color, or by avoiding custodial sentences for lesser crimes \u2013 are also in his sights. He threatens in Agenda47 to instruct the justice department to carry out investigations into \u201cradical Marxist prosecutors\u201d in cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco to see if they have \u201cillegally engaged in race-based law enforcement\u201d. Prosecutors are exploring how to protect their offices against a second-term Trump attack. Beth McCann, the Democratic district attorney of Denver, Colorado, joined a simulation exercise over the summer held by the Brennan Center for Justice that examined responses to a range of threats, including Trump sending in the national guard into cities. Krasner said that the potential of a Trump return to the White House had \u201creminded all of us who are progressive prosecutors that we have two jobs: to ensure public safety and justice, and secondly, to defend democracy\u201d. The irony, Krasner said, was that Trump is justifying his aggression towards cities based on rising violent crime, when in fact homicides are down by more than 40% in Philadelphia this year. A report by the thinktank Third Way has found that for 23 consecutive years the murder rate has been higher in Republican states that have voted for Trump than in Democratic states. \u201cThe reality is that reform prosecution makes us safer,\u201d Krasner said. \u201cThe policies that Trump represents \u2013 everybody should have a gun, mass incarceration is good, more division between rich and poor \u2013 get your ass killed in Republican states.\u201d"

            "content": "A military training ground with tanks charging around, explosions and gunfire hardly seems a haven for wild plants, but the Ministry of Defence\u2019s Salisbury Plain site is exceptional. The training ground is the largest remaining area of semi-natural chalk grassland left in north-west Europe, an area of 150 sq miles (380 sq km), the size of the Isle of Wight. It is home to rare plants unique to chalkland and one of the richest ecosystems for plant diversity in Europe. The military have been using Salisbury Plain for more than 100 years, so the land has escaped the ravages of intensive agriculture, including fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and ploughing. Perhaps most surprising is how tanks churning up the ground helps to create diverse habitats, especially where bare chalk is exposed and becomes colonised by specialised plants, such as kidney vetch and small scabious. It is a hotspot for the critically endangered pink flowering red hemp nettle, which grows along the edges of the tank paths, and the viper\u2019s bugloss which, with its deep blue flowers, thrives where the ground has been roughed up and the plant\u2019s seeds dispersed by the vehicles."

            "title": "Israeli military deploys fourth division in Lebanon ground offensive",
            "date": "2024-10-08T22:32:04Z",
            "content": "Israel has said it is expanding its ground operation in Lebanon with the deployment of a fourth division after another night of intense airstrikes across the south and east of the country. The reservist 146th division was sent to southern Lebanon overnight, hours after Israel announced the mobilisation of a third standing division, meaning the number of troops on the ground is now likely to number 15,000. Launching what it has called Operation Northern Arrows last week, the Israeli army said the ground offensive would involve \u201climited, localised and targeted raids\u201d to remove Hezbollah infrastructure along the disputed de facto border between the two countries, known as the blue line. However, the rapid deployment of four divisions operating across south Lebanon, alongside evacuation orders for Lebanese villages on the coast upwards of 20 miles from the blue line and the intensive bombing of the country\u2019s south and east and the capital, suggests Israel is preparing for a wider push north against the Lebanese militia. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday threatened Lebanon with \u201cdestruction\u201d such as Israel has already wreaked in Gaza. \u201cYou have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,\u201d he said in a video address directed to the people of Lebanon. \u201cI say to you, the people of Lebanon: Free your country from Hezbollah so that this war can end.\u201d In a defiant speech on Tuesday, Hezbollah\u2019s acting secretary general, Naim Qassem, said the group\u2019s military capabilities were still functional despite two weeks of heavy Israeli airstrikes, including Beirut bombings that killed the group\u2019s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and much of the militia\u2019s top command. \u201cYou see that our daily accomplishments are great. Hundreds of rockets and dozens of aircraft [drones], a great number of [Israeli] settlements and cities have come under rocket fire \u2026 I would like to reassure you that our capabilities are fine,\u201d he said. Hezbollah had replaced all of its senior commanders, he said, and Israeli ground troops had not made any advances after a week of fighting. However, Netanyahu, claimed the IDF had killed Hashem Safieddine, the man expected to replace the late Nasrallah. \u201cWe\u2019ve degraded Hezbollah\u2019s capabilities. We took out thousands of terrorists, including Nasrallah himself and Nasrallah\u2019s replacement, and the replacement of the replacement,\u201d Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video message. It was not immediately clear whom Netanyahu meant by the \u201creplacement of the replacement\u201d. Hezbollah has not confirmed Safieddine\u2019s death. The IDF said that it had also killed Suhail Husseini, responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management, the night before. There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah, but about 85 projectiles were launched towards the northern Israeli city of Haifa from Lebanon on Tuesday morning. Most of the projectiles were intercepted by Israel\u2019s air defence systems. Two Israeli airstrikes hit Beirut\u2019s Shia-majority southern suburbs almost immediately after Qassem\u2019s speech. There were reports of a \u201cmassive airstrike\u201d in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley, about 30km east of Beirut, on Tuesday night, and at least four strikes on Dahiyeh, the southern suburb of Beirut where Nasrallah was killed. Elsewhere, the Syrian government said seven civilians were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Damascus, that a war monitor said targeted a building used by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah. The defence ministry said women and children were among the dead and the toll was preliminary as rescuers were still combing the rubble. None of the dead were Iranian, the Iranian embassy in Damascus said. At least 1,400 Lebanese people, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million \u2013 about a quarter of the population \u2013 have been driven from their homes since fighting escalated three weeks ago. The Lebanese health ministry said at least 36 people had been killed in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours, with 150 people being injured. Israel says the operation\u2019s goal is to allow approximately 60,000 displaced people to return to their homes across northern Israel after a year of simmering cross-border fighting. Hezbollah began firing on Israel in solidarity with its Palestinian allies a day after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack last year that triggered the new war in Gaza and now threatens to drag in Iran and the US. In a statement on Tuesday, the anniversary of Hezbollah\u2019s involvement, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN\u2019s special coordinator for Lebanon, and Lt Gen Aroldo L\u00e1zaro of Unifil, the head of the peacekeeping force on the blue line, called for a \u201cnegotiated solution\u201d to end the latest round of violence. \u201cNear-daily exchanges of fire have escalated into a relentless military campaign whose humanitarian impact is nothing short of catastrophic,\u201d the statement said. \u201cA negotiated solution is the only pathway to restore the security and stability that civilians on both sides so desperately want and deserve \u2026 The time to act is now.\u201d The region is still waiting for Israel\u2019s response to an unprecedented missile attack from Iran last week, launched in support of its Lebanese ally after Israel\u2019s ground invasion. Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said in an interview with CNN late on Monday: \u201cEverything is on the table. Israel has capabilities to hit targets near and far \u2013 we have proved it.\u201d Israel is consulting Washington, its most important ally, over how to retaliate against Tehran without triggering an even stronger response. The New York Times, citing US officials, said the US believed Israel would prioritise attacking military bases and intelligence sites before nuclear facilities. A Pentagon spokesperson announced on Tuesday night that Gallant had cancelled plans for a visit to Washington to meet his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Wednesday. Netanyahu reportedly told Gallant his trip would not be approved until the Israeli prime minister has a phone call with Joe Biden to discuss the response to Iran\u2019s missile attack, and until the Israeli security cabinet approves the plan. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, earlier warned against a new Israeli attack. Fighting also continues to rage in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes killed 17 people in a refugee camp in the centre of the Palestinian territory on Tuesday, medics said. At least 15 people, including two women and four children, were killed on Tuesday in ground fighting in the Jabaliya neighbourhood of Gaza City, the nearby Kamal Adwan hospital said, after new Israeli evacuation orders for the city were issued on Monday. The IDF has intensified bombing of the area and moved in tanks. The Israeli military said it killed about 20 militants in Jabaliya and located a large quantity of weapons, including grenades and rifles. Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas\u2019s armed wing, said in a speech on the anniversary of the 7 October attack that the group would \u201ckeep up the fight in a long war of attrition, one that is painful and costly for the enemy\u201d. Hamas fired a barrage of longer-range rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday\u2019s anniversary, underscoring that the group\u2019s military capabilities are eroded but not yet defunct after a year of war. A total of 1,205 people were killed on 7 October and 251 taken hostage. Another 41,965 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliatory war in Gaza over the past year, which has also drawn in militia groups allied to Iran in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Israeli media outlets reported earlier this week that government officials have not met to discuss the stalled ceasefire and hostage swap negotiations aimed at ending the war in Gaza for more than two weeks."

            "date": "2024-10-05T06:39:03Z",
            "content": "A series of explosions were heard over Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs early on Saturday after the Israeli military demanded evacuations for some areas while Hezbollah said it was engaged in continued clashes with Israeli troops in the Lebanon border area. Israel said on Friday it had targeted the intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut and was assessing the damage after a series of strikes on senior figures in the militant group that Iran\u2019s supreme leader condemned as counterproductive. Media affiliated with Hamas, meanwhile, reported on Saturday that a leader of its armed wing was killed with three family members in an Israeli strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. It named the al-Qassam Brigades leader as Saeed Atallah. Israel did not immediately comment on the strike. In Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, a blast was heard and smoke seen early on Saturday, Reuters witnesses said, as the Israeli military issued three warnings for residents of the area to immediately evacuate. The first alert warned residents in a building in the Burj al-Barajneh neighbourhood and the second in a building in Choueifat district, while the third alert mentioned buildings in Haret Hreik as well as Burj al-Barajneh. Iran-backed Hezbollah said the Israeli army was trying to infiltrate the southern Lebanese town of Odaisseh, where clashes continued. Israel has been weighing options in its response to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack on Tuesday, which Iran had carried out in response to Israeli military action in Lebanon. Oil prices have risen on the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran\u2019s oil facilities. The air attack on Beirut, part of a wider assault that has driven more than 1.2 million Lebanese from their homes, was reported to have targeted the potential successor to Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, killed by Israel a week ago. Hashem Safieddine\u2019s fate was unclear immediately afterwards. The US president, Joe Biden, said on Friday that if he were in Israel\u2019s shoes he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oilfields, adding that he thought Israel had not yet concluded how to respond to Iran. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told a crowd in Tehran that Iran and its regional allies would not back down. Israel\u2019s adversaries in the region should \u201cdouble your efforts and capabilities \u2026 and resist the aggressive enemy\u201d, Khamenei said in a rare appearance leading Friday prayers, at which he mentioned Nasrallah and called Iran\u2019s attack on Israel legal and legitimate. The semi-official Iranian news agency SNN quoted Revolutionary Guards deputy commander Ali Fadavi as saying on Friday that if Israel attacked, Iran would target Israeli energy and gas installations. The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as Unifil, said on Saturday that it would not leave positions in the country\u2019s south despite what it said was an Israeli request to relocate from some of them. \u201cPeacekeepers remain in all positions and the UN flag continues to fly,\u201d it said. Lebanon\u2019s government says more than 2,000 people have been killed there in the past year, with most in the past two weeks. A UN spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, called the toll on civilians \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. The Israeli military said about 70 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israeli territory on Friday evening and were either intercepted or fell in open land. The US state department said an American was killed in Lebanon this week and Washington was working to understand the circumstances. Kamel Ahmad Jawad, from Michigan, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday, according to his daughter, a friend and the US congresswoman representing his district. Hezbollah said early on Saturday it was engaged in clashes with Israeli troops in the Lebanon border area, after earlier saying it forced Israeli soldiers to retreat there. \u201cIsraeli enemy soldiers renewed an attempt to advance towards the vicinity of the municipality in the village of Adaysseh\u201d and Hezbollah fighters confronted the attempt \u201cand clashes are continuing\u201d, the group said. Its fighters had forced Israeli troops to \u201cretreat\u201d in the same area, it said earlier. Hezbollah also said it targeted troops in south Lebanon\u2019s Yarun area with a \u201crocket salvo\u201d, as well as soldiers in two points across the border with rockets. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging near-daily cross-border fire for almost a year, with the group saying it is acting in support of Palestinian ally Hamas over the Gaza war. Israel, saying it is targeting Hezbollah in order to make Israel\u2019s northern area safe for the return of displaced people, has intensified its bombardment and this week announced its troops had started ground raids into parts of southern Lebanon.

            "date": "2024-10-19T19:00:23Z",
            "content": "Some nights, when the wind blows from the east, Yvonne Johnstone goes to sleep to the hum of the Tarong power station. Occasionally, she finds ash from the coal-fired plant scattered among the vegetables and fruit trees of her five-acre block. \u201cIt forms a ring,\u201d she says. \u201cAs if it\u2019s gone up in a cloud and then fallen\u201d. Johnstone doesn\u2019t think twice about it \u2013 but what of federal opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s proposal to build a nuclear reactor within cooee of her smartly painted, corrugated iron home? Dutton and the Coalition\u2019s proposal is to build seven nuclear power plants across Australia along with two proposed small modular reactors. The opposition wants them in Tarong and Callide in Queensland; Mount Piper and Liddell in New South Wales; Collie in Western Australia; Loy Yang in Victoria; and the former site of the Northern power station in Port Paterson, South Australia. The sites are mostly in Coalition seats. The Queensland LNP\u2019s leader, David Crisafulli, facing an election, has been steadfast in his defiance of Dutton\u2019s plan for the Queensland sites. He says he would oppose them if elected at the 26 October poll and has repeatedly ruled out repealing the state\u2019s nuclear ban under any circumstances. But Dutton, a fellow Queenslander, has previously suggested overriding state legislation. \u201cWhen you hear nuclear, of course you start to panic,\u201d Johnstone, a retired biscuit factory worker, says. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that they can\u2019t just have something that dangerous in a suburb. \u201cI\u2019m a person that buries her head in the sand, I suppose, and gets on with what I want to do\u201d. Suburb is a generous description for the couple of dozen acreages hacked into the Tarong forest \u2013 and not everyone here is so comfortable at the prospect of living in the shadow of a nuclear power plant. Her neighbour, Brian Collison, concisely explains why. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cChernobyl,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know? Big hole in the ground that no one can do anything about?\u201d The 65-year-old farmhand moved to his Tarong block 22 years ago, drawn to its wildlife and proximity to both bush and the corn and peanut fields he works. Collison is no greenie. \u201cPeople make me laugh, they go and buy an electric car and plug it into a power point. Well, where does the power come from?\u201d he says, pointing in the direction of the coal plant. And if the power station and adjacent Meandu coalmine were closed down tomorrow, he says, nearby Nanango would \u201cturn into a ghost town\u201d. Still, Collison can see the energy transition occurring rapidly before his eyes, with several large-scale solar and windfarms being built in this rich agricultural region to Brisbane\u2019s north-west. With renewables \u201call going ahead\u201d, Collison says a gradual transition from coal to solar and wind is \u201ca no-brainer\u201d. \u201cSo, to me, why do you want to build a monster?\u201d Collison does not believe Crisafulli when he says he would defy his party\u2019s federal leader \u2013 should both be elected \u2013 and reject Dutton\u2019s nuclear vision. On this basis alone, the farmhand will vote for Labor at Queensland\u2019s state election this 26 October. He will be in the minority, however, according to John Cole, a emeritus professor at the University of Southern Queensland. Cole grew up not far from here and well knows the electorate long ruled by Kingaroy peanut farmer \u2013 and Queensland\u2019s longest-serving premier \u2013 Joh Bjelke-Petersen. \u201cHell will freeze over before Kingaroy votes Labor,\u201d Cole says. Crisafulli, though, is brooking no distractions as he seeks to become just the second conservative leader to win a majority of seats at a Queensland election in 38 years. \u201c[Crisafulli] needs nuclear energy like a hole in the head,\u201d Cole says. For some, that small-target strategy is working. In the village of Maidenwell, about 15km south-west of Tarong at the foothills of the Bunya Mountains, inside an old garage that has been converted to a bar, diner and gift shop, there is unease about the prospect of nuclear industry in the neighbourhood \u2013 but also some wind at its back. Perched alone at the bar is a David \u201cBushie\u201d Stewart, his long white beard flowing from under a battered felt hat and clad in a blue singlet revealing arms full of tattoos. Cracking his tinnies from behind the bar is Peter Henry. Both are retired from working in the nearby coalmine and power station; both would prefer that plants be kept online while there is coal to be dug. Henry worries about how much water a nuclear station would need to draw and whether it would have a target on it in the event of conflict. A young cook, Blake, chips in from the kitchen with his two cents\u2019 worth. \u201cI\u2019d prefer it to be out woop woop,\u201d he says of a nuclear plant. \u201cThis is woop woop,\u201d Bushie counters from the bar. \u201cMore woop woop,\u201d Blake says. Peter\u2019s wife, Deborah Henry, who runs this and two other tourism-related businesses into which she has invested her life savings, is the most forthright in expressing her fears. \u201cAny human error and we\u2019ll be dead, or we\u2019ll have cancer,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I came out here for the fresh air\u201d. But Crisafulli\u2019s anti-nuclear stance has satisfied Henry. She\u2019ll be voting LNP. Tarong\u2019s power station is largely hidden from view by forest, but five hours\u2019 north up the Burnett Highway, signs point towards a scenic lookout of the open cut coalmine and coal-fired Callide power plant. Taking in the view, dressed in blue jeans, a high viz top, her blond hair in a ponytail, is Ann Lederhose. The sales representative for a company that services the mining, oil and gas industries, she is about to drive 115km east to her home in Gladstone. Lederhose is sympathetic to communities and families reliant on its jobs, but says coal-fired power stations are \u201cvery much a thing of the past\u201d. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep digging shit out of the ground and burning it,\u201d she says. \u201cOr coal anyway.\u201d Uranium, though, is a different matter. Nuclear energy, she believes, \u201cis the way we are going to have to go\u201d. Lederhose agrees too with advocates who propose a nuclear plant at Gladstone, saying it would be a \u201csensible solution\u201d for the port city home to the state\u2019s largest coal-fired power plant. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dirty industry there that puts a lot of emissions out,\u201d she says. \u201cSo anything that they can do to clean that environment would be a massive bonus.\u201d Opposition to renewables is also more overt around Callide. Anti-renewable signs dot the landscape, including at the front gate of nearby farmer Darren Jensen\u2019s property \u201cGrandview\u201d \u2013 a vista that includes Callide\u2019s smoking stacks and cooling towers, just a few kilometres away. \u201cI\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Jensen says of the power station. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have a problem with nuclear being there at all. \u201cYou go all over Europe and all over America and there\u2019s nuclear power stations operating safely everywhere.\u201d Jensen does, however, have a problem with the burgeoning solar and wind industries. As well as the loss of arable land, Jensen\u2019s worries include the impact of high voltage towers upon land value, clearing of natural habitat and less secure jobs and more waste associated with ageing panels and turbines. \u201cMore often than not\u201d an LNP voter, Jensen says he may cast a protest vote for One Nation on energy. \u201cMy personal preference is nuclear, I reckon it\u2019s a great technology,\u201d he says. \u201cBut why rush? Keep burning coal until we can have that technology available.\u201d Dr Amanda Cahill, the chief executive of the not-for-profit The Next Economy, is picking up on angst at renewable energy in the regions and says \u201cnuclear is catching on more than some people expected\u201d. And she can understand why. Cahill says the climate wars that engulfed Australian politics for at least the decade to 2022 meant many discussions around energy transition were held \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d. So the money and projects now pouring into the renewable sector has caught some communities by surprise. But \u201cthis whole conversation\u201d about nuclear, Cahill says, is only adding fuel to a climate of \u201cconfusion and chaos and uncertainty\u201d. \u201cAnd it\u2019s making people nervous.\u201d"

Almost all novelists, including former bestselling authors and prize-winners, now face a daily struggle to maintain income and confidence. Fiction, especially literary fiction, has always been akin to gathering samphire, but we find ourselves squeezed both by the high prices that publishers insist on (which bestsellers get discounted by up to 50%) and also by the fashion for Irish writers who have already enjoyed a level of Arts Council support in their own country that we in Britain can only marvel at. Those of us below the \u201cgolden generation\u201d of the 1980s will simply not survive if this continues.

            "title": "Gambling poses huge global threat to public health, experts warn",
            "date": "2024-10-24T22:30:02Z",
            "content": "Gambling poses a growing worldwide threat to public health, with its rapid expansion via mobile phones and the internet harming far more people than previously thought, a report warns. Much stronger global regulatory controls are urgently needed to curb the impact of commercial gambling on global health and wellbeing, a group of leading experts in gambling, public health, global health and regulatory policy concluded. About 450 million people have at least one behavioural symptom or have experienced a harmful personal, social or health consequence of gambling, the 45-page report from the Lancet public health commission on gambling found. Of those, at least 80 million people suffer from gambling disorder, a mental health condition identified by a pattern of repeated and continuous betting despite negative consequences on a person\u2019s life. The estimates of the numbers experiencing significant harm to their health as a result of gambling are likely to be conservative, the experts said. Incredibly sophisticated marketing, ever-widening easy access to the internet and mobile phones are enabling the gambling industry to reach more people than ever before. These included adolescents and younger children who were routinely exposed to advertising of gambling products in ways that were unprecedented before the digital revolution, the report found. Prof Heather Wardle, the co-chair of the commission, said the huge global threat posed to public health was rooted in the fast changing nature of gambling. \u201cMost people think of a traditional Las Vegas casino or buying a lottery ticket when they think of gambling. They don\u2019t think of large technology companies deploying a variety of techniques to get more people to engage more frequently with a commodity that can pose substantial risks to health, but this is the reality of gambling today,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone with a mobile phone now has access to what is essentially a casino in their pocket, 24 hours a day. Highly sophisticated marketing and technology make it easier to start, and harder to stop gambling, and many products now use design mechanics to encourage repeated and longer engagement.\u201d Wardle, a specialist in gambling research, policy and practice from the University of Glasgow, added: \u201cThe global growth trajectory of this industry is phenomenal; collectively we need to wake up and take action. If we delay, gambling and gambling harms will become even more widely embedded as a global phenomenon and much harder to tackle.\u201d A systematic review and meta analysis conducted for the commission estimated that gambling disorder affected 15.8% of adults and 26.4% of adolescents who used online casino or slot products, and 8.9% of adults and 16.3% of adolescents who gambled using sports betting products. Online casino and online sports betting are two of the most rapidly expanding areas for commercial gambling globally, the report found. Commercial gambling is clearly associated with financial losses and the risk of financial ruin, but it is also associated with physical and mental health problems, relationship and family breakdown, heightened risk of suicide and domestic violence, increased crime against property and people, and loss of employment, the experts concluded. The commission report noted that this impact was not spread evenly through populations, and specific groups faced an \u201celevated risk\u201d of harms including adolescents and younger children who were routinely exposed to advertising of gambling products. In addition, gambling is often embedded into the architecture of video games. Dr Kristiana Siste, one of the report\u2019s experts, said: \u201cWe need to take action to protect children from the harms of gambling. We know that early exposure to gambling increases the risk of developing gambling disorders later in life, and children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the allure of easy money and the game-like designs of online gambling.\u201d The report also warned how a complex ecosystem enabled the multibillion dollar gambling industry to promote its products and protects its interests. This includes innovative digital marketing approaches rooted in \u201cdeep surveillance\u201d to target consumers online, as well as widespread sports and broadcast media sponsorship. The experts also raised concerns about how the betting industry undermined legitimate science on the impact of gambling, reframed discussions about its harmful effects to promote individual responsibility and consumer freedom, and influenced political processes around regulation. Prof Malcolm Sparrow, one of the experts behind the report, said the findings pointed to the need for increased regulation of gambling. \u201cWhile the industry continues to promote gambling as harmless entertainment, countries and communities are experiencing rapidly increasing threats from gambling harms. \u201cThe commission urges policymakers to treat gambling as a public health issue, just as we treat other addictive and unhealthy commodities such as alcohol and tobacco.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-24T07:02:46Z",
            "content": "A senior government nuclear safety official says the sites of coal-fired power plants \u201cmight not be adequate\u201d to house the opposition\u2019s proposed taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors. Government agencies and departmental officials were grilled in parliament on Wednesday at a government-backed inquiry into nuclear energy. The inquiry was tasked with scrutinising the Coalition\u2019s controversial plan to lift Australia\u2019s ban on nuclear power and build taxpayer-funded reactors at seven sites. Several officials told the inquiry it would take at least 10 to 15 years to start generating nuclear power once a future government confirmed an intention to build reactors. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has said the Coalition expects to be able to build a small reactor by 2035 or a larger reactor as early as 2037. The Coalition has said putting reactors at the sites of coal-fired power stations would reduce the need to build expensive transmission lines and towers to connect renewables to the grid. At Thursday\u2019s inquiry, the Nationals MP Darren Chester asked the chief regulatory officer of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, Jim Scott, if that approach could save time. Scott said it likely would, but added that this \u201cpresupposes that the sites of current coal-fired plants would be adequate for nuclear sites, because that might not be the case\u201d. He said: \u201cYou have to look at external events \u2013 flooding, natural events \u2013 that could occur. That\u2019s part of the siting process. Given that, the potential issue [is] that the sites of current coal-fired plants might not be adequate for nuclear plants.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Simon Duggan, a deputy secretary in the energy department, listed some of the steps that would be needed for nuclear to go ahead, including setting up management frameworks for health, safety, security, environmental impacts, as well as transport of nuclear fuels and waste, storage of waste and the workforce capability to build, maintain and regulate plants. \u201cBased on the work and the assessments that you have seen from bodies such as CSIRO and the [International Energy Agency] you are looking at around a 10- to 15-year timeframe to put all those prerequisites in place in order to have nuclear power capability in Australia,\u201d Duggan said. Many officers raised the issue of social licence and community consultation, saying this would be a critical step if any nuclear reactors were to be built in the future. The opposition energy spokesman, Ted O\u2019Brien, who is also deputy chair of the inquiry, attacked analysis from the energy department which the energy minister, Chris Bowen, said showed the Coalition\u2019s plan would mean a gap of at least 18% between electricity supply and demand. Duggan said the analysis was based on assumptions supplied by the minister, where there would be no new investment in renewable energy, and that coal-fired power stations would stick to the closure schedule assumed by the Australian Energy Market Operator. But O\u2019Brien said those assumptions, described by Bowen previously as reflecting Coalition plans, were \u201cthe opposite\u201d of what they were planning and were \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d. He said the Coalition had made public statements \u201cwith respect to ensuring there\u2019s no premature closure of baseload power stations, more gas is poured into the grid and renewables continue to be rolled out\u201d. O\u2019Brien asked if Duggan was comfortable with how the minister had presented the analysis to the public. \u201cI am very comfortable,\u201d Duggan replied. Officials from Australia\u2019s Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency both said Australia had deep expertise in nuclear regulation, and did not see problems in expanding that to accommodate a future nuclear power sector. Clare Savage, chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, told the inquiry she did not believe nuclear could be deployed in enough time to cover the closure of coal-fired power plants, which she said were becoming increasingly less reliable as they aged. She told the inquiry that on the same day of the hearing, 26% of the total capacity of Australia\u2019s coal-fired power fleet was offline. Eleven per cent of the coal fleet was down due to unplanned outages, she said."

            "date": "2024-10-28T12:33:13Z",
            "content": "Lithuania\u2019s opposition Social Democratic party has promised to spend \u201cas much money as is needed\u201d on security and defence to counter a potential threat from Russia after it finished a comfortable first in Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections. \u201cOur election manifesto says it should be not less than 3.5% [of GDP], and this is unavoidable,\u201d the Social Democrat leader and MEP, Vilija Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117, said on Monday after her centre-left party won 52 seats in the 141-member parliament. The Baltic state, which shares a 179-mile (275km) border with Russia, has been one of the EU\u2019s strongest supporters of Kyiv and fiercest critics of Moscow under its outgoing conservative-led government. Blinkevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117 promised that would not change. Polls show as many as three-quarters of Lithuania\u2019s 2.8 million people believe it could be the target of a Russian invasion in the near future. The country is already among the top Nato spenders, allocating about 3% of its GDP to defence. According to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, Lithuania is also among the top three countries in terms of aid for Ukraine in relation to the size of its economy. The Social Democrats, who were last in power from 2012 to 2016, are expected to start negotiations on forming a coalition with the centre-left Union of Democrats \u201cFor Lithuania\u201d and the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union. The centre-right party of the outgoing prime minister, Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117, Homeland Union \u2013 Lithuanian Christian Democrats, finished second with 28 seats. Its leader, the foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, resigned on Monday. Analysts have suggested the Social Democrats\u2019 desired three-way coalition, which would have only a slim majority of 74 seats, may prove too fragile to last long without the backing of a new nationalist party, Nemunas Dawn, which won 20 seats. The Social Democrats have ruled out going into government with Nemunas Dawn, led by a former MP, Remigijus Zemaitaitis, who resigned last year over allegedly antisemitic comments and is on trial on charges of inciting hatred, which he denies. In Bulgaria, meanwhile, which also held parliamentary elections \u2013 its seventh in four years on Sunday, provisional results showed the centre-right GERB party of the former prime minister Boyko Borissov finished first with 26.5% of the votes. However, there seems little likelihood of stability returning to the EU\u2019s poorest member state, which has been in in political limbo since 2021 after massive anti-corruption protests in 2020 triggered the downfall of a Borisov-led cabinet. Six elections since then have failed to yield a sustainable government. The reformist coalition We Continue the Change came second on 14.7%, and the ultra-nationalist, pro-Russian Vazrazhdane (Revival) party a close third on 13.5%. Borissov, who served as prime minister for 13 years before his downfall, on Monday described his victory as \u201ccategorical\u201d, promised he was willing compromise and said he would \u201cwork together with everyone except Revival\u201d. But analysts predicted GERB would again struggle to find coalition partners in a fragmented parliament of nine different parties. Political uncertainty has held up the flow of badly needed EU funds into Bulgaria\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and already contributed to Bulgaria\u2019s plans to join the eurozone being twice pushed back. Turnout rose slightly to 38%, up on the 34% recorded in the previous election in June, but polls showed about 60% of Bulgarians found the continuing deadlock \u201cextremely alarming\u201d. Official results are not expected for several days. If confirmed, Borissov would be handed a mandate to try to form his fourth government \u2013 but the results, which are not significantly different from the six most recent elections, do not look promising and could lead to yet another vote."

            "date": "2024-10-05T16:00:28Z",
            "content": "Hopes to rein in private equity investment in healthcare died in California last weekend, as a nationally watched bill was vetoed by the Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. The bill was the nation\u2019s most high-profile legislative effort to regulate such investments in healthcare, and would have given the state attorney general discretion to deny mergers. Its demise comes amid US Senate hearings over mismanagement at Steward Health, a chain of more than 30 private equity-backed hospitals in Massachusetts whose CEO and investors siphoned \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars from community hospitals even as they developed one of the worst patient care records in the country. \u201cWe\u2019re really disappointed to see this bill was vetoed,\u201d said Katie Van Deynze, a legislative advocate for Health Access California, a consumer advocacy coalition that lobbied in favor of the bill. \u201cThere are a lot of other states and folks who were watching this.\u201d The bill received an endorsement this summer from Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, the agency responsible for enforcing antitrust regulations. A dozen other US states, including red states such as Indiana, either have merger review laws on the books or considered similar legislation this year. Private equity investors have gained an enormous foothold in American healthcare in the last decade, buying up $1tn worth of physician practices, hospitals, specialty practices and even hospice centers. California alone has seen $20bn in private equity investment. The bill, formally known as AB 3129, would have required private equity and hedge fund-backed buyers of certain healthcare businesses to seek the state attorney general\u2019s approval 90 days before a deal was slated to close, and given the attorney general the option to deny such mergers. The bill would have also prohibited investor-owners from interfering with professional medical judgment of providers from dentists to psychiatrists, strengthening so-called corporate practice of medicine laws. That kind of power could have altered the playing field for regulators, who often have little power to challenge mergers until organizations grow into behemoths or display anticompetitive behavior. In response to a request for comment, the private equity lobbying group the American Investment Council directed the Guardian to a statement saying it \u201capplauds\u201d the Newsom veto. \u201cOur coalition worked hard to ensure California leaders recognize and support private equity\u2019s essential role in improving health care in California,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Governor\u2019s well-reasoned decision will help patients and communities continue to have access to quality care.\u201d In a letter explaining the veto, Newsom said: \u201cI appreciate the author\u2019s continued efforts and partnership to increase oversight of California\u2019s healthcare system\u201d. However, he argued that a recently created state agency should instead oversee healthcare consolidation. \u201cFor these reasons, I cannot sign this bill.\u201d Newsom is an important surrogate for Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has a track record of critically examining such consolidation in healthcare. As attorney general of California, Harris intervened to stop mega-mergers and oversaw settlements against major players, such as Quest Diagnostics laboratories and McKesson, a medical supplies behemoth. Private equity investment received special scrutiny this year as the indignities of patients at Steward Healthcare have come to light, following an investigative series by the Boston Globe. At Steward, reporters and now legislators have documented how investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from hospitals, even as many lacked staff and basic supplies. In recent testimony before the US Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee, a nurse recounted how the hospital was so stingy that it lacked \u201cbereavement boxes\u201d, containers specially designed for infants\u2019 remains. \u201cSteward didn\u2019t pay the vendor and there weren\u2019t any bereavement boxes,\u201d said a former Steward nurse, Ellen MacInnis, as she paused to gather emotions. \u201cAnd nurses were forced to put babies\u2019 remains in cardboard shipping boxes.\u201d At the same time, academic research is beginning to reveal the disadvantages such ownership structures appear to present for patients. Patient care, \u201cis intrinsically a human endeavor, it is intrinsically an art practiced with a bond of trust ideally between a patient and a clinician\u201d, said Dr Zirui Song, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard University and a general practitioner at Massachusetts general hospital. Song was lead author of a 2023 Jama study examining private equity-owned hospitals. The research studied preventable injuries and illnesses in more than 662,000 hospitalizations at 51 private equity-backed hospitals. Researchers compared those hospital stays with 4.1m hospitalizations at 259 control hospitals. All of the data was derived from Medicare, the federal public health insurance program covering people older than 65 and the disabled. Researchers found a more than 25% increase in incidents such as falls and infections of central lines, tubes inserted near the heart to deliver medicine, fluids and nutrition. That happened even though private equity-backed hospitals tended to admit more socioeconomically advantaged patients. \u201cWe should be seeing fewer complications and yet we\u2019re seeing an increase in complications,\u201d said Song. Increased charges and billing, another well-documented strategy firms use to extract profit, are ultimately paid by \u201csociety as a whole\u201d, because healthcare is primarily financed through taxes and wages foregone by employees who receive private insurance. \u201cThis bill was fought at every point by mostly the private equity folks, but also others that didn\u2019t want any of their investment opportunities hamstrung,\u201d said Rachel Linn Gish, communications director at Health Access California. For instance, the state\u2019s hospital association opposed AB 3129 even after lawmakers exempted hospitals from the oversight, Van Deynze said. \u201cOur argument has always been: we\u2019re not preventing private equity from buying hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices,\u201d said Gish. \u201cAll we want is to make sure there\u2019s not going to be a decrease in access and increase in price \u2026 If you continue to provide good and quality healthcare you shouldn\u2019t face any issues.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-25T05:00:12Z",
            "content": "The value of the UK\u2019s private healthcare market rose to a record \u00a312.4bn last year as long NHS waiting lists fuelled demand from individuals and the health service paid for nearly \u00a33.5bn of procedures to help ease the care backlog. As private medical insurance boomed, total revenues generated in the independent healthcare sector hit an all-time high in real terms pegged to 2003 prices, research revealed. The total value of work done in hospitals, clinics and by privately practising doctors, including cataract removals, knee surgery and MRI scans, was \u00a31bn higher than in 2022, according to the latest report by the health data provider LaingBuisson. More patients went private last year as the NHS waiting list peaked at 7.77 million in September, up sharply from 4.57 million at the end of 2019. Increasing numbers took out private medical insurance to fund their treatment, while there has been a decline in those paying out of their own pockets, LaingBuisson said. To help clear the backlog, the NHS paid more to private providers to offer treatments. It spent \u00a32.1bn in private hospitals last year \u2013 up from \u00a31.9bn in 2022 \u2013 accounting for nearly a third of their revenues, compared with 10% two decades ago. The NHS spent a further \u00a31.5bn at private clinics. Of 1.3m procedures carried out by private hospitals and clinics in 2023, nearly 445,000 were funded by the health service, the report found. Cataract surgery is the most common private procedure, costing about \u00a32,000 for private payers and less for NHS contracts. Chemotherapy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopies, colonoscopies, hip replacements, knee arthroscopies and replacements and hernia repair were the top private procedures. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, wants to use the private sector to cut the NHS care backlog. This week, he said delays within the health service spelled a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for some NHS patients, as Keir Starmer stressed the need for more use of AI and technology. Private acute hospitals made revenue of \u00a36.7bn last year, up from nearly \u00a36bn the year before. The five largest operators accounted for three-quarters of these revenues. The FTSE 250-listed firm Spire Healthcare and the Abu Dhabi-owned Circle Health Group are the two biggest, followed by the US company HCA Healthcare\u2019s UK arm, the UK charity Nuffield Health and Australia\u2019s Ramsay Health Care UK. The top four hospital groups have an annual turnover of \u00a31bn or more. Private clinics and privately practising doctors generated revenue of \u00a34.9bn in 2023, while the NHS made \u00a3700m from treating non-NHS patients and international visitors \u2013 known as \u201cembassy patients\u201d \u2013 at private patient units, primarily in London, such as the Royal Marsden hospital in west London. Tim Read, the co-author of the report, said: \u201cIncreasingly we are seeing people willing to find alternatives rather than waiting to be seen on the NHS. Independent hospitals are seeing a continued boom in people claiming against health insurance entitlements, whilst independent clinics offering lower cost treatments \u2013 whether it\u2019s cataract surgery or a diagnostic scan \u2013 are becoming an increasingly common sight on high streets across England, not just in more affluent areas traditionally associated with private healthcare.\u201d The two specialties with the longest NHS waits \u2013 ophthalmology and orthopaedics \u2013 continue to see the biggest boom in private healthcare. The NHS is now paying for more cataract surgery to be carried out by private eye clinics than it performs itself. The number of eye clinics has jumped since 2020, with Newmedica, SpaMedica, CHEC and Optegra all opening more sites. However, doctors have argued that the cataract boom means that there is less NHS funding to treat more serious conditions that can lead to blindness. David Hare, who runs the industry body Independent Healthcare Providers Network, said: \u201cPrivate healthcare is now becoming increasingly relevant to many more millions of people\u2019s lives, with \u2018going private\u2019 now the \u2018new normal\u2019.\u201d"

The former president proposed a reform plan in the 2020 budget that said it supported \u201cseveral initiatives to empower States and consumers to regain control over healthcare and increase affordability and consumer choice\u201d. The plan incorporated a repeal of the ACA\u2019s premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion, replacing them with a block grant to states, and would have capped federal spending on Medicaid. The plan could have reduced federal healthcare spending by more than $1tn over a decade. In their election platform, Democrats argue that more than 20 million Americans have gained healthcare coverage and that the uninsured rate has been cut almost in half under Obamacare, including 2.3 million young adults. They note that healthcare discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is now illegal. \u201cDemocrats have been fighting to secure universal health care for the American people for generations, and we are proud to be the party that passed Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the policy statement reads.

Medicare Advantage plans can be enticing because they often include food or transportation cards, $0 monthly premiums for drugs benefits, and hearing, vision and dental benefits \u2013 none of which are included in traditional Medicare. Kinsell notes that the problems usually start when people get sick. \u201cPatients have been unable to get into rehab, or stay,\u201d she said. Others were charged $50 a day for rehab when the service is normally free for a short period in traditional Medicare. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time in our district office with seniors who got hoodwinked by these corporate insurance plans,\u201d said Democratic US representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington state. Jayapal has called for \u201curgent reforms\u201d and consumer protections to be added to Medicare Advantage. \u201cThey took the name \u2013 so seniors actually think they\u2019re signing up for Medicare,\u201d she said. Despite complaints from doctors and patients, fraud investigations, allegations insurers used artificial intelligence models to deny care to seniors, and a pile of evidence that Medicare Advantage costs taxpayers more, Republicans have continued to boost the program. The most specific healthcare policy proposals are set forth by Project 2025, the conservative playbook by the Heritage Foundation. Amid a thicket of gripes about vaccine mandates and no less than 199 mentions of abortion, the document also proposes further privatizing Medicare through Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage \u201cprovides beneficiaries with a wide range of competitive health plan choices \u2013 a richer set of benefits than traditional Medicare provides and at a reasonable cost\u201d, Project 2025 argues. Republicans should make it the default enrollment option and \u201cremove burdensome policies that micromanage\u201d plans, the document said. The document also proposes to \u201cgive beneficiaries direct control of how they spend Medicare dollars\u201d, which Democrats argue describes a voucher program, something Republicans tried to push in the Trump administration. \u201cThat has been the playbook for privatization of Medicare really since these corporate Medicare \u2018dis-Advantage\u2019 plans \u2013 that\u2019s what I call them \u2013 started,\u201d said Jayapal. \u201cIt was their in-road.\u201d That, like a lot of Donald Trump\u2019s proposals, is likely to cost the federal government a lot of money. \u201cThe federal government is significantly overpaying Medicare Advantage plans in relation to what it spends on an individual and traditional Medicare \u2013 without corresponding significant gains to show for it,\u201d said David Lipschutz, co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Studies show Medicare Advantage plans will cost the federal government an estimated $83bn more than traditional Medicare in 2024 without corresponding improvements in health, according to the congressionally commissioned nonpartisan research agency Medicare Payment Advisory Council. Using default enrollment could increase that cost to an additional $2tn over 10 years, according to the left-leaning Center for American Progress. The stakes for private health insurers are equally huge. One of the largest Medicare Advantage providers, United Healthcare, earned 46% of its $281bn in total revenue from Medicare Advantage enrollees, even though they represent only 15% of the company\u2019s beneficiaries, an Accountable.US analysis found. The analysis was shared exclusively with the Guardian. \u201cThe fact this is becoming something conservatives are trying to push as a universal model is alarming, because it\u2019s a way to just increase profits for insurance companies,\u201d said Tony Carrk, Accountable.US executive director. Problems with the program are so acute that, at one point in 2022, eight of the 10 largest insurance companies selling Medicare Advantage plans were defendants in federal fraud or whistleblower lawsuits. \u201cPart of the problem of having private plans involved in Medicare, or really any healthcare space, is the promise they could provide better care more efficiently,\u201d Lipschutz said. \u201cAnd neither has happened.\u201d Although the Republican deficit hawks of yesteryear might balk at such a cost, the proposal to further privatize Medicare goes to a long-held Republican philosophy that survived Trumpism: the government is inherently untrustworthy and regular people need a financial reason to do the right thing. \u201cThe problem with the left is they don\u2019t think in economic terms,\u201d said John Goodman, an economist who has advised nearly every Republican presidential candidate on health since George W Bush. He said he is currently working with America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump thinktank. Philosophically, Goodman believes Americans need \u201ceconomic incentives\u201d to do the right thing. For patients, for example someone who is diabetic, that might mean low-cost insulin (a carrot) and the specter of a big bill if you don\u2019t manage your diabetes and end up in the hospital (a stick). For doctors, it might mean jumping through bureaucratic hoops to get approval for a procedure, called prior authorization, to avoid being wasteful. Critics argue debates about \u201ceconomic incentives\u201d mask what are in fact \u201ccatastrophic\u201d health costs. Medicare Advantage plans are allowed to require patients to spend as much as $13,300 per year for out-of-network providers in 2024. More than one-third of all Medicare Advantage enrollees live on less than $10,000 per year, according to the Commonwealth Fund. Nearly 95% of all seniors have a chronic health condition, and more than 78% have two or more, according to the National Council on Aging. Although Trump has disavowed Project 2025, he has deep ties to its authors. Its health proposals were written by Roger Severino, his own former director of the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services. Notably, Goodman thought Project 2025 was a \u201cpoor document\u201d whose many references to abortion would turn voters off. But he agrees with proposals on Medicare. In the 2024 GOP Platform, Trump pledged to, \u201cnot cut one penny from Medicare\u201d, but does not provide further specifics. That comports with the Project 2025 plan \u2013 which would require a lot more money to expand Medicare Advantage enrollment. For Goodman, there is at least one piece of humor in this branch of health policy \u2013 the idea that the left would propose a health system where people don\u2019t have to pay for healthcare. \u201cIn fact, the Bernie Sanders types do not think economic incentives should play any role in healthcare,\u201d Goodman said. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024 to clarify that most people pay a standard monthly rate of $174.70 for both Medicare and Medicare Advantage, rather than just the former, as was previously written."

            "title": "Lebanese healthcare workers fearful as growing numbers killed in strikes",
            "date": "2024-10-03T16:48:06Z",
            "content": "The airstrikes started just before noon. The injured and the dead quickly followed. As the ground in the southern Lebanese town of Marjayoun began to shake from the relentless approach of Israeli bombs, Shoshan Mazraani let her muscle memory take over. As the emergency room director of its public hospital, she was well versed in the grim logistics of the triage procedures that follow a bombing. Then after five hours of gruelling work, the din of the emergency room was interrupted by a long whistle. Doctors turned their heads, a reflex after nearly a year of war. Then a blast, the doors of the hospital blown open, the windows shattering and cracks spreading across the hospital walls. \u201cWhen I heard the rocket, I thought it was coming to hit us. Then there was a tremendous pressure in the hospital, the doors buckled from it. I really thought the rocket had impacted us,\u201d Mazraani said. Two airstrikes had landed just metres from the hospital on Monday last week, damaging its interior and forcing medical workers to stop their work until they could figure out if they were under attack. The airstrikes took Mazraani by surprise. Marjayoun, colloquially referred to as the beginning of the \u201cChristian corridor\u201d by UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon, had remained relatively untouched by fighting. As late as July, residents of the town could be seen going on scenic jogs, UN armoured personnel carriers passing them by and plumes of smoke rising from the hills just a few miles away. Marjayoun\u2019s hospital, in particular, was thought to be safe. But on 23 September, when Israel began a punishing aerial offensive on Lebanon that has so far killed 700 and wounded more than 2,000, healthcare workers suddenly found themselves at risk. At least 50 paramedics have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon over the last two weeks, more than doubling the number of healthcare workers killed since the beginning of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel last year. Of the paramedics killed over the last two weeks, all have belonged to healthcare services affiliated with either Hezbollah or Amal, another Shia political party \u2013 affiliations which rights experts say does not affect their protected status under international law. One after another, Israeli airstrikes last week began to hit near hospitals in Lebanon\u2019s south. On Tuesday one airstrike landed next to Bint Jbeil hospital and another hit the outskirts of Tibnine public hospital as ambulances were approaching it. An empty building next to Ragheb Harb University hospital near Nabatieh was hit on Wednesday and then again on Thursday. The strikes continued into this week. In the early hours of Thursday, Israel struck a medical centre belonging to the Islamic Health Organisation \u2013 a Hezbollah-linked paramedic service \u2013 in central Beirut, killing at least nine and wounding 14. Paramedics say they began to notice a pattern with the strikes: whenever they arrived at a location to start rescue operations, they said Israeli airstrikes would follow. In one case, in the town of Suhmoor in the western Bekaa valley on Monday last week, an ambulance was struck directly after the team left the car. Pictures of the vehicle engulfed in flames circulated in Lebanese media. Meanwhile, paramedics have begun receiving strange calls with a voice speaking Arabic on the other end, warning them to evacuate their medical centres, said Rabih Issah, a local commissioner of Islamic Kashafat al-Risala medical organisation that serves much of south Lebanon. Last Wednesday, paramedics in two different villages received calls, forcing the workers to stop their work and evacuate, though the buildings were not bombed. Unlike the wave of Israeli calls that warned 80,000 Lebanese to distance themselves from buildings it alleged contained Hezbollah weapons ahead of Israel\u2019s aerial campaign in south Lebanon the week before, these warnings were directed only at the medical workers. Human rights experts have said that the targeting of medical workers and false calls for evacuations are forbidden under international law. \u201cCalls for evacuating areas that are primarily intended to cause panic among residents or compel them to leave these areas for reasons other than their safety are prohibited under customary international humanitarian law,\u201d said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher for Human Rights Watch. He added that healthcare workers and facilities, \u201cregardless of affiliation\u201d, cannot be targeted in attacks unless \u201cthey commit or healthcare facilities are being used to commit acts harmful to the enemy\u201d. The Israeli military told the Guardian in response to claims that it has targeted paramedics and hospitals: \u201cThe [Israel Defense Forces] operates in strict accordance with international law [and] takes all feasible precautions in order to mitigate harm to civilians during operational activity.\u201d Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a plastic surgeon who worked in Gaza over the last year and is now in Beirut, said the treatment of medical workers over the last two weeks in Lebanon\u2019s south was reminiscent of Israeli tactics in Gaza. \u201cOn the 12th of October in Gaza, five days before the attack on al-Ahli hospital, they were phoning hospital directors and blaming him for the deaths of anybody who died when the hospital would be targeted,\u201d Abu-Sittah said. He said he was concerned that damaging the health system in south Lebanon is part of an Israeli strategy to clear areas along the Lebanon-Israel border of its inhabitants. The phone calls and the bombs that seem to follow them wherever they go have frayed the nerves of medical workers. \u201cWe are scared that we will be bombed,\u201d Mazraani said, adding that she tries to keep the morale of her team high. \u201cWe are trying as much as we can to continue, because there are still people here.\u201d She added, with pride, that no one from her department had left Marjayoun, despite the danger. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t left,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I left, morale would fall, and maybe the others would start to leave to.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-21T12:00:35Z",
            "content": "Although older Americans had the highest number of deaths in the Covid-19 pandemic, younger Americans had the highest rates compared with the overall population \u2013 especially among people of color, according to a new study. And in two groups \u2013 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander and Native American or Alaska Native \u2013 working-age people (ages 25 to 64) had the greatest increase in mortality of any age group. It\u2019s \u201creally devastating, because these are individuals who could be contributing to our society and, more importantly, contributing to their families\u201d, said Utibe Essien, an assistant professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, a primary care physician and one of the co-authors of the study. \u201cThe disparities happen in this working-age population where the implications are so much longer-lasting \u2013 that, to me, was the shocking thing,\u201d said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study. The researchers calculated excess deaths \u2013 the number of people who died compared with the normal rate \u2013 finding almost 1.4 million more people died than expected between March 2020 and May 2023. Working-age Americans saw a 20% increase in mortality rates during the pandemic, while older Americans\u2019 mortality rate increased by 13%. But among younger populations, the effects were starkly unequal. Black children and young people under the age of 25 accounted for more than half of the deaths (51%) in that age group, despite only representing 13.8% of the population. \u201cThat\u2019s a staggering fact,\u201d said Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, associate professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with this study. \u201cThe US has been an exceptionally unequal place for a long time,\u201d she said, and the pandemic \u201cwas experienced in profoundly unequal ways\u201d. Indigenous populations, including Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, also had more under-25 deaths than before the pandemic \u2013 but there were no excess deaths among Asian and white populations in the same age group. Compared with the average working-age American before the pandemic, Native American or Alaska Native people of the same age were 45% more likely to die in the pandemic, while that rate was 40% for Hispanic people and 39% for Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders. The relative increase in mortality among working-age people is highest because younger people usually don\u2019t die, Wrigley-Field pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s often the case that you see the biggest proportionate changes in younger age groups, just because that\u2019s where mortality is smaller.\u201d At the same time, she said, the idea that \u201cpandemic mortality is only a story about older people \u2013 that stereotype was really incorrect and has misled us about the extent to which this was a disaster that led to deaths very broadly across the population\u201d. The US was deeply unequal before the pandemic, but the inequities were magnified even more, experts said. \u201cThere are really wide differences in who has access to treatment \u2013 who has access to a primary care doc, who has access to insurance,\u201d Essien said. Then, in the pandemic, there were inequities among frontline workers who were required to work in person, often without protection; who needed to take public transportation; and who had intergenerational households. There were also disparities in access to lifesaving vaccines once they arrived. \u201cThis pandemic shone a light on the inequities that are structural and are not due to genetics or poor behaviors or poor decisions,\u201d Essien said. The disparities magnified by the pandemic must be addressed now \u2013 not during the next crisis, Essien said. \u201cHow do we take care of our communities and societies today so that the folks who are still alive can continue to be healthy, especially those from underrepresented and minoritized groups?\u201d Essien said. \u201cWhat can we be doing today \u2013 in our health systems, public health departments, federal government, state governments \u2013 to really make sure that people are leading the healthiest lives they can, so that they\u2019re not exposed at such a high risk when a new pandemic happens?\u201d"

            "content": "Primary schools are having to teach infants how to communicate, as they struggle to make friends or cope with lessons because of speech and language difficulties, according to a report by Ofsted. The research by Ofsted inspectors, based on visits to schools in England rated as good or outstanding, found that the Covid pandemic \u201cis still having an impact on children\u2019s behaviour and social skills\u201d. Schools told inspectors that the \u201cconsequences of lockdowns\u201d meant that \u201cchildren were starting reception with delayed communication and language, poor self-help skills and emotional difficulties\u201d. The inspectors said some schools were adapting their curriculum for four-year-olds in reception classes, \u201cto provide extra help for children with speech, language and communication difficulties. Increasing numbers of children joining reception were experiencing these difficulties. This made it hard for them to express their wants and needs or to make friends and experience high-quality play.\u201d Martyn Oliver, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that there has been some good progress in improving the teaching of early reading and mathematics in primary schools. But schools are still having to navigate the impact of the pandemic, and many children are still catching up on lost learning. \u201cIt is those children who are most vulnerable who benefit most from a strong start to their education.\u201d The report, based on visits to 20 primary schools in late 2023, is highly critical of how schools are applying the key stage one curriculum for children aged between four and seven, with some children missing out on \u201cfoundational knowledge\u201d as teachers worked their way through topics. \u201cWe saw year 1 children who were mostly silent and appeared withdrawn when the teacher directed questions to one child at a time. Some children appeared to give up because they had to wait so long for their turn to speak. Other children appeared not to understand what was being taught or what their peers were saying,\u201d the report said. When children were asked to write about their weekends or holidays, the inspectors noted: \u201cFor children with fewer opportunities and experiences in their home lives, there is little to tell.\u201d In response, teaching unions called for extra support for schools, so they can provide more specialist help to children at risk of falling behind their peers. James Bowen, an assistant general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that many children currently in key stage one will have missed out on important preschool experiences due to Covid and will have experienced major disruption to their early education. \u201cWhile curriculum choices made by teachers are obviously important, this is only one part of a much bigger picture. The previous government\u2019s failure to invest properly in Covid recovery and the decimation of crucial early support services has meant that young children who need extra support often struggle to access it.\u201d The report was critical of schools that failed to demonstrate good behaviour to their youngest pupils, noting that children\u2019s behaviour \u201cdeteriorated when they were not taught how to manage and care for toys and equipment. The classroom became chaotic.\u201d Even play-based learning often failed to convey valuable lessons in problem-solving, collaboration or persistence. \u201cSuch poorly planned play keeps children busy but does not support their development: their hands and bodies are active, but their minds are not,\u201d the report said."

            "date": "2024-10-21T03:06:37Z",
            "content": "Qantas is facing a hefty compensation bill expected to exceed $100m as it braces for the fallout of its decision to illegally sack almost 1,700 baggage handlers in 2020. Justice Michael Lee ruled on Monday that three test cases should receive $30,000, $40,000 and $100,000. They suffered varying amounts of \u201cnon-economic loss\u201d, the court ruled, which refers to hardship and distress caused by the airline. Many workers will also be able to claim economic losses, linked to lost wages. Lee ordered Qantas and the Transport Workers\u2019 Union into mediation using the test-case amounts to inform a total payout, with the parties due to report back early next month. He found that the workers would have been retrenched one year later in 2021 anyway due to the airline\u2019s \u201claser-like\u201d focus on cutting costs, capping the economic component of compensation calculations. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The federal court found the outsourcing move to be illegal because it acted against protections in the Fair Work Act and was in part driven by a desire to avoid industrial action. Qantas unsuccessfully appealed against the decision to the full bench of the court and later the high court. About 20 former Qantas workers were in the court room to hear the judgment in Sydney on Monday, where Lee noted the extreme cost of the proceedings and use of court resources. \u201cVast legal costs have been expended, and particularly by Qantas, who have retained no less than five senior counsel during the course of the matter and numerous solicitors from one of Australia\u2019s pre-eminent law firms,\u201d Lee said. Qantas had previously made a provision of $70m in its accounts to meet any liabilities. Transport Workers\u2019 Union national assistant secretary Nick McIntosh said the total compensation bill would likely exceed $100m. The union was also seeking penalties to be imposed on Qantas in addition to a compensation payout. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said Qantas needed to prove it has \u201cturned over a new leaf\u201d. \u201cAfter relentlessly prolonging this case and denying workers justice, Qantas must do everything in its power to ensure appropriate compensation to workers,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cThey should not have to suffer a day longer after the last four years of anguish.\u201d The Qantas chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, said in a statement the airline would \u201cwork to expedite the payments\u201d. \u201cWe sincerely apologise to our former employees who were impacted by this decision and we know that the onus is on Qantas to learn from this,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe recognise the emotional and financial impact this has had on these people and their families. We hope that this provides closure to those who have been affected.\u201d Compensation hearings leading up to the judgment focused on what would have occurred if the illegal outsourcing did not occur. The court also heard that some of the workers had suffered significant psychological distress after losing their jobs and had to take medication to cope. Former Qantas worker Damien Pollard said outside court that over the last four years he had taken hundreds of calls from colleagues \u201cthat are going through personal problems and mental health issues\u201d caused by Qantas\u2019 actions. He said the court\u2019s decision \u201cgoes some way to facilitating a little bit of recovery from all that and hopefully allowing for us to move on with our lives\u201d. Australia\u2019s biggest airline emerged from the pandemic disruptions to post record profits but its reputation was tarnished by a string of scandals that precipitated the early retirement of its chief executive Alan Joyce. This month the federal court approved a regulator-imposed penalty on Qantas of $100m for selling thousands of tickets for already-cancelled flights."

That attack makes no sense. Several things caused a surge in inflation, but the US vice-president wasn\u2019t one of them. Blame inflation on the pandemic or on Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, but don\u2019t blame it on Harris. Blaming her for inflation makes as much sense as blaming her for the leak in your roof. In seeking to blame Harris for inflation, Trump is absurdly trying to turn her \u2013 a vice-president who, like other veeps, has very little power \u2013 into some all-powerful economic tsar who somehow controls everything from egg prices to gasoline prices. Any American who is truly concerned about inflation should be much more worried about Trump than about Harris. She is far more serious about fighting inflation and helping households cope with the high cost of living. What\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s plan to impose steep tariffs on all imported goods will significantly push up prices and hit consumers hard, especially less wealthy consumers. If Trump is elected and implements his tariffs and other plans, inflation will probably \u2013 and quickly \u2013 rise to an uncomfortable 6% to 9.3% per year (from the current 2.5%), according to a respected thinktank, with prices climbing a very painful 20% to 28% during Trump\u2019s four years in office. That means there\u2019s a good chance that inflation would rise more in a second Trump term than it has under Joe Biden. Not only that, economists say the higher prices caused by Trump\u2019s tariffs will cost the typical American household from $2,600 to $3,900 a year. Ouch. Trump blames Harris for causing \u201cthe worst inflation in American history\u201d. Comments like that insult everyone\u2019s intelligence and show that Trump knows zilch about American history. Inflation was far worse in the years immediately after the second world war and far worse in the late 1970s and early 1980s. More absurdity: JD Vance recently blamed Harris for higher egg prices, even though we\u2019ve been repeatedly told that bird flu and the loss of more than 100 million chickens were what caused egg prices to soar. (In fact, the not-always-truthful Vance embarrassed himself by blaming Harris for $4-a-dozen egg prices while he stood in front of egg cartons marked $2.99 for a dozen.) Instead of listening to Trump\u2019s attacks about inflation, every American should be rejoicing that inflation has come way down \u2013 back to nearly 2%. If we look honestly at inflation, we see that two main factors fueled the spike in inflation back in 2021 and 2022. (Neither of those factors is named Kamala Harris.) The first factor was the pandemic, which closed thousands of factories worldwide and badly disrupted supply chains, causing prices of everything from furniture to cars to soar. The second factor was Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine, which pushed up agricultural prices around the world because Ukraine is a major grain and fertilizer exporter. That war also caused oil and gas prices to soar because Russia is a huge energy exporter and the war disrupted energy exports. There was another important factor behind inflation. Many corporations took advantage of the situation by raising prices far higher than necessary. This \u201cgreedflation\u201d jacked up corporate profits while hammering consumers. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive thinktank, said these moves to boost corporate profits caused one-third of the growth in prices since the pandemic began. Under Biden, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan, which gave an important boost to our pandemic-plagued economy and sent checks to millions of households to help them weather the pandemic. Thanks to that ambitious plan, the US under Biden has had far stronger economic growth than other G7 countries while also having the lowest average unemployment rate under any president since Lyndon Johnson. Indeed, the 16.2m jobs added under Biden are a record, far more than were added under any previous president in a four-year term. The American Rescue Plan was a huge success: the billions of dollars it put in people\u2019s pockets contributed modestly to inflation, but far less than other factors did. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, has said: \u201cThere\u2019s a long list of reasons for the high inflation. At the top of the list is the pandemic and the Russian war \u2026 [the American Rescue Plan is] at the bottom of the list.\u201d The truth is, the US economy is in good shape, even though many people are unhappy because prices are considerably higher than when the pandemic began. Many Americans fail to realize that wages have been rising faster than prices. As for what will happen to prices in the future, economists are far more worried about Trump than Harris. They fear that Trump\u2019s promised tariffs will send prices shooting upwards and trigger a huge trade war that could drag the US economy into recession. Trump has talked up two economic policies: big tax cuts for the richest 1% and corporations and, second, steep tariffs \u2013 up to 20% on all imports, from TVs to shoes to bananas \u2013 and a 60% tariff on imports from China. Trump says foreign companies will pay for those tariffs even though economists keep saying he\u2019s 100% wrong on that. American consumers will pay for those tariffs in the form of higher prices. Economists warn that a second Trump term will dangerously increase inflation through his tariffs, through his plans that will cause the budget deficit to soar, and through his threats to limit the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to reduce inflation. Sixteen Nobel-prize winning economists have warned that Trump\u2019s policies \u201cwill reignite\u201d inflation and have a \u201cdestabilizing effect\u201d on our economy. Unlike Trump, Harris has serious plans to fight against higher prices. Seeing how housing prices have soared (largely because builders haven\u2019t built enough homes since 2008), Harris has a bold plan to build 3m new housing units nationwide. She also wants to give a $25,000 down payment subsidy to first-time homebuyers. To battle high grocery prices, Harris has vowed to crack down on price-gouging by food suppliers and supermarket chains. She also wants the government to do more to reduce bloated prescription drug prices, in the same way Biden has chopped insulin prices to $35 a month for seniors. Recognizing how expensive it is to raise a family, Harris has called for creating an annual $3,600 tax credit per child and a $6,000 credit in a newborn\u2019s first year. She is also pushing for a trailblazing measure: to subsidize childcare so that no family spends more than 7% of its income on childcare. Trump is once again attacking people for what he\u2019s guilty of. He is falsely attacking Harris for causing inflation, while he is the one whose economic plans will cause inflation to climb skyward.

            "date": "2024-10-23T08:28:00Z",
            "content": "Doctors have begun trialling the world\u2019s first mRNA vaccine against the vomiting bug norovirus in the hope the jab could bring huge health and economic benefits. Norovirus causes sickness and diarrhoea and can spread very rapidly between people who are in close contact, with outbreaks often occurring in hospitals, care homes, schools and nurseries. While most people recover within two to three days, the virus can be serious, particularly for the very young, elderly or people with a weakened immune system. Dr Patrick Moore, a GP and national chief investigator for the trial in the UK, said that at present there were no approved vaccines for norovirus in the world, while people who become very ill were simply given intravenous fluids. Moore added that the burden of the bug was huge, with about 685m cases and 200,000 deaths globally each year. In the UK it is thought there are about 4m norovirus cases annually, with 12,000 hospitalisations a year in England alone. \u201cIn the UK, norovirus is estimated to cost about \u00a3100m annually to the NHS [and] if you take into account lost earnings, that\u2019s about \u00a3300m,\u201d Moore said. Called Nova 301, the phase 3 clinical trial is to run for two years, and will enrol 25,000 adults \u2013 with a focus on those over the age of 60 \u2013 from countries including Japan, Canada and Australia. In total, 27 NHS primary and secondary care sites in England, Scotland and Wales will be involved in the trial, with about 2,500 participants to be recruited from late October. The team added they will also be using mobile units to make it easier for people to take part. The British arm of the study is part of the 10-year Moderna-UK Strategic Partnership and involves a collaboration between the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), and the pharmaceutical company Moderna, which is producing the vaccine. Within the trial, half of the participants will be randomly allocated to receive the new vaccine, and the other half will receive a saline shot as a placebo. The norovirus vaccine is based on mRNA technology \u2013 an approach used by companies such as Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech in the development of their Covid jabs. Such vaccines work by introducing a single-stranded molecule \u2013 mRNA \u2013 into human cells. The mRNA carries instructions that can be used by machinery within these cells to make proteins associated with the virus. These proteins then trigger the body\u2019s immune system, providing protection against a future encounter with virus itself. In the case of the new jab, the mRNA carries instructions for making the protein coat of three different types of norovirus, giving rise to the formation of harmless virus-like particles which can trigger the production of antibodies. While the team said earlier trials of the vaccine have shown it generates a strong immune response in humans, the new trial is designed to explore whether the jab is effective against the virus itself and, if so, how long protection lasts. \u201cAt least 65% [efficacy] or higher is what we would consider to be clinically meaningful,\u201d said Dr Doran Fink of Moderna. Should the norovirus jab prove successful, the company expects to submit a marketing application to regulators in 2026, with the review process expected to take up to a year. Further trials would also be carried out in teenagers and younger children. Prof Saul Faust, of the University of Southampton and NIHR Vaccination Innovation Pathway co-clinical lead, added a successful vaccine would help keep care homes running as normal so people can visit their loved ones, while Moore said it will help prevent those who are frail from becoming frailer. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be doing this sort of trial at this sort of pace if it wasn\u2019t going to benefit the individuals themselves,\u201d Faust said. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 October 2024. The vaccine being trialled is the world\u2019s first mRNA vaccine for norovirus, but not the first norovirus vaccine of any type, as an earlier version suggested owing to an editing error."

            "content": "One Nation has refused to comment on the future of a candidate at the Queensland state election who likened the Covid vaccine to the Holocaust amid calls for him to be stood down. Health experts and a Jewish community leader condemned the comments by Gary Williamson, a bricklayer who is running for the seat of Redlands, when revealed by Guardian Australia on Wednesday. After the Guardian\u2019s report, the deputy premier, Cameron Dick, called for Williamson to be \u201cdisendorsed immediately\u201d. Williamson made the comparison on social media in June. \u201cHitler, forced people into gas chambers. Covid-19, had people lining up, which is worse..!?!\u201d he wrote on Facebook. Williamson later deleted the post, but stood by the claims when contacted by the Guardian this week. Until Tuesday, his Instagram account \u2013 which featured a profile image carrying the One Nation banner and a bio with a link to his bricklaying company \u2013 remained open to the public and contained a long history of anti-vaccination posts, including a video which showed a bong, a heat gun and a packet of cigarettes and in which he joked about having \u201ckilled covid\u201d. After speaking to the Guardian on Tuesday, Williamson sent a text message saying that he \u201clooked forward to the publicity\u201d and that \u201cthe people need to see my face\u201d. On Wednesday, his social media account was changed to private. Williamson did not answer calls from the Guardian. Nor did the One Nation state election leader, James Ashby. Ashby was contacted on Tuesday morning for comment and requested questions be sent via email. Several emails were sent by the Guardian on Tuesday and Wednesday, but no response was received. Ashby did not answer calls on Wednesday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Answering a question from Guardian Australia after the leaders debate on Wednesday afternoon, the Queensland treasurer described Williamson\u2019s comments as \u201cdisgraceful and disgusting\u201d. \u201cHe should be disendorsed immediately if One Nation has any sense or any skerrick of moral fibre in that organisation,\u201d Dick said of Williamson. \u201cBut you know what? I doubt it.\u201d One Nation fielded a candidate in all 93 electorates across Queensland in this month\u2019s election and Williamson is not the first to have his past rear its head. The party\u2019s Chatsworth candidate, Jasmine Harte, was disendorsed last week after photos emerged of her as a nude model and a 13-year-old accusation of attempted murder \u2013 a charge that was later dropped \u2013 resurfaced. Political analysts said One Nation\u2019s long history of running \u201ccolourful\u201d candidates would likely end up dooming what was once a powerful force in Queensland politics to irrelevance. One Nation\u2019s popularity in the sunshine state hit its high-water mark in the first Queensland election it contested in 1998, at which the anti-immigration party won almost 23% of the vote and a total of 11 seats in Queensland\u2019s unicameral parliament. Paul Williams, an associate professor of politics at Griffith University, said that all minor parties faced greater challenges in vetting candidates \u2013 but that One Nation had a particularly long history of having damaging material emerge about candidates, being forced to stand down representatives or having them quit the party. \u201cYou might say that One Nation has disproportionately been embarrassed by candidates in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been a problem for One Nation for 26 years.\u201d He said such \u201ccolourful\u201d candidates were likely to \u201cdoom\u201d the party to irrelevance once its leader, Pauline Hanson, retired from politics. \u201c[One Nation] started off as potentially mainstream,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut that vote has diminished. \u201cTheir actions and rhetoric have condemned the party to be a fringe party.\u201d Pandanus Petter, a research fellow at the school of politics and international relations at the Australian National University, said the party\u2019s fortunes contrasted with the ascendant far right of Europe. \u201cUnlike some of those European, rightwing, radical, populist parties, One Nation are not super big on trying to be what\u2019s called \u2018respectable radicals\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of those parties have spent many years trying to bring themselves into the mainstream, whereas a lot of One Nation is still happy to stand outside the main party system and have more extreme views.\u201d Despite polls predicting big swings against the governing Labor party, both Williams and Petter said it was more likely than not One Nation would fail to win a seat at the coming election."

            "date": "2024-10-12T23:00:39Z",
            "content": "One in 10 Australian parents are struggling to afford the costs of vaccinating their children, according to a nationally representative survey conducted earlier this year. The national vaccination insights project surveyed 2,000 Australian parents of children under five between March and April and found the biggest barrier to turning declining vaccination rates around were the practical difficulties parents face. Dr Katarzyna Bolsewicz, one of the lead investigators of the project which is a collaboration between the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), the University of Sydney and the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute, said the project offers the first ever national social and behavioural insights study around vaccination. Bolsewicz presented the early findings from the survey at a NCIRS webinar on Thursday, and a separate presentation based on data from the Australian Immunisation Register showed the steady decline in childhood immunisation coverage since the start of the pandemic has continued into mid-2024. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Only 90.8% of two-year-olds were fully vaccinated in 2023, a fall from 92.1% in 2020, while only 93.3% of five-years-old in 2023 were fully vaccinated compared with 94.8% in 2020, according to associate professor Frank Beard from the NCIRS. While much of the media attention and popular perception around lagging vaccination rates has focused on vaccine hesitancy and concern, Bolsewicz said \u201cthe survey shows those practical barriers are really pronounced\u201d. Of the respondents, 11% said they could not afford the vaccinations, 9.3% found it was not easy to get to an appointment, 8.2% did not prioritise vaccination appointments, while 6% did not not believe vaccines were safe and 5.3% did not believe vaccines were effective. \u201cEven though childhood vaccination under the national immunisation program is supposed to be free of charge, there are other costs,\u201d Bolsewicz said. \u201cIf you get a consultation at the same time some GPs will charge a co-payment, or costs associated with taking time off work for parents who are single parents, or the costs related to transport, especially for people living in regional and rural areas.\u201d The survey results, which were weighted for state, regionality and age group, reflected vaccine uptake that was largely representative of current national childhood immunisation rates with 93.5% of respondents saying their children were up to date with their vaccinations, 4.85% partially vaccinated and 1.65% unvaccinated. \u201cThis is pretty spot-on nationally,\u201d Prof Margie Danchin, another lead investigator of the project and a paediatrician at the Royal Children\u2019s hospital in Melbourne, said. The most common barrier parents reported in the survey was 60% said they felt distressed about vaccinating their child and the needle pain. Although people cited fear of needles, the barriers that were most associated with partial vaccination rates compared with the fully vaccinated group were practical access barriers \u2013 including affording, prioritising and getting to appointments \u2013 were most strongly linked. The barriers were higher among parents who also reported financial stress, Danchin said. The project will involve further research interviewing participants to understand more about the reasons why they could not afford costs or struggled to get to an appointment. Some of the barriers to parents getting to appointments include the inability to take young children under five to a pharmacy for their vaccinations, the lack of pop-up or weekend clinics and besides Victoria, very few free nurse-led immunisation clinics, Danchin said. Beard, who was not involved in the national vaccination insights project, said \u201cregular monitoring of vaccination coverage is important, but it doesn\u2019t tell us why childhood vaccination rates in Australia are declining. It is therefore critical to identify the barriers to vaccination uptake so that we can implement evidence-based approaches to address them\u201d."

            "date": "2024-10-27T08:00:06Z",
            "content": "People from ethnic minority groups in the UK are twice as likely to be under-vaccinated against Covid-19 compared with individuals who have a white British background. That is the striking finding of a study carried out by scientists at Health Data Research UK, which indicates that people from these groups are more likely to need hospital treatment or risk death from Covid because they lack full protection against the disease. \u201cThe results are very clear,\u201d said Prof Angela Wood, of the HDR UK and Cambridge University. \u201cUsing data for 67 million people from England, Scotland and Wales, we found that only about 40% of those of white backgrounds had not had their full Covid vaccinations by the beginning of this year, while 80% of individuals from some ethnic groups were under-vaccinated. It is a really striking difference.\u201d Those who had under-vaccination levels of 80% included people from Black African, Black Caribbean and Asian Pakistani backgrounds. Others, including those in Asian Chinese and Asian Indian groups, were about 60% under-vaccinated. \u201cA person is deemed to be under-vaccinated if they had missed any of the Covid jabs that were recommended for their age group,\u201d Wood told the Observer. The discovery of the high vulnerability of ethnic groups to Covid comes as the health services prepare for an expected rise in cases with winter approaching. Doctors and pharmacies are already offering jabs to eligible individuals such as residents in care homes and people over 65. The research on ethnic groups and Covid vaccines is a follow-up to a study published earlier this year in which scientists collaborated to reveal the take-up of Covid vaccines across Britain. This allowed them to identify the proportion of people who were under-vaccinated by the end of 2022 in England (46%), Northern Ireland (50%), Scotland (33%) and Wales (34%). \u201cWe also found that people who are more likely to be under-vaccinated were male, younger and from more deprived backgrounds,\u201d Wood said. The consequences of the failure to obtain full vaccination were profound, the study showed. An estimated 7,000 severe Covid outcomes, including hospitalisation and death, would have been triggered by the lack of full protection, the group calculated. The original study \u2013 carried out by the HDR UK and Edinburgh University \u2013 also indicated that those in ethnic minority groups were also more at risk of being under-vaccinated and it was decided to look more carefully at the issue. So the researchers split the population of England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 Northern Ireland figures were not included in the latest study \u2013 into 13 different ethnic categories. Apart from the group labelled white British or Irish, which had just over 40% of people under-vaccinated, all other categories had figures over 60%, while several reached 80%. \u201cIt is a substantial discrepancy,\u201d said Wood. The discovery that people in ethnic minority groups are particularly lacking in protection against Covid is a major worry for health officials, although Wood sounded a note of caution. \u201cPeople in the different ethnic groups have different age profiles \u2026 and tend to have fewer old people. We also know, from our first study, that younger people, in general, are less likely to take up the vaccine. So that might be influencing our results. Nevertheless, it is worrying. \u201cWe have been able to calculate these differences using whole-population, electronic health records available for Covid-related research. But there is a public health need to look at vaccinations for other conditions, for example, the take up of measles vaccines for different ethnic groups across the UK. There are a host of similar studies that we now need to look at as a matter of urgency.\u201d"

As doctors, psychiatrists take a holistic approach that recognises the complex interaction between psychological, social, cultural, environmental and biological factors, and the impact that these can have on mental health. This ensures that patients receive personalised care and treatment options as well as support from a variety of other services. Psychiatry has been at the forefront of developing the biopsychosocial model, which is routinely used in modern psychiatric practice to help people recover from all types of mental illness.

Psychiatrists (medically qualified doctors who go on to treat emotional and mental health issues with medications) are necessarily focused on diagnosis of a \u201cdisorder\u201d as an illness in the person. However, there is little evidence that this is effective with mental health issues in the vast majority of cases. Studies have shown that a person-centred, non-diagnosis-led and least-medicalised approach is more effective, quicker and with fewer clinical returns over the longer term. Such an approach does not require consultant psychiatrists, but can be delivered in the main by other therapists, with minimum referral to psychiatrists in a minority of cases. What is needed is a shift from a medical model of mental health (mental health is a disease or imbalance in the sufferer who is treated in isolation of events in their life) to a \u201cwithin context\u201d approach (ecological paradigm), which would enable a wider number of therapists to assist those in need.

            "content": "More than a dozen states and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits against TikTok on Tuesday, alleging the popular short-form video app is damaging children\u2019s mental health with a product designed to be used compulsively and excessively. The lawsuits stem from a national investigation into TikTok, which was launched in March 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from several states, including California, Kentucky and New Jersey. All of the complaints were filed in state courts and claim that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is especially dangerous given the platform\u2019s widespread use among young people and its ability to deliver quick hits of dopamine. Design choices such as infinite scrolling, push notifications and in-app purchases prey on youth and create addictive habits among users, prosecutors allege. There are over 170m monthly active TikTok users in the US, and over a billion worldwide. At the heart of each lawsuit is the TikTok algorithm, which powers what users see on the platform by populating the app\u2019s main \u201cFor You\u201d feed with content tailored to people\u2019s interests. In its filings, the District of Columbia called the algorithm \u201cdopamine-inducing\u201d, and said it was created to be intentionally addictive so the company could trap many young users into excessive use and keep them on its app for hours on end. TikTok does this despite knowing that these behaviors will lead to \u201cprofound psychological and physiological harms\u201d, such as anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia and other long-lasting problems, the complaint said. \u201cTikTok\u2019s design choices exploit the neurotransmitter dopamine, which helps humans feel pleasure as part of the brain\u2019s reward system to encourage reinforcement,\u201d the state\u2019s filing in the superior court of California read. \u201cDopamine \u2018rewards\u2019 can lead to addictive behavior, particularly when rewards are unpredictable.\u201d Citing internal documents and presentations, the states claim TikTok considers users under 13 a \u201ccritical demographic\u201d and knowingly targets them and collects their data without parental consent. Michael Hughes, a TikTok spokesperson, said in a statement: \u201cWe strongly disagree with these claims, many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading.\u201d Hughes cited the app\u2019s \u201crobust safeguards\u201d such as proactive removal of underage users, default screentime limits and default privacy settings for users under 16. \u201cWe\u2019ve endeavored to work with the attorneys general for over two years, and it is incredibly disappointing they have taken this step rather than work with us on constructive solutions to industrywide challenges,\u201d Hughes said. TikTok has faced intense pressure from US lawmakers and prosecutors over the past year. Congress passed a law in April that will force a nationwide ban on TikTok that will come into effect in January unless its parent company, the China-based ByteDance, sells the app to a new owner. The US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission also sued TikTok and ByteDance in August for allegedly breaking child privacy laws. \u201cIt is profiting off the fact that it\u2019s addicting young people to its platform,\u201d said Brian Schwalb, District of Columbia attorney general. Keeping people on the platform is \u201chow they generate massive ad revenue\u201d, Schwalb said. \u201cBut unfortunately, that\u2019s also how they generate adverse mental health impacts on the users.\u201d TikTok does not allow children under 13 to sign up for its main service and restricts some content for everyone under 18. But the District of Columbia and several other states said in their filing that children can easily bypass those restrictions, allowing them to access the service adults use despite the company\u2019s claims that its platform is safe for children. The lawsuit from California also alleges TikTok\u2019s beauty filters can perpetuate \u201cself-hatred of their appearance\u201d among its young users. The complaint claims the platform knows these filters can harm users but continues to design these filters to increase engagement. The filters perpetuate beauty stereotypes, the complaint reads, including favoring certain Caucasian or European features. \u201cIndeed, plastic surgeons have reported an increase in patients seeking procedures to look better onscreen and have remarked that TikTok\u2019s advanced \u2018effects\u2019 blur the line between fantasy and reality,\u201d the complaint reads. District of Columbia\u2019s lawsuit takes aim at other parts of the company\u2019s business. It alleges TikTok is operating as an \u201cunlicensed virtual economy\u201d by allowing people to purchase TikTok Coins \u2013 a virtual currency within the platform \u2013 and gift it to streamers on TikTok Live, who can then cash it out for real money. TikTok takes a 50% commission on these financial transactions but hasn\u2019t registered as a money transmitter with the US treasury department or authorities in the district, according to the complaint. Officials say teens are frequently exploited for sexually explicit content through TikTok\u2019s livestreaming feature, which has allowed the app to operate essentially as a \u201cvirtual strip club\u201d without any age restrictions. They say the cut the company gets from the financial transactions allows it to profit from exploitation. \u201cTikTok profits from the sexual exploitation of children \u2013 operating like a virtual strip club,\u201d Schwalb said on X. TikTok\u2019s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, has repeatedly pushed back against claims that the platform is harmful for young people and in January pledged to spend $2bn to protect US users."

            "date": "2024-10-06T14:00:07Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s already been a hard morning for Beau Woodbridge. He\u2019s had several breakdowns. Or, rather, the same one on repeat. The actor is deep into rehearsals for the Australian premiere of Dear Evan Hansen, the hit Broadway musical by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, a coproduction by Sydney Theatre Company and Michael Cassel Group that opens at Sydney\u2019s Roslyn Packer Theatre this month before seasons in Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide. He\u2019s playing the titular lead: an anxious teenager who, through a mix-up and misunderstanding \u2013 and a not-so-little white lie \u2013 has a hero\u2019s mantle placed on him by his high school peers after the suicide of another student, Connor, who they believe was Evan\u2019s friend. Today Woodbridge (the son of doubles tennis champ Todd Woodbridge) has been working on one of Evan\u2019s big numbers, Words Fail, in which he confesses all to Connor\u2019s shocked and disbelieving family. If you know the show, or have seen the 2021 movie version, you\u2019ll remember this moment. It\u2019s a hard one. Moments before this interview, Woodbridge was acting to an empty dining table \u2013 emoting to the air \u2013 as the rest of the cast were given the morning off. \u201cIt\u2019s a big song,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I really love about Dear Evan Hansen is that each song has a great big story and they are really demanding technically, so with songs like Words Fail, I know I have to pace myself. There\u2019s something like 14 or 15 songs in the show and I lead 11 or 12 of them. It\u2019s quite a heavy load.\u201d Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Woodbridge, who landed the role while in his graduate year at the Royal Academy of Music in London, is also feeling the weight of expectation. The title role in Dear Evan Hansen is synonymous in the minds of its fans with the performance by Ben Platt, who won a Tony in 2017 for his performance on Broadway and starred in the film \u2013 to the chagrin of some, who thought that Platt (aged 27 at the time) was too old to play a teenager. He copped a pasting on socials. Aged 22, the soft-faced Woodbridge might be considered more \u201cteen adjacent\u201d. \u201cI was lucky enough to actually see the original production on Broadway when I was quite young, about 14, and I saw Ben as Evan,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there are definitely parts of his Evan that have stayed in my head but I don\u2019t think too much about stuff like that. It\u2019s fun for me to approach it from the text [and] from the score, and really honour that. I definitely have my own version of Evan and my own idea of the social anxiety he experiences.\u201d Is that something from Woodbridge\u2019s imagination? \u201cI do have anxiety myself in certain areas and I\u2019ve definitely been using that to fuel some of the decisions I\u2019m making,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s something that tends to manifest physically, you know? It sort of drops into my stomach. So that\u2019s something I\u2019ve been playing with, gathering and releasing that tension in your gut.\u201d Some of Evan\u2019s anxiety might be the result of his hyper-awareness, Woodbridge says. \u201cDean [Bryant, the director] and I have been developing his idea that Evan isn\u2019t one of those socially anxious people who wants to avoid people and issues. Instead, we see him as hyper-aware, really good at reading situations. He\u2019s just unable to interact with them. [What] I really want to show in my Evan is this longing for connection.\u201d Bryant says putting on a new Australian production of a much-loved musical doesn\u2019t faze him; he did the same for Fun Home in 2021. \u201cThat show was beloved as well, not maybe as much of a blockbuster as Dear Evan Hansen, but still, so many people had seen it on Broadway or in London. I have the same approach I would take to any classic or even new work, which is, what does it feel like the writers were intending to do? What does it feel like it\u2019s saying about mental health in 2024 and the way teenagers and parents talk in 2024, while using the set text that you\u2019re given?\u201d In his staging, \u201cThe [theatre] space feels like Evan\u2019s mind, compressing him, with screens used sparingly, swamping the characters, much like we experience social media [and the internet],\u201d he says. Natalie O\u2019Donnell, who plays Connor\u2019s mother Cynthia, has two teenagers of her own and says she\u2019s particularly struck by the authenticity of Bryant\u2019s production. \u201cWhat I think this show captures beautifully is the way the teenagers engage with each other, and how conversations between the parents and teenagers sit in a very different world. For me, that really resonated, and I don\u2019t say that lightly, because I\u2019m a mum seeing my kids do the same.\u201d Woodbridge saw the Broadway production with his own mother. \u201cI remember both of us turning to each other at the end and we were both in tears. You come away wanting to talk, just to let them know you appreciate them being there. You\u2019ve watched these characters moving through all these moral and ethical grey areas and it\u2019s so real, so like the world we are in every day. It\u2019s really moving to see a musical that is not all glitz and glam.\u201d Dear Evan Hansen is at Roslyn Packer Theatre, Sydney, from 12 October; Arts Centre Melbourne from 14 December; Canberra Theatre Centre from 27 February 2025; and Her Majesty\u2019s Theatre, Adelaide, from 3 April"

            "date": "2024-10-30T11:00:07Z",
            "content": "If elected, Donald Trump plans to carry out \u201cthe largest deportation operation in American history\u201d. After pushback on Joe Biden\u2019s border policies, Kamala Harris has embraced border restrictions and the need to maintain limits on asylum seekers. But neither candidate captures the realities of US immigration. US consumers are accustomed to cheap goods and services, and the economic rationale for large-scale immigration has been largely avoided. In a country that relies on a mobile, low-cost workforce, the loss of migrant workers would trigger productivity losses and a new round of inflationary pricing pressure. \u201cIt would be an economic disaster for America and Americans,\u201d says Zeke Hernandez, an economics professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, of Trump\u2019s deportations threat. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the immigrants would be harmed, but we, the people of America, would be economically harmed.\u201d Baby boomers are retiring, and with fewer immigrants, the workforce will struggle to sustain economic output: US employers will need to hire 240,000 people a month for the next five years just to replace those who are stepping out, according to one recent study. Hernandez, author of a recent book, The Truth About Immigration, argues that immigrants contribute talent, investment, innovation, consumption and tax revenue. \u201cIf you lose those things, there are fewer jobs, the economy contracts and becomes less diversified.\u201d Of the undocumented migrants, between 8 and 9 million are in the workforce doing essential jobs that Americans disproportionately don\u2019t want to do or work in sectors where there aren\u2019t enough workers. Typically, that\u2019s farm work (one third of the labor force), construction work (about one quarter) and about half of the labor force in skilled work like drywalling, plumbing and insulation. \u201cUndocumented immigrants make up a huge proportion of household services, manufacturing work, kitchen staff in restaurants. Americans simply do not do those jobs, or there are not enough to go around. But if you lose those key \u2018bottleneck\u2019 workers, the native workforce also can\u2019t do their jobs,\u201d says Hernandez. A study by the Center for Migration Studies estimates undocumented workers contribute $97bn in federal, state and local taxes, their removal from the workforce would have a substantial impact on local economies, including pushing nearly 10 million US citizens into economic hardship. Families would also be profoundly impacted. About 5.8m US households are home to at least one undocumented resident and mass deportations would break up nearly 5m US families. The cost of bringing up US-born children whose caregivers are removed has been put at $116bn. Taxpayers would have to foot the bill. Apprehending and deporting just 1 million of an estimated 11 million-12 million undocumented migrants in the US could cost taxpayers about $20bn, or $19,599 per person, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data \u2013 and take far longer than the term of a four-year Trump administration. Business leaders have been fairly quiet on Trump\u2019s plans \u2013 possibly fearing retribution \u2013 but some lobby groups have begun to tally the costs of mass deportation. The construction sector employs an estimated 1.5 million undocumented workers, or 13% of its total workforce \u2013 a larger share than any other, according to data the Pew Research Center. Construction firms, already facing labor shortages, are warning that the loss of immigrant workers would push new home prices higher. The National Association of Home Builders considers foreign-born workers, regardless of legal status, \u201ca vital and flexible source of labor\u201d. The CEO of the NAHB, Jim Tobin, told NBC that their loss would be \u201cdetrimental to the construction industry and our labor supply and exacerbate our housing affordability problems\u201d. The Business Roundtable notes that \u201cimmigrants have always been a key part of America\u2019s innovative spirit. A vast majority of economists and business leaders agree that immigration is a net positive for the US economy\u201d but says \u201cthe system for welcoming these highly valuable workers is broken\u201d. A 2023 study of previous efforts at mass deportation, such as President Barack Obama\u2019s Secure Communities program from 2008 to 2014 that resulted in the deportation of almost half a million people, found that any benefits from reduced job competition that US-born workers face were counteracted by a decline in labor demand due to an increase in labor costs. \u201cPolice-based enforcement policies aimed at reducing the number of undocumented immigrants should consider the potential negative spillover effects on the labor market outcomes of immigrants who remain in the US and on US-born workers,\u201d a University of Denver study concluded. The same effect was seen during the Trump and Biden administrations when the Covid pandemic caused about a million fewer immigrants to enter the US leading to labor shortages and reduced output, and contributing to inflationary pressure. The post-pandemic spike in immigration contributed to inflation coming down, according to Hernandez. \u201cImmigration allowed business to hire again and raise output to what the market demands, so prices normalized,\u201d he says. Nevertheless opponents of immigration have been \u201cvery effective at flooding the zone with false or dubious claims\u201d, said Hernandez. Biden\u2019s policies, which Harris is now walking back, have created complications for the Latino communities in the US, resulting in declining support for Democrats and a frantic late-campaign effort to shore up their votes. In 2012, Latino support for Obama was at 71%. Eight years later Biden won 62%. A recent Times/Siena poll found Harris with 56%. According to Ana Valdez, president and CEO of the Latino Donor Collaborative, says the negative myths around Latino immigration are just \u201cpure rhetoric \u2026 Trump knows that most of the workforce the US needs to continue growing comes from Latinos.\u201d Valdez cites labor department statistics that show Latino workers in the labor force have grown from 10.7 million in 1990 to 29 million in 2020, and are projected to reach 36 million in 2030. In 2030, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects they will account for one out of every five workers in the labor force, at 21.2%, or or 78% of net new workers by 2030. Without those immigrant workers, the change in the standard of living for the middle class would be much more dramatic, Valdez says. \u201cThe reason we have avocados or chicken to choose from every day is because of immigration.\u201d Valdez, who worked in the Clinton administration, cites figure that show US Latinos generate $3.6tn in GDP and says the political discourse around the issue by both parties has equated all Latinos to undocumented immigrants and does not reflect the economic, data-backed reality. \u201cIf Trump and Harris want to win the Latino vote, and if the winner wants to keep our support once they\u2019re in office, they need to change their perspective and messaging to Latinos and recognize the full scope of our economic contributions,\u201d she says. \u201cNot doing so is reckless for their campaigns and the US economy.\u201d"

            "title": "Biden\u2019s economic legacy could decide the presidential race in Scranton",
            "date": "2024-10-20T10:00:41Z",
            "content": "From the north, motorists pull into Scranton via the Joseph R Biden Jr Expressway. Cutting through the scenic Pocono Mountains, now at the start of autumn color season, they are greeted with a towering, electric billboard, blaring an encapsulating \u2013 if divisive \u2013 message to this working-class town: \u201cDemocrats for Trump,\u201d it reads. \u201cEconomy,\u201d it continues, with a green checked box next to the word. The sign in Biden\u2019s hometown is the perfect fall 2024 welcome mat in this crucial swing state filled with voters whose economic anxiety or satisfaction will decide next month\u2019s election. The US has staged a remarkable recovery since the pandemic and Biden has successfully pursued an economic agenda, Bidenomics, that should benefit Scranton and the state \u2013 $13bn has been earmarked from his infrastructure bill for repairing highways and bridges alone. But poll after poll shows deep-seated worries about the economy \u2013 worries that could sink Democrats\u2019 chances of keeping the White House come November. Like many mid-sized upper midwest cities that have faced post-industrial decline, Scranton, a longtime Democratic stronghold, has grown more conservative in recent elections. With the city\u2019s native son leaving office, and pocketbook issues top of mind, some believe Trump could finally take Scranton \u2013 a more-than-symbolic win. But with Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s successor, and Donald Trump tied in the polls, guessing who will take Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the White House is a fool\u2019s errand. And this politically split town shows why the race is so close. On the street, one person\u2019s economic reality may be entirely different to the next. The complicated political mix of fears about the local economy, faith and mistrust in both Harris and Trump and shifting political allegiance was evident at the Marketplace at Steamtown, a downtown mall filled with local mom-and-pop shops. Pete, 78, a swing voter who declined to provide his last name, said inflation had been a problem over the last four years, but added prices were coming down, the stock market was high, and said he didn\u2019t blame Biden for the economic challenges. \u201cEvery president is stuck with what happened before, and the pandemic happened, so Biden was in a hole to begin with,\u201d Pete said. But the veteran added the main issue driving him to Harris was Trump disrespecting veterans: \u201cHe called us suckers and losers.\u201d The argument for Trump\u2019s economics is ironclad, said Lori Higgins with a scoff: \u201cLook at the last four years \u2013 everyone is paying more for everything. What more do you need to know to make a decision?\u201d Now 52, she voted for Democrats until Trump convinced her to switch sides in 2016. Even on the most basic details, there is disagreement: Pete said he had just paid $2.99 for gas, citing it as evidence that inflation was coming under control. Two Trump supporters said they paid as much as $3.50 for gas, evidence, they said, that inflation is still squeezing Scranton. Trump and Harris have made close to 50 visits to Pennsylvania so far this election cycle and poured nearly $1bn into ads \u2013 a record spend that reflects how crucial its 19 electoral votes, the biggest prize of any battleground, make the keystone state. Trump made his second visit to Scranton in as many months last week. \u201cGo get everyone you know and vote immediately,\u201d he urged rallygoers. But persuading any part of the deeply divided electorate to swap their vote looks difficult. Harris may yet hold Scranton, said Berwood Yost, a Pennsylvania pollster, but that is \u201csurprising\u201d given the level of economic discontent in the city and the county. \u201cThe dissatisfaction with Biden is really high and views on personal finances are very negative, so Trump should be clearly ahead,\u201d Yost said. And yet polling averages show Harris ahead by a point in Pennsylvania, (firmly within the margin of error) which \u201cspeaks in part to some voters\u2019 concerns about Trump and his personal character\u201d. Since 2000, Democrats have won the county with as much as 63% support, but Hillary Clinton narrowly won with less than 50% of the 2016 vote. Biden\u2019s home-field advantage may have buoyed Dems in 2020 \u2013 he was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware, and he has name-checked the city throughout his long career and is still nicknamed \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s third senator\u201d. Biden beat Trump in the county by 53.7% to 45.3%. Still, Scranton has become \u201cground zero for demonstrating the appeal of Trump and the Maga movement, and places that traditionally voted Democrat and ended up changing their stripes in a significant way\u201d, Yost said. \u2018Way more optimistic\u2019 Once a powerhouse city in the nation\u2019s coal capital, Scranton\u2019s economy is now driven by small business, retail, healthcare, education and the service sector, said Satyajit Ghosh, a University of Scranton economist. Though there is no shortage of empty storefronts downtown, it is noticeably livelier than many similar Rust belt urban cores. University of Scranton\u2019s surveys of downtown businesses found owners in April had concerns about the current economic climate but were decidedly more optimistic about the next six months: \u201cWay more optimistic than they were a year ago,\u201d Ghosh said. Yost\u2019s most recent polling put Harris up three points statewide and found the economy to be the top issue for 34% of residents. Other recent polling found 60% of Pennsylvanians said their economic situation was worse compared with 40% who say it was better or no different. James Simrell is part of the latter group. As he closed up his boxing gym in Steamtown, the lifelong Democrat was upbeat about Scranton\u2019s economy. His gym is just one of his three businesses, and all stay busy \u2013 he also designs jewelry and runs a small farm that produces butternut squash and pumpkins. He sells pumpkins to Blackwatch Cafe, and squash to Abe\u2019s Delicatessen, which uses it in their soup. \u201cEveryone is doing well,\u201d Simrell said. In contrast, the Trump economy was \u201cfalling apart\u201d as the former president left office amid a poorly managed pandemic, Simrell said. He has other reasons for not voting for Trump. His two adopted children are Black and Trump is \u201ca little bit prejudiced \u2013 it drives my wife crazy\u201d. Echoing longtime Democratic voters\u2019 sentiment, he added: \u201cMy mom and dad were Democrats and I follow what they believe, and Kamala\u2019s the best person to be president \u2013 she\u2019s not crazy.\u201d But lingering inflation is still a drag for Eric Flesher, who runs a collectibles and vintage store, Rock-N-Models. He likened the economy to a \u201ctightening sphincter\u201d. He declined to talk about politics, but said everything remained expensive: \u201cI\u2019m in a business that sells stuff that nobody needs unless they have disposable income, so it gets much more difficult\u201d when there is inflation, Flesher said. Flesher added that he disagreed with the \u201cmindset here that I should vote for someone because that\u2019s how my mom and dad voted \u2013 then you\u2019re just voting for a party and not a person\u201d, he added. \u2018She\u2019s not the kind you can trust\u2019 The economic indicators in Scranton track those of the wider US. Inflation, which peaked at an annual rate of 9.1% in mid-2022, has eased to 2.4%. Prices are similarly down in Scranton, the economist Ghosh said. Seasonally adjusted unemployment in the region was 3.9% in August, below the 4.2% national average. \u201cIn this area, which I\u2019ve covered for many years, I really haven\u2019t ever seen this strong of a performance in terms of employment,\u201d said Ghosh. Still, there\u2019s an after-effect of inflation that consumers feel, Ghosh added, and some high prices, like those for rent or food, are still hurting. Outside a Walmart in Dickson City, a retail hub just north of Scranton, husband and wife John and Carol Gardner still feel the pinch. The Mount Cobb residents used to pay $150-$200 a month on groceries, and now they pay twice that. Carol is out of a job on disability, while John assembles buffet trays for $12 an hour to make ends meet, even though he said he should be retired. \u201cTrump at least made sure we could go shopping, and Biden is making sure we can\u2019t,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI hope the lady doesn\u2019t get in because we\u2019re going to go straight downhill \u2013 she\u2019s not the kind you can trust.\u201d The view is different at Bethel AME, a 153-year old Black church on downtown\u2019s west side. Pastor Mark Alexander sees an improving economy, and blames inflation on Trump. \u201cInflation was more so because of Covid, and how the former president handled that situation, because when you have supply chain interruptions and poor leadership guiding the nation, it exacerbates things,\u201d he said. The Federal Reserve, not the president, decides rates, Alexander noted, and he pointed to low unemployment, the Chips Act \u2013 which is pouring billions into domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors \u2013 and Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill as evidence of the president\u2019s economic success. Moreover, at Bethel AME, there is \u201cexcitement for someone who looks like us and has experienced some of things we have gone through and comes from a middle-class upbringing\u201d, Alexander added. \u201cAs opposed to a billionaire who has no clue what it is like day to day for middle-class people,\u201d he said. That\u2019s especially true with younger people because Harris \u201cspeaks their language\u201d, Alexander added. For others, neither candidate is appealing. Mike Gilson owns a flooring business, a maintenance company, and manages artists and chefs. He said the economy was strong locally because its economic backbone was made up of longtime small businesses, and it fared better during the last session than most other areas because of that composition. But the city\u2019s relatively strong economic standing is not persuading Gilson to vote for Harris. He said the president was a \u201cceremonial position\u201d and big corporations run the nation. \u201cIf the president actually wielded the power that people think they do then voting would make a lot more sense to me,\u201d Gilson said. History will decide which of Scranton\u2019s many voices will decide this election. Right now it is unclear whether the legacy of the city\u2019s most famous son will be enough to carry Harris over the line or finally hand Scranton and the state to Trump. With the race essentially a toss-up at this point, the key for either party is going to be turnout, Yost said. But in that battle, Trump may have an advantage \u2013 people who are less likely to vote have in recent elections voted for Trump. \u201cDemocrats have to counter that by getting their voters to the polls,\u201d Yost said. \u201cThink about the election as a mosaic \u2013 there are many pieces and some are bigger than others, but they\u2019re all going to matter.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-26T19:03:28Z",
            "content": "Labour will launch a new era of public and private investment in hospitals, schools, transport and energy as momentous as any in the party\u2019s history in this week\u2019s budget, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said. In an interview with the Observer before the first budget by a female chancellor, Reeves draws comparisons with Labour\u2019s historic reform programmes begun in 1945 by Clement Attlee, in 1964 under Harold Wilson and in 1997 under Tony Blair. \u201cThis is only the fourth time that Labour has gone from opposition into government,\u201d she says. \u201cIn 1945, we rebuilt after the war; in 1964, we rebuilt with the \u2018white heat of technology\u2019; and in 1997, we rebuilt our public services. We need to do all of that now.\u201d Reeves will, however, face huge controversy amid claims that she will break at least the spirit of Labour\u2019s election promises when she announces \u00a340bn of tax rises and spending cuts that will include an increase of up to 2% in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and a likely further freeze in income tax thresholds beyond 2028. Such a freeze on thresholds \u2013 which Reeves described last year as \u201cpicking the pockets of working people\u201d when the same policy was reannounced by the Tories \u2013 will drag 400,000 people into paying tax for the first time and 600,000 into doing so at a higher rate. Before the election, Labour ruled out any increases in income tax, national insurance and VAT on \u201cworking people\u201d. In the interview, Reeves claims that she is in fact keeping to her election pledges in full, as people will not see their taxes rise immediately after the budget and national insurance rises will not directly affect employees. \u201cThe day after the budget, people are not going to see those main taxes that they pay \u2013 income tax, national insurance, VAT \u2013 going up \u2026 We promised at the election that we wouldn\u2019t put up those taxes for working people. \u201cOne of the things that has eroded trust in politics and politicians has been a failure to stick to manifesto commitments. We don\u2019t want to be that sort of government, I don\u2019t want to be that sort of chancellor.\u201d But Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, said that raising employer NICs was a \u201cjobs tax that is paid by working people\u201d, which would mean \u201cfewer jobs and lower wages\u201d, as employers would pass on the effects to those they employed in the form of lower wages or redundancies. He cited the Institute for Fiscal Studies as saying the rise would be a \u201cstraightforward breach\u201d of promises. While she is bound to face a backlashes over tax rises, Reeves is determined to portray the budget as the launch of a period of huge \u201cnational renewal\u201d that will tackle the legacy of chaos left by the Tories \u2013 a \u00a322bn black hole in current spending \u2013 through tough decisions on tax, while changing the fiscal rules to allow \u00a350bn of extra borrowing for capital projects to reverse a decline in infrastructure across the public sphere. As part of the twin-track approach, \u00a31.4bn will be directed towards \u201crebuilding crumbling schools\u201d, with 50 schools rebuilt a year. Hospital rebuilding projects are expected to be announced alongside these in the budget. Reeves says such schemes would not be possible without changing the fiscal rules, and makes clear she expects the Tories to oppose such changes in the aftermath of the budget. Sensing the opportunity to open a new dividing line with the Conservatives, Reeves says: \u201cIf they oppose our new fiscal rules next week, they will basically be saying they support the current path of decline. We are happy to have that debate. We are on the right side of it.\u201d She adds: \u201cI think the big divide in politics after this is going to be whether you are in favour of investment or whether you are in favour of decline. \u201cWe inherited a plan from the previous government in which public sector net investment, capital investment, would be falling sharply over the course of this parliament, and that would mean scores of hospitals not built. It would mean massive opportunities to grow our economy in the digital and energy sector would be missed and those jobs would go elsewhere.\u201d She spells out how she sees two types of investment as crucial to transforming the country, as a direct result of reforming borrowing rules. The first will be projects that \u201ccrowd in\u201d big private sector investment alongside public funding, such as the plan recently announced for \u00a321bn of public investment in carbon capture and storage alongside billions of pounds of private investment. There will be other such public-private models in the energy, digital, science and transport sectors, to be announced in the budget. The second type of investment will be in \u201cthe public realm\u201d, with the rebuilding of urgently needed schools and hospital buildings. New and developing industries also offer huge opportunities that invite investment, she says. \u201cThis is a new settlement on Wednesday to rebuild our country and seize the massive opportunities in technology and energy that are out there. There is a global race on for those jobs and we need to seize them for Britain. If we can unlock that investment, public and private, then we can do great things as a country again.\u201d Reeves says that while she will not be lifting the two-child benefit cap that is blamed for plunging thousands more young people into poverty, she will be taking other actions to alleviate child poverty. \u201cWe are a good Labour government, and good Labour governments lift children out of poverty and fix the National Health Service. I hope that people can see that I am starting to turn the corner.\u201d"

            "title": "Harris edges out Trump on key economic questions, new poll shows",
            "date": "2024-10-21T15:24:29Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has lost his advantage over Kamala Harris on who is best qualified to manage the economy, new polls suggest. With millions of voters already casting early ballots for the presidency ahead of election day on 5 November, a fresh Associated Press/NORC poll says Harris, the Democratic nominee, has taken a slight lead when it comes to some key economic questions that concern middle-class voters. The finding consolidates a trend from the the same poll last month, which showed Harris had almost closed a previously large deficit with Trump, the former US president and Republican nominee, on who could best handle economic issues. The economy consistently tops voters\u2019 priority list. The latest poll asked more detailed questions than the previous survey, concluding that 46% prefer Harris\u2019s policies on taxes for the middle class, compared to 35% for Trump. The US vice-president also has a slight edge on the cost of housing, while voters are evenly split on which of the pair has the better policies on the prices of groceries and petrol, and creating jobs or addressing unemployment. The boost to Harris comes even as a majority of voters, 62%, believe the economy is in poor condition, compared with 38% who say the opposite. The outlook is more positive than in October last year, when nearly three in four people said the economy was in poor shape. The Trump campaign has long sought to make inflation and rising living costs a focal point of its critique of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Harris, since replacing Biden as the Democrats\u2019 nominee in July, has launched a counteroffensive that involves putting proposals for an \u201copportunity economy\u201d at the heart of her campaign message \u2013 including a pledge to give first-time buyers $25,000 towards a down payment on a new home. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, stressed economic themes in a CNN interview on Sunday in which he rebutted suggestions that voters were primarily concerned with Trump\u2019s increasingly erratic campaign rhetoric and actions, including shutting down audience questions at a town hall in order to shuffle aimlessly to music for 39 minutes. \u201cThe big question \u2013 and the one that Kamala Harris has not been able to answer \u2013 is: are you better off now than under the Trump administration, four years ago?\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNo one can answer that question with a yes.\u201d The Harris campaign has deployed Bill Clinton to sell the vice-president\u2019s economic message, with a particular focus on rural and Black voters. Clinton\u2019s role as an economic messenger is partly a product of his successful 1992 presidential campaign, which was distinctive largely because of its focus on economic issues, as summarised by the famous phrase \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d coined by its chief strategist James Carville. At a rally last Friday in Wilmington in North Carolina \u2013 a key battleground state where the two candidates are neck and neck \u2013 the former Democratic president said Harris\u2019s economic proposals would ease circumstances for the majority. \u201cShe wants to help the middle class and working people with lower incomes work their way into the middle class,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton has also offered a nuanced view of the state of the contemporary economy, acknowledging inflation under the Biden administration but explaining why it occurred. At the Democratic national convention in August, he said the US had created 51m jobs since the end of the cold war, and that 50m of them had come under Democratic administrations. \u201cI swear I checked this three times. Even I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the score? Democrats 50, Republicans one.\u201d"

            "title": "OBR says budget unlikely to lift economic growth over next five years",
            "date": "2024-10-30T19:23:19Z",
            "content": "Labour has embarked on a \u201clarge, sustained increase in spending, tax and borrowing\u201d, according to the government\u2019s economic forecaster, as it judged that Labour\u2019s first budget for 15 years is unlikely to increase economic growth over the next five years. Assessing Rachel Reeves\u2019s policies, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the economy would expand at the same rate as predicted in March by the end of the parliament, despite a \u00a370bn-a-year rise in spending. The extra spending revealed by Reeves would give a short-term lift to economic output, it said, but leave the average rate of growth over the next five years unchanged. A change in the budget rules that allows for a spending increase will swell the size of the state to 44% of annual national income, five percentage points higher than before the pandemic.Richard Hughes, the head of the OBR, said the effect of an increase in taxes of \u00a340bn would take the tax take each year as a proportion of national income to a historic high of 38% by 2029-30. Hughes said: \u201cAgainst a largely unchanged economic and fiscal backdrop since our last forecast in March, this budget delivers one of the largest increases in spending, tax and borrowing of any single fiscal event in history.\u201d The larger state will \u201ccrowd out\u201d business activity and business investment, the OBR said, pushing living standards down by about 1% in the last year of its five-year forecast. Inflation will be slightly higher than previously estimated and wages slightly lower than previously forecast after a \u00a326bn hit to business costs from the chancellor\u2019s decision to raise employers\u2019 national insurance. The expanded state will be competing with the private sector for the same scarce resources, pushing up prices. David Miles, the chief economic adviser to the OBR, said: \u201cThe [fall in disposable incomes] is inevitable when the government is taking 2% of national income to spend on public services and public investment.\u201d Brexit will also hurt the UK\u2019s growth prospects by lowering trade intensity with the EU by 15%. Trade intensity measures a drop in trade with the EU relative to the bloc\u2019s trade with the rest of the world. Hughes said the increase in borrowing would cost the government more than \u00a3100bn in debt payments in each year of the parliament for the first time following an average annual rise of \u00a332bn over the next five years. There was a better outlook for the economy over the next two years, compared with a revised outlook since March, but a weaker rate of expansion in the second half of the parliament, the OBR added. A prediction in March that the economy would grow by 0.8% this year was revised up to 1.1%, in line with the outlook by the International Monetary Fund and just below the 1.2% forecast by the Bank of England. Next year the economy is expected to expand by 2%, compared with the 1.8% expected in March. However, the growth rate will slow in subsequent years compared with the forecast in March. In 2026, the OBR said growth would be 1.8%, down from 2% in March and 1.5% in 2027, down from the 1.8% prediction in March. Over the longer term, the improvements in public services expected to be funded by the budget will add 1.5% to economic growth. Hughes said two new budget rules would govern how the government taxes and spends. One rule forces the chancellor to keep day-to-day spending in balance. The other allows the Treasury to include government assets in its calculation of the national debt. Reeves said she had adopted a new measure of national debt to align with the way it is calculated in France, Germany and Japan. The switch to public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) will capture assets such as student loans and investments made through government agencies. Conservative spending plans implied \u00a319bn of real-terms cuts in 2028-29 for unprotected departments such as justice and transport. Reeves, who vowed there would be no austerity under Labour, pumped most of her extra spending into the NHS. She said defence spending would remain above the commitment made to Nato of 2% of national income. However, the OBR said this had been achieved after reducing a growth rate of 3% in defence spending this year to zero next year, once adjusted for inflation."

            "date": "2024-10-28T00:01:14Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s Alternative Investment Market (Aim) has shrunk to its smallest size in 23 years as business owners and investors anticipate an abolition of inheritance tax relief in the budget this week. The accountancy group UHY Hacker Young calculated that 92 companies have delisted from Aim, London\u2019s junior stock market, in the past year, reducing the total number of companies on Aim to 695. Twenty-six companies have delisted from Aim since the general election in July, taking the total below 700 for first time since 2001. UHY Hacker Young said the possibility that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, would scrap inheritance tax (IHT) relief on Aim shares was hurting the index, with only 10 companies floating on the market in the last year. The value of the Aim market has fallen by 6% since Labour\u2019s election win on 4 July, while the blue-chip FTSE 100 index has been flat over the same period. Aim has fallen by more than 10% since Rishi Sunak called the election in May. Under current rules, Aim shares qualify for business property relief, meaning they avoid IHT if they have been held for more than two years at the time of death. This has made them attractive to wealthier families, looking for ways to pass on more of their money untaxed to their descendants. Colin Wright, a partner and the group chair at UHY Hacker Young, said: \u201cAs Aim experiences a further glut of companies leaving the exchange, the government needs to urgently address how it can help. Cutting IHT relief on Aim shares would do the opposite.\u201d He added: \u201cWith fewer companies now listed on Aim, and with fewer companies looking to join, the government should be looking at maximising incentives for both companies and investors in small caps.\u201d According to Dominic Tayler, the UK managing director at Oakglen Wealth, 15% of Aim shares are held through business relief-based funds for inheritance tax purposes. Tayler says that Aim has been hit by a fall in liquidity in recent years, as investors have switched to passive, or tracker, funds that track the main market moves, and as pension funds have ignored smaller companies. \u201cSpeculation around the removal of business relief for Aim in the forthcoming budget has compounded this. Not only is this bad for business, it also harms long-term savers who are the life blood of private investment,\u201d Tayler said. This month, the British online retailer N Brown joined the ranks of companies leaving Aim, by accepting a takeover bid by Joshua Alliance, whose family control the company. Alliance said N Brown was not benefiting from being listed on the Aim market, and would have to bear \u201csignificant costs\u201d associated with its listing. Research commissioned by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) found that Aim companies contributed \u00a368bn in gross value added to the UK economy last year, and paid \u00a35.4bn in corporation tax. In September, Marcus Stuttard, the head of Aim and UK primary markets at LSEG, wrote that Aim had helped more than 4,000 companies to raise nearly \u00a3135bn from investors since it was created in 1995. Stuttard argued that Aim had made an important contribution to the UK economy through company tax contributions, creating jobs and expanding supply chains. \u201cAs Aim turns 30, we should celebrate the success of companies past and present who have made such an important contribution to our economy. But it is vital that we protect the market and its structures so that companies in the future can continue to support this positive legacy of economic growth and deliver returns for investors and savers,\u201d he added."

            "date": "2024-10-21T13:27:51Z",
            "content": "When CD sales took off in the late 80s, many believed it sounded the death knell for the old-fashioned vinyl album. Fast forward 40 years and records are the in thing again, so much so that the high street retailer WH Smith is bringing them back after a three-decade hiatus. The records will be stocked in 80 high street shops across the country for the first time since the 90s, as the retailer tries to attract \u201cseasoned fans and new listeners alike\u201d. According to data from the BPI, the UK record labels association, vinyl purchases reached 5.9m units during 2023 \u2013 their highest annual level since 1990. In the UK, sales were given an extra boost by Taylor Swift\u2019s album 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version), which was crowned the biggest vinyl album of 2023, with more than 84,700 copies sold since its release last October. The biggest vinyl LP of the year by a British artist was the Rolling Stones\u2019 Hackney Diamonds, at number two. WH Smith first began selling vinyl albums in the 1950s, with records becoming a key product category for the retailer. But they were discontinued in the 1990s as CDs took off. The record renaissance has also brought about a rise in the number of indie record stores across the UK. A study by ERA, the digital entertainment and retail association, found that there are now 461 indie record shops in the UK, 122 more than 2014. In 2014, indie shops made up just 3% of total music outlets in the UK, but the figure is now 23%. This reflects the drop in the number of supermarkets and other big stores selling music. The music retailer HMV reopened its flagship record store in 2019 after a four-year absence, with an entire floor dedicated to vinyl LPs and CDs. This year, records were also added to the list of products used to calculate annual inflation for the first time since they dropped off in 1992. Emma Smyth, commercial director of WH Smith\u2019s high street operations, said: \u201cTo me it\u2019s no surprise that vinyl is growing in popularity again, and we are very excited to be bringing back record selections to more than 80 different stores across the UK for both seasoned fans and new listeners alike.\u201d Vinyl would be stocked in WH Smith stores in Canterbury, Chester, Edinburgh Gyle and York, among others, the group said."

            "content": "New York City police arrested numerous pro-Gaza protesters outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday after a demonstration highlighting Israel\u2019s ongoing attacks on Gaza and Lebanon. Demonstrators voiced chants such as \u201cLet Gaza live!\u201d and \u201cUp up with liberation, down down with occupation!\u201d and managed to get inside a security fence outside the exchange on Broad Street in downtown Manhattan. They then sat down and waited for police to take them into custody, according to the Associated Press. Jewish Voice for Peace, which organized the protest, said: \u201c\ufeff200 Jews are risking arrest risking arrest in the largest act of civil disobedience in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cStocks are rising while children are dying. As Israel drops bombs on homes, schools, and hospitals in Gaza, Wall Street booms, and all the members of Congress who invest in these companies get richer every day,\u201d Jay Saper of Jewish Voice for Peace said in a press release. Video of the protest posted by independent journalist Noah Hurowitz on Twitter/X shows a large group of protesters walking briskly toward the exchange, converging in front of the entrance, and blocking it. Police reportedly told some media that there had been up to 200 arrests. Asked to confirm the number of arrests, an NYPD spokesperson said there had been multiple, but that they did not have a final number yet. Police were also witnessed detaining a credentialed journalist and then released her shortly thereafter, Hurowitz said on X. The demonstration came a week after the one-year anniversary of Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack against Israel. Hamas fighters crossed into Israel from Gaza and killed 1,200 people, including more than 40 Americans, and took at least 251 hostages of whom nearly 100 remain in Gaza, according to NBC News. Israel has since carried out a military campaign in Gaza. The Gaza ministry of health says that more than 41,000 have died, ABC News said. The Israel-Gaza war has expanded into other parts of the region and stoked fears that military action will spread further, especially if Iran carries out larger attacks than it has done so far. Hezbollah, allied with Iran, on 8 October 2023 started launching rockets at northern Israel in support of Hamas. The conflict deepened recently after Israel bombed southern Lebanon, the Bekaa valley and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, and deployed ground troops across the border. \u201cAt this very moment, the Israeli military is massacring family after family in North Gaza \u2013 with US-made bombs. The Biden Administration wants the public to believe that the US\u2019s $18 billion slushfund for Israel\u2019s genocide is for the sake of \u2018Jewish safety,\u2019\u201d Elena Stein, director of organizing strategy for Jewish Voice for Peace, said in a press release. \u201cWe\u2019re here refusing to be used as the US\u2019s moral cover and to expose its true interests: financial gain and control in the region. Weapons embargo now,\u201d Stein also said."

            "date": "2024-10-15T14:07:33Z",
            "content": "Boeing is seeking to raise up to $25bn (\u00a319bn) in an attempt to shore up its finances as the planemaker struggles with production delays amid a strike by 33,000 workers and ongoing safety concerns. A regulatory filing by the company on Tuesday said it intended to raise the money through a stock and debt offering, which would provide flexibility for Boeing to seek options to support its balance sheet over a three-year period. It also entered into a separate $10bn credit agreement with a consortium of banks, which it said would provide short-term access to liquidity as it navigated through a \u201cchallenging environment\u201d. Production at the planemaker has been hobbled by the strike that began a month ago, which is estimated to have cost the company more than $1bn, according to Reuters. Last week, the company withdrew its offer of a 30% pay rise over four years for striking staff after talks with unions broke down, and later in the week it announced plans to shed 17,000 jobs \u2013 about 10% of its global workforce \u2013 to cut costs. The strikes add to a tumultuous year for Boeing, which began in January when a door panel blew out in mid-air from one of its 737 Max 9s shortly after it took off from Portland, Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) then enforced a cap on the production of the Max jets. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people, and agreed to pay a fine of almost $250m (\u00a3191m). It was not clear when or how much the company expected to raise through the offering announced on Tuesday but analysts predicted it would be completed before the end of the year. Boeing is also facing $11.5bn of debt maturing through February 2026, while it has committed to issuing $4.7bn of its shares to acquire Spirit AeroSystems, as well as take on its debt. The deal to buy back the parts supplier, which it sold off nearly 20 years ago, was part of its plan to boost safety on production lines. In a statement with the filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing said: \u201cThis universal shelf registration provides flexibility for the company to seek a variety of capital options as needed to support the company\u2019s balance sheet over a three-year period.\u201d The separate $10bn credit facility was struck with banks including Citibank and Goldman Sachs but the manufacturer confirmed it had yet to draw any money from it. It said: \u201cThese are two prudent steps to support the company\u2019s access to liquidity.\u201d"

            "content": "The rolling stock firm Porterbrook paid out \u00a380m in dividends to its mainly overseas shareholders last year, accounts show, fuelling further calls for Britain\u2019s trains to be nationalised. The firm\u2019s train leasing arm made profits of \u00a3144m in 2023, when the railway was still beset by strikes over frozen pay and passengers faced widespread cancellations and fare rises of almost 6%. Unions described the figures as \u201cshocking but unsurprising\u201d after years of Porterbrook and other rolling stock firms continuing to pay out large dividends to shareholders, despite the downturn in the wider rail industry\u2019s revenues. The pay of Porterbrook\u2019s chief executive, Mary Grant, rose to almost \u00a31.4m \u2013 more than double that of the chief executive of Network Rail. Just more than \u00a3150m was paid in dividends from Porterbrook\u2019s leasing arm to its parent company, Porterbrook Holdings, in the 12 months to December 2023, according to accounts filed this month. The holdings firm paid out \u00a380m in dividends to its shareholders, led by the insurer Allianz and the Canadian pension fund AIM. It is the second successive year it has returned \u00a380m in dividends. Unions argue that the hundreds of millions in profits diverted overseas by Porterbrook, Eversholt, Angel Trains and others should be reinvested in rail. Labour has started legislating to renationalise train operating firms but not the rolling stock firms, which would require a huge capital outlay. A spokesperson for Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 trade union, said: \u201cThese new figures are shocking, but not surprising. The privatisation of the RoSCos, the rolling stock companies, by John Major in 1994 was the most egregious example of all the Tories\u2019 privatisations. \u201cThe new Labour government is doing a great job bringing the passenger companies back into public ownership. Now, though, the government must turn its attention to the freight companies, and the rolling stock companies, which are turning the taxpayer over big time. We have to get their snouts out of the public trough.\u201d Porterbrook said it had spent \u00a33.5bn on rolling stock and hundreds of millions more in upgrading fleets and testing green technology. A spokesperson said: \u201cPorterbrook is able to invest and innovate for the future of the railway because of the funding that our shareholders provide, and in the normal course of business, when appropriate, dividends are paid.\u201d"

            "content": "A closely watched measure of US inflation has slipped to its lowest level since 2021, within striking distance of policymakers\u2019 target, after the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down price growth from its highest level in a generation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.1% last month, down from 2.2% in August and in line with economists\u2019 expectations. The progress was underlined by official data released five days before the US presidential election. The state of the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 and the cost of living in it \u2013 has played a central role in the contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to succeed Joe Biden. Inflation surged three years ago, peaking at its highest level in four decades as the impact of Covid-19 continued to roil the global economy. Officials at the Fed, having initially insisted that an acceleration in price growth would be \u201ctransitory\u201d, later engineered an extraordinary U-turn and embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle it. The Fed would go on to lift interest rates to a two-decade high \u2013 and only started to cut them last month. The central bank\u2019s effort was designed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d PCE index \u2013 which strips out volatile food and energy costs \u2013 rose 2.7% in September, in line with recent months, but slightly above economists\u2019 expectations of 2.6%. While inflation has fallen dramatically, years of price increases continue to take their toll on many Americans. The economy has remained remarkably resilient \u2013 and continued to grow at a robust pace in the third quarter, according to data released on Wednesday \u2013 but almost half of voters wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Such polling frustrated Biden. When the president withdrew from the election this summer, making way for Harris, his vice-president was more willing to acknowledge that the cost of living remained \u201cjust too high\u201d for many. As Trump has argued that America is in economic decline, the White House has sought to underline positive economic figures in recent months. Hiring unexpectedly accelerated in September, and data for October will be released on Friday."

            "date": "2024-10-16T10:04:42Z",
            "content": "Last month\u2019s surprise fall in UK inflation lands with bad timing for millions of people who receive state benefits linked to the figure, who can now expect their payments to rise by just 1.7% next April. A number of benefits, including universal credit, are increased each tax year in line with the cost of living figure for the previous September. The decline in the annual price growth figure in September, driven by falling air fares and transport costs, disguised larger increases in some categories, including food and drink, which recorded inflation of 1.8%. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said the 1.7% figure would mean that a typical low-income family, with two children, on universal credit would receive an increase of \u00a3253 in their annual payment from next April. It said the fall in the headline rate was likely to be temporary as previous falls in energy prices dropped out of the 12-month inflation calculation, and suggested inflation could increase again in October to 2.2%. If that higher figure were used, the same family would be \u00a374 better off as the annual increase would be \u00a3327. By contrast, state pensioners are protected by the triple lock, which stipulates that their annual increase in payments is in line with whichever is highest of earnings, inflation or 2.5%. Next year, the rise will be in line with wages, meaning an increase of 4.1% in April \u2013 adding \u00a3473 a year to the full state pension. Lalitha Try, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThis temporary [inflation] fall is badly timed for millions of low- to middle-income families as it will result in a lower increase in their benefits next year. A more timely measure of benefit uprating would deliver a cash gain to a low-income family with kids of around \u00a374 next year. The government needs to address the age divide in benefits which has left working-age support fall further behind rising wages and living standards.\u201d September\u2019s inflation figure has also increased market bets that the Bank of England will cut interest rates again to 4.75% when it meets next month, which would be good news for borrowers but would be likely to lead to a cut in savings rates."

            "content": "Inflation weakened to its slowest pace in more than three years last month, as price growth continued to fall back from its highest levels in a generation. With concerns over the heightened cost of living at the heart of the presidential election campaign, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its final monthly inflation reading before voters head to the polls. The consumer price index rose at an annual pace of 2.4% in September, slightly higher than economists\u2019 expectations of 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, increased at an annual rate of 3.3%. Over the month, prices rose 0.2%. Gasoline prices dropped by 4.1% during September, and were 15.3% lower than a year ago. But problems remain. Shelter costs rose 0.2% and food prices increased 0.4% in September, contributing over 75% of the monthly all items increase. Egg prices rose 8.4%. Though prices surged three years ago, their rapid growth has since slowed significantly from its 9.1% peak in June 2022 and prices are now rising at their slowest rate since February 2021. The US Federal Reserve, which scrambled to increase interest rates in an effort to cool the world\u2019s largest economy, started cutting rates last month. The broader US economy appears to be growing at a robust pace. American employers added 254,000 jobs last month, according to official data released on Friday, defying fears of a slowdown in the labor market. Lael Brainard, the White House national economic adviser, said: \u201cWe keep making progress, with inflation returning to pre-pandemic levels, 16m jobs created, lower interest rates, and low unemployment.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-02T19:00:56Z",
            "content": "With a pandemic that upended global trade through lockdowns and travel restrictions still fresh in managers\u2019 minds, international supply chains are again under pressure. Shippers are facing myriad issues, from the conflict in the Middle East and drought in Central America to strike action in the US, and companies are finding it more difficult \u2013 and more expensive \u2013 to transport supplies. So, how bad is the supply chain squeeze? Why are supply chains under pressure? Global shippers have been faced with a growing number of headaches in moving goods over the last year. At the top of this list is the disruption in the Middle East and the impact on the movement of trade through the Red Sea. Traffic has plummeted by two-thirds through the key shipping route since attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels began last year. The route accounted for 12% of all global trade before the attacks began. Many companies, including major shipping firms such as Maersk, have all but abandoned the route, instead opting to travel around the Cape of Good Hope, which can add 10 days to journeys, and significant costs. A fresh flare-up of tensions in the Middle East in recent days has raised fears that even more ships may shun the route. Peter Sand, chief analyst at shipping analytics platform Xeneta, believes the latest escalation will have a smaller impact, as most container ships are already avoiding the Red Sea. However, he warns that a \u201cfurther deterioration in the political situation means a large-scale return of container ships to the Red Sea region seems to be a more distant prospect\u201d. Separately, traffic through the Panama Canal has also dropped after a drought forced its operator to reduce the cap on the number of ships that could travel through it earlier this year, from 36 a day to 20. Fears of trade disruption have been further exacerbated by the port workers\u2019 strikes on the east coast of the US. On Tuesday, nearly 50,000 members of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association went on strike indefinitely, affecting 14 ports across the east coast of the US. Marco Forgione, director general at the Chartered Institute of Export and International Trade, said all of these issues have meant \u201chighly fragile\u201d supply chains are facing \u201cexceptional pressures\u201d. He said Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the US-China trade standoff, as well as events such as the Baltimore bridge collapse, have added to supply chain pressures. What has been the impact so far? The biggest impact from the disruptions has been on the cost for business to transport goods. Freight companies opting for the Cape of Good Hope route face an added 40% in fuel costs, while container prices have also risen. According to Xeneta, spot rates for 40ft shipping containers moving between the east Asia and northern Europe stood at $8,587 a container when the market peaked in July \u2013 468% higher than in December 2023, before the Houthi attacks ramped up. The US port strikes have already affected container prices from northern Europe to the east coast of America, with an average 40ft container costing $2,861 on Tuesday, compared with $1,836 at the end of August. The disruption, particularly in the Red Sea, has also led to longer lead times for companies. Earlier this year, manufacturers and retailers said the diversion around Africa to avoid the Red Sea had added four weeks to delivery times. Carmakers such as Volvo and Tesla have had to suspend production lines because of a lack of parts as a result of the disruption. Meanwhile, retailers in the UK, including DFS and JD Sports, have said the Red Sea crisis has hit some sales. Forgione said continued disruption would ultimately hit the consumer. He said: \u201cWhere there is instability and uncertainty, the impacts are either price increases, \u2018shrinkflation\u2019, or you\u2019re going to see availability issues.\u201d What is the outlook for oil prices? The oil price climbed for a second consecutive day to almost $76 a barrel on Wednesday, from $71 at the start of the week. Some analysts believe it could break $80 within days. The market is braced for a potential threat to Iran\u2019s crude output by an Israeli retaliation against its oil infrastructure. Goldman Sachs estimates Iran can produce 1m barrels of oil a day. But there could be further disruption to supplies if problems with key shipping routes through the Red Sea affect crude exports from the wider Middle East region. In an \u201cunlikely tail scenario\u201d, Goldman Sachs warned that an interruption of oil trade through the strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, would result in a \u201clarge oil price spike\u201d. However, Saudi Arabia has said prices could actually fall, to about $50 a barrel, due to a supply glut as it tries to regain market share. Could inflation start rising again? The cost of oil and gas began to soar in 2021, sending inflation above 10% and pushing up the price of everything from food to household energy bills. Inflation has tumbled back to near the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target over the last year, but left prices more than 20% higher than before the pandemic, giving households a financial shock. Brexit has pushed up the price of imported goods from the EU, while the US\u2019s trade war with China threatens to widen into a broader battle over tariffs. The UK is one of the most open trading nations in the world and the scars from the pandemic and two major conflicts are being deeply felt by importers and exporters. If they choose to pass on those costs to consumers, then Britons may face a squeeze on their budgets again."

            "title": "Inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling. Here\u2019s why that matters for Australia",
            "date": "2024-10-16T03:23:37Z",
            "content": "Sarah Hunter, the Reserve Bank\u2019s chief economist, has given a speech about \u201cinflation expectations\u201d at the Citi investor conference in Sydney on Wednesday, drawing on new research from the central bank. Here are four takeaways: What are inflation expectations and why do they matter? We anticipate a lot of things, such as the weather, and (often) modify our behaviour and clothing accordingly. So it is with inflation. If people experience rising prices, they assess \u2013 with some caveats \u2013 how they think about future prices and make adjustments. Those changes might be to ask for a bigger pay rise or to set a higher price for goods or services if they\u2019re in business. And, as Hunter said, expectations can be self-fulfilling: \u201cMacroeconomists generally think that a prerequisite for consistently achieving low and stable inflation over time is well anchored inflation expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is, people across the economy believe inflation will generally average a low rate (in Australia\u2019s case 2%-3%), and they make decisions based on this underlying belief that becomes self-reinforcing. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email What did the research into expectations show? Hunter said the findings were \u201cgood news\u201d. Inflation expectations \u201cappear\u201d to be sliding back towards long-term norms and had \u201cremained anchored\u201d during the recent price spurt (unlike, say, in T\u00fcrkiye). And if actual inflation had lately been \u201csticky\u201d (to cite previous RBA officials\u2019 speeches), there was \u201cno evidence of expectations being more persistent than normal\u201d, she said. Importantly, though, the research (by Anthony Brassil, Yahdullah Haidari, Jonathan Hambur, Gulnara Nolan and Callum Ryan) found the RBA\u2019s model was more pessimistic about how households and unions would be about inflation than turned out to be the case. Guardian Australia asked Hunter: if the model over-anticipated inflation expectations, does it follow official interest rates might not need to stay as high for as long? \u201cInflation expectations are just one part of what determines actual inflation outcomes, of course, and broader economic outcomes as well,\u201d and the RBA would consider \u201cthat much bigger picture\u201d. No cigar then. (Markets are rating only a 60% chance of an RBA interest rate cut by February, as of yesterday.) Some price rises have more impact than others Consumers (and businesses) form views about where inflation is headed based on a range of \u201csalient\u201d items that are taken as proxies for what\u2019s happening more broadly. Groceries and rent are obvious ones but energy prices, particularly motor fuel, tend to carry more sway than others. (Blame those red neon price signs at servos perhaps.) And yet drivers seem to discern that price spikes from \u201cshocks\u201d (think Ukraine) may only be temporary. It needs \u201can extended period\u201d of unusually high (or low) fuel prices before there\u2019s \u201ca meaningful impact on expectations\u201d, the model suggests. For instance, fuel price inflation was 61% between the start of 2021 and mid-2022 before dropping back to \u201caround\u201d historical averages. \u201cSalient\u201d fuel prices did not bounce around like actual bowser bills did, it seems. We asked if that meant the RBA might \u201clook through\u201d another oil price spike (eg should Israel attack Iran\u2019s oil industry) since consumers\u2019 views take some budging. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful in terms of knowing that inflation expectations hopefully would stay anchored through a future period like that,\u201d Hunter said, adding the \u201ccontext\u201d mattered. There are no \u201chard and fast\u201d rules. Is \u2018rational inattentiveness\u2019 really rational? Among other findings: most households are slower to adjust their anticipation of future inflation based on \u201clived experience\u201d compared with unions. Inflation has to be \u201cpersistently higher or lower than previously expected for expectations to change significantly\u201d, Hunter said. The outcome is consistent with a so-called \u201crational inattention\u201d hypothesis. The longish period when inflation was low and stable meant people didn\u2019t think it was worth worrying too much about inflation, so they didn\u2019t. However, the recent experience may have shaken some of that complacency. Might that lead to \u201cirrational attention\u201d? (We can think of one example: electricity prices. These make up about half of petrol/diesel\u2019s share of the CPI basket but attract far more media notice.) And, as a concept, can we put much store in experiences as a guide to the future? Few of us can envisage future extreme weather that physics tells us to anticipate as global heating intensifies, but that doesn\u2019t mean under-preparation is rational. Inflation expectations might also be among the least of our worries at some point. Peter Hannam is Guardian Australia\u2019s economics correspondent"

Predictions that the German economy would shrink for a second consecutive quarter proved unfounded as gross domestic product increased by 0.2% in the third quarter after a 0.3% contraction in the previous quarter. Germany\u2019s minister for economic affairs, Robert Habeck, said: \u201cThis is still far from what we need, but at least it is a ray of hope.\u201d Growth in Germany lifted the wider eurozone economy, which expanded by 0.4% in the third quarter, twice the 0.2% rate predicted by economists. Economists said the inflation shock that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 sparking a dramatic increase in energy and food prices that undermined business and consumer confidence across the eurozone \u2013 was beginning to ease. Alexander Kr\u00fcger, the chief economist at the private bank Hauck Aufha\u00fcser Lampe, said: \u201cUnder the weight of many structural weaknesses, the economy is sending out a sign of life. This is thanks to the consumers, who have let their guard down a little.\u201d The consultancy Oxford Economics said the available information suggested most of the growth across the eurozone came from household and government spending, while investment continued to be restricted by high interest rates. France\u2019s economy expanded by 0.4%, up from 0.2% in the second quarter, thanks to a boost from the Olympic Games in the summer, while Spain marked itself out as Europe\u2019s growth hub, growing by 0.8%, largely due to a surge in tourism. Only Italy was among Europe\u2019s large economies to stagnate in the third quarter. Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government is officially forecasting the Italian economy will grow by 1% this year, but after downward revisions to the first two quarters, the economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, said this month that the goal may be out of reach. Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 senior economist, Kamil Kovar, said the figures put to rest any questions of whether the eurozone was in recession. \u201cIt is not, and such worries were always overblown. \u201cThat said, there is a clear continuing weakness in investment, suggesting that worries about the outlook are not completely misplaced. \u201cWe believe that today\u2019s release, together with the rebound in inflation, will shut down any talk about [a] jumbo-sized cut at the December European Central Bank meeting, and we also remain skeptical about expectations of a rate cut in January.\u201d"

            "content": "Eurozone GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of this year, twice as fast as the 0.2% growth expected. That follows Germany\u2019s welcome dodging of a recession, and France\u2019s Olympics-fuelled growth over the summer, which we\u2019ve seen this morning. Rachel Reeves has announced \u00a340bn of tax rises on businesses and the rich as Labour\u2019s first budget in 14 years sought to reverse more than a decade of decline in Britain\u2019s public services. After months of speculation since the party\u2019s general election landslide victory, the chancellor revealed a sweeping package of tax increases she said would be vital to balance the books and turn the page on austerity. \u201cThe only way to improve living standards, and the only way to drive economic growth is to invest, invest, invest,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cThere are no shortcuts, and to deliver that investment, we must restore economic stability and turn the page on the last 14 years.\u201d At its heart was an increase in national insurance contributions (Nics) paid by employers \u2013 worth \u00a325bn by the end of this parliament \u2013 alongside billions of pounds in increases from changes to capital gains tax, inheritance tax, VAT on private schools and the non-dom tax regime. In financial markets, borrowing costs initially fell, as investors welcomed the confirmation of large tax hikes. But the rally reversed \u2013 causing bond prices to fall and and yields (or interest rates) to rise, as the City digested the sharp increase in government borrowing forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care \u2013 JK John Burn-Murdoch, columnist and chief data reporter at the Financial Times, observed that the tax burden is also high in other countries. Economists at ING have looked at how the budget has been received in financial markets. Financial markets have been on a wild ride since the announcement of the UK\u2019s latest budget. Big tax rises are coming, but not as quickly as big spending increases. And the prospect of higher growth has led investors to curtail expectations for Bank of England rate cuts. Markets initially liked the tax hikes, but quick spotted the higher borrowing projection. UK bond yields did initially dip as the chancellor was speaking, and markets liked Rachel Reeves\u2019 confirmation that tax rises would raise \u00a340bn (1.5% GDP) per year. That\u2019s a big number by any comparison and is much more than Labour promised to raise during the general election. Investors also warmed to Reeves\u2019 commitment to balancing the current budget (day-to-day spending vs taxes), initially within five years, and latterly over three. But no sooner had the chancellor ended her speech did the tide quickly begin to turn. 10-year government bond (gilt) yields are up four basis points on the day, at the time of writing, and almost 15bp from the intraday low. Keith Cooney, head of business rates at the property firm Knight Frank, said: Today it was revealed that despite a change in government, the \u00a329bn business rates tax burden is set to increase again for 2025 with the largest ratepayers \u2013 which will include the country\u2019s key employers \u2013 being asked to effectively fund any support for SMEs. Despite pledges to support the high street the chancellor has cut the business relief for retail, leisure and hospitality from 75% to 40% albeit retaining the cap of \u00a3 110,000 per business. Moreover, the move to fund a reduction in the multiplier for retail, leisure and hospitality from 2026/7 with a higher rate targeting warehouses, is shortsighted as government is effectively taxing the infrastructure that these businesses rely on to move goods to their premises and directly to the consumer. This all adds even more complexity to an already highly complex system, and simply the shifts the tax liability without acknowledging that the tax burden on UK businesses is simply too high. It is difficult to see how these measures will help fix the foundations needed for economic recovery. Will Hutton, political economist and Observer columnist, wrote on X: Phil Vernon, head of business rates at PwC UK, said: The introduction of permanently lower business rates multipliers for high street retail, hospitality and leisure (RHL) properties from 2026-27 will be welcomed by these sectors. However, the government intends to fund the relief through a higher multiplier for properties with a Rateable Value over \u00a3500k. This is likely to spell higher rates bills for other property types such as offices, factories or distribution hubs from 2026. In the short term, the freeze in the small rates multiplier in 2025 is good news for many small businesses. Companies in the RHL sectors will be pleased with the extension of the current relief although this will be slightly tainted by the cutting of the relief from its current level of 75% to 40%. This would mean a single-property business with a gross rate charge of \u00a3100k would see their annual rates bill rise from \u00a325k to \u00a360k next April. In addition, with the relief capped at \u00a3110k per business, this means that the wider retail sector will not see a significant reduction in their rates bills until at least 2026, when the new multipliers are introduced. Andy Jones, partner at EY UK, has also looked at the retail measures. For retailers, the bottom line is that today\u2019s budget will likely result in increased cost pressures amid what is already a challenging backdrop. A particularly significant headline, as expected, is the proposed increase in the national minimum wage and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) for employers. Whilst good news for workers, this will impact retailers during a time of already-intense cost pressures. Moreover, whilst the announcement to ease the removal of the business rate discount will be welcome news for some businesses, it will still be an increase on the amounts paid today. That said, many may be hopeful that it is a first indication of the new government\u2019s approach to taxation and an indication that further reliefs that may come in the future. Therefore, overall, whilst the freeze on fuel duty and the reduction in alcohol duty rates for draught products will be welcomed, the budget will likely lead to increased inflationary pressures for retailers and likely price rises for consumers. Chris Sanger, EY\u2019s tax policy leader, added: Business rates is an area that governments have struggled with for at least the last decade. This is a tax that is paid regardless of whether a business is in the red or the black - whether there are profits to fund this tax or not. We have seen the tax rate increase from the low 40s to the high 50s, marking a big increase in the costs for those firms using real estate. Here is some reaction to the changes to business rates for shops, pubs, bars and restaurants. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said next year \u201cwill be painful for hospitality,\u201d with an increased annual tax bill of \u00a33bn. This budget is the latest blow for hospitality businesses. Rising taxes, increasing costs and fragile consumer confidence risk bringing growth to a grinding halt. In the short-term, the tsunami of employment costs coming in April will ultimately do more to hamper growth than incentivise it. Increases to employer NICs and wages will make it harder for businesses to support employment and invest in their businesses. Avoiding the business rates cliff-edge next April was critical and it was important that some relief has been extended. However, the reduced level of 40% is another cost that businesses have to deal with. For those small- and medium-sized operators, their rates bills will still go up in April. But, she added: However, there are reasons for longer-term positivity. I am pleased that the chancellor is implementing UKHospitality\u2019s recommendation for a permanently lower level of business rates for hospitality. Levelling the playing field in this way recognises the importance of the high street and the role it plays in our communities and economy. Simon Green, head of business rates at property consultancy Gerald Eve, was more blunt. The decision to slash the retail, hospitality and leisure relief scheme from 75% to 40% is absolute madness. It will see rates bills more than double overnight for 250,000 small businesses, leading to business failures and job losses. Meanwhile\u2026 AstraZeneca\u2019s China president Leon Wang is standing back because he is under investigation by Chinese authorities, the UK\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical firm has announced. Wang, who is also the company\u2019s executive vice president for international markets, \u201cis cooperating with an ongoing investigation by Chinese authorities\u201d. It is not clear whether he has been detained. The company said: Our China operations continue under the leadership of the current general manager of AstraZeneca China. If requested, AstraZeneca will fully cooperate with the investigation. Michael Lai is general manager at AstraZeneca China. Last month, it emerged that five current and former AstraZeneca employees had been detained by Chinese police as part of an investigation into possible breaches related to data privacy and importing unlicensed medications. Update: Eight to nine current or former staff were detained. The detentions took place earlier this summer, and targeted Chinese citizens who marketed cancer drugs for the oncology division of the British drugmaker, in news first reported by Bloomberg. Police are investigating whether AstraZeneca employees were involved in importing a drug meant to treat liver cancer, but which had not been approved for distribution across mainland China. The investigation, which is being led by police in the Shenzhen region, is also examining the way the company collected patient data, and whether that may have broken China\u2019s privacy laws. China has become a big market for AstraZeneca, and it has invested heavily in the country, announcing plans last year to build a $450m factory and signing a number of licensing deals with Chinese companies, including one for an obesity and type 2 diabetes pill. It acquired the Shanghai-based Gracell Biotechnologies, which develops cell therapies for cancer and autoimmune disease, for $1.2bn earlier this year. To build 1.5m more homes in the coming five years, as the Labour government has pledged, Reeves has revealed \u00a35bn of government funding, including \u00a33.1bn for affordable housing (an increase of \u00a3500m). There is also \u00a33bn support for small housebuilders and the build-to-rent sector in the form of housing guarantee schemes. The chancellor also said that local authorities would hire \u201chundreds of new planning officers\u201d to speed up housebuilding. The government is reducing \u2018right to buy\u2019 discounts for council tenants to buy the homes they are living in, and local authorities get to keep full receipts from the sale of council homes. Following the deadly Grenfell fire in 2017, the government will spend \u00a31bn to remove dangerous cladding from tall buildings next year, Reeves said. Helen Barnard, director of policy, research &amp; impact at the charity Trussell Trust, posted on X: Rachel Reeves has announced permanently lower tax rates for retail, hospitality &amp; leisure properties from 2026-27, to help the high street. While relief on business rates for the industry is being extended, it will be reduced from 75% to 40% in 2025-26, up to a cap of \u00a3110,000 per business. The small business tax multiplier will be frozen next year. Those two measures amount to \u00a31.9bn of support to small businesses and the high street, according to the Treasury. Over in parliament, Rachel Reeves is presenting the budget, and revealed it includes \u00a340bn of tax rises \u2013 to address the \u2018black hole\u2019 in the public finances, and other unfunded commitments. You can track it all here: On the US GDP report, Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show that the economy has grown less than expected. In recent quarters we have seen the economy sustain healthy growth considering the point in the cycle and the time since the last recession, so it\u2019s not entirely surprising to see a slowdown today. It\u2019s important to remember that one report does not a trend make \u2013 this may be a change in the wind, but it also may just be a wobble. Overall, the economy is in a good place so we wouldn\u2019t expect today\u2019s numbers to factor too heavily in the Fed\u2019s next policy decision. Recession will likely not be at the top of central bankers\u2019 risk lists at this point \u2013 they\u2019ll be keeping a much closer eye on inflation and jobs numbers as they seek to maintain this period of calm.\u201d Newsflash: The US economy grew a little slower than expected in the last quarter. US GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.8% in July-September, new data show, the equivalent of 0.7% growth in the quarter. That\u2019s slightly below forecasts of a 3% annualised rise in GDP, and also a little slower than the 3% growth recorded in Q2. Boom! US companies created many more jobs than expected this month. US private sector payrolls rose by 233,000 jobs in October, data provider ADP reports, smashing forecasts of a 113,000 increase. That may show that the US labo(u)r market is stronger than thought, dampening the pace of interest rate cuts in the months ahead. Hopes of any good news \u201crabbits\u201d in the budget may be dashed, flags George Eaton of the New Statesman. Volkswagen has reported a 60% drop in profits amid a slump in sales in China, with the carmaker emphasising the difficulties it faces as it prepares to close factories in Germany for the first time. Germany\u2019s biggest carmaker has told workers it is considering shutting three plants serving its main Volkswagen brand in its home market and cutting staff pay, raising the prospect of an extended battle with unions representing 120,000 German employees. VW remains profitable but earnings before tax dropped almost 60% to \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) in the quarter from July to September, down from \u20ac5.8bn a year earlier. Carmakers around the world are struggling with limp demand for new vehicles as higher interest rates take their toll, while several \u2013 including VW\u2019s German rivals BMW and Mercedes-Benz \u2013 have reported that demand in China in particular has dropped. The British sportscar brand Aston Martin also confirmed on Wednesday that the \u201cweak macroeconomic environment in China\u201d was dragging it back. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging all the UK budget action today, which you can see here: (I\u2019ll pop over to assist a little later, when Rachel Reeves begins her speech) The Institute for Fiscal Studies have published a handy thread on today\u2019s budget, highlighting how government spending and borrowing have risen in recent years: The London stock market has dipped very slightly this morning, but we can\u2019t blame the selloff \u2013 such as it is! - on the budget. GSK are the top faller, down 3.2%, after it cut its forecast for vaccine sales this morning (see 10.37am). Mining compan Anglo American is close behind, down 3.1%. That follows reports that global mining company BHP has \u201cmoved on\u201d from its three unsuccessful attempts to take over Anglo. Lloyds Bank are another faller, down 1.4%. It\u2019s caught up in last week\u2019s landmark court ruling over car finance mis-selling, which may lead to lenders paying out billions of pounds in compensation to borrowers. This has left the FTSE 100 share index down 18 points (-0.2%) at 8200 points, having earlier hit its lowest level since mid-September. Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group says eurozone economic expansion was much stronger than expected at 0.4% in the third quarter. That has cut betting on a 50bp rate cut in December, and handing a modest boost to the euro, he says, adding: \u201cThe upbeat growth data will go a long way in alleviating the ECB\u2019s fears about faltering activity and undershooting inflation. There is a flicker here of the rising real wage, higher consumption path that policymakers had been flagging as the source of a rebound. My expectation is for policymakers to continue with back-to-back 25bp rate cuts, which will do the job just fine. There is no need to panic yet, and that takes a 50bp move off the table for now. That said, these are hardly figures to get excited about. Germany may have eked out a touch of growth, but that is from a weaker position in Q2 than previously thought and the structural headwinds to growth will evidently persist in the longer term. The quarterly growth data is backward looking and only captures one month of the poor PMI prints that have spooked the ECB into easing more aggressively. It points to a stronger outlook for consumption but does not preclude a fizzling out of the growth momentum in the fourth quarter which would reignite the discussion about a jumbo rate cut in December.\u201d The boss of British drugmaker GSK has called for the chancellor to encourage investment into the country through research and development tax credits. Speaking as the company published its third-quarter results, Emma Walmsley, GSK chief executive, said: \u201cWe remain very committed to this country as a company, with significant R&amp;D and manufacturing investment. \u201cIt is important for us that the fiscal environment remains competitive and you know, we\u2019re looking forward to seeing the details that are coming through. We want to see investment encouraged, whether that\u2019s through the patent box or research and development tax credits, and we\u2019ll see more on that today.\u201d R&amp;D tax credits are aimed to encourage investment in research and development by allowing companies to claim tax credits or reduce their tax bill by showing cash has been reinvested in research projects. The Patent Box is designed to encourage companies to keep intellectual property in the country by offering lower rates of corporation tax on profits made from inventions patented locally. The comments came as GSK\u2019s total sales for the three months up to 30 September hit \u00a38bn, a 2% increase from compared to the previous year. However, its vaccines sales forecast dropped for the year due to a sharp decline in sales of its new respiratory virus jab Arexvy. The jab which saw significant sales after its launch last year plunged 72% year-on-year to \u00a3188m, hit by fewer of the shots being given out in the US. UK government bonds are continuing to strengthen in morning trading, pushing down borrowing costs a little further. The yield (interest rate) on 10-year UK government debt is now down 7 basis points, at 4.23%, down from last night\u2019s five-month closing high of 4.3%. [bond yields fall when prices rise]. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says investors will be hoping this isn\u2019t simply the calm before the storm, adding: \u201cThe last thing the market wants is for Reeves to pull a Halloween-themed rabbit out of the hat that scares investors and causes another Liz Truss-era horror show. For all the wild speculation around what might be in the Budget, investors don\u2019t seem to be on tenterhooks going into the announcement.\u201d Research institute the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are hopeful that Rachel Reeves\u2019s new fiscal rules will create the space needed to drive investment, without undermining stability. Monica George Michail, associate economist at NIESR, says: The UK is at a critical juncture: after years of sluggish growth and deteriorating public infrastructure, a sustained rise in government investment is vital to promote long-term growth and boost living standards. Growing demands for defence and green infrastructure further add urgency for decisive action to secure the UK\u2019s economic future. We look forward to the Chancellor\u2019s budget announcement today and hope the new fiscal rules will strike a balance between creating fiscal space and ensuring long-term financial stability.\u201d Newsflash: the eurozone has beaten growth forecasts. Eurozone GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of this year, twice as fast as the 0.2% growth expected. That follows Germany\u2019s welcome dodging of a recession, and France\u2019s Olympics-fuelled growth over the summer, which we\u2019ve seen this morning. Statistics body Eurostat says: Ireland (+2.0%) recorded the highest increase compared to the previous quarter, followed by Lithuania (+1.1%) and Spain (+0.8%). Declines were recorded in Hungary (-0.7%), Latvia (-0.4%) and Sweden (-0.1%). The year on year growth rates were positive for seven countries and negative for six. Sticking with Italy briefly, shares in drinks company Campari have dropped by 15% after its latest financial results disappointed the markets. Net sales at the spirits firm behind Aperol, Grand Marnier and Cinzano fell by 1.4% in the last quarter, missing forecasts of a rise. Campari blamed macroeconomic weakness, poor weather (it wasn\u2019t the best summer for a cheeky outdoor Aperol spritz), pressure on disposable income from inflation and falling confidence among consumers and retailers. Campari\u2019s pretax profits dropped by 20% in the quarter. Maybe they should consider bringing back those classic Cinzano adverts with Joan Collins &amp; Leonard Rossiter\u2026.. While Germany has beaten growth expectations, Italy has done worse than expected. Italian GDP was flat in July-September, new data this morning shows, worse than forecasts of 0.2% growth for Q3. The euro has jumped to its highest level in over a week, after Germany\u2019s economy avoided a recession in July-September. The single currency is up 0.25% at $1.0845, with investors calculating that hefty cuts to eurozone interest rates are now a little less likely. Reuters reports that the odds of a large, half-point, cut from the European Central Bank at its next meeting in December has dropped to 22%, from 45% early this morning. Newsflash: Germany has avoided falling into recession, in a welcome sign for Europe\u2019s largest economy. Germany\u2019s GDP expanded by 0.2% in July-September, new data shows, beating expectations of a contraction of 0.1%. That will be a relief for Berlin, at a time when Germany\u2019s economy is being buffered by high energy costs and problems in its car sector. BUT it\u2019s not all good news. Germany\u2019s second-quarter GDP report has been revised down, to show a contraction of 0.3% \u2013 worse than the 0.1% fall first reported. So the rise in activity in Q3 is against this new, lower, benchmark. UK bonds are recovering ahead of the Budget, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB: The UK\u2019s 10-year Gilt is outperforming its European counterparts with just a few hours to go before Rachel Reeves\u2019s first Budget, scheduled for 1230 GMT. Is this a sign that the bond market will welcome the fiscal shake up that is set to be announced later today? we could traders see \u2018sell the rumour and the buy the fact\u2019 in the UK Gilt market, once the uncertainty of the Budget is out of the way. Rachel Reeves may risk a sigh of relief if she checks the bond markets this morning, because UK government borrowing costs are dipping. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year government bonds has dropped to 4.26% this morning, a fall of over basis points from last night\u2019s close of 4.3%. Yesterday, the 10-year yield hit its highest level since the general election. The yield on UK government debt (known as gilts) has been rising in recent weeks, up from 3.75% in mid-September. That could be a sign of investors anticipating the UK will issue more government debt \u2013 with increased supply weighing on prices (which fall when yields rise). But there are other factors too \u2013 including concerns over the US election, which have pushed up US borrowing costs. Japanese bank MUFG told clients this morning: UK Gilt yields have been rising this month with the 10-year yield up just over 30bps from the September close. But it is debatable how much of that move reflects fears over increased Gilt supply on the potential for increased borrowing. The US Treasury 10-year yield is up over 50bps this month on expectations of a Trump election victory next week and that is helping lift yields everywhere. UK firms expect no growth over the next three months, according to a new survey that shows the challenge facing Rachel Reeves to stimulate the economy. The CBI\u2019s latest Growth Indicator has shows that private sector firms expect no change in activity over the next three months. Alpesh Paleja, CBI interim deputy chief economist, says Reeves needs to boost business confidence today: \u201cOur latest surveys paint a picture of an economy shifting down a gear as we head into the final quarter of 2024. Weaker growth expectations are weighing on firms\u2019 hiring intentions, which have treaded water since the beginning of the summer. \u201cIn the budget, the Chancellor has an opportunity to boost confidence despite the difficult fiscal picture. Business will want to see messages of hard choices balanced with interventions that deliver a vision of optimism. \u2018Many businesses are very concerned about potential increases to Employers\u2019 NICs and the impact it will have on pay, hiring and investment. If the government does follow through, then they will want to see the government act on other key areas of investment, such as reforming the Apprenticeship Levy \u201cGiving firms certainty over future tax plans in the form of a business tax roadmap, measures to enhance productivity, and the country\u2019s net zero trajectory can all help cement the path to long-term growth.\u201d Shares in weapons producer BAE Systems have dropped by 1% in early trading, after a fire broke out at its shipyard in Cumbria, where British nuclear submarines are built. Two people were taken to hospital with suspected smoke inhalation after the fire at the shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness began at around 12.45am today. The police said there is \u201cno nuclear risk\u201d but residents should stay inside with doors and windows closed. BAE Systems said: \u201cWe are working with emergency services to deal with a fire at site in Barrow in Furness. Two colleagues have been taken to hospital having suffered suspected smoke inhalation.\u201d BBC Radio Cumbria\u2019s Jennie Dennett has reported that there is \u201cno sign of fire now\u201d but a \u201cmetallic smell of smoke in the air\u201d. BAE\u2019s shares have dropped by 1.25% to \u00a312.64, making it one of the top fallers on the FTSE 100 share index this morning. The cold snap this autumn has helped drive sales at retailer Next, putting it on track to make more than \u00a31bn profits this year. Next has raised its guidance for profits this year to \u00a31.005bn, up from \u00a3995m previously, after selling more stock than expected in the last three months. Next\u2019s full price sales in August-October were up 7.6% compared with last year, beating forecast of 5.0% growth. It told shareholders this morning: We believe the strong performance was driven by the early arrival of colder weather this year, versus an unusually warm September and early October last year. If Next were to hit \u00a31bn of profits for the first time, it would join only a handful of UK retailers that have done so, including Tesco \u2013 and Marks &amp; Spencer in a previous era. Next\u2019s shares have jumped by 1.3% in early trading. Hosting the Olympics this summer has helped the French economy to accelerate. France's GDP grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of this year, new data from statistics body INSEE this morning shows, up from 0.2% in April-June. The data suggests the summer sporting festivities boosted consumer spending \u2013 it rose by 0.5% in the third quarter after a flat performance in the second quarter. INSEE says GDP \u201caccelerated moderately in the third quarter\u2026.boosted by the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games\u201d, adding: Final domestic demand (excluding inventories) regained some momentum, driven by a rebound in household consumption (+0.5% after +0.0%). Conversely, gross fixed capital formation continued to decline (-0.8% after -0.1%). Overall, domestic demand (excluding inventories) made a positive contribution to GDP growth this quarter: +0.2 points after +0.1 points in Q2 2024. Official data this morning could show that German output contracted again in the third quarter as its industrial slump drags on, tipping Europe\u2019s largest economy into recession. The AFP newswire reports: Federal statistics agency Destatis will unveil its quarterly GDP estimate at 09:00 GMT. The economy ministry has said it expects \u201ca renewed slight decline\u201d after gross domestic product already shrank by 0.1 percent in the second quarter. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. \u201cThe German economy is unlikely to have emerged from its weak phase in the third quarter,\u201d the ministry said in its autumn forecasts this month. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were narrowly more upbeat, predicting a quarter-on-quarter stagnation. Currency traders have been racing to protect themselves against possible big swings in the value of the pound, as the UK budget is released today. One-week implied options volatility - which measure the demand for protection against large moves in the pound over the coming week - have risen to 10.375%, Reuters reports, which is the highest since March 2023. The overnight rise from around 6.325% was the largest one-day increase in one-week implied volatility since September 2022, the month of Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget (which triggered the sort of market chaos that Rachel Reeves is desperate to avoid). Pepperstone strategist Chris Weston says today\u2019s budget is being taken more seriously by traders than usual: It\u2019s budget day in the UK, and while these events rarely pose the sort of risks to price action that warrants real focus on positioning, this one is different. It is seen by some as a generational budget, that will define Chancellor Reeves\u2019s career and could significantly impact Keir Starmer\u2019s public approval rating, which has been shot to pieces of late. Currently the pound is trading flat against the US dollar, at just over $1.30. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. It\u2019s a significant day in the UK and in Europe, with Rachel Reeves delivering Labour\u2019s first budget in almost 15 years, and growth data from across the eurozone likely to show Germany is in recession. Reeves could present one of the largest tax-raising budgets in decades today, as she tries to raise funds to repair UK public services. The chancellor is expected to announce a swathe of \u201cdifficult but necessary decisions\u201d to restore economic stability. She\u2019ll promise to \u201cinvest, invest, invest\u201d to drive economic growth and provide funding for the NHS, to build homes and rebuild schools. After a lot of gloominess since the July election, Reeves could strike a more optimistic note today, saying: \u201cMy belief in Britain burns brighter than ever. And the prize on offer today is immense. \u201cMore pounds in people\u2019s pockets. An NHS that is there when you need it. An economy that is growing, creating wealth and opportunity for all. Because that is the only way to improve living standards.\u201d Reeves is also expected to stick to Labour\u2019s pledge not to introduce higher taxes on working people. Instead, companies will carry a lot of the burden, with a rise in employers\u2019 national insurance contributions expected. Capital gains tax rates, or inheritance tax, may also be in the chancellor\u2019s sight. Income tax thresholds may be frozen for even longer than already planned, which will drag more people into higher tax rates as their salaries rise. Another measure \u2013 an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage, was announced last night. Reeves will also set out the details of her changes to the UK\u2019s debt rules. She\u2019s expected to target public sector net financial liabilities (a measure known as PSNFL, or \u201cpersnuffle\u201d) which takes into account all the government\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, increasing her latitude to borrow for investment in long-term infrastructure. The Office for Budget Responsibility will give its verdict after the speech. The OBR is also expected to release its report into the spending forecast drawn up by the previous, Conservative, government for the spring budget in March, despite former chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s efforts to delay it. The report may show whether or not Labour was left with a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d of unfunded commitments. Hunt says it\u2019s unfair to publish it on the day of the budget. The success of Reeves\u2019s first budget will be judged, eventually, by whether it does stimulate faster growth in the UK, leading to higher tax receipts to fund better public services. We\u2019ll get a taste of how other European countries fared last summer, with the first estimate of eurozone GDP for the third quarter of the year. Economists predict that Germany may have shrunk slightly in July-September, which would put Europe\u2019s largest economy into recession.

            "date": "2024-10-31T12:58:36Z",
            "content": "A closely watched measure of US inflation has slipped to its lowest level since 2021, within striking distance of policymakers\u2019 target, after the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down price growth from its highest level in a generation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.1% last month, down from 2.2% in August and in line with economists\u2019 expectations. The progress was underlined by official data released five days before the US presidential election. The state of the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 and the cost of living in it \u2013 has played a central role in the contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to succeed Joe Biden. Inflation surged three years ago, peaking at its highest level in four decades as the impact of Covid-19 continued to roil the global economy. Officials at the Fed, having initially insisted that an acceleration in price growth would be \u201ctransitory\u201d, later engineered an extraordinary U-turn and embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle it. The Fed would go on to lift interest rates to a two-decade high \u2013 and only started to cut them last month. The central bank\u2019s effort was designed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d PCE index \u2013 which strips out volatile food and energy costs \u2013 rose 2.7% in September, in line with recent months, but slightly above economists\u2019 expectations of 2.6%. While inflation has fallen dramatically, years of price increases continue to take their toll on many Americans. The economy has remained remarkably resilient \u2013 and continued to grow at a robust pace in the third quarter, according to data released on Wednesday \u2013 but almost half of voters wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Such polling frustrated Biden. When the president withdrew from the election this summer, making way for Harris, his vice-president was more willing to acknowledge that the cost of living remained \u201cjust too high\u201d for many. As Trump has argued that America is in economic decline, the White House has sought to underline positive economic figures in recent months. Hiring unexpectedly accelerated in September, and data for October will be released on Friday."

            "content": "The pace of US economic growth slowed over the summer but continued its two-year expansion, according to data released on Wednesday, days before millions of voters decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump is best placed to lead it forward. US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose by 2.8% in the third quarter, short of economists\u2019 expectations of 3.1%, and down from the previous quarter\u2019s 3% reading. The increase was driven primarily by consumer spending, exports and federal government spending. US policymakers scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation two years ago. The Federal Reserve rapidly increased interest rates to tamp down prices in a move that economists feared risked tipping the world\u2019s largest economy into recession. Such effects failed to materialize. \u201cDespite earlier fears that the US economy was headed for recession, growth continued to outperform,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. \u201cOverall, the US economy appears to be doing just fine.\u201d US economic growth has been surprisingly resilient under Joe Biden, with only one quarter \u2013 the first of 2022 \u2013 in decline, as the shockwaves of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to rattle the global economy. Inflation has fallen from a generational high of 9.1% in June 2020 to an annual rate of 2.4% in September, its lowest rate in over three years. But many Americans still aren\u2019t feeling it. Almost half wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Years of rising prices continue to take their toll. In a speech in Washington on Tuesday, Harris once again tried to allay voters\u2019 fears. The Democratic candidate for president promised to assist first-time homebuyers, ban price-gouging at supermarkets and cap the price of insulin. \u201cI will deliver tax cuts to working people and the middle class \u2026 I will lead in honoring the dignity of work,\u201d she said. Trump has sought to portray the Biden administration as a \u201cdestroyer\u201d of jobs, despite US employers adding millions of jobs in recent years. Harris, Biden\u2019s vice-president, has acknowledged that the cost of living remains \u201cjust too high\u201d for many, and has pledged to take action to help. The latest GDP report was released ahead of closely watched jobs data for October, out on Friday, the last employment report before the election. Economists expect the economy to have added about 125,000 new positions over the month. That figure would be a sharp drop from the 250,000 jobs added in September, when hiring unexpectedly accelerated, and will probably reflect the strike at Boeing and the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. But there are signs that the US\u2019s resilient jobs market may also shake off last month\u2019s disruptions. On Wednesday ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, said private companies hired 233,000 new workers in October, the best month for job creation since July 2023, up from 159,000 in September and far ahead of the estimated 113,000. \u201cEven amid hurricane recovery, job growth was strong in October,\u201d ADP\u2019s chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. \u201cAs we round out the year, hiring in the US is proving to be robust and broadly resilient.\u201d"

            "content": "Lloyds Banking Group has scrapped commission payments across its \u00a315bn motor finance arm after a landmark ruling on car loan misselling, as industry and Treasury officials hold urgent talks amid fears of contagion across the wider financial sector. The moves follow last week\u2019s court of appeal judgment, which agreed that consumers could not have consented to loans that involved \u201csecret\u201d commission payments to brokers and car dealers. The shock decision has already forced the likes of Close Brothers \u2013 which was a defendant in the case \u2013 to pause all new lending as it prepares to challenge the ruling in the supreme court. Lloyds, which is the biggest motor finance provider among the UK\u2019s high street banks, has continued to issue new loans. However, the bank has had to \u201cadapt quickly\u201dto do so, its chief financial officer, William Chalmers, told analysts. That has involved immediately cancelling commission payouts to brokers from its Black Horse car finance division, which oversees \u00a315bn worth of loans. It has already put aside \u00a3450m for potential compensation, but analysts at RBC Capital believe the court decision could end up costing the lender between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a33.9bn in the worst case scenario. Lloyds shares have fallen nearly 13% since Friday. Chalmers\u2019s comments, summarised in an RBC note, came as senior officials from the Treasury and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) held a second urgent meeting with the Finance and Leasing Association (FLA) after an initial call last Friday. The FLA \u2013 which represents car lenders ranging from big banks such as Barclays to the finance arms of carmakers including Ford and Volkswagen \u2013 is concerned that the ruling could severely disrupt lending, particularly if firms end up on the hook for much larger compensation payments than had been anticipated from the FCA examination of the issue that began in January. That investigation, which only covers a practice banned in 2021 known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCA), was already expected to collectively cost the motor finance industry between \u00a38bn and \u00a313bn. That estimate includes \u00a31.1bn for Santander UK and \u00a3375m for Barclays, which ditched its motor finance business in 2019. Analysts estimate that the much-smaller Close Brothers, which has already been forced to cancel dividends and strengthen its balance sheet by \u00a3400m, could suffer a \u00a3252m blow. Its shares have plunged more than 37% since Friday. Lenders argue the court of appeal decision sets a higher bar for disclosing commission arrangements and securing customers\u2019 consent than they previously thought was necessary under FCA rules. Santander UK delayed the release of its quarterly results on Tuesday as it scrambled to review last week\u2019s ruling. The FLA is now calling on authorities to urgently extend an official pause on response times on complaints. The industry wants the pause to extend beyond DCA complaints, to ensure lenders are not penalised for taking longer to respond to new grievances over other types of commission related to motor finance. \u201cWe are considering this carefully and working at pace through the potential benefits and risks of doing so,\u201d the FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said in a speech on Tuesday. He added that the regulator was \u201cworking closely with the financial services sector, the Financial Ombudsman Service and the government to understand any wider consequences and further steps needed\u201d. More meetings are expected in the coming days. The FLA said \u201can expedited path to the supreme court would be a first step to restoring certainty\u201d. But there are growing concerns that the court of appeal judgment \u2013 which also ruled against specialist lender FirstRand \u2013 could expose lenders to complaints over commission payments across other financial products. Those fears prompted the banking industry body UK Finance to hold a call with a large number of its members on Tuesday to discuss the court ruling and its implications. The consumer champion Martin Lewis has said the ruling \u201chas the potential to shake up more than just car finance\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand this wasn\u2019t a ruling on the FCA rules, but on common law,\u201d he said in a post on his Money Saving Expert website. \u201cSo, unless overturned by the supreme court, it means ALL relevant commissions needed declaring this way, not just DCAs \u2013 a seismic change.\u201d The Treasury was contacted for comment."

            "content": "If it\u2019s possible to have a parasocial relationship with a fictional character, I have it with Buffy Summers. She\u2019s tattooed on my thigh. I\u2019ve dressed as her for comic conventions. I\u2019ve attended Buffy trivia. And I\u2019ve watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer more times than Giles, her watcher \u2013 kind of like a guardian-slash-taskmaster, for the uninitiated \u2013 got knocked on the head. Even as a megafan I recognise that many aspects of the show have aged badly. Still, Buffy helped me get through adolescence into adulthood by showing me that nearly everything is survivable: in Buffy\u2019s case, even one\u2019s own death. Before Sarah Michelle Gellar, Kristy Swanson held the titular role in the oft-forgotten Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie from 1992. There\u2019s no denying that the film lacks the depth, complexity and esteem of the series; it notoriously saw writer Joss Whedon leave the production because he was so dissatisfied with the direction. Its tagline \u2013 \u201cPert. Wholesome. Way lethal\u201d \u2013 sums up its lighthearted tone: Swanson\u2019s Buffy only cares about cheerleading, dating the captain of the basketball team, Jeffrey, and hanging out with her clique of vacuous valley girls. That is, until her watcher Merrick (Donald Sutherland) shows up and throws a stake in the works by revealing her destiny as the Slayer; the one girl in all the world chosen to fight vampires. Buffy is initially reluctant but soon accepts her fate, leaving the frivolity of girlhood to save the world. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Like Sutherland\u2019s TV counterpart Giles, the stuffy and curmudgeonly Merrick soon grows protective over his charge as she prepares to face down an ancient and powerful vampire, Lothos (Rutger Hauer), and his minion Amilyn (Paul Reubens). The biggest difference between Buffy one and Buffy two is the lack of Scoobies, the code name for TV Buffy\u2019s core crew. Unlike the TV show\u2019s Willow and Xander, the film only allows Buffy a trio of bloodless, interchangeable girlfriends (including Hilary Swank in her feature debut). But let\u2019s not flick the flick so easily. Like the show, I accept the film is flawed, but it does offer us a delightful campiness brimming with exaggerated dialogue. A news reporter describes a victim\u2019s bite wound to \u201ca really gross hickey\u201d. Or when vampires attack the school, they have \u201cthis look in their eyes, totally cold, animal,\u201d one student says \u2013 \u201cI think they were young Republicans\u201d. I like to think of the Buffy movie not as a separate universe, but rather as TV Buffy\u2019s origin story. The film is set at Hemery High, which in the show was Buffy\u2019s original school before she burned down the gymnasium and moved to Sunnydale. Flashbacks in the series show us that Buffy was also facile and flighty before becoming the chosen one. In my imagination, film Buffy is like an entree to her more famous iteration. Without the movie, there would\u2019ve been no 1997 Buffy to save me and myriad others from the horrors of high school. And that\u2019s not for nothing. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is available to stream on Disney+ in Australia and the UK and Paramount+ in the US. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click here"

            "date": "2024-10-24T13:32:41Z",
            "content": "Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, is facing demands from a watchdog to place another prison into emergency measures because of \u201cvery high levels of violence\u201d, drug problems and compromised security. An inspection of HMP Winchester found that the level of serious assaults against staff was the highest of any reception prison in England and Wales, while nearly half of all prisoners \u2013 47% \u2013 said it was easy to get illicit drugs there. A letter sent to Mahmood by inspectors noted that the fabric of the category B jail was so poor that a prisoner was able to remove his cell door, while a third of its CCTV cameras did not work. The letter is the second formal request this month from HM Inspectorate of Prisons for a formal ministerial intervention into a prison, and the ninth since November 2022. The demand comes amid deepening concern that the Ministry of Justice could face spending cuts of up to 20% in next week\u2019s budget despite an overcrowding crisis. Ministers have been forced to release thousands of prisoners early since August because of a lack of capacity. In the pointed final paragraph of the letter to Mahmood, Martin Lomas, the deputy chief inspector, said correcting \u201csystemic failures\u201d seen at Winchester would require more money. \u201cThe poor outcomes we found at Winchester represent systemic failings under the oversight of HMPPS and the Ministry of Justice and will require sustained support and investment if the prison is to provide decent living conditions, improve safety and security, and operate effectively,\u201d he wrote. More than two out of every five prisoners \u2013 41% \u2013 held at Winchester tested positive for drug use in August, and 47% reported it was easy to get hold of illicit substances. The prison, which holds 690 men, was so \u201cdilapidated\u201d one inmate had \u201cbeen able to remove his own cell door\u201d, the watchdog\u2019s inspection carried out earlier this month found. In May, it emerged that another prisoner at the jail had used plastic cutlery to dig a through a cell wall on to a prison landing. Having received an urgent notification, Mahmood has 28 calendar days to publicly respond to the concerns. It in effect places the jail in special measures and means the justice secretary has to urgently produce an action plan for improvement before the watchdog carries out another inspection. Lomas wrote: \u201cWinchester was in a very poor state and had been for many years. At this most recent inspection we found that standards had deteriorated to the point that we had no choice but to issue an urgent notification for improvement.\u201d On Tuesday, Mahmood announced a sentencing review, chaired by the former justice secretary David Gauke, which will examine a number of options to cut the number of people sent to prison. Responding to the report, the prisons minister, James Timpson, said: \u201cThis report illustrates the scale of the crisis this government inherited in our prisons. \u201cPrisons like HMP Winchester must not be allowed to become breeding grounds for further crime. Staff are already working hard to drive the improvements needed and we will publish an action plan in the coming weeks to support them in their efforts.\u201d The full findings of the inspection which prompted the urgent notification will be published at a later date. Mark Day, the deputy director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \u201cInspectors are right to lay the blame on systemic failings within the Prison Service and Ministry of Justice. This week\u2019s sentencing review highlights a dawning realisation at the very top of government that a radical change to our approach to imprisonment is needed.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-01T18:08:41Z",
            "content": "Late Monday, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced it plans to launch the first-ever federal investigation into the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, in which hundreds of Black Tulsans were killed, thousands were displaced and forced into internment camps overseen by the national guard, and Greenwood, the thriving district once known as \u201cBlack Wall Street\u201d, was decimated, looted and burned by a racist mob. The review, launched by the civil rights division\u2019s Cold Case Unit, comes after a major setback for survivors and descendants of the massacre. In June, Oklahoma\u2019s supreme court dismissed a lawsuit brought by two survivors, Lessie Benningfield Randle, 109, and Viola Fletcher, 110. In July, the women once again called for Joe Biden and the justice department to intervene. Kristen Clarke, the assistant attorney general who announced the DoJ review, called the Tulsa race massacre \u201cone of the deadliest episodes of mass racial violence in this nation\u2019s history\u201d. \u201cWe honor the legacy of the Tulsa race massacre survivors, Emmett Till, the Act that bears his name, this country and the truth by conducting our own review and evaluation of the massacre,\u201d Clarke said, announcing that the review should be finalized by the end of the year. \u201cWe thus are examining available documents, witness accounts, scholarly and historical research and other information on the massacre. When we have finished our federal review, we will issue a report analyzing the massacre in light of both modern and then-existing civil rights law.\u201d In a statement back in June, Fletcher and Randle said: \u201cWe are deeply saddened that we may not live long enough to see the state of Oklahoma or the United States of America honestly confront and right the wrongs of one of the darkest days in American history. At 109 and 110 years old, we are elderly and we know that we are living on borrowed time \u2026 Oklahoma and the United States of America have failed its Black citizens. This failure is profound, systemic and marred by lip service and clever platitudes.\u201d Clarke said that there was \u201cno expectation\u201d there is anyone still living who may be prosecuted as a result of the inquiry. Regardless, for descendants and survivors who have not been compensated for the massacre and its ongoing consequences, the inquiry\u2019s announcement was still worth celebrating. \u201cIt is about time,\u201d Damario Solomon-Simmons, the lead attorney for the Tulsa race massacre survivors, said during a press conference. \u201cIt only took 103 years, but this is a joyous occasion, a momentous day, an amazing opportunity for us to make sure that what happened here in Tulsa is understood for what it was \u2013 the largest crime scene in the history of this country.\u201d"

            "content": "Julian Assange has said he chose freedom \u201cover unrealisable justice\u201d as he described his plea deal with US authorities and urged European lawmakers to act to protect freedom of expression in a climate with \u201cmore impunity, more secrecy [and] more retaliation for telling the truth\u201d. In his first public statement since the plea deal in June ended his nearly 14 years of prison, embassy confinement and house arrest in the UK, the WikiLeaks founder argued that legal protections for whistleblowers and journalists \u201conly existed on paper\u201d or \u201cwere not effective in any remotely reasonable time\u201d. \u201cI eventually chose freedom over unrealisable justice, after being detained for years and facing a 175-year sentence with no effective remedy,\u201d he told lawmakers in Strasbourg at the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe (Pace), the human rights body with members ranging from Iceland to Azerbaijan. \u201cI am not free today because the system worked. I am free today after years of incarceration because I pled guilty to journalism,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe rights of journalists and publishers within the European space are seriously threatened,\u201d he told Pace\u2019s committee on legal affairs and human rights, urging the assembly to act. \u201cThe criminalisation of news-gathering activities is a threat to investigative journalism everywhere. I was formally convicted by a foreign power for asking for, receiving and publishing truthful information about that power while I was in Europe.\u201d Assange rose to prominence in 2010 after publishing a series of leaks from the former soldier Chelsea Manning showing that the US army in Iraq killed a dozen unarmed civilians, including two Reuters employees. No one has ever faced justice for the killings. He further angered the US government when a few months later he published a trove of 250,000 US diplomatic cables, some of which were published in the Guardian, causing a diplomatic crisis. He walked free from a US district court on the Pacific island of Saipan in June after agreeing to a plea deal. He pleaded guilty to a single criminal charge of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents and received a 62-month sentence, in effect time served at Belmarsh prison in south London. Assange spent five years in Belmarsh, after seven hiding away in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London and more than a year under house arrest. Assange was arrested by British authorities on behalf of the US in 2019 after Ecuador withdrew his asylum. He had originally entered the Knightsbridge-based embassy in 2012. At the time it was reported that he feared he might be extradited on to the US if he was extradited to Sweden, where a warrant for his arrest had been issued on two separate allegations of sexual assault. Swedish authorities dropped an initial investigation into an alleged rape in 2017 after concluding that all avenues to conduct an inquiry had been exhausted. Assange, who denied all charges, remained in the embassy for a further two years, fearing extradition to the US by British authorities. Assange told the committee on Tuesday that the landscape changed dramatically in February 2017 when Donald Trump appointed \u201ctwo wolves in Maga hats\u201d \u2013 Mike Pompeo as the CIA director and William Barr as the US attorney general. While Barack Obama had commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the Trump White House pursued a much more aggressive approach to WikiLeaks. In 2020 it was reported that senior CIA officials had considered abducting and assassinating Assange when he was in his fifth year in Ecuadorian embassy. Assange said his wife, Stella Assange, and then baby son had been victims of US spying and attempted evidence-gathering, including what he said was an attempt to take DNA from his six-month-old child\u2019s nappy. Over nearly 90 minutes, Assange addressed the committee seated next to his wife. He answered questions slowly but firmly, but declined a final question, citing tiredness. He said it had been a \u201cprofound and surreal shift\u201d to go from a Belmarsh cell to Strasbourg. Speaking of his time at Belmarsh, he said: \u201cThe experience of isolation for years in a small cell is difficult to convey. It strips away one\u2019s sense of self, leaving only the raw essence of existence. I am yet not fully equipped to speak about what I have endured.\u201d On Wednesday, assembly members will debate a draft resolution that condemns the \u201cdisproportionately severe charges\u201d brought against Assange by the US government. Drafted by Th\u00f3rhildur Sunna \u04d4varsd\u00f3ttir, an Icelandic MP with the left-leaning Pirate party, the resolution states that \u201cmisuse\u201d of the US 1917 Espionage Act has had a \u201cdangerous chilling effect, dissuading publishers, journalists and whistleblowers from reporting on governmental misconduct\u201d. The text also criticises the UK, a founding member of the Council of Europe, for failing to protect Assange\u2019s freedom of expression and right to liberty. In a dissenting opinion, the British conservative peer Richard Keen said the text was \u201coverly polemic and imprecise on key legal points\u201d. He argued it was \u201cregrettable\u201d to describe Assange as a political prisoner in Belmarsh because, he wrote, the WikiLeaks founder had been detained lawfully having violated earlier bail conditions and was considered a flight risk. \u201cThese proceedings did indeed take unusually long, but Mr Assange and his legal team contributed to prolonging them himself. His detention was therefore in no way politically motivated,\u201d Keen wrote, arguing that the designation \u201cbelittled the fate of true political prisoners\u201d."

            "content": "Theresa May has said \u201cjustice is highly unlikely\u201d to come for the victims of the novichok attacks in Wiltshire, in an interview broadcast days before an inquiry opens into the Russian state poisonings. The former prime minister said she hoped that the family and friends of Dawn Sturgess, who was killed in 2018 after she was exposed to the nerve agent, would find comfort from the inquiry into her death and feel that it had \u201cgot to the truth\u201d of what happened. The former Russian spy Sergei Skripal was the target of the poisoning in March 2018. He, his daughter Yulia and a police officer, DS Nick Bailey, were poisoned but survived. Four months later, Sturgess, 44, and her partner, Charlie Rowley, were also poisoned after he found a discarded perfume bottle containing the chemical weapon and unwittingly gave it to her. Rowley recovered but Sturgess died on 8 July 2018. An independent inquiry into Sturgess\u2019s death opens in Salisbury on Monday. The Skripals will not attend the hearing over fears for their security. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s Crime Next Door: Salisbury Poisonings podcast, May, who was prime minister at the time, said of the inquiry: \u201cI would hope by the end of it the family and friends of Dawn Sturgess feel it has got to the truth.\u201d The three Russian men thought to have been behind the attacks are the subject of an international arrest warrant. But since the Russian constitution does not allow its citizens to be extradited, it is highly unlikely they will ever stand trial. May said: \u201cClosure to all the people affected would only finally come with justice, and that justice is highly unlikely to happen.\u201d Sergey Fedotov is alleged to have been the on-the-ground commander of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who are understood to have been working for Russia\u2019s GRU military spy agency. Petrov and Boshirov are suspected of having smeared novichok on the handle of the former GRU officer Skripal\u2019s front door. May said the men acted with \u201cutter recklessness\u201d. She said: \u201cYou felt they just didn\u2019t care about anything.\u201d A preliminary hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in June heard that the Sturgess family wanted the Skripals to give oral evidence to address \u201cunanswered questions\u201d. In a judgment published later, the Skripals were excused from appearing because of an \u201coverwhelming risk\u201d of another assassination attempt."

            "content": "An independent investigation into the first assassination attempt on Donald Trump has warned that further such episodes will occur unless the Secret Service undergoes \u201cfundamental reform\u201d. In a sometimes scathing 51-page report, a panel commissioned by the homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, lambasted the agency for a spate of failings, including a \u201clack of critical thinking\u201d, and said it had not engaged in sufficient \u201cself-reflection\u201d over the episode. It also criticised agents for failing to communicate effectively with local and state law enforcement officers at the site of a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July, when a lone gunman opened fire from a nearby roof. Trump was wounded after a bullet grazed his ear and one rally-goer, Corey Comperatore, was killed before the 20-year-old shooter was shot dead by a Secret Service agent. The report noted that Comperatore was the first person ever to be killed in a Secret Service perimeter zone by a person trying to assassinate someone under the agency\u2019s protection. Mayorkas commissioned a four-member team of eminent national and state law enforcement officials to investigate amid a storm of criticism over the incident, which prompted the resignation of the agency\u2019s director, Kimberly Cheatle, following a disastrous performance at a congressional hearing. The report was commissioned before a second apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his golf club in Palm Beach, Florida, on 15 September, which was foiled after a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a gun protruding from bushes as the former president played golf. The gunman, Ryan Routh, was subsequently arrested and has been charged with trying to kill Trump. In a chilling passage, the authors conclude that the first attempt was not a one-off. \u201cThe Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission,\u201d they write. \u201cWithout that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again.\u201d The report identifies \u201cspecific failures and breakdowns\u201d on the day, including a failure to encounter Crooks despite the fact that several law enforcement officers had become aware of him. It also found that Trump\u2019s Secret Service detail had not been told of the gunman\u2019s presence at the site, even though three agents knew about it. By the time they came close to apprehending him, more than an hour and a half after a local law enforcement officer had first noticed him entering the car park of a cordoned-off building, Trump was already speaking on stage. Beyond operational failures on the day lay \u201cdeeper concerns\u201d, the report said. It added: \u201cTaken together, these issues reveal deep flaws in the Secret Service, including some that appear to be systemic or cultural.\u201d The agency was guilty of a formulaic approach to assessing how much protection was needed rather than on the basis of specific threats faced by individuals. The report praised the quick actions of Secret Service agents in diving to protect Trump after shots had been fired. But it added: \u201cBravery and selflessness alone, no matter how honourable, are insufficient to discharge the Secret Service\u2019s no-fail protective mission.\u201d The report\u2019s authors included Janet Napolitano, a former homeland security secretary in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency."

            "date": "2024-10-18T17:30:52Z",
            "content": "Last month\u2019s report on sentencing from a group of former heads of the judiciary ended with a stark warning that the country faces a future of \u201cUS-style mass incarceration\u201d \u2013 overcrowded prisons, mounting costs and deepening social inequalities \u2013 \u201cwithout urgent remedial action to address sentence inflation\u201d. The gap between the two countries remains large. The UK has the highest per-capita prison population in western Europe. But the 0.1% of the population that is incarcerated in England, Wales and Scotland is still only a seventh of the 0.7% imprisoned in the US (Northern Ireland\u2019s rate is far lower). Still, with the prison population of England and Wales predicted to rise from 88,000 (in August) to 106,000 by 2028, the judges are right to sound the alarm. Ministers know they have a problem. So did their Conservative predecessors. Spending by the prison and probation service has ballooned to \u00a34.6bn \u2013 around three-quarters of which goes on prisons, including \u00a3100m spent on keeping more than 2,000 men over 70 locked up. Conditions in many jails are appalling. The latest urgent notification from the prisons inspector, Charlie Taylor, regarding Manchester, described drones delivering drugs through windows that have been broken to enable this. While Labour\u2019s early release scheme was a sensible opening move, it has not been enough to curb rising prisoner numbers. In fact, the decision to let magistrates hand down longer sentences of up to 12 months is expected to further inflate the prison population. More radical changes will depend on the independent sentencing review promised in the manifesto. The former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke is the favourite to lead this, and should command cross-party support. This matters because both parties bear responsibility for the sentence inflation of the past 30 years. The lack of alternatives to custody and low public confidence in existing ones have fuelled a widespread belief that voters \u2013 along with the rightwing press \u2013 prefer harsh sentencing. As a result, successive prime ministers have refused to commit to the penal reform programme that is urgently needed. Under Boris Johnson, sentences were increased, and rules changed so that some violent offenders must now serve two-thirds of their sentence behind bars, rather than half, before being considered for release. The destructive consequences of the partial privatisation of the probation service were recognised when this was reversed. But further reform has been ducked. Probation should be taken out of the Prison Service and locally embedded instead \u2013 with stronger links to councils, housing providers and charities. Investment in the workforce would be part of this process. Effective use of technology could also make community supervision work better. Given the problems with short sentences, including high reoffending rates, robust alternatives including tags, curfews and harm prevention orders should be prioritised. Victims\u2019 needs must also be considered. Campaigns against perceived leniency are one reason for sentence inflation. If the public is to be persuaded that alternatives to custody are meaningful, the service offered to victims must be improved. Unacceptable delays in the trial process contribute to a general sense of grievance at a broken system. While the last word on sentences belongs to judges, the public\u2019s views on crime and punishment must be taken seriously if confidence in the system is to be renewed. Good communication is crucial. As a former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Sir Keir Starmer has relevant expertise and should be bold in pushing through change.

Cruddace, whose intervention has support from racing\u2019s main stakeholder groups, believes it is also an opportunity to reaffirm the distinctions between betting, on racing and sport, and fixed-margin casino-style gaming which guarantees a profit to the operator. General Betting Duty, on racing and other sports betting, is set at 15% of gross profits, while Remote Gaming Duty, on online slot machines and casino products, is 21% of gross profits. Gambling firms also pay the statutory Levy of 10% of gross profits on British racing bets, which is returned to the sport in prize money and other funding via the Levy Board. Cruddace told the Guardian that any changes to the tax regime around gambling should not just reflect, but also amplify, the clear differences between betting and games of chance. \u201cSpeaking on behalf of all British Racing\u2019s stakeholders, I can say it is only right that the new government urgently examines how it taxes and regulates betting on horse racing as opposed to online slot machines and casino games,\u201d Cruddace said. \u201cThe predilection for gambling-related harm is wildly different between horse-race betting and online casino games, with British horse racing a world leading industry that makes a major economic contribution to the country.\u201d Cruddace suggests that the 5% difference between the rates charged for GBD and Levy could be redistributed, with either a straightforward rate-swap, reducing GBD to 10% and upping Levy to 15% or a move to 12.5% for both. The overall charge on firms\u2019 gross profits on racing would remain unchanged, but additional Levy revenue would support racing and its associated industries while the reduced rate of GBD would incentivise operators to shift their focus back towards betting. His intervention in the debate over gambling taxation also coincides with the publication at midnight on Monday of a report by the thinktank the Social Market Foundation, which argues that RGD should double, from 21% to 42%, raising an estimated additional \u00a3900m in tax revenue. The SMF report\u2019s focus is on the online gaming sector, RGD and the huge explosion in online slot machine turnover in particular. However, James Noyes, a senior fellow of the SMF and the report\u2019s lead author, acknowledges that \u201cthe [racing] industry generates \u00a3300m annually in taxation and attracts inward investment from overseas\u201d, and that \u201cin terms of jobs, an ecosystem of employment exists within and around racecourses, training yards and stud farms [including] jockeys, stable staff, vets, feed merchants, ground staff and racecourse staff, as well as associated jobs within the wider hospitality sector during events.\u201d Noyes also notes that \u201csingle pre-event horserace betting is qualitatively different in its relationship to harm from other, high-frequency remote gaming activities such as online slots\u201d. Reports over the weekend that gambling duties could rise sharply later this month, including a proposal by the Institute for Public Policy Research that GBD should rise to 30% with RGD going up to 50%, prompted a warning by Grainne Hurst, the chief executive of the industry body, the Betting and Gaming Council, in Monday\u2019s Racing Post that \u201cany further tax rises now will not only slam the brakes on growth for our sector, but will threaten jobs and completely derail horse racing\u201d. However, Noyes believes that such comments follow a familiar pattern, in which the body defends the gambling industry\u2019s gaming interests to the detriment of betting. \u201cFor too long, the BGC has conflated the regulation of online slots with the fortunes of horse racing,\u201d Noyes said. \u201cThis has been a deliberate and cynical ploy. By hiding behind horse racing, industry lobbyists have resisted calls to reform online casino gaming. \u201cBut people understand that there is a difference between games of skill and games of chance, and that rates of harm are far higher for online slots than they are for other gambling sectors. The minister [for gambling, Fiona Twycross] recently acknowledged this at the Labour party conference, when she said [during an SMF panel] that it is important to differentiate between types of gambling activity.\u201d Predictions from the gambling industry of imminent disaster for racing as a result of moves to regulate gaming products are certainly nothing new. Throughout the ultimately successful 15-year campaign to restrict \u00a3100-a-spin roulette machines in high street betting shops, it was often claimed that a cut to \u00a32-a-spin would result in wholesale closures across the retail sector, and leave a huge hole in racing\u2019s balance sheet. It did not happen. Cruddace\u2019s intervention in the debate shows the kind of support for betting \u2013 and antipathy to gaming \u2013 that would have been welcome from racing\u2019s senior executives when the machines were extracting immense, guaranteed profits from Britain\u2019s most deprived communities, and causing untold amounts of harm in the process. If it signals a new willingness by the sport to go into bat for betting, it is certainly welcome and not before time. A Betting and Gaming Council spokesperson, said: \u201cThe speculation on tax increases are the product of fantasy economics which are simply not credible. Recent regulatory changes have contributed to 2,485 bookmakers closing since 2019, with the loss of around 10,000 jobs. Any further tax rises now will not only slam the brakes on growth for our sector, but it will threaten jobs, and in turn, revenues for horse racing. Suggestions the BGC are opposed to reform are wrong, we welcomed many of the measures contained in the gambling white paper including new stake limits for online games.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-14T15:16:33Z",
            "content": "Nothing reveals Britain\u2019s aversion to change quite like its failure to reform the House of Lords. Since the turn of the 21st century, almost everyone in politics has agreed that this should take place. The Lords may be quaint and historic, but it is constitutionally indefensible. It is one of only two parliaments in the world, along with Lesotho, to have hereditary members: there are 92 sitting by inherited right, 26 as leaders of a religious sect and dozens who have paid large sums to be members, often just for the title. When Keir Starmer became Labour leader in 2020 he pledged to abolish the Lords in favour of a new elected second chamber in his first term. It was proof of his radical credentials. Within three years he had dropped the \u201cfirst term\u201d, and by this year all mention of \u201cabolishing\u201d the Lords had vanished from Labour\u2019s manifesto. This week a bill is reportedly to go through parliament that merely abolishes the 92 hereditaries. There is no mention of bishops and donors, let alone Downing Street\u2019s clothing suppliers and former secretaries. For its hordes of retired politicians, the place will remain a luxurious club that makes the Garrick look like a greasy spoon. The last serious attempt at reform in 2003 ended in fiasco, with seven options being overwhelmingly rejected by peers and MPs alike. Tony Blair was said to have heaved a sigh of relief. In his first eight years he had created a record 292 lords, 25 of whom had donated close to \u00a325m to Labour party coffers. When his successor, Gordon Brown, revived abolition in 2009 it was all but shouted down, as it was again in 2022. It is hypocrisy for British politicians to criticise foreign regimes for their corruption. The reality is that the House of Lords has become a festival of fancy dress, privilege and prestige, with a minor limb of parliament attached. There is no problem about what to do. Most democratic legislatures have second chambers that can be studied. There have been commissions, white papers and thinktanks galore. A genuine consensus exists that what the UK needs is an institutional answer to the gross over-centralisation of the British state. There should be a pressure valve to answer the rising separatism in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As Starmer himself proposed in 2020, a new senate would be a forum for the regions and nations. It should have no power beyond that of argument and debate. The Lords\u2019 marginal revising role could be replaced by a reformed Commons committee system. But if one voice is glaringly absent from Britain\u2019s political conversation, it is the voice from beyond the capital. How that voice should be selected is controversial, since even reform-minded politicians are desperate to keep membership under their control. This must not be. Any direct election of members would replicate and weaken the legitimacy of the Commons. Party list elections would merely extend the parties\u2019 power. Better by far would be to bring together national assembly leaders, council leaders, mayors and possibly vocational representatives \u2013 as, for instance, in Ireland and Germany. Such a body could meet regionally as well as centrally. Fusing its influence into the legislative and executive process would require innovation. But it is desperately overdue. So why has Starmer become the champion of continuity rather than change? Is he wondering if soon he will be joining his friends?

            "date": "2024-10-09T20:45:31Z",
            "content": "A police department in California has purchased a flashy new piece of equipment to impress local children: a $150,000 Tesla Cybertruck. In a Facebook video featuring lightning graphics, the Irvine police department said it believed the vehicle to be \u201cthe first police cybertruck in the nation\u201d. It\u2019s unlikely to be in any high-speed chases: police say it will mostly be used by officers for school programs, though it is able to respond to emergencies. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to say that we\u2019re the first police department in the country to have this in its fleet,\u201d the police chief, Michael Kent, told the Orange County Register. The department\u2019s 40-year-old Drug Abuse Resistance Education (Dare) program has used a range of flashy cars over the years, including PT Cruisers and small monster trucks, Kyle Oldoerp, a police spokesperson, said: \u201cThe goal has always been to have a unique vehicle that doesn\u2019t look like a police car, that is approachable by kids and students to encourage interaction between officers and our schools and our community.\u201d Since Elon Musk announced the Cybertruck in 2019 \u2013 at an event that saw Tesla\u2019s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, attempt to show off its durability and shatter a window in the process \u2013 the unusual-looking electric vehicle has been a lightning rod for controversy. As of last week, it has been subject to five recalls in roughly a year since its release. Among the concerns have been an accelerator pedal at risk of getting stuck and trouble with loose trim and windshield wipers. Oldoerp said the department was not concerned about the recalls, saying they were commonplace for its fleet and there was a Tesla repair facility nearby. The police department paid $150,000 for the vehicle. A Ford Interceptor, the typical model of its patrol cars, costs $116,000. The department says the patrol cars last for just three to four years, whereas it expects the Cybertruck to last a decade. It also expects to save $6,000 in gas on the EV over five years. The Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, which sends police to classrooms to urge children to stay off drugs, has a controversial history of its own. Instituted in 1983 as a collaboration between Los Angeles police and public schools, it soon spread across the US. In the late 90s and early 2000s, studies found that it had no significant effect and could even backfire. The program was overhauled in 2009 and remains in use in some parts of the country. Irvine is one of two cities in California that still have the program, which has expanded its focus from drugs to include bullying, healthy eating and other lifestyle issues, Oldoerp said."

            "title": "Meteorologists could be climate change heroes by relaying its urgency to the public | Katrina vanden Heuvel",
            "date": "2024-10-22T10:00:14Z",
            "content": "Some have called Hurricanes Helene and Milton an October surprise. Yet such disasters are now dispiritingly predictable. In their wake, pundits have asked whether and how the storms \u2013 which happened to hit some key swing states \u2013 could impact a presidential election shaping up to be decided by razor-thin margins. There\u2019s practical concerns, like whether some affected voters will physically be able to cast their ballots. And then there\u2019s a political question: Will the fact that the climate crisis, which is exacerbated these hurricanes, raise the importance of that issue? Or will that be counterbalanced by those who have become convinced the government engineered these disasters to suppress electoral power? Believe it or not, the answer could rest on the shoulders of your local weather reporter. Such an unlikely hero went viral earlier this month when John Morales, a venerable meteorologist in Miami, became visibly emotional on air during one of his reports on Milton. His voice choking, he offered an ominous assessment of the hurricane\u2019s strength: \u201cThis is just horrific.\u201d That sincerity and urgency garnered the clip nearly 2m views. The resonance of Morales\u2019s appearance proves that combining deep expertise, hard-earned credibility and a willingness to be vulnerable could provide a roadmap \u2013 or a forecast \u2013 for climate reporting to remain relevant and impactful despite the headwinds. Climate change presents the classic political conundrum of a (literally) glacial catastrophe demanding swift action. To avert the worst effects, the investments required \u2013 from clean energy to flood-proof infrastructure \u2013 would total in the trillions, but voters tend to be wary of making such outlays until the worst has already happened. Polling bears out this \u201cshort-termism.\u201d Americans have gone from climate skeptics to climate curious, with 54% saying they consider it a major threat. And yet when it comes time to rank their top issues heading into election day, the public demurs, placing climate change second to last on their list of priorities. Of course, the repeat champion remains the economy \u2013 never mind that with smart policies, combating the climate crisis could be a lifesaver and a job creator. Despite the popular narrative, global heating does have short-term consequences, namely extreme weather events like Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Over the past three decades, extreme weather has caused $48bn in crop damage, $339bn in property damage and killed nearly 14,000 people. And the intensity of that damage has been exacerbated by rising temperatures. Amid these catastrophes, reeling residents turn to local news broadcasts for live updates, with ratings sometimes spiking by 80% during hurricanes. In such moments, meteorologists are perfectly positioned to help viewers connect short-term extreme weather with long-term climate change \u2013 having forged a deep connection with a wide audience all year round. Republicans and Democrats alike rank the Weather Channel as their most trusted news source. And meteorologists remain among the most trusted sources regarding global heating in communities nationwide, even though trust in the media generally continues to plummet. To be sure, weathercasters haven\u2019t been completely unscathed by today\u2019s hyper-fragmented, ultra-polarized media landscape; they, along with Fema workers, have had to endure harassment and death threats directly tied to inflammatory disinformation. But such encounters, while serious, remain exceptional. Local meteorologists are still the most effective and credible mass communicators we have \u2013 better positioned than almost anyone to persuade on climate, if armed with the right message. Enter Climate Central, a nonprofit which creates weekly climate content for meteorologists and weather reporters tailored to their specific communities. The organization empowers local journalists to make climate change personal, equipping partners in 95% of American media markets with the science, big data and targeted graphics they need to help audiences understand what\u2019s happening in their own backyards \u2013 and, critically, what can be done about it. Covering Climate Now has taken this approach globally. Co-founded by the Nation, the Guardian and the Columbia Journalism Review, CCN provides local journalists worldwide with climate reporting resources, from training to targeted investigations of issues like extreme drought or big oil. The journalists they support have a collective audience of 2 billion people in 60 countries. But the basic strategy remains the same no matter the continent, as described in a recent column in the Nation by CCN co-founder Mark Hertsgaard: \u201cWeathercasters talk their viewers through scary times by calmly providing practical, life-saving information.\u201d If you want proof of its efficacy, look no further than John Morales, a longtime CCN colleague. These efforts bring the media closer to treating climate change like it does every other issue, providing macro context for micro events in the simplest terms possible. The Dow Jones industrial average offers readers a digestible daily snapshot of the American stock market. Its ticker tape runs endlessly on CNBC and in Times Square. Why not cover extreme weather with the same unswerving attention? At the very least, why not dedicate 30 seconds of every evening newscast to the latest movement on the US climate extremes index? If we want to curb climate change\u2019s effect on our planet, it might just start with weather reporters bringing the issue down to earth.

            "date": "2024-10-30T10:23:19Z",
            "content": "Like a lot of people, Richard Seymour, 47, was trying to quietly ignore the climate crisis and get on with his life. As a prolific Marxist intellectual, this meant industriously writing about a range of subjects: the Iraq war, neoliberalism, the class struggle. The climate crisis could wait until after the revolution. Besides, he didn\u2019t have the expertise or emotional capacity for it. But in 2015 that changed. Walking in a local park on Christmas Day, he couldn\u2019t ignore how noticeably warm it was. He started to think about not just what has already been lost but what global heating means for the losses to come. \u201cSome sort of defence just went down,\u201d he says, \u201cand I experienced a preliminary bit of climate mourning.\u201d Seymour grew up in a small town in Northern Ireland surrounded by farmland, rivers and woodland but for years he\u2019d been flexing what he calls a \u201chyper urban\u201d attitude \u2013 it was in New York and Paris where the labour movement historically flourished and so it was in those kinds of environments that he felt he and his politics most belonged. But on that winter\u2019s day, he remembered \u201cgrowing up in nature and having an emotional attachment to it\u201d \u2013 from the Mourne Mountains to the Giant\u2019s Causeway. \u201cIt struck me that although things will go on in a way, nothing like that will ever exist again, it\u2019s gone \u2026 And the things that I enjoy now, you know, they\u2019re going to go too.\u201d Seymour set about reading all he could, from oceanography to evolutionary theory. Now he is, arguably, one of the UK\u2019s foremost thinkers on the politics of climate breakdown and nature loss. In his regular Patreon and podcast appearances, Seymour \u2013 who is clearly something of a polymath \u2013 effortlessly joins the dots between environmental collapse, the rise of the far right and the role our desires play in a crumbling world, all while retaining his Marxist roots. As the Swedish scholar Andreas Malm asks on the front cover of Seymour\u2019s new book, Disaster Nationalism: The Downfall of Liberal Civilization, \u201cWhat thinker would you bring to an Earth on fire? You would not want to leave Richard Seymour at home.\u201d Our emotional responses to the world around us is one of the things that interests Seymour most. When we meet in the British Library to talk about his latest work, it\u2019s this theme we keep circling back to. Comparing the success of the far right in India, Brazil and the US (among other places), Seymour argues that most explanations for their rise are insufficient. What we\u2019re seeing is \u201ctoo consistent over time and too global, to be explained by local factors such as the backlash of a fading white supremacy, or Russian troll farms, or \u2018bad actors\u2019 spreading disinformation,\u201d he writes. These movements also don\u2019t have the hallmarks of historical fascism. \u201cTheir immediate objective is not the overthrow of electoral democracy,\u201d Seymour observes, but \u201ca constitutional rupture breaking with all humane and \u2018woke\u2019 constraints on the exercise of power.\u201d While the old establishment decomposes, the far right conjures up apocalyptic images \u2013 \u201cthe great replacement\u201d, \u201cIslamisation\u201d, \u201cChinese-style communism\u201d \u2013 to animate potential supporters. This is not yet a distinct form of fascism; instead, it is what Seymour calls \u201cdisaster nationalism\u201d. An examination of the far right globally, Disaster Nationalism isn\u2019t strictly about the climate crisis. But they are clearly connected. While disaster-laden fantasies capture imaginations, the environmental crisis lurks in the background. Seymour wants to interrogate this: why is fictional collapse so appealing, so exhilarating, when we live in a world of already existing, real disasters? If people are miserable, insecure and humiliated, the far right offers a specific remedy in disaster nationalism, Seymour argues. \u201cIt offers the balm, not just of vengeance, but of a sort of violent reset which restores the traditional consolations of family, race, religion and nationhood, including the chance to humiliate others.\u201d Applying a psychoanalytic lens, as the American writer Tad DeLay does too, Seymour avoids commonplace and often sympathy-tinged characterisations of the far right as a cry of the working class (the \u201cleft behind\u201d). The economy matters somewhat \u2013 he says a trajectory of decline fuels many middle-class people\u2019s radicalisation to the right \u2013 but the roots of these movements often aren\u2019t proletarian. \u201cAll of these formations start off with a fairly middle-class voter base,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly true of Bolsonaro, Duterte and Modi, and after a term in office, they have begun to build a real cross-class coalition, which is incredible.\u201d Anyone familiar with Seymour\u2019s writing will know that he takes racism, sexism and transphobia seriously. When we talk, he speaks about these forms of bigotry with the same sophistication he brings to his writing and manages to do so while forgoing one of the other mainstream explanations of the far right\u2019s rise, where voters are dismissed as gullible idiots who need to be shown the error of their ways \u2013 and of their information sources. \u201cIf I agree to fantasise about gruesome, erotically charged scenarios for whose reality I\u2019ve been given no good evidence, I am not simply lacking \u2018critical skills\u2019 or \u2018media literacy\u2019: the fantasy is doing something for me. It is staging something that I want, even if I don\u2019t want to want it. And if that fantasy is then adopted by numerous others, for no good reason, then the wish obviously isn\u2019t reducible to personal psychopathology but is rooted in a shared social condition,\u201d he writes in Disaster Nationalism. And that shared social condition is crucially affected and shaped by climate breakdown. The 2020 Oregon wildfires are illustrative, sweeping through the western US state after a series of chronic disasters: the credit crunch, skyrocketing rural poverty, alcoholism, suicide above the norm and a breakdown of local news, leaving Facebook and Nextdoor to fill the void. But when mostly white, rural, conservative Christians see the fires, it\u2019s not climate change or capitalism they blame. Spontaneously \u2013 not orchestrated by any one person or politician \u2013 it is the conspiracies they\u2019ve heard that make the most sense of something so large and so destructive: Antifa, doing the bidding of the Democrats whose aim is to usher in communism, are to blame, wanting to kill people like them to remake America. Ideas like these spread like a contagion and the threshold for their uptake isn\u2019t necessarily that high. As the fires rage, people refuse to leave, Seymour notes, so they can physically protect where they live from the arsonists they believe are behind all of this. Ecological disaster transforms into disaster created by human evil; the climate crisis turns into a crisis of interpersonal rivalry, aggression and victimhood. The destruction of the planet creates the structural conditions for these ideas but it wouldn\u2019t be possible if they weren\u2019t already circulating, Seymour argues. And he\u2019s clear on why they\u2019re so effective. \u201cYou can\u2019t shoot climate change, you can\u2019t take it to court, the same thing with capitalism. These are big, abstract forces, and you feel kind of hopeless against them,\u201d he says. It\u2019s far more attractive, exciting even, to \u201cattack a personalised enemy\u201d. All of us are susceptible to this, Seymour maintains \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s jackboots for all of us\u201d, he reminds me at the end of our interview \u2013 albeit not equally. I ask him about the left\u2019s attempts to try a similar tactic and personify capitalism \u2013 for example, Bernie Sanders\u2019 crusade against billionaires. He says they\u2019ve had some success but it\u2019s not so easy to play the far right at their own game. The ultra-rich live on another planet \u2013 you might see Jeff Bezos on TV, but you\u2019re never going to meet him. Whereas people feel they know immigrants or Muslims and, if you read the news, you\u2019ll be offered up these people as deviants every single day, Seymour points out. The left has also been derailed by the idea that self-interest exhaustively explains how people behave. \u201cI am not suggesting that bread-and-butter politics is superfluous. It will help,\u201d he writes \u201cwe do need bread and butter. We even like it. But we don\u2019t love it. And the things we do love often don\u2019t give us any material benefit whatever. You might love your children, for example, but it isn\u2019t because they increase your income and free time.\u201d Hope-scolds, as he calls them, miss the point when they caution that greens who doom-monger about the state of the world will demotivate people; recognising the end may be imminent can have the opposite impact, he argues. \u201cPeople can be affected by climate disasters and draw wildly varying conclusions from it. But when they find other people who have the same response and who want to do something about it, they bond over it,\u201d he explains. \u201cToo often, leftist talk about \u2018organisation\u2019 is abstract, making it sound like the issue is one of correct ideas and procedures,\u201d he says. Instead, it should mean creating a form of life where people need each other. We already see this in unions, where people might join for better wages but end up striking to defend their comrades, even if they lose pay. Seymour experiences this solidarity when he volunteers at his local church, which supports people who are homeless, many of whom are refugees. \u201cI\u2019m surrounded by people who do this all the time \u2026 they bring in stuff that they\u2019ve made, they bring in stuff they\u2019ve bought, they give up their free time for other people, no questions asked. The rule is \u2026 [you have to show] unconditional love for whoever walks in the door\u201d - no matter who they are or what they\u2019ve done. This might all sound a bit too \u201cuniversal peace and brotherhood\u201d, he acknowledges, while still retaining his sardonic edge. But \u201cif you imagine that you live in a planet where everything alive around you is purposive and has an intentional relationship to you and the rest of the world \u2026 I think that motivates better behaviour.\u201d For Seymour, then, comradeship isn\u2019t just between humans, but between species and the living world. This is surely the bedrock of not just socialism, but eco socialism. To better understand this and what we\u2019re losing, it makes more sense to talk about mass extinction than just climate change, he tells me. \u201cIt pertains to the destruction and decay and etiolation of life across the board and all the evidence suggests we\u2019re in what some call the end \u2013 Holocene mass extinction.\u201d And extinctions reveal all our unacknowledged dependencies; we need plants and other animals. We, human beings, do not sit at the top of a grand hierarchy. Continuing as we are, exploiting other animals and the rest of nature, is unsustainable. \u201cIf you want a less fancy way of putting it: love,\u201d says Seymour. This isn\u2019t necessarily where all Marxists might end up but he adds, \u201cif we\u2019re talking about socialism, what else are we talking about?\u201d \u2022 Disaster Nationalism by Richard Seymour (Verso Books, \u00a320).

She discusses it with family and friends because of the intensity of hurricanes like Milton and Helene, which have ravaged the southern US, she says. \u201cIt just seems like it\u2019s affecting more people every day.\u201d That\u2019s one reason why she is glad that UC San Diego has implemented an innovative graduation requirement for students starting this autumn: a course in climate change. Courses must cover at least 30% climate-related content and address two of four areas, including scientific foundations, human impacts, mitigation strategies and project-based learning. About 7,000 students from the class of 2028 will be affected this year. \u201cThe most important thing is that UC San Diego wants to make sure we\u2019re preparing students for the future that they really will encounter,\u201d says Sarah Gille, a physical oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who was part of the committee to create the new plan. The requirement won\u2019t add any time to a student\u2019s graduation schedule \u2013 it\u2019s designed to be integrated into existing classwork. Forty one-quarter courses meet the goal, including \u201cThe Astronomy of Climate Change\u201d, \u201cGender and Climate Justice\u201d, \u201cIndigenous Approaches to Climate Change\u201d and \u201cEnvironmentalism in Arts and Media\u201d. Many of the classes that fall under the climate requirement overlap with courses that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, the school says. Gille says students are positive about the requirement, which aims to prepare them for future climate-related policies and career opportunities. \u201cWe\u2019re acutely aware as a society of how the climate is changing and how scary that can be, and that probably means that we need to implement some changes in how we do things,\u201d says Gille. \u201cIf they\u2019re thinking about the future, they need to be prepared for what the future might bring.\u201d That could mean new opportunities in climate-adjacent fields such as carbon accounting or civil engineering with a climate focus. Gille says she can stand in front of a class and talk about what the world might look like in 50 or 100 years in terms of temperature increase or sea level rise \u2013 \u201ca pretty demoralizing lesson\u201d \u2013 but when she ties it to strategic decisions students can make about their own lives, and how to pursue opportunities in the future, \u201cit can become an empowering lesson too\u201d. The move mirrors a larger sentiment in society. According to a Marist poll this year, 85% of gen Z is very or somewhat concerned about the climate crisis. They are more likely to believe the climate crisis is caused \u201cmostly by human activity\u201d than any other generation. And states from California to Connecticut and New Jersey are now requiring that kids learn about the climate crisis in grade school classrooms. Arizona State University has also implemented a new sustainability requirement for graduation this year. Universities such as Columbia, Harvard and Stanford are taking the climate focus a step further and have created entire schools devoted to the issue. Marcello Ametrano, a communications major and marine science minor, says that even as a non-science student, he\u2019s interested in keeping up to date on the latest science. \u201cIt\u2019s really opening my eyes to a lot of what\u2019s going on right now, especially with Hurricane Milton, and why it\u2019s so devastating,\u201d he says. Understanding the oceans is key: \u201cThe ocean is kind of saving us from it being so much worse, because it absorbs so much carbon dioxide. So it\u2019s really important to understand the ocean because it directly relates to climate change and essentially what\u2019s going on right now in Florida.\u201d A wider rollout of climate change courses for graduation is possible across the vast, statewide University of California system, but the school is first focusing on its own plan. \u201cThe important thing for UC San Diego was to do what made sense for our campus and to see how this requirement is adopted,\u201d Gille says. \u201cIf we can do something that\u2019s bigger, we can potentially create a generation of college graduates who are better prepared for the future.\u201d"

The video below shows the moment a woman and a dog were rescued from a property in Valencia If you\u2019re just joining our coverage this afternoon, here\u2019s a brief look at developments in Spain today. Tap the link in each bullet point to take a look back at previous posts The number of people killed by yesterday\u2019s flash floods in eastern Spain now stands at 155, with the toll expected to rise as the search continues. One minister said bodies were likely to have been trapped in cars Rescue workers, residents and the military have been working at pace in a bid to find survivors and to clean-up after yesterday\u2019s floods. There are no confirmed numbers of those missing Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez urged people to stay at home during a visit to flood-hit Valencia and has said they will search for as long as it takes to find any survivors More rain is forecast, with parts of Valencia notably subject to an AEMET yellow weather warning for more rain on Thursday As well as the damage caused to roads, businesses and neighbourhoods, farms in Valencia have also borne the brunt of the flash floods. Fruit farmer Bernardo Ferrer says everything has been lost - his trees caked in thick silt that will make harvesting impossible. \u201cNow the fruit is going to rot. Even the trees can die because they have been under water for 36 hours ... With the heat, the humidity, the fungus will attack them too,\u201d he told the Reuters news agency by phone from his farm in the Alzira area. Valencia as a whole accounts for nearly two-thirds of citrus fruit production in Spain - the world\u2019s top exporter of oranges. Persimmon, a soft, orange-coloured fruit is another major regional crop, along with avocados, almonds and grapes for wine-making. The floods, which have killed at least 155 people and caused massive damage to infrastructure, have affected thousands of hectares of farmland, agricultural groups and farmers said. \u201cWe are facing a catastrophe ... the losses will be in the millions of euros,\u201d said Ricardo Bayo, secretary of the Union of Small Producers (UPA) in Valencia. Another farming group, the Valencia Farmers\u2019 Association, said orange, persimmon and mandarin crops were among those that would be lost. In the rice-growing area of Albufera, fields were totally sumerged, with only a few farm buildings and trees visible above the water, Reuters pictures showed. Ferrer said he was relieved he had insurance to cover his losses. \u201cThe insurance (payout) usually arrives quite quickly but with this scale we\u2019ll have to be patient,\u201d he said. But while citrus crops are generally insured in the region, the proportion of vineyards and nut crops with insurance is low, Bayo said. The floods also washed away machinery, irrigation systems and roads, said Manuel Alcaide, spokesman for farmers\u2019 association COAG, who said it was too early to calculate losses. Livestock was also killed as the floodwaters swept in. In Utiel, one of the worst-affected towns in Valencia, Javier Iranzo and Ana Carmen Fernandez said the flooding had completely wrecked their pig farm, with 50 of their animals having drowned Global heating made the heavy rainfall that lashed Spain this week about 12% heavier and twice as likely, an initial estimate from climate scientists has found. The early-stage analysis, carried out by scientists from the World Weather Attribution, said climate change was \u201cthe most likely explanation\u201d for the unusual strength of the downpour. The group pointed to historical weather observations that showed one-day bursts of rain in the region have increased as fossil fuel pollution has heated the planet. They also highlighted a physical relationship that shows hotter air can hold more moisture - about 7% for every 1C that temperatures rise. \u201cWe are loading the dice of extreme weather in the worst way possible,\u201d said Ben Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London. To properly quantify the influence of global heating, the group would have to use models to project the probability of such heavy rainfall hitting in a hypothetical climate without human activity. Their estimate comes as a separate analysis from Climate Central finds climate change made the hot sea surface temperatures that fuelled the downpour at least 50 to 300 times more likely. These new images in from Valencia this afternoon are just a snapshot of the impact on homes and streets caused by the flash flooding \u2013 with more rain forecast on Thursday. The pictures show scenes of ruin and destruction, with homes damaged and cars piled up and strewn across roads in the area The number now killed in yesterday\u2019s flash floods in Valencia stands at 155, according to regional authorities. This is an increase on the 140 confirmed earlier today and a jump on the 95 confirmed just yesterday. As we reported earlier, the Spanish government has pledged to continue the search for survivors \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d. The Spanish top flight football game between Valencia and Real Madrid scheduled for this weekend has been called off in light of these week\u2019s multiple tragedies. The match was due to take place at Valencia\u2019s Mestalla stadium on Saturday evening. In a statement released by Real Madrid this afternoon, it said: \u201cDue to the natural catastrophe that has occurred in the Comunidad Valenciana as a result of a hurricane, having decreed three days of official mourning with the suspension of sporting competitions in the cited autonomous region, a request for a postponement has been received from the LIGA F, after speaking with all the clubs involved. \u201cIn the light of the circumstances of force majeure arising from the events referred to above, it is necessary to postpone the matches scheduled to take place.\u201d Other La Liga and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n matches due to be played this weekend in the Valencia region have also been postponed - Villarreal-Rayo Vallecano, Castell\u00f3n-Racing de Ferrol, Eldense-Huesca and Levante-M\u00e1laga. Sam Jones Madrid correspondent In the small Valencian town of Utiel, where six people died in the floods, residents were trying to come to terms with what had happened as they carted bucketloads of sodden possessions from their homes and tried to sweep out the mud. Around them, personnel from the army\u2019s military emergencies unit supervised the clean-up and the pumps, aided by Guardia Civil officers, firefighters and civil protection units. In the worst affected part of the town, where the river Magro had burst its banks and sent floodwaters surging into people\u2019s houses, the mud was still calf-deep in places and the streets littered with wrecked cars and other detritus. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you want happened here,\u201d said one local resident, Carmen Aleixandre. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the words to describe it.\u201d Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabald\u00f3n, said the town was at the end of its tether and desperately needed help from the regional and national governments. \u201cSix people died and we\u2019re mourning them, but hundred of people could have died here,\u201d he said. In some parts of the town, the floodwaters reached a height of three metres, trapping some people in their homes and leading to the deaths of the victims, who were older people or those with mobility issues. The mayor said water and shelter were still major problems for many in the town, adding that some people were now homeless. \u201cThere\u2019s no power in some places and we\u2019re having to restrict water,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are hundreds of people who\u2019ve lost everything - their houses and their businesses.\u201d The death toll as a result of the flash floods in eastern Spain has risen from 95 to 140, according to state-run news agency EFE. Images from the US Landsat-8 satellite from 8 and 30 October vividly illustrate the scale of the disaster, showing the dramatic transformation of the landscape: We would like to hear from people in Spain about the impact of the flooding. Have you been affected by the recent flooding? How are you coping? We would like to hear about your experiences. You can tell us how you have been affected by the flooding using the form on this link: The satellite image comparison below shows just how badly impacted Valencia was by the torrential rain. The top picture \u2013 captured by the NASA/USGS Landsat 8 Earth observation satellite \u2013 above the white line shows Valencia on October 13. The lower image, below the white line, is the same city on October 30 after the rain caused flash floods. Our video team have produced this, showing shocking footage of a bridge being washed away in Valencia. Agence France-Presse have a dispatch from Paiporta, a suburb of Valencia city at the epicentre of the damage, where 27-year-old musician David Romero lamented a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. \u201cNeighbourhood after neighbourhood, street after street, there is not a business standing,\u201d he told AFP. Romero said the warnings in Paiporta only arrived when the local river was already overflowing and catching people off guard in the streets, a complaint echoed by 21-year-old Joaquin Rigon. \u201cNobody warned of anything... they took out the owner of the bar here dead, drowned, chaos,\u201d he said. If you\u2019re just joining our coverage today here\u2019s a brief round-up of the situation in Spain. Stay with us while we keep you updated The number of people killed by yesterday\u2019s flash floods in eastern Spain stands at 95, with the toll expected to rise as the search continues Rescue workers, residents and the military have been working at pace in a bid to find survivors and to clean-up after yesterday\u2019s floods. There are no confirmed numbers of those missing Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez has urged people to stay at home and has said they will search for as long as it takes to find any survivors More rain is forecast, with parts of Valencia notably, subject to an AEMET yellow weather warning for more rain on Thursday These pictures \u2013 just coming into us now \u2013 show the extent of the clean-up operation taking place in Valencia and north and eastern parts of Spain hit by yesterday\u2019s deadly floods. Streets are caked in mud, cars are stranded and homes have been severely damaged by yesterday\u2019s torrential rainfall. The flags at the European Commission have been flown at half mast today. EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen has offered Spain support in the wake of yesterday\u2019s flooding As we reported earlier, Pedro S\u00e1nchez has arrived in Valencia and has been speaking to the media. \u201cThe priority right now is to find those who are missing in order to alleviate the anguish that families are suffering,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe will support the search by land, sea and air for as long as it takes to find all of the missing people.\u201d \u201cPlease, the storm continues, please stay at home. Please heed all calls from the emergency services, their needs, their recommendations. \u201cThe most important thing is to save as many lives as possible. The AEMET is issuing alerts, I ask that these recommendations be heeded.\u201d More now on the impact of the floods on communities in regions in and around Valencia. \u201cUnfortunately, there are dead people inside some vehicles,\u201d said Spain\u2019s transport minister \u00d3scar Puente in reference to hundreds of cars and trucks stranded on roads stained brown with mud. The aftermath of the floods looked eerily similar to the damage left by a strong hurricane or tsunami. Cars piled on one another like broken toys, uprooted trees, downed power lines and household items all mired in a layer of mud covered the streets of Barrio de la Torre, just one of dozens of damaged localities in the hard-hit region, where 92 people died between late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Walls of rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that ripped into the ground floors of homes and swept away cars, people and anything else in its path. It knocked down bridges and made roads unrecognisable. \u201cThe neighbourhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it\u2019s literally smashed up,\u201d said Christian Viena, a bar owner in Barrio de la Torre. Ground crews and citizens continued to inspect vehicles and homes that were damaged by the onslaught of water. Why were yesterday\u2019s floods in Spain so bad? Ninety-five people are dead, an unknown number of people remain missing, while thousands of others are without electricity or phone service. The intense rain was attributed to a phenomenon known as the gota fr\u00eda, or \u201ccold drop\u201d, which occurs when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea. This creates atmospheric instability as the warm, moist air rising rapidly to form towering, dense clouds capable of dumping heavy rain. See below for a visual guide to yesterday\u2019s devastating events Let\u2019s return now to the rescue efforts currently ongoing in north and eastern Spain. More than one thousand soldiers from Spain\u2019s emergency rescue units joined regional and local emergency workers in the search for survivors. Spain\u2019s defence minister said that soldiers alone had recovered 22 bodies and rescued 110 people by Wednesday night. \u201cWe are searching house by house,\u201d \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez, official of a military emergency unit, told Spain\u2019s national radio broadcaster RNE on Thursday from the town of Utiel, where at least six people died. As we reported earlier, prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez is heading to the region to witness the destruction first-hand as the nation starts a three-day period of official mourning. Thousands of people were left without water and electricity and hundreds were stranded after their cars were wrecked or roads were blocked. In the rural town of Utiel, some 85 km from the city of Valencia, the Magro river burst its banks, sending up to three metres of water into homes, reports the Reuters news agency. Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabaldon said at least six people had died in the town of about 12,000, most of them elderly or disabled people who were unable to clamber to safety. Early on Thursday, residents used water pumps carried on tractors as they started the clean-up, with children helping to sweep the sidewalks. \u201cThe sorrow is for the people who have died,\u201d said Encarna, a 60-year-old teacher in the town, wiping away tears as she spoke in a flood-ravaged street near her damaged home. \u201cThese are my savings, my effort, my life. But we are alive.\u201d The floods have also wrecked crops and killed livestock. Utiel residents Javier Iranzo, 47, and Ana Carmen Fernandez, 48, told Reuters the flooding had completely wrecked their pig farm, with 50 of their animals having drowned. They estimated hundreds of thousands of euros worth of damages and, despite government pledges of help, said they worried about whether they would receive state aid to help rebuild. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez is due to make a visit to Valencia later today \u2013 we\u2019ll keep you updated when that happens. He has thanked EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen and UN general secretary Ant\u00f3nio Guterres for their support. Here\u2019s a reminder of what he had to say after the floods hit: Rescuers today face the painstaking process of searching stranded cars for any survivors of yesterday\u2019s flash floods, with these pictures of a motorway in Valencia showing the aftermath of the torrential rain. Spain\u2019s transport minister has said bodies of dead are still likely to be trapped in vehicles. Pictures coming in from Valencia show relatively calm conditions as the clean-up and search for survivors continues. But as we touched on in our post at 9.17GMT, a weather warning has been issued for part of the region already devastated by yesterday\u2019s tragedy. The AEMET state weather agency issued its highest level of alert for the province of Castellon. Further north in the Catalonia region, an amber alert was issued for the city of Tarragona. Meteorologists said a year\u2019s worth of rain had fallen in eight hours in parts of Valencia on Tuesday. The storm that caused the torrential downpours has since moved in a northeasterly direction. \u201cThere are already very strong storms in the area, especially in the north of Castellon,\u201d AEMET posted on its X account. \u201cThe adverse weather continues! Beware!\u201d it added, saying people should not travel to the area. Local authorities have not disclosed how many people are still unaccounted for after Europe\u2019s deadliest floods in years, but Defence Minister Margarita Robles said late on Wednesday the death toll was likely to rise. How have you been affected? If you have been impacted by the flooding The Guardian\u2019s community team would like to hear from you. We\u2019re also interested in hearing from those helping with rescue efforts. Get in touch below More heavy rain is predicted for the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region and other areas on the north-east coast today. National weather agency AEMET launched a red alert for Valencia region on Tuesday morning and conditions deteriorated throughout the day. But it was only in the early evening that the regional body in charge of coordinating the emergency services was set up. And an alert sent by the civil protection service urging residents in the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia not to leave home was issued after 8pm. For many, it was already too late. Motorists began journeys only to find themselves trapped on roads and left at the mercy of raging torrents of water. \u201cThey raised the alarm when the water was already here, there\u2019s no need to tell me the flood is coming,\u201d fumed Julian Ormeno, a 66-year-old pensioner in the Valencia city suburb of Sedavi. \u201cNobody came to take responsibility,\u201d he told AFP. With weather forecasters issuing warnings beforehand, such tragedies are \u201centirely avoidable\u201d if people can be kept away from surging flood water, said Hannah Cloke, hydrology professor at the University of Reading. The devastating outcome suggests Valencia\u2019s warning system failed, she said. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know what to do when faced with a flood, or when they hear warnings.\u201d \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be dying from these kinds of forecasted weather events in countries where they have the resources to do better,\u201d added Liz Stephens, a professor in climate risks and resilience at the University of Reading. \u201cWe have a long way to go to prepare for this kind of event, and worse, in future.\u201d You can read the full story below Experts have been giving their reaction to yesterday\u2019s disaster - sounding a warning about our preparedness and ability to cope. Extreme weather events are becoming more intense, are lasting longer and are occurring more frequently as a result of human-induced climate change, scientists say. \u201cOur infrastructure is not designed to deal with these levels of flooding,\u201d Hayley Fowler, professor of climate change impacts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University. She added \u201crecord-shatteringly hot\u201d warmer sea temperatures fuel storms that dump extreme levels of rain in one place. Such extreme weather \u201ccan overwhelm the ability of existing defences and contingency plans to cope, even in a relatively wealthy country like Spain\u201d, said Leslie Mabon, senior lecturer in environmental systems at Britain\u2019s Open University. \u201cThe floods in Spain are a timely reminder that no country is exempt from the risks of climate change.\u201d For Linda Speight, a lecturer at the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford, warnings for intense thunderstorms are \u201cincredibly hard to issue\u201d as the exact location of the heaviest rainfall is usually unknown in advance. \u201cWe urgently need to adapt our cities to be more resilient to floods,\u201d she added, suggesting making space for water to flow through urban environments without causing damage. \u201cWe take preparation for other hazards such as earthquakes and tsunami very seriously,\u201d added Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology, at the University of Reading. \u201cIt is time we afforded the same to flood risk preparedness.\u201d As we\u2019ve been reporting this morning, there are ongoing efforts to find survivors. However, Emiliano Garc\u00eda-Page, the president of the Castilla La-Mancha communitieas, has said part of the hard-hit village of Letur remains inaccessible to crews. The region said yesterday two people had died. Five residents of Letur remained missing. \u201cIn Letur, specifically, it still hasn\u2019t been possible to access part of the village,\u201d Garc\u00eda-Page told reporters. \u201cThe prognosis is pessimistic, but until we find people and confirm things, we will cling to hope.\u201d Residents of Chiva, a small town on the outskirts of Valencia, can expect a grim future of worsening drought as the planet heats up and the country dries out. But on Tuesday, they also witnessed a year\u2019s worth of rainfall in a matter of hours. The torrential rains that flooded southern and eastern Spain on Tuesday night, ripping away bridges and tearing through towns, have killed scores of people. Fossil fuel pollution plays a role in warping both extremes of the water cycle: heat evaporates water, leaving people and plants parched, but hot air can hold more moisture, increasing the potential for catastrophic downpours. \u201cDroughts and floods are the two sides of the same climate change coin,\u201d said Stefano Materia, an Italian climate scientist at Barcelona Supercomputing Centre. He said studies had linked droughts in the Mediterranean with the climate emergency through changes in atmospheric circulation at the same time that global temperature rise had severely heated the region. Read on here: Authorities have confirmed a mother and baby were among the victims swept away in yesterday\u2019s floods in the Valencia suburbs. Around 40 people were confirmed to have died in Paiporta alone. Tens of thousands of homes across the area are still without electricity and drinking water and many roads were blocked by hundreds of cars and trucks swept away in sudden torrents. Emergency services carried out 200 rescues on the ground and 70 aerial evacuations on Wednesday, said Valencia regional government chief Carlos Mazon. This week\u2019s floods were Spain\u2019s worst since 1996, when 87 people died after torrential rain hit a campsite in the Pyrenees mountains. Europe\u2019s most recent deadly floods came in July 2021, killing 243 people in Germany, Belgium, Romania, Italy and Austria. The intense rain has been attributed to a phenomenon known as the gota fr\u00eda, or \u201ccold drop\u201d, which occurs when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean. This creates atmospheric instability, causing warm, saturated air to rise rapidly, leading to heavy rain and thunderstorms. Experts say the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. Here are some of the latest images from affected areas in Spain: The gratitude that greeted Tuesday\u2019s dawn downpours was short-lived in Utiel. When the longed-for rains finally reached the town in the drought-stricken eastern Spanish region of Valencia, they were merciless in their abundance. \u201cPeople were very happy at first because they\u2019d been praying for rain as their lands needed water,\u201d said Remedios, who owns a bar in Utiel. \u201cBut by 12 o\u2019clock, this storm had really hit and we were all pretty terrified.\u201d Trapped in the bar, she and a handful of her customers could only sit and watch as Spain\u2019s worst flooding in almost 30 years caused the Magro River to overflow its banks, trapping some residents in their homes and sending cars and rubbish bins surging through the streets on muddy flood waters. \u201cThe rising waters brought mud and stones with them and they were so strong that they broke the surface of the road,\u201d said Remedios, who gave only her first name. \u201cThe tunnel that leads into the town was half-full of mud, trees were down and there were cars and rubbish containers rolling down the streets. My outside terrace has been destroyed \u2013 the chairs and shades were all swept away. It\u2019s just a disaster.\u201d By Wednesday afternoon, the death toll in Valencia and the neighbouring regions of Castilla-La Mancha and Andaluc\u00eda stood at 95 . Utiel\u2019s mayor, Ricardo Gabald\u00f3n, told Las Provincias newspaper that some of the town\u2019s residents had not survived the floods, but was unable to provide an exact number. Hours earlier, Gabald\u00f3n had told Spain\u2019s national broadcaster, RTVE, that Tuesday had been the worst day of his life. \u201cWe were trapped like rats,\u201d he said. \u201cCars and rubbish containers were flowing down the streets. The water was rising to 3 metres.\u201d Rescue personnel and more than 1,100 soldiers from Spain\u2019s emergency response units have been deployed to affected areas. Spain\u2019s central government has also set up a crisis committee to coordinate rescue efforts. As the search for missing people continues, motorists are urged to stay off the roads and away from swollen rivers amid warnings that the severe weather was not over and that the number of deaths could still rise. Rescue workers in Spain continued to search for more victims after deadly floods, as questions were raised about how one of the world\u2019s most developed nations failed to respond adequately to an extreme storm. Torrential rains that began at the start of the week sparked flooding that has left at least 95 people dead, the deadliest such disaster in the western European country since 1973. Defence minister Margarita Robles told Cadena Ser radio station that a military unit specialised in rescue operations would on Thursday start combing through the mud and debris with sniffer dogs in the worst-hit areas. Asked if the number of victims was likely to increase, she said: \u201cUnfortunately we are not optimistic\u201d. The teams have brought with them 50 mobile morgues. More heavy rain was predicted for the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region and other areas on the north-east coast on today."

            "content": "The havoc unleashed by Hurricane Milton provided unambiguous evidence that we are entering a critical and alarming new phase in the planet\u2019s climate crisis. Rising fossil fuel emissions have triggered increases in ocean temperatures and sea levels to such an extent they are generating some of the most destructive storms ever experienced in Florida. Together with Hurricane Helene earlier, the lives of about 250 people have been claimed and thousands of homes destroyed. Florida has been left reeling and forecasters have warned there is more to come \u2013 a lot more. It is a grim prognosis that should be galvanising Florida\u2019s political leaders into taking urgent action to protect the state. Extraordinarily, this has not been the case. Despite the intensification of hurricanes and worsening flooding over the past decade, governor Ron DeSantis has consistently rejected the idea that global warming poses a threat to Florida or that the phenomenon exists at all. A few weeks ago, he signed a law erasing the words \u201cclimate change\u201d from state statutes and effectively pledged the state\u2019s future to burning fossil fuels. Such behaviour is disturbing. DeSantis is a Republican who is matched in the vehemence of his climate denials by his party\u2019s candidate for the US presidency, Donald Trump. Should the latter triumph in next month\u2019s election, the tribulations that afflict Florida will be escalated and repeated across the nation and the rest of the planet. Trump has vowed to dismantle the environmental policies introduced by President Joe Biden and promised to allow increases in the production of fossil fuels by drilling on public lands. In doing so, Trump would allow billions of tonnes of extra carbon to be pumped into our already overheated atmosphere and send a clear signal to other nations, which might be wavering in their commitment to the fight against global warming, that they need not bother to act. Such an entirely plausible scenario would have grim implications for our already endangered planet. Global temperatures are close to reaching the 1.5C rise that the 2015 Paris agreement pledged to try to prevent. Today, a rise of 2C seems inevitable, with worse likely to follow. Jim Skea, the chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), recently warned the world was headed towards 3C warming by 2100 if current policies are maintained. In such an overheated world, several catastrophic points of no return would be passed, from the runaway melting of ice sheets to the Amazon rainforest drying out, on top of catastrophic sea-level rises and the displacement of millions of people whose homelands have become uninhabitable. Earth will become meteorologically and politically unstable. It is an extraordinary situation made all the more alarming by the basic observation that we have known about these dangers for decades but have done little to impose measures that might deflect them. In a few weeks, politicians and scientists will meet at Cop29, the UN climate change conference, that will be held in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. The meeting should be an opportunity for world leaders to galvanise nations into action. This is unlikely, with most of the discussion expected to focus on methods by which developed nations can pay poorer countries to transition away from fossil fuels and adapt to climate change\u2019s worst impacts. A commitment to end fossil fuel burning was agreed in principle at the last Cop, meeting but there has been little movement, say observers. Carbon emissions look set to continue for a long time. This leaves the world with one last option. If we refuse to halt the burning of fossil fuels with sufficient speed, we must find ways to catch the resulting emissions as they are created or \u2013 further in the future \u2013 after they have reached the atmosphere. This means developing ways to extract carbon emissions at factories and power plants and then to sequester them. This is carbon capture and storage (CCS), a process that recently received a major boost in the UK when the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, announced a \u00a322bn investment in CCS schemes that would eventually lead to 8.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year being removed from emissions from British industrial plants. It should be noted that the UK emitted 384m tonnes of carbon dioxide last year, so the scheme will clearly make little difference to our overall contribution to global warming. However, it should, if successful, highlight a route for tackling the crisis by providing us with an additional weapon in the fight against global warming alongside renewable energy, electric cars and home insulation. From that perspective, Miliband deserves congratulation \u2013 though questions remain. Why should public money be spent on cleaning up emissions created by the fossil fuels that make private companies so much money, for example? Crucially, we are failing to halt global warming. We are not going to stop carbon in the atmosphere reaching dangerous levels quickly enough and so will need to find ways to remove it once it has got there. We are going to need every weapon we can develop for this purpose if we are to deal with the greatest threat that faces civilisation today. The alternative is the global spread of the carnage that last week engulfed Florida."

            "date": "2024-10-28T00:01:15Z",
            "content": "The high carbon emissions of the world\u2019s richest 1% are worsening hunger, poverty and excess deaths, a report has found. Owing to luxury yachts, private jets and investments in polluting industries, the consumption of the world\u2019s wealthiest people is also making it increasingly difficult to limit global heating to 1.5C. If everyone on Earth emitted planet-warming gases at the same rate as the average billionaire, the remaining carbon budget to stay within 1.5C would be gone in less than two days, the Oxfam analysis said, rather than current estimates of four years if carbon emissions remain as they are today. Preceding a budget in the UK, a presidential election in the US and the Cop29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, the anti-poverty group\u2019s examination of carbon inequality calls on governments to tax the super-rich in order to curtail excessive consumption and generate revenue for the transition to clean energy, and to compensate those worst affected by global heating. Oxfam\u2019s research found that fifty of the world\u2019s richest billionaires produce on average more carbon emissions in under three hours than the average British person does in their entire lifetime. On average, they take 184 private jet flights in a single year, spending 425 hours in the air. This produced as much carbon as the average person in the world would in 300 years. Their luxury yachts emitted as much carbon as the average person would in 860 years. The Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s two private jets spent nearly 25 days in the air over a 12-month period and released as much carbon as a US Amazon employee would emit in 207 years. Two jets of Elon Musk, the second richest person in the world and Tesla chief, jointly discharged as much CO2 in the same period as 834 years\u2019 worth of emissions generated by an average person. Meanwhile, the three yachts of the Walton family, heirs of the Walmart retail chain, had a combined carbon footprint in one year of 18,000 tonnes \u2013 an amount similar to that of 1,714 Walmart shopworkers. Ahead of the Labour government\u2019s first budget statement on Wednesday, Oxfam is calling on the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to increase taxes on \u201cclimate-polluting extreme wealth\u201d, starting with private jets and superyachts, to raise funds which could be used to tackle the climate crisis. In response, a UK Treasury spokesperson said \u201cWe do not comment on speculation around tax changes outside of fiscal events\u201d. The Oxfam researchers developed a methodology for calculating the emissions from yachts that included data on the size of the vessel, engine specifications, fuel type, hours at sea and even generators for hot tubs and air conditioning for helicopter hangars. \u201cOne of the key findings for us is that superyachts are by far the most polluting toy that a billionaire can own, except perhaps for a rocket ship,\u201d said Alex Maitland, one of the authors of the report. Far more destructive still are the greenhouse gas emissions from the investments of the ultra-rich, which are 340 times higher than the CO2 from their yachts and jets. On average, the portfolios of the 50 billionaires in the study were almost twice as polluting as an investment in the main US stock index. Almost 40% of their shareholdings were in emissions-intensive industries such as oil, mining, shipping and cement. Many of these companies also hire lobbyists and marketing professionals to delay or disrupt action on the climate. Oxfam says investment is also the area that has the greatest potential for positive change because, unlike most poor and middle-income people, billionaires have a choice about how to use their money. If they were to switch their holdings into low-carbon-intensity funds, their investment emissions would be 13 times lower. The report also projects the deadly consequences of carbon inequality: in the coming century, 1.5 million excess deaths will be caused by the consumption emissions of the richest 1% \u2013 those with incomes of at least $140,000 (\u00a3108,000) \u2013 between 2015\u201319. It says the past three decades of consumption emissions of this wealthy group have caused global economic output to fall by $2.9tn and crop losses equivalent to the calorific needs of 14.5 million people a year. Chiara Liguori, Oxfam\u2019s senior climate justice policy adviser, said: \u201cThe evidence is clear: the extreme emissions of the richest, from their luxury lifestyles and even more from their polluting investments, are fuelling inequality, hunger and threatening lives. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unfair that their reckless pollution is fuelling the very crisis threatening our collective future \u2013 it\u2019s lethal.\u201d The findings are the latest in a series of annual carbon inequality reports by Oxfam. As the Guardian reported last year, the wealthiest 1% \u2013 who tend to live climate-insulated, air-conditioned lives, mostly in the global north \u2013 produce as much carbon pollution as the 5 billion people who make up the poorest and most vulnerable two-thirds of the human population, who predominantly live in poorer countries in the global south. The latest report stresses the need to address the climate and inequality crises alongside carbon taxes on high-emitting industries, higher income taxes on the super-rich and restrictions on the use of private jets and luxury yachts. Liguori said: \u201cThis report shows that fairer taxes on extreme wealth are crucial to accelerate climate action and fight inequality \u2013 starting with private jets and super-yachts. \u201cIt\u2019s clear these luxury toys aren\u2019t just symbols of excess; they\u2019re a direct threat to people and the planet.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2024 to remove the Stockholm Environment Institute as being one of the organisations involved in producing the latest annual carbon inequality report."

            "title": "What is carbon capture, usage and storage?",
            "date": "2024-10-04T11:19:49Z",
            "content": "The UK, along with many governments around the world, is placing its faith in carbon capture and storage, the technology that can keep carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere. The government has committed almost \u00a322bn over 25 years to developing CCS in a big investment promise designed to reignite Britain\u2019s struggling industrial heartlands. But does CCS work, and how can the UK afford it? What is carbon capture and storage (CCS)? The key aim of CCS is to stop CO2 escaping into the atmosphere and exacerbating the climate crisis. The components of CCS have been around for decades: they are a group of technologies that can capture the carbon dioxide produced by big factories and power plants, preventing them from reaching the atmosphere and contributing to global heating, then transport them, bury them or reuse them. In most versions, the preliminary step involves fitting factory chimneys with solvent filters to trap carbon emissions. The gas can then be piped to locations where it can be used or stored. Most carbon dioxide will be injected deep underground \u2013 where fossil fuel gas comes from in the first place \u2013 to be stored where it cannot contribute to the climate crisis. This can be part of a process called \u201cenhanced oil recovery\u201d, where CO2 is pumped into an oilfield to force out the remaining pockets of oil that would otherwise prove difficult to extract. Some of the CO2 could be used to help make plastics, grow greenhouse plants or even purified to be used in carbonated fizzy drinks. Does the UK need carbon capture? CCS is considered an essential part of the UK government\u2019s commitment to become a net zero economy by 2050. These technologies feature in most policy paths towards this goal, including the map provided by the government\u2019s official climate advisers at the Committee on Climate Change, who have said CCS is a \u201cnecessity, not an option\u201d in the transition to net zero. Globally, CCS projects could reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by almost a fifth and reduce the cost of tackling the climate crisis by 70%, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). One of the main reasons CCS is necessary is because heavy industry \u2013 fertiliser producers, steel mills and cement makers \u2013 would be difficult and expensive to adapt to run on cleaner energy. UK government officials believe that using CCS is the lowest-cost option to meet its climate targets. Why is CCS controversial? Some climate experts and green groups believe the technology could keep big economies hooked on fossil fuels. They say that when CCS is used to remove the carbon produced by gas power plants or to remove the carbon from gas to create clean-burning \u201cblue hydrogen\u201d, it creates an expensive route for fossil gas to remain part of the energy system. This matters, because carbon is also released when gas is extracted from the ground and transported. Many of the companies investing in carbon capture development are oil and gas firms \u2013 they stand to benefit from government support for CCS and from the continued use of their gas. Green groups believe investment should instead focus on clean forms of energy such as \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d, which is extracted from water using an electrolyser powered by renewable electricity. CCS should be used only as a last resort for industries that offer an important economic contribution and that would be too difficult to decarbonise. Where is CCS technology being used? There are several CCS projects operating commercially, but nowhere near enough to clean up the world\u2019s carbon emissions. The forerunners are in the US, Canada, Norway (which aims to be an international leader in the field) and China. In Abu Dhabi, the energy company Adnoc has begun a drilling campaign at Fujairah for a project to turn captured carbon dioxide into rock. Globally, about 51 megatons of carbon dioxide were captured and stored last year, according to BloombergNEF data, or about 0.14% of global emissions. The IEA has said: \u201cCCS deployment has been behind expectations in the past, but momentum has grown substantially in recent years, with approximately 300 projects in various stages of development across the CCS value chain.\u201d Is the process expensive? The cost of carbon capture technologies is \u201chigh and varied\u201d, according to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, but costs are expected to fall as more countries invest in CCS. UK government officials believe CCS is cheaper than trying to cut emissions from very high polluting sectors through alternatives such electrification, or importing goods rather than manufacturing them domestically. Some people have argued that governments could reduce the cost of CCS on taxpayers by compelling oil companies to pay for enough carbon capture to offset their own emissions. One study argues that the companies that profit from extracting fossil fuels should be paying for an equivalent quantity of carbon dioxide to be stored geologically as a condition of operating. Under a \u201ccarbon take-back obligation\u201d, all fossil fuels extracted or imported into a country or group of countries would be offset by storing underground an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide to that generated. Over time, it could be used to store 100% of emissions by 2050 to help the world reach net zero. In reality, this plan is unlikely to go ahead. Instead, governments are crossing their fingers that the costs will come down as the technology evolves."

            "title": "Campaigners call for steeper cuts to UK greenhouse gas emissions",
            "date": "2024-10-26T05:00:26Z",
            "content": "Climate campaigners have urged ministers to make steeper cuts in the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions after the government\u2019s statutory adviser on the climate gave its verdict on new targets. The Climate Change Committee, which advises the government, has written to Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, to advise cuts of 81% in the UK\u2019s emissions, compared with 1990 levels, by 2035, if emissions from aviation and shipping are excluded. Miliband now faces the choice of whether to follow the committee\u2019s advice in setting the UK\u2019s new international commitment under the Paris agreement at a forthcoming UN climate summit. A cut of 81% as an international target would be broadly in line with the UK\u2019s existing domestic carbon budgets for the 2030s, which are also set with advice from the CCC and are intended to deliver net zero emissions by 2050. But campaigners urged the government to go further in order to demonstrate global leadership and spur innovation and a low-carbon economy. Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cWith climate change spiralling dangerously out of control, the recommended 81% cut should be seen as the very minimum carbon reduction target the UK government should commit to. Ramping up ambition to make even deeper cuts in practice would show real leadership in global efforts to avert the worst of climate breakdown.\u201d Catherine Pettengell, the executive director of Climate Action Network UK, said: \u201c[This] should be the floor, not the ceiling, of the UK\u2019s ambition and action. A more ambitious and fair target could be achieved if the UK brings its full economic and political will to the table.\u201d Meeting the new target will be a stretch. The UK is far away from meeting the international target in place of a 68% reductions in emissions by 2030, which was set by Boris Johnson before the UK hosted the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021, according to analysis by Friends of the Earth. Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cTrue leadership means the government must also set out tangible plans to deliver on its 2035 target.\u201d He called for the fulfilment of Labour\u2019s promise to end new oil and gas licences, at least triple renewables and double energy efficiency rates by 2030, and support workers to transition away from polluting industries. Another key question for Miliband, in drawing up the UK\u2019s international target \u2013 known as a nationally determined contribution, or NDC, under the Paris agreement \u2013 is how to account for emissions from international aviation and shipping to and from the UK. These emissions are now included in the UK\u2019s domestic carbon budgets, but were not explicitly in the 2015 Paris agreement, and previous international pacts, because of the difficulty of apportioning the emissions to particular countries. Some campaigners argue that aviation and shipping are implicitly covered by the Paris agreement, but there is disagreement over this and most countries exclude them from their NDCs. Jonathan Hood, the UK sustainable shipping manager at the Transport &amp; Environment campaigning group, said they should be included. \u201cPassing responsibility for shipping emissions to the ineffective International Maritime Organisation and excluding them from the NDC makes no sense \u2013 particularly when the UK has already accepted legal responsibility for international shipping and aviation emissions by including them in the sixth carbon budget,\u201d he said. If aviation and shipping are included, in effect the headline target for an NDC would be likely to equate to a cut of about 78% by 2035, in line with the UK\u2019s carbon budgets. New NDCs are not due to be submitted to the UN until next February, but Keir Starmer promised that the UK\u2019s would be unveiled early, at the forthcoming Cop29 UN climate summit, taking place in Azerbaijan from 11 November. The prime minister told other leaders at the UN general assembly in New York last month: \u201cThe UK will lead again, tackling climate change, at home and internationally and restoring our commitment to international development. The threat of climate change is existential and it is happening in the here and now. So we have reset Britain\u2019s approach.\u201d Delivering the NDC early is intended to spur other major economies to do the same. However, the big question mark hanging over Cop29 is whether Donald Trump will win the US presidential election, which takes place just five days before. Trump has vowed to dismantle the green industrial stimulus put in place by Joe Biden, boost fossil fuels, and withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. The UK met the first three five-year carbon budgets set under the Climate Change Act of 2008, but current and future budgets look harder to meet. This carbon budget runs to 2027, and will be assessed at the end of this parliament in 2029. The fifth and sixth carbon budgets call for a cut of 58% in emissions by 2032, and 78% by 2037. The seventh carbon budget will be set by the CCC next year. Robert Jenrick, the Conservative leadership candidate, has pledged to repeal the Climate Change Act, and his rival in the contest, Kemi Badenoch, is also hostile to the UK\u2019s net zero ambitions. A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \u201cBritain is back in the business of climate leadership because the only way to protect current generations in the UK is by making Britain a clean energy superpower, and the only way to protect our children and future generations is by leading global climate action. \u201cWe are grateful to the Climate Change Committee for this expert advice, which we will consider carefully before we announce an ambitious nationally determined contribution target at Cop29 to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.\u201d"

But he only hints at a worse aspect of the plan: that it is entirely unproven to work on the scale needed to be effective, as many studies have shown. A study of the health and climate impacts of carbon capture, in the journal Energy and Environmental Science, found that only 10.8% of one such plant\u2019s CO2-equivalent emissions and 10.5% of the CO2 removed from the air is captured over 20 years, and only 20 to 31% is captured over 100 years. In addition, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis finds that \u201cCCS is an expensive and unproven technology that distracts from global decarbonisation efforts while allowing oil and gas industries to conduct business as usual.\u201d This spells out exactly why the oil and gas extraction firms are so strongly in favour of CCS: it allows them to continue making their obscene profits at our expense \u2013 and of that of the future of the planet. Dr Richard Carter Putney, London \u2022 The government\u2019s carbon capture and storage proposal shows either their ignorance of the advice from all independent scientific experts (that CCS is quite the least energy-efficient way to get carbon out of the atmosphere) or that they are in the pockets of the fossil fuel lobby to which they are throwing a lifebuoy. Carbon dioxide only makes up a tiny proportion of the atmosphere (0.04%), so capturing it requires a lot of electricity. Best just to stop generating emissions. A much more far-sighted investment would be to release Britain\u2019s unrivalled potential for tidal-power generation, now a mature technology, by extending the electrical distribution network down our coastlines. The jobs created would utilise Britain\u2019s marine and electrical engineering skills, provide reliable generation, thereby eliminating the argument for further nuclear power stations and hasten the day when we are free of all reliance on fossil fuels. Catching and burying carbon dioxide emissions from power stations, oil and gas fields and steel and cement plants has been ongoing for 20 years, but it has spectacularly failed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, its only clear successes involve enhanced oil recovery: carbon dioxide is used to drive oil out of geological formations that are otherwise difficult to exploit. With astonishing chutzpah, some oil companies have claimed the small amount of carbon that remains trapped in the rocks as a climate benefit. Kate Macintosh Winchester \u2022 I was disappointed but perhaps not surprised to read Rachel Reeves\u2019 celebration of the government\u2019s funding of carbon capture as the start of their \u201cgreen revolution\u201d. She might as well have said the government was investing \u00a322bn of our taxes in bitcoin over the next 25 years. The environmental impact would be similar, as would the efficacy of the technology. The only proven carbon capture is the fossil fuel industry\u2019s capture of our media and politicians, as evidenced by this new form of fossil fuel subsidy. If they wanted to invest in unproven technology, the government could have chosen any of the new forms of bulk energy storage that we will need to develop to make our grid resilient to the intermittent nature of renewable generation. But no, we get fossil-fuel snake oil instead. Edric Brown London \u2022 Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it.

But it\u2019s not too late\u201d). But your conclusion that carbon capture and storage is the \u201clast option\u201d is misleading, defeatist and dangerous. Carbon capture has a 50-year record of failure. In a half century, the industry has captured a minuscule proportion of global emissions and left a trail of failed projects and wasted public money in its wake. The fossil fuel industry knows CCS is not the answer, yet it keeps pushing it as a distraction tactic to delay the transition to clean energy. The irony is that the very industry you suggest should be paying for cleaning up emissions is instead pocketing billions in public money for failed CCS. Money that should go to transitioning to renewable energy solutions. Supporting Ed Miliband\u2019s recent announcement to waste \u00a322bn of public money on the fossil fuel industry\u2019s snake oil of carbon capture and blue hydrogen is a shocking misread of the facts. If CCS is the \u201cweapon\u201d this editorial claims, it is, at best, a very expensive butter knife. We must not give up on the only solution to climate change that works: phasing out fossil fuels. Rosemary Harris Brighton Sex is a privilege, not a right While some might consider Philippa\u2019s response to be pragmatic, there are times in life where a compromise is not the only answer (\u201cAsk Philippa: my partner wants more sex and more enthusiasm from me\u201d). Being pestered for sex is annoying but what is described is emotional manipulation. Anyone who rates their partner\u2019s performance in a derogatory manner must firstly understand that their whims are a privilege and not a right. Women have the agency to choose what they do with their bodies without having to manage their partner\u2019s sulky inability to handle \u201crejection\u201d. Philippa\u2019s advice may well pave a path to resolution but, by omitting this basic starting point, it undermines everything we seek to teach young people about consent. Mona Sood Southend-on-Sea, Essex Don\u2019t blame headteachers Anna Fazackerley reports that headteachers feel \u201cunder pressure to turn around a national crisis in school attendance\u201d (\u201cUK academies \u2018very sorry\u2019 for policies saying pupils must attend when unwell\u201d). How are they supposed to do this when the reasons for this crisis are largely outside their control? It is not headteachers but politicians who have ensured that school has increasingly become an unsatisfactory experience. The reasons for so much pupil dissatisfaction include: lack of resources; an inappropriate curriculum, the teaching of which is almost entirely geared to external examinations; the disappearance of practical and creative activities; an increase in bullying and feelings of inadequacy promoted by social media platforms; overworked and exhausted teachers who have no time to deal with these problems or even recognise, let alone attend to, the needs of individual children and who increasingly leave the profession at the first opportunity. If the government wants to improve school attendance, it should start by reforming the hopelessly outdated policies that it has inherited. Michael Pyke The Campaign for State Education Israel\u2019s doomed strategy As a big fan of Kenan Malik, I\u2019m disappointed by his adoption of a plague-on-both-your-houses narrative concerning the crisis in the Middle East (\u201cIsrael is not \u2018saving western civilisation\u2019. Nor is Hamas leading \u2018the resistance\u2019\u201d). While Israel had, until 7 October, attempted to \u201cfavour\u201d Hamas to divide the Palestinian resistance and undermine popular support for the secular PLO, it was a strategy doomed to fail. Israel\u2019s success at co-opting the Palestinian Authority into doing its security bidding is in stark contrast to its failure to \u201ctame\u201d Hamas despite its successive brutal assaults since 2006, culminating in the current slaughter of civilians, first in Gaza and now in Lebanon. Even after a year of carnage, 70% of Gazans approve of the 7 October attack and Hamas\u2019 role in the war, according to the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research. Like it or loathe it, Hamas continues to offer the only serious resistance to Israeli occupation.

Not all of Badenoch\u2019s detractors have a problem with \u201crightwing politicians of colour, particularly women\u201d, or are exclusively on the left. Badenoch attracts dislike because her negative focus on the vulnerable in general, and minority ethnic groups in particular, is obsessive, while her party hopes her ethnicity offers insurance against reproach.

            "date": "2024-10-02T16:18:38Z",
            "content": "Sellafield will have to pay almost \u00a3400,000 after it pleaded guilty to criminal charges over years of cybersecurity failings at Britain\u2019s most hazardous nuclear site. The vast nuclear waste dump in Cumbria left information that could threaten national security exposed for four years, according to the industry regulator, which brought the charges. It was also found that 75% of its computer servers were vulnerable to cyber-attack. Sellafield had failed to protect vital nuclear information, Westminster magistrates court in London heard on Wednesday. Chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, said that after taking into account Sellafield\u2019s guilty plea and its public funding model, he would fine it \u00a3332,500 for cybersecurity breaches and \u00a353,200 for prosecution costs. The state-owned company has already apologised for the cybersecurity failings. It pleaded guilty to the charges \u2013 which relate to IT security offences spanning a four-year period from 2019 to 2023 \u2013 when they were brought by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) in June. Goldspring said the case fell into a category \u201cbordering on negligence\u201d and a \u201cdereliction of responsibilities\u201d. Sellafield might also \u201cforeseeably have caused harm\u201d and a loss of data could \u201chave had huge risk adverse consequences for workers, the public and the environment\u201d, he said. Sellafield, which has a workforce of about 11,000 people, is a sprawling rubbish dump on the Cumbrian coast that stores and treats decades of nuclear waste from atomic power generation and weapons programmes. It is the world\u2019s largest store of plutonium and is part of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, a taxpayer-owned and -funded quango. Late last year, the Guardian\u2019s Nuclear Leaks investigation revealed a string of IT failings at the state-owned company, dating back several years, as well as radioactive contamination and a toxic workplace culture. The Guardian reported that the site\u2019s systems had been hacked by groups linked to Russia and China, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems. The Guardian investigation revealed that Sellafield\u2019s computer servers were deemed so insecure that the problem was nicknamed \u201cVoldemort\u201d, after the Harry Potter villain, because it was sensitive and dangerous. It also revealed concerns about external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into its system while unsupervised. In sentencing, Goldspring added that the prosecution did not offer any evidence of a successful cyber-attack, even if it asserted that it was impossible for Sellafield to prove that the nuclear site had not been \u201ceffectively attacked\u201d. As a result, the court could only sentence Sellafield on the basis that there was no evidence of \u201cactual\u201d harm arising from any attacks. The fine was reduced by one-third as the nuclear site pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. The judge also noted that Sellafield has sought to improve its cybersecurity in recent months. The fine was further reduced as it is ultimately dependent on public funding to operate as a not-for-profit business. At an earlier hearing in August, Goldspring had said that, while all parties said the failings were very serious, he would need to balance the cost to the taxpayer with the need to deter others in the sector from committing similar offences in deciding the size of the fine. At that hearing, the court heard that a test had found that it was possible to download and execute malicious files on to Sellafield\u2019s IT networks via a phishing attack \u201cwithout raising any alarms\u201d, according to Nigel Lawrence KC, representing the ONR. An external IT company, Commissum, found that any \u201creasonably skilled hacker or malicious insider\u201d could access sensitive data and insert malware that could then be used to steal information at Sellafield. Euan Hutton, chief executive of Sellafield, has apologised for the failing and said he \u201cgenuinely\u201d believes that \u201cthe issues which led to this prosecution are in the past\u201d. Paul Fyfe, senior director of regulation at the ONR, said: \u201cWe welcome Sellafield Ltd\u2019s guilty pleas. \u201cIt has been accepted the company\u2019s ability to comply with certain obligations under the Nuclear Industries Security Regulations 2003 during a period of four years was poor. \u201cFailings were known about for a considerable length of time but despite our interventions and guidance, Sellafield failed to respond effectively, which left it vulnerable to security breaches and its systems being compromised.\u201d There have, however, been \u201cpositive improvements\u201d at Sellafield during the last year under new leadership, the ONR added. A Sellafield spokesperson said: \u201cWe take cybersecurity extremely seriously at Sellafield, as reflected in our guilty pleas. \u201cThe charges relate to historical offences and there is no suggestion that public safety was compromised. \u201cSellafield has not been subjected to a successful cyber-attack. \u201cWe\u2019ve already made significant improvements to our systems, network and structures to ensure we are better protected and more resilient. \u201cThe cyber threat is continually evolving, and we will continue to work with the regulator to ensure we meet the high standards rightly required of us.\u201d The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \u201cWe take the safety of our nationally significant infrastructure very seriously and I welcome the fact we have a robust regulator holding our nuclear industry to account. \u201cI have written to the chief executive of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority seeking assurance that cybersecurity failings at Sellafield are being addressed and cannot happen again.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-25T19:58:01Z",
            "content": "Chinese government-linked hackers are believed to have targeted phones used by Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, as part of a larger breach of US telecommunications networks, according to a New York Times report. The Trump campaign was informed this week that the phone numbers of the Republican presidential and vice-presidential nominee were among those targeted during a breach of the Verizon network, the paper said, citing sources. Investigators are working to determine what data, if any, was accessed by the \u201csophisticated\u201d hack, the sources said. Other current and former government officials were also targeted, according to the report. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed an investigation was under way into the \u201cunauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d. It did not name the Trump campaign in the statement. \u201cAfter the FBI identified specific malicious activity targeting the sector, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims,\u201d the agency said. The Trump campaign did not directly address whether the phones used by Trump and Vance had been targeted. In a statement, a Trump campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, criticized the White House and Trump\u2019s opponent, Kamala Harris, and sought to blame them for allowing a foreign adversary to target the campaign, the Times reported. A Wall Street Journal report last month said a cyber-attack linked to the Chinese government had infiltrated multiple US telecommunications firms and may have gained access to systems used by the federal government in court-approved wiretapping efforts. The hackers accessed at least three telecommunication companies \u2013 AT&amp;T, Verizon and Lumen Technologies \u2013 in what may have been an attempt to find sensitive information related to national security, according to the report. The Trump campaign earlier this year revealed it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. The US justice department unsealed criminal charges in September against three members of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps suspected of hacking the Trump campaign. Justice department officials said hackers were trying to undermine Trump\u2019s campaign and intended to sow discord, exploit divisions within American society and potentially influence the outcome of the 5 November election. With the election under two weeks away, Trump and Kamala Harris are locked in a tight race. In both national head-to-head polls and surveys in the crucial swing states where the election will be decided, the pair seem almost deadlocked."

            "date": "2024-10-23T04:01:07Z",
            "content": "The cost of cleaning up Sellafield is expected to spiral to \u00a3136bn and Europe\u2019s biggest nuclear waste dump cannot show how it offers taxpayers value for money, the public spending watchdog has said. Projects to fix buildings containing hazardous and radioactive material at the state-owned site on the Cumbrian coast are running years late and over budget. Sellafield\u2019s spending is so vast \u2013 with costs of more than \u00a32.7bn a year \u2013 that it is causing tension with the Treasury, the report from the National Audit Office (NAO) suggests. Officials from finance ministry told the NAO it was \u201cnot always clear\u201d how Sellafield made decisions, the report reveals. Criticisms of its costs and processes come as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, prepares to plug a hole of about \u00a340bn in her maiden budget. Europe\u2019s most hazardous industrial site has previously been described by a former UK secretary of state as a \u201cbottomless pit of hell, money and despair\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Nuclear Leaks investigation in late 2023 revealed a string of cybersecurity problems at the site, as well as issues with its safety and workplace culture. The NAO found that Sellafield was making slower-than-hoped progress on making the site safe and that three of its most hazardous storage sites pose an \u201cintolerable risk\u201d. The site is a sprawling collection of buildings, many never designed to hold nuclear waste long-term, now in various states of disrepair. It stores and treats decades of nuclear waste from atomic power generation and weapons programmes, has taken waste from countries including Italy and Sweden, and is the world\u2019s largest store of plutonium. Sellafield is forecast to cost \u00a3136bn to decommission, which is \u00a321.4bn or 18.8% higher than was forecast in 2019. Its buildings are expected to be finally torn down by 2125 and its nuclear waste buried deep underground at an undecided English location. The underground project\u2019s completion date has been delayed from 2040 to the 2050s at the earliest, meaning Sellafield will need to build more stores and manage waste for longer. Each decade of delay costs Sellafield between \u00a3500m and \u00a3760m, the NAO said. Meanwhile, the government hopes to ramp up nuclear power generation, which will create more waste. Sellafield is owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), a taxpayer-owned and -funded quango. The NDA believes the cost of decommissioning Sellafield could range from \u00a3116bn to \u00a3253bn, depending on the length and complexity of the cleanup. Plans to clean up three of its worst ponds \u2013 which contain hazardous nuclear sludge that must be painstakingly removed \u2013 are running six to 13 years later than forecast when the NAO last drew up a report, in 2018. The NAO said deteriorating buildings, Covid restrictions, staffing and equipment breaking down were to blame. Sellafield had \u201cretrieved much less waste than it had planned\u201d since 2020, it said. Sellafield could spend more on demolishing buildings earlier to be more efficient and offer better value for money, the NAO said. One pond, the Magnox swarf storage silo, is leaking 2,100 litres of contaminated water each day, the NAO found. The pond was due to be emptied by 2046 but this has slipped to 2059. The Guardian investigation revealed it could continue leaking until 2050. The NAO said: \u201cSellafield has demonstrated that it can remove safely the most hazardous waste, but is not progressing quickly enough to meet its plans.\u201d Last year, Sellafield defied the Treasury and without consultation increased its headcount from 11,200 to 12,000, despite previous commitments to reduce its employee numbers by becoming more efficient, the report said. In one blunder, Sellafield paid out \u00a32.1m more in staff bonuses than it should have done \u2013 about \u00a3200 a person \u2013 in 2023. This was paid after a management decision that the NAO suggests was questionable. Sellafield had expected to replace a testing facility that is more than 70 years old and in \u201cextremely poor condition\u201d, but after racking up \u00a3265m over more than seven years the project is under review amid concerns over delays and the condition of buildings on the site. The NAO said this was the single biggest risk to Sellafield\u2019s future, as workers needed to carry out many different regular scientific tests. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cDespite progress achieved since the NAO last reported, I cannot conclude Sellafield is achieving value for money yet, as large projects are being delivered later than planned and at higher cost, alongside slower progress in reducing multiple risks.\u201d He added: \u201cContinued underperformance will mean the cost of decommissioning will increase considerably, and \u2018intolerable risks\u2019 will persist for longer.\u201d This month, Sellafield was fined \u00a3332,500 for cybersecurity failings and the chief magistrate in the case, Paul Goldspring, said it fell into a category \u201cbordering on negligence\u201d. The NAO said the nuclear site had again admitted that its cybersecurity efforts were falling short. David Peattie, the NDA\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cSellafield is one of the most complex environmental programmes in the world. We\u2019re proud of our workforce and achievements being made, including the unprecedented retrieval of legacy waste from all four highest hazard facilities. \u201cBut as the NAO rightly points out there is still more to be done. This includes better demonstrating we are delivering value for money and the wider significant societal and economic benefits through jobs, the supply chain and community investments.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-09T14:16:30Z",
            "content": "Over the past decade or so, people have accumulated a vast array of logins for dozens of sites and apps, as more of our work and home lives moves on to the internet. That\u2019s why it has never made sense that so many IT departments have belligerently insisted on maintaining a major hurdle to password management. Namely, the need to change passwords regularly. It\u2019s a familiar scenario. You arrive at the office and need to log on to your company laptop quickly, before your morning meeting. But speed is not going to be of the essence today, because an annoying prompt has appeared: you need to change your password. Thank goodness, then, for new US government guidance, which suggests an end to requiring such mandatory password resets. Previously, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommended organisations enforce password expiration every 365 days, but now it says this is not necessary at all \u2013 unless a password has been compromised in a breach. It\u2019s another nail in the coffin for the practice, which is no longer recommended by organisations including the US Federal Trade Commission, Microsoft and the UK\u2019s National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) \u2013 which has advised against regularly changing passwords since 2015. Indeed, NIST is only just catching up with the general consensus as people\u2019s digital footprints reach unmanageable levels, leading to a pile-up of passwords that are difficult enough to remember, let alone change. The issue with changing passwords regularly is easy to imagine, especially at work. You want to get into a required website, you are in a rush, you\u2019re not feeling at your most creative \u2013 and frankly, you don\u2019t care what you need to do to log in. What was once \u201cpassword1\u201d becomes \u201cpassword2\u201d and once you\u2019ve accessed the site successfully, you forget all about it. Attackers know these patterns, so if they were able to work out your old password, they\u2019ll also be able to guess your new one. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those counterintuitive security scenarios; the more often users are forced to change passwords, the greater the overall vulnerability to attack,\u201d says Emma W, people-centred security lead at the UK\u2019s NCSC. \u201cAttackers can often work out the new password if they have the old one. And users, forced to change another password, will often choose a weaker one that they won\u2019t forget.\u201d And studies reveal that in general people are still using usernames or passwords that are too simple, despite warnings from government and the industry. A recent report by the cybersecurity experts Redcentric suggests that one in five people use just one or two passwords to access all of their online log-ins. If people are terrible at choosing passwords in the first place, changing them isn\u2019t going to fix the problem. An annual study by the password manager company NordPass reveals the most common and therefore easy to crack credentials each year, and the same ones regularly come up. As well as the expected \u201cpassword1\u201d and \u201c1234567\u201d, people often revert to using favourite football teams or celebrity names. Tech giants know that passwords are a flawed system, so they\u2019ve started to make changes to get rid of them altogether, including industry initiatives such as the FIDO Alliance. These aim to push users towards biometrics such as Apple\u2019s Face ID and Touch ID, and even physical tokens such as the Yubico YubiKey, but at the moment, they\u2019re in addition to passwords, rather than instead of them. So what about passwords themselves? Should we be choosing a complex array of numbers and letters and unique characters to make up our logins? Apparently not. Experts, including NIST, now say it\u2019s far better to use something you can remember. According to the latest guidelines, passwords should be at least eight characters \u2013 preferably more like 15 \u2013 up to a maximum of 64. So what about an obscure but memorable song lyric, or a line from a book you love (just don\u2019t use A Tale of Two Cities; it\u2019s too obvious). Or better still, the NCSC recommends using three random words to create a password that will be \u201clong enough and strong enough\u201d to protect your accounts. But if you\u2019re thinking of changing certain characters in your password \u2013 swapping the letter \u201co\u201d with a zero, for example \u2013 the NCSC warns that cyber-criminals know these tricks too. \u201cYour password won\u2019t be significantly stronger, but it will be harder for you to remember,\u201d the NCSC says. So what should people do? First, pay attention to the NCSC and NIST guidance as these institutions really know the latest research on security, which can help in your personal password choices. At work, you should follow the advice of your IT department and perhaps make them aware of NCSC and NIST guidelines if they aren\u2019t already. The NIST guidelines mark a shift away from the rigid views of the past. The US helps set the standard for the tech world, and they are saying it\u2019s more realistic to meet people where they are, accepting they have different levels of technical ability, which should ultimately help make everyone more secure.

            "content": "The pace of US economic growth slowed over the summer but continued its two-year expansion, according to data released on Wednesday, days before millions of voters decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump is best placed to lead it forward. US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of economic health \u2013 rose by 2.8% in the third quarter, short of economists\u2019 expectations of 3.1%, and down from the previous quarter\u2019s 3% reading. The increase was driven primarily by consumer spending, exports and federal government spending. US policymakers scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation two years ago. The Federal Reserve rapidly increased interest rates to tamp down prices in a move that economists feared risked tipping the world\u2019s largest economy into recession. Such effects failed to materialize. \u201cDespite earlier fears that the US economy was headed for recession, growth continued to outperform,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. \u201cOverall, the US economy appears to be doing just fine.\u201d US economic growth has been surprisingly resilient under Joe Biden, with only one quarter \u2013 the first of 2022 \u2013 in decline, as the shockwaves of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to rattle the global economy. Inflation has fallen from a generational high of 9.1% in June 2020 to an annual rate of 2.4% in September, its lowest rate in over three years. But many Americans still aren\u2019t feeling it. Almost half wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Years of rising prices continue to take their toll. In a speech in Washington on Tuesday, Harris once again tried to allay voters\u2019 fears. The Democratic candidate for president promised to assist first-time homebuyers, ban price-gouging at supermarkets and cap the price of insulin. \u201cI will deliver tax cuts to working people and the middle class \u2026 I will lead in honoring the dignity of work,\u201d she said. Trump has sought to portray the Biden administration as a \u201cdestroyer\u201d of jobs, despite US employers adding millions of jobs in recent years. Harris, Biden\u2019s vice-president, has acknowledged that the cost of living remains \u201cjust too high\u201d for many, and has pledged to take action to help. The latest GDP report was released ahead of closely watched jobs data for October, out on Friday, the last employment report before the election. Economists expect the economy to have added about 125,000 new positions over the month. That figure would be a sharp drop from the 250,000 jobs added in September, when hiring unexpectedly accelerated, and will probably reflect the strike at Boeing and the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. But there are signs that the US\u2019s resilient jobs market may also shake off last month\u2019s disruptions. On Wednesday ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, said private companies hired 233,000 new workers in October, the best month for job creation since July 2023, up from 159,000 in September and far ahead of the estimated 113,000. \u201cEven amid hurricane recovery, job growth was strong in October,\u201d ADP\u2019s chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. \u201cAs we round out the year, hiring in the US is proving to be robust and broadly resilient.\u201d"

The former president\u2019s big lie has distorted the views of millions of Americans, wrongly convincing many that the US economy is in bad shape. There\u2019s no denying that many Americans are struggling economically and that inflation was painfully high back in 2022, but inflation is far lower now, and most economists agree that our economy is strong. The unemployment rate is low, inflation is way down, economic growth is solid, and job growth has been remarkably strong. Indeed, the country has added nearly 18m jobs \u2013 a record \u2013 under the Biden-Harris administration. Not only that, median household income has climbed to $80,610, higher than it was in Trump\u2019s last year in office. \u201cIn the 35 years I\u2019ve been an economist, I\u2019ve rarely seen an economy performing as well as it is,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said recently. \u201cI\u2019d give it an A+.\u201d But the US public, still upset about the surge in inflation several years ago, sees things very differently: 62% say the economy is in bad shape, while just 38% say it\u2019s in good shape, according to an October AP-NORC poll. The public holds this negative view even though there\u2019s been very good news for blue-collar workers: the US has added more than 700,000 factory jobs under the Biden-Harris administration, far more than during Trump\u2019s presidency, indeed more than under any president since the 1970s. There\u2019s also been good news for small businesses \u2013 a record 19m new business applications have been filed under Biden. There\u2019s also good news for the wealthy \u2013 the stock market has climbed to record levels, which is Wall Street\u2019s way of saying the economy is in excellent shape. Let\u2019s not forget that Trump warned that if Biden was elected president, the stock market would crash. Wrong again, Donald. Under Biden, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 36% higher than when Trump left office, and the S&amp;P 500 is 53% higher. Trump\u2019s repeated claim that today\u2019s economy is the worst ever shows either an appalling ignorance of history or an appalling contempt for the truth. The truth is that the economy was in far worse shape during Trump\u2019s last year in office, when the unemployment rate soared to 14.8% during the pandemic, compared with 4.1% now. Moreover, there were many other times when the economy was in worse shape \u2013 it was worse during the 2008 recession under George W Bush, far worse during the 1980-81 and 1974-75 recessions, and catastrophically worse during the Great Depression of the 1930s. When Trump tells his Maga crowds that today\u2019s economy is the worst ever, he\u2019s taking everyone for an idiot. The US economy has grown the fastest among major industrial nations since the pandemic began. Our economy has grown twice as fast as Canada\u2019s, three times as fast as France\u2019s and Japan\u2019s, and four times as fast as Britain\u2019s. Under Biden, the average unemployment rate has been lower than under any president since Lyndon Johnson. If Harris loses to Trump, historians and economists will long debate why she lost while Ronald Reagan was re-elected in a landslide in 1984 even though unemployment was far higher back then (7.2% versus 4.1% today), inflation was higher (4% versus 2.4% today), and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rates were far higher (10% versus 5% today). One thing working for Reagan was that GDP growth was strong in 1984. Don\u2019t get me wrong, today\u2019s economy has serious problems. Millions of Americans are struggling, but it\u2019s wrong to blame Biden and Harris for that. I\u2019ve been writing about America\u2019s workers and economy for more than 40 years \u2013 from Reagan to Clinton to Trump to Biden \u2013 and under every president, millions of American have struggled economically. Trump makes believe that far more Americans are struggling now than ever before, but that\u2019s just not true. Take this important statistic: 11.1% of Americans currently fall below the poverty line. That\u2019s essentially the same percentage as under Trump and is only slightly above its lowest point in half a century. Many Americans say the economy is in poor shape mainly because of their lingering dismay about the high inflation from mid-2021 to mid-2023. But they may not know that wages have risen faster than inflation over the past two years and that real wages are higher than before the pandemic. Trump blames Biden and Harris for causing inflation, but they weren\u2019t the cause. The two main causes were the pandemic\u2019s closing factories and disrupting supply chains worldwide and Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, which increased energy and food prices. Americans complain that gas prices are higher, but that\u2019s Vladimir Putin\u2019s and Opec\u2019s fault, not Biden\u2019s or Harris\u2019s. US oil production has hit record levels. Housing affordability remains a big problem. Not only have housing prices soared, but high interest rates \u2013 which are finally coming down \u2013 have made it far too difficult for many Americans to buy a house. Again, the housing squeeze is not Biden\u2019s or Harris\u2019s fault; it was caused by a huge slowdown in housing production that began during the 2008 recession. It\u2019s unfortunate that Trump\u2019s dishonesty and deceit too often make us focus on his lies rather on something far more important: the future, and what a second Trump term would mean for the country. Many economists warn of disaster if Trump wins. They warn that his plan to impose tariffs or taxes on all imported goods will send inflation soaring and ignite a dangerous trade war that could cause a recession and throw millions out of work. Economists also warn that Trump\u2019s plans, including his plan to slash taxes on the wealthy and corporations, not only will increase the federal debt by a colossal $7.8tn, but could bankrupt the social security system and lead to a 33% across-the-board cut in social security benefits. No wonder 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a recent letter calling Trump\u2019s economic agenda \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and warning that it \u201cwill lead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality\u201d. In contrast to Trump, Kamala Harris has specific plans to improve the economy and help Americans cope with high prices. She has pledged to build 3m new housing units to help bring down housing prices. She also plans to give $25,000 in down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers. To help with the high cost of raising a family, she has called for creating a $3,600 tax credit per child and $6,000 for newborns. Recognizing how expensive caregiving needs can be, she wants to create a trailblazing Medicare at Home program to help pay for care for ageing parents. Nobel-winning economists said Harris\u2019s economic agenda is \u201cvastly superior\u201d to Trump\u2019s and \u201cwill improve our nation\u2019s\u201d employment opportunities, health, investment and fairness. American voters have a clear choice. They can choose Harris\u2019s agenda, which promises a stronger, fairer economy, or Trump\u2019s agenda, which will bring a worse, less stable economy with higher prices and less fairness. Unlike Trump, I\u2019ll be honest and won\u2019t claim that his economic agenda will bring the worst economy ever, even though his agenda looks plenty dangerous.

            "date": "2024-10-01T08:00:26Z",
            "content": "Tim Walz and JD Vance, the US Democratic and Republican candidates for vice-president, will face off on Tuesday in what is likely to be the last debate showdown between the two parties\u2019 tickets before election day in exactly five weeks\u2019 time. The pair \u2013 who have had sharp words for each other at a distance \u2013 will engage in verbal combat in close quarters at a CBS-hosted event in New York, with the stakes raised by polling evidence that shows the contest between the two presidential nominees, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, poised on a knife edge. With Trump, the Republican nominee, continuing to refuse demands from Harris, his Democratic opponent, for a second presidential debate, much may ride on how the clash between Walz and Vance unfolds. The 90-minute duel will have added piquancy after Walz, the 60-year-old governor of Minnesota, memorably described Vance as \u201cweird\u201d while casting him as a key architect of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for a radical shake-up of American government and society that would crack down intensely on immigration, vanquish LGBTQ+ and abortion rights, diminish environmental protections, overhaul financial policy and take aggressive action against China. Vance, 40, a senator for Ohio who has reinvented himself as a political attack dog for Trump despite disparaging him before entering politics, has hit back by depicting his opponent as a far-left liberal and accusing him of serially misrepresenting aspects of his military service in the national guard. He has also thrown the \u201cweird\u201d jibe back at Walz after the Democratic vice-presidential nominee said his children had been born with the help of IVF \u2013 which Vance once voted as a senator to oppose \u2013 before it emerged that he and his wife had used a different form of fertility treatment. A new poll released on Monday found that US voters specifically want the duo to debate immigration and economic policies \u2013 two of the top election issues this year. American voters may also be looking to hear from both sides on handling the unfolding devastation and aftermath of Hurricane Helene, with Trump and Harris visiting affected states this week. The potential for fireworks could be further raised by the fact that CBS\u2019s rules of engagement preclude its moderators, Norah O\u2019Donnell and Margaret Brennan, from factchecking the candidates in real time \u2013 as happened at last month\u2019s ABC debate between Harris and Trump in Philadelphia. Instead, the two men will be expected to fact-check each other. Vance enters the debate with arguably more to gain. Since his selection as Trump\u2019s running mate, his approval figures have been consistently in the negatives amid a string of disclosures over derogatory comments about childless women, whom he branded \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d. He has also drawn fire for his role in promoting a debunked rumour about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating pets, before later telling CNN \u2013 unapologetically \u2013 that he\u2019s willing to \u201ccreate\u201d stories for the purpose of calling attention to \u201cthe suffering of the American people\u201d. Amid the opprobrium, the Yale-educated Vance \u2013 who has prepared for the debate by holding rehearsals with a small team that includes the House Republican whip, Tom Emmer, playing the role of Walz, and his wife, Usha, as an adviser \u2013 has gained a high profile by embracing the role of articulator of Trump\u2019s fiercely anti-immigrant America-first populism. Walz, by contrast, has achieved more encouraging polling numbers yet has adopted a low-key posture since Harris chose him as her running mate after being promoted to the top of the Democratic ticket following Joe Biden\u2019s decision to step aside in July. He has given few media interviews and had settled for a lower profile following the acerbic attacks on Vance and other Maga Republicans that were first brought to national attention in the summer \u2013 and prompted Harris to select him. Walz, who projects an image of folksiness, has admitted to nervousness about Tuesday\u2019s debate while preparing with the help of Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary. He has voiced fears to associates that he may let Harris down and reportedly warned her when she chose him that he was a poor debater. While there is little evidence historically of vice-presidential debates affecting the outcome of presidential elections, past encounters have been notable for producing memorable moments and soundbites. In 2020, Harris herself was the source of one when she told Mike Pence \u2013 Vance\u2019s predecessor as Trump\u2019s running mate and, at the time, the vice president \u2013 after he interrupted her. She said: \u201cMr Vice-President, I\u2019m speaking.\u201d In the 1988 vice-presidential debate, Lloyd Bentsen, running mate to the Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, had a ready rejoinder when Dan Quayle, the Republican nominee behind George HW Bush, when quizzed, at age 41 \u2013 a year older than Vance \u2013 about his relative youth, responded by invoking John F Kennedy. \u201cSenator, I served with Jack Kennedy,\u201d replied Bentsen. \u201cI knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-10-17T17:11:09Z",
            "content": "The European Central Bank has intervened to prevent a sharp slowdown in the eurozone economy with its first back-to-back interest rate cut since the euro crisis in 2011. With Germany on the brink of a recession and inflation tumbling across the 20 member single currency bloc, the ECB followed a reduction in the cost of borrowing at its previous meeting in September with a further 0.25 percentage point cut in its key deposit rate to 3.25%. Marking the third interest rate cut this year, the ECB\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said the fall in inflation had surprised the central bank and meant a cut was needed to ensure a soft landing for the eurozone economy. Figures out earlier on Thursday revealed annual prices growth in the eurozone had eased in September to 1.7%, down from 2.2% the previous month. Lagarde said there were clear signs from most measures of business and consumer activity that the economy was weakening. Growth in France is expected to wane after a bounce during the Olympics while Italy\u2019s better than expected recovery from the inflation shock of the last two years has petered out. Only Spain has shown a degree of resilience while interest rates have remained high, increasing by 0.8% in the second quarter of the year. Earlier this month, an measure of factory output in the eurozone \u2013 the HCOB Manufacturing PMI \u2013 fell to a nine-month low in September, adding to a downturn lasting more than two years. Lagarde said: \u201cThe latest data is all heading in the same direction, downwards, and points to more sluggish growth.\u201d She refused to indicate whether there would be further rate cuts, saying the central bank would remain dependent on the data before making further cuts at its next meeting in December. The ECB\u2019s move puts it two ahead of the Bank of England, which is widely forecast to cut the cost of borrowing in the UK by 0.25 percentage points from the current level of 5% when its monetary policy committee meets next month. In the US, the Federal Reserve has indicated it is also minded to trim rates in the coming months after instituting its first reduction last month \u2013 a half-point cut. Gold reached a record high just before Thursday\u2019s ECB announcement, hitting $2,688.82 (\u00a32,065.26) an ounce for the first time, lifted by forecasts of interest rate cuts around the world and uncertainty ahead of next month\u2019s US election. Announcing its decision, the ECB said the reduction in interest rates was based on \u201can updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission\u201d. It added: \u201cThe incoming information on inflation shows that the disinflationary process is well on track. The inflation outlook is also affected by recent downside surprises in indicators of economic activity.\u201d The deposit rate sets the return paid to eurozone banks when they make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem, the euro\u2019s monetary authority comprising the ECB and national central banks. \u201cThe trends in the real economy and inflation support the case for lower rates,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. Joe Nellis, an economist at Cranfield University and an adviser to the financial consultancy MHA, said the ECB would be focused on promoting growth after a long period in which the cost of borrowing was kept high to combat inflation. \u201cUnlike the Bank of England, the ECB has a dual mandate, requiring it to take decisions to foster growth as well as control inflation. ECB policymakers will hope that this cut provides a boost to the German (and wider eurozone) economy, inspiring consumer spending, encouraging investment and ultimately stimulating the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the German economy likely to shrink for its second consecutive year, we can expect the ECB to cut rates by another 0.25% in December \u2013 this is a decision policymakers will feel they have to make if they are serious about catalysing growth in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy,\u201d he added."

Before we go let\u2019s recap the big headlines: Anthony Albanese announces two more clean energy-related projects in New South Wales and Victoria aimed at transitioning Australia\u2019s energy production and workforce away from fossil fuels. The pace of property price growth is slowing, with Domain recording a 0.8% growth in the quarter and slightly more for units. Experts say homebuyer budgets are finding a ceiling. The Victorian Greens are called on the state government to enter the property development game, saying Labor\u2019s plan to get more millennials into the housing market will not work without such an intervention. Robbie Katter, the Katter\u2019s Australia party leader, says babies deserve representation in parliament. He wants to wind back abortion rights. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, criticised new Israeli laws restricting the UN relief agency Unrwa\u2019s access to Gaza, saying that Unrwa \u201cdoes life-saving work\u201d. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he hasn\u2019t had to declare flights taken on the private jets of billionaires, answering questions on reports he sought free Qantas flight upgrades directly from Alan Joyce while serving as transport minister. Tenants Advice and Advocacy Services in New South Wales are set to receive $4m in funding over four years from NSW Fair Trading. Journalist and academic Stan Grant took shots at \u201cpolitical elites\u201d in the United States, saying neither Donald Trump or Kamala Harris were the answer to the \u201cexistential crisis of America\u201d. Australians lost trust in governments as the Covid pandemic went on, particularly due to poor communication of the reasons for lockdowns and other restrictions, an inquiry found. Mark Butler announced $251m to establish a Centre for Disease Control. And a group of children were injured after a car crashed through a fence at Auburn South primary school this afternoon and collided into a bench. BoM confirms prospects for a La Ni\u00f1a event continue to subside As we flagged way back at the start of today\u2019s blog, the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s main model only gave a 4% chance of a La Ni\u00f1a forming in December. The bureau this afternoon updated its fortnightly climate drivers report to provide a bit more detail. Conditions in the Pacific Ocean remain in neutral and look like remaining so, even though the BoM is maintaining its \u201cLa Ni\u00f1a watch\u201d rating. The bureau noted only one of the international models it compares its ACCESS model to is forecasting its La Ni\u00f1a threshold is likely to be breached throughout November to February. As for the Indian Ocean, the negative phase of that basin\u2019s dipole (which compares sea-surface temperatures between the west and the east) looks likely to be exceeded next month. A negative-IOD, as it is known, typically contributes to wetter than usual conditions for much of the country. But BoM notes the background warming from global heating means past experiences may not be such a good guide to what\u2019s happening now. \u201cGlobal [sea surface temperatures] remain at near record levels, with temperatures since July being just short of the record temperatures observed during 2023, yet above all other years since observations began in 1854,\u201d BoM said. \u201cThe sustained nature of this significant global ocean heat suggests that climate indicators such as [El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation in the Pacific] and IOD may not behave or evolve as they have in the past.\u201d More renewables connecting to the grid as project pipeline grows, Aemo says In recent years we\u2019ve heard a lot about the need for a faster pace of deployment of large-scale renewable energy to shore up the grid as aging coal-fired power stations drop out. Well, there\u2019s some light (so to speak) at the end of the tunnel, with a jump of registrations in wind and solar farms and big batteries during the September quarter. The tally of 3.5 gigawatts of capacity was more than the 2.4GW of registrations for all of 2023, the Australian Energy Market Operator says. Aemo\u2019s connections scorecard said the past quarter\u2019s tally included three windfarms (1.8GW), three battery projects (1.25GW) and four (relatively small) solar farms (0.4GW). \u201cThese projects are built, connected to the grid and can now move to the final commissioning phase,\u201d Aemo\u2019s executive general manager, Merryn York, said. Perhaps more usefully, seven projects with a capacity of 1.3GW (or about the total of the Liddell coal-fired power station when it shut in April 2023) reached full generation during the September quarter, an increase of about two-thirds on the same quarter last year. (This collection included four windfarms, a hybrid battery and solar farm, and a gas-fired generator.) Early-stage application approvals also rose 160% to 2.6GW in the quarter from a year earlier. Aemo said 45.6GW of generation and storage capacity was working through various stages of the connections process as of the end of September, or equal to 70% of the total generation capacity in the national electricity market. That result was 36% more than a year ago. Wonder if we\u2019ll still have room for nuclear power plants from the mid-2030s (or later)? One child in critical condition and four others also in hospital after Hawthorn East collision Victoria police have provided an update for the Hawthorn East incident, in which a number of children have been injured after a car crashed into a school fence. Victoria police said: Emergency services attended a collision in Hawthorn East this afternoon. It\u2019s believed a vehicle was traveling along Burgess Street when it left the road and crashed through a school fence just after 2.30pm. One child has been taken to hospital in a critical condition and four others have been transported to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The female driver of the vehicle has been arrested and will be interviewed. The exact cause of the incident is being investigated. Major collision investigation unit detectives are enroute to the scene. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. The Labor-turned-independent senator, Fatima Payman, has accused her former party of giving \u201ccomplete impunity\u201d to Israel after it voted in favour of a ban against the UN\u2019s Palestinian aid body overnight. On social media, Payman said: Waking up to this news and wondering why everyone is shocked? This is what happens when this Labor government gives complete impunity to its so-called friend, Israel and in return, they incrementally increase their human rights violations and continue breaching international humanitarian laws. This is another low for Israel to cut off humanitarian aid provided by UNRWA to Palestinian refugees! Victoria\u2019s education department has confirmed a collision has occurred at a school in Melbourne\u2019s inner east.

Victoria police have confirmed emergency services are at the scene. More to come. Dutton says PM should refer himself to integrity commission over Qantas flights Dutton says the PM should refer himself to the integrity commission over the flight upgrades. It is clear he has breached the standards of the ministerial code of conduct in the Gillard code of conduct when he was transport minister. Dutton has attacked the PM on the Qantas upgrades and the lack of competitive air fares in Australia. He has been asked about his own access to a private jet and relationship with a billionaire Gina Rinehart. I have been very transparent, declared all of that, which is why [Albanese] knows about it and I was not the transport ministe, picking up the phone to Alan Joyce, the CEO of Australia\u2019s biggest airline, to ask for free up-rates for me and my family and then refusing to detail it in an honest way. Dutton says PM is focused only on \u2018what he can get from the system\u2019 Peter Dutton is talking in Queensland. He has accused the PM of being \u201cfocused on himself\u201d: This government talks a lot and Anthony Albanese promised a lot before the election but doesn\u2019t do anything except for himself and, unfortunately, Australians are missing out. And the prime minister is focused only on himself and what he can get from the system. He says the treasurer has handed down \u201cinflationary\u201d budgets: When we were in government during the Covid period, Jim Chalmers and Anthony Albanese proposed spending more money, so if their argument was inflation was a problem, their argument at the time was to fuel it further, and this is something that Australians understand. Thanks for tuning into the blog today. Handing over now to Cait Kelly, who will roll your live news updates this afternoon. The independent ACT senator, David Pocock, has urged the Albanese government to place targeted sanctions on officials within the Israeli government and its armed forces after it banned the UN\u2019s Palestinian aid body from entering Gaza, the West Bank and Israel. Overnight, Israel\u2019s parliament voted to ban the UN relief and works agency (UNRWA) from its territory within 90 days. The aid body provides food, water and medicine for the more than 1.9 million displaced Palestinians, who face severe shortages in the Gaza strip. Pocock said he held concerns about the potential \u201chumanitarian apocalypse\u201d in Gaza and called for targeted sanctions against Israeli government and defence force officials \u201cresponsible for war crimes against the people of Gaza and the West Bank\u201d. \u201cThis is one of the only levers available to us,\u201d Pocock said. In July, Australia imposed financial sanctions and travel bans on seven Israelis and a youth group for their involvement in violent attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank. The move came after the UN\u2019s international court of justice ordered Israel to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d and make full reparations for its \u201cinternationally wrongful acts\u201d in an advisory opinion that declares the occupation violates international law. In a press conference earlier, Pocock said the federal government\u2019s failure to do more amounted to a \u201creal failure of moral courage\u201d. At some point, countries like Australia, [must] say \u2018that\u2019s not good enough\u2019, and we can actually make a small stand as a middle power. Read more about the Knesset\u2019s decision here: Mark Butler says trust difficult to restore after Covid pandemic The health minister, Mark Butler, says it \u201cis going to be a long hard road to get trust to the level it was before the pandemic\u201d. He points to mis- and disinformation in health as something that is \u201cnot going to be easy to battle\u201d: It\u2019s easily lost, it\u2019s hard to build it back up, I think is the insight. The establishment of an independent authoritative body that is seen as distant from government, that is able to provide fearless advice to the community and to governments, which I think will have a reporting function to parliament, that will be transparent, I think is a critical central ingredient in rebuilding that trust. But I \u2013 I think \u2013 as all of you know, you know, the pandemic did fuel a lot of misinformation and disinformation which \u2013 which particularly was fertile in health, and that is not going to be easy to battle, frankly. So we need to build the structures, we need to give the community confidence that, in the future, decisions will be taken at an appropriate time on the basis of real data, Australian data, not overseas data, which the report makes clear we had to use because we had no data of our own, even though UK and US data was telling a very different picture to a population like Australia\u2019s that had different vaccination status. We use our own data and we use evidence-based approaches that \u2026 balance risks and benefits, takes the proportionate approach and thinks about non-health impacts as well as the direct health impacts. \u2018Billions and billions of dollars were wasted\u2019 during Covid crisis, Jim Chalmers says The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, also addressed press on the Covid inquiry report. \u201cBig decisions were taken and big mistakes were made,\u201d he said. \u201cThose mistakes were costly and they were inflationary. \u201cThe consequences of the economic policies developed through the pandemic also continue to be felt right across our economy even today.\u201d Chalmers quotes the report in saying \u201cthere was excessive fiscal and monetary policy stimulus provided throughout 2021 and 2022, especially in the construction sector, combined with supply-side disruptions this contributed to inflationary pressures coming out of the pandemic\u201d. He continued: The modelling cited in the report says that the extended policy support which didn\u2019t always move in line with the health advice meant that peak inflation was at least two percentage points higher than it could have been. On the design of the economic response, we saw some very good ideas badly implemented and poorly targeted. Labor called for and supported programs like jobkeeper but we were very, very clear at the time that the support should have been rolled out faster and that it should have been better targeted because, if it was better targeted, we could have provided more assistance to those who genuinely needed it by wasting less on the businesses in particular who didn\u2019t need jobkeeper and we know subsequently that billions and billions of dollars were wasted. On the home builders\u2019 program, the report makes it clear that overheated the industry and contributed to inflation in the post-pandemic era with many Australians experiencing the consequences of this now through higher inflation and through lack of access to housing. It\u2019s also particularly critical of the early release of superannuation, which was not an appropriate policy response and shouldn\u2019t be deployed again. They see the existing hardship provisions as sufficient for these kinds of events. It also concludes that the slow vaccine rollout had economic consequences as well. It delayed the reopening of our economy by months at great cost to the economy. Here\u2019s more on the newly announced Centre for Disease Control. The health minister, Mark Butler, told the media a short while ago: The first priority of the CDC will be to establish a comprehensive joined-up data and surveillance system in partnership with states and territories, but to have a single comprehensive real-time data and surveillance system and for our surveillance capability to be world-leading including our use of wastewater surveillance, which we know has been so important. The CDC will be also responsible for providing independent evidence-based advice about particularly a pandemic response, but more generally our responses to communicable diseases. It will also be responsible for engagement with regional and international partners. It will also obviously be responsible for leading pandemic planning and testing or stress-testing of our ability to respond to a pandemic in partnership with relevant departments, including my own, the Department of Health, and the National Emergency Management Authority. Mark Butler has announced $251m to establish a Centre for Disease Control. He told the media: The government is investing $251m over the forward estimates as well as funding ongoing to establish an independent authoritative Centre for Disease Control to commence from 1 January 2026. Legislation will be introduced into the parliament next year to set out its independence and functions, he said. It will be based out of Canberra, and its functions will \u201cclosely reflect\u201d recommendations from the Covid inquiry report. Butler talked through the report\u2019s recommendations a short while ago: There are 26 recommended actions for the national government, 19 of them are recommended to be prioritised over the next 12 to 18 months. Seven in the longer-term. Cabinet considered this report yesterday and appointed PM&amp;C to lead a cross-government taskforce to work through those recommendations and come back to the cabinet. I think, without doubt, though, the most important recommendation from this report is the establishment of a centre for disease control \u2013 a CDC. As you know, Australia at the beginning of this pandemic was pretty much the only OECD nation without a central authoritative centre for disease control and it was an election promise from Anthony Albanese, made in one of his budget reply speeches to close that gap and to establish a CDC here in Australia. Australia now \u2018arguably worse-placed\u2019 to deal with a pandemic than in 2020 The health minister, Mark Butler, says the Covid inquiry report concludes that, for a range of reasons, \u201cwe are arguably worse-placed as a country to deal with a pandemic than we were in early 2020\u201d. He told the media: There has been really significant scarring on our healthcare systems and the health workforce, a workforce that is exhausted by the demands of a once-in-a-century pandemic that\u2019s gone on for years. The APS has lost \u2013 the Australian Public Service \u2013 has lost key personnel who learnt a lot through that pandemic but have moved on from their positions, often through exhaustion. As I\u2019m sure the treasurer will talk about, governments are in much more significant debt than they were before the pandemic. But crucially, crucially, this report says that a number of the points I have already made about the lack of real-time evidence-based policy and the lack of transparency has driven a large decline in trust \u2026 which the panel members say, and these are their words \u2013 which many of the measures taken during Covid-19 are unlikely to be accepted by the population again. Health minister says Covid report criticises pace of vaccine rollout as well as aged care and communication failures Health minister Mark Butler told press the Covid-19 inquiry report identified the \u201cslowness of our vaccine rollout,\u201d \u201cfailures in aged care,\u201d and \u201cstark inequity\u201d between different community groups \u201cparticularly different groups from culturally linguistically diverse backgrounds but also temporary visa holders\u201d. He also said the report \u201cpoints to a lack of transparency around the rationale and the evidence behind decisions that were taken by governments that had such a profound impact on the lives of Australians and the freedom of Australians\u201d. The Covid-19 inquiry report found Australia\u2019s pandemic plans were \u201cgrossly inadequate for the scale of the challenge that Covid-19 presented to us\u201d, the health minister, Mark Butler, has told the media: The first lesson from this report is that like most countries, frankly, our pandemic plans were grossly inadequate for the scale of the challenge that Covid-19 presented to us. The report makes clear, for example, that our plans, such as they were, included no plan that would deal with the closure of the international border, which was such a central part of our response. No plan to deal with quarantine, which was also incredibly important. No plan to deal with the workforce demands of a pandemic that went on for as long as it did. And, as a result, to use the words of the report, our response to the pandemic was not as effective as it could have been. As a result of the lack of plans, leaders, particularly, were placed in the invidious position, to use the words of the report, of building the plane while it was flying. The disease surveillance systems were frankly simply not up to the task. The report talks about the use of paper systems, the use of facsimile machines. Mark Butler says Covid took lives directly of 20,000 Australians and caused immense \u2018separation, anxiety and grief\u2019 The health minister, Mark Butler, is addressing a press conference after the release of the Covid-19 inquiry report: It almost goes without saying that the Covid-19 pandemic for anyone born after the end of World War II was the biggest national and global emergency in our lifetimes. As we know it, it took the lives directly of more than 20,000 Australians, but its indirect impacts on the health system resulted in thousands more losing their lives as well. There was immense dislocation, separation, anxiety, grief and, as the treasurer will point out, enormous economic impacts from the pandemic and our response to it. We have a responsibility, particularly as a government, we have a responsibility to examine our response to the pandemic, to learn what we did well and, in particular, to learn what we could have done better. Importantly, to build as this report describes it, \u201ca high-level playbook for the next pandemic\u201d, because we know there will be a next pandemic. In releasing the report of the Covid inquiry, the federal government is also announcing $251m to deliver an Australian Centre for Disease Control. The idea was a Labor election commitment and an \u201cinterim\u201d body has been operating inside the health department since the start of 2024. But the health minister, Mark Butler, is today pledging $251.7m to deliver the proposal as a standalone institution. The Covid inquiry said a CDC would be a key trusted source of information in future, especially around health emergencies, helping to track statistics and communicate information as a central authority. The government said Australia is the only OECD country without an equivalent body. The interim body is already operating, and working on biosecurity measures for avian flu. The standalone body is slated to be located in Canberra and launch in January 2026, pending passage of legislation. \u201cThe establishment of the Australian CDV will ensure we are prepared next time,\u201d Butler said. The long-awaited Covid inquiry into Australia\u2019s response to the pandemic has been released. A panel of experts found Australians lost trust in governments as the pandemic went on, particularly due to poor communication of the reasons for lockdowns and other restrictions. The report also warned Australians are unlikely to abide by such strict pandemic restrictions in future health emergencies, and stressed that governments needed to work hard to rebuild public trust in institutions \u2013 with concerns that secrecy led to misinformation growing rife on the health response. Many Australians still feel \u201cresentment about what they lost\u201d during the pandemic Covid period and governments need to \u201crebuild the social fabric\u201d, respondents told the inquiry. The report said: Focus group participants said that governments resisted releasing information that may have contradicted the policies they were pursuing. This opinion led to a view that government did not trust the public to understand or interpret information correctly. A lack of transparency around vaccination prioritisation decisions reduced trust in government, particularly among people with disability. The panel heard that a lack of transparency also increased the perception that the government was hiding adverse information. This view fuelled the spread of misinformation and disinformation. Journalist and academic Stan Grant has taken shots at \u201cpolitical elites\u201d in the United States, as well as coverage of the US election, in a speech made at a social cohesion conference in western Sydney. The former host of ABC\u2019s Q+A told attendees that neither Donald Trump or Kamala Harris were the answer to the \u201cexistential crisis of America\u201d and then made reference to Robin Hood: The American political elites have turned their backs on poor Americans. They are bought and paid for by lobbyists. They pass laws that put more money into rich people\u2019s hands. Healthcare is a scandal. Machines are making people redundant. Big pharma has people hooked on drugs. If we think that Harris or Trump are going to be the answer to the existential crisis of America, then we need to know that the Sheriff of Nottingham has taken up residence in Washington DC, and the good cops have left town. Robin Hood is nowhere to be seen. He said coverage of the election had been \u201cabominable\u201d in that \u201cevery lie\u201d and \u201cevery hatred\u201d has been \u201camplified.\u201d He said the media has only been interested in the outrage and star power of the campaigns, and less so the people \u201cholding that broken country together\u201d. I barely watched much of the news coverage because it has been abominable. Every lie is amplified, every hatred is broadcast. And I\u2019m just not talking about Donald Trump. I\u2019m talking about the entire picture. If we reduce the American election to just an idea of who may be more decent or who has bad manners, but better manners, we\u2019re missing the point. The point is that we are talking about a nation where human beings are expendable and the media doesn\u2019t tell us that story because they\u2019re too interested in the latest entertainment, the latest pop star, the latest movie star, the latest business person, the latest Trump outrage, the latest inane comment from Kamala Harris, and never speak to the people who were doing the back-breaking, dirty, gut-busting work of holding that broken country together while politicians have absolutely exploited them. Tenants Advice and Advocacy Services in New South Wales are set to receive $4m in funding over four years from NSW Fair Trading. The service network \u2013 made up of 21 not-for-profits that support tenants in negotiations, dispute resolution and advocacy \u2013 will be boosted by $1m extra a year until 2028, as put in a statement from the minister for fair trading and better regulation, Anoulack Chanthivong. Funding has increased to $16.2m in 2024-25. \u201cThe Tenants Advice and Advocacy Service provides local support through a network of highly skilled advocates who work to ensure quality advice and advocacy is available to all renters in NSW,\u201d Chanthivong said. \u201cThe funding boost will mean the services can reach even more renters and keep this critical information service free.\u201d The chief executive of the Tenants\u2019 Union of NSW, Leo Patterson Ross, welcomes the additional funding, and says it \u201cwill make it easier for renters\u201d to seek free advice and advocacy: This funding increase will ensure services can continue to provide the same high-quality advice we have for the past 30 years. Third person charged in alleged Bluey coin theft A third person has been charged today with allegedly stealing tens of thousands of unreleased limited edition Bluey coins from a warehouse in Sydney\u2019s west. Police received a report that a large amount of currency had been stolen from a warehouse in Wetherill Park on Monday 12 July this year, according to a NSW Police statement. 63,000 unreleased limited edition $1 Bluey coins \u2013 produced by the Australian Mint \u2013 had been stolen, officers who arrived at the scene were told. An investigation into the incident was commenced by State Crime Command\u2019s Robbery and Serious Crime Squad under Strike Force Bandit. Two men have been charged and remain before the courts. Around 6.55am today, a 27-year-old woman was arrested, after detectives executed a search warrant in Green Valley. She taken to Liverpool Police Station where she was charged with \u201cthree counts of aggravated break &amp; enter commit serious indictable offence, and dispose property-theft=serious indictable offence &lt;=$5000\u201d, as put in the NSW Police Statement. She was refused bail to appear before Liverpool Local Court today. Police will allege in court the woman was the driver in the alleged break and enter. Class action against Homes Victoria won\u2019t be decided until next year Residents in public housing towers slated for demolition will not learn if they are successful in their fight against the Victorian government until next year, AAP has reported. The class action claims Homes Victoria did not properly consider the residents\u2019 human rights before deciding to demolish the towers in Carlton, Flemington and North Melbourne. The trial began in the Victorian supreme court on Monday, where the Homes Victoria chief executive, Simon Newport, conceded Daniel Andrews made the announcement before residents were notified. The trial was due to continue on Tuesday but the case was instead adjourned so the parties could fight over the production of secret documents. Justice Melinda Richards said another judge would need to decide on the document question, with a hearing date yet to be fixed. Julia Gillard library to be established at University of Adelaide Former prime minister Julia Gillard and the University of Adelaide have agreed to establish the Julia Gillard Prime Ministerial Library on the University\u2019s North Terrace campus. The uni will work with National Archives of Australia to bring the trove of documents from Gillard\u2019s career and prime ministership closer to the public. Gillard said: I am deeply honoured that plans are under way to establish the Julia Gillard Prime Ministerial Library on the grounds of the university where my tertiary education journey began. I have many fond memories from my time at the University of Adelaide, where I studied law, economics and literature. I have continued my relationship with the University as an honorary professor and through the annual Julia Gillard lecture. I am excited to see the library take shape in the coming years and become a dynamic, living space for students, staff and the general public. Circling back to Albanese\u2019s press conference \u2013 Labor is trying to change the topic (or at least muddy the waters) around the prime minister\u2019s Qantas upgrades by pointing out Peter Dutton\u2019s own disclosures of accepting flights related to mining billionaire Gina Rinehart. Albanese referenced Dutton taking flights \u201corganised to private parties\u201d. It seemed to be a reference to a story we broke in January, where the opposition leader was flown to a party \u2013 at Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting mine in the Pilbara \u2013 by another billionaire rich-lister. Senior Labor minister Murray Watt referenced this story last night, tweeting a screenshot with the caption \u201cspeaking of flights\u201d. Watt yesterday also noted Dutton had accepted flights in 2022 from Gina Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting, including a Perth-to-Pilbara air fare and flights between Sydney, Rockhampton and Mackay to attend a Bali bombing memorial. On Tuesday, Albanese defended his actions by saying all the upgrades were disclosed, but he didn\u2019t directly answer several questions about whether he\u2019d asked the then chief executive, Alan Joyce, for the upgrades himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to declare any flights on private jets owned by billionaires like Gina Rinehart, because I haven\u2019t engaged in it. As simple as that. And it\u2019s up to Mr Dutton to explain how those flights were organised to private parties,\u201d the PM said at a press conference. Stamp duty bill introduced to Victorian parliament Earlier this morning, the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, held a news conference in Docklands, where she announced the approval of three new residential towers in the area. She says two permits for 915 new homes to be built in three towers at Collins Wharf were approved by the planning minister, Sonya Kilkenny, on Monday. The $521m Lendlease development includes two 28-storey buildings with 349 and 375 apartments, and a 16-storey building with 191 apartments. She also announced the government will be introducing the Duties Amendment (More Homes) bill 2024 to parliament to allow for the 12-month off-the-plan stamp duty concessions she announced last week to come into effect. Under the plan, anyone buying off-the-plan apartments, townhouses and units will receive a huge discount on their stamp duty. The bill will be debated in the lower house this week before it goes to the upper house in the following sitting week, where Allan urged both the Liberals and Greens to support it. Allan told reporters: We need to take this action immediately and that\u2019s why, too, I\u2019m calling on the Liberal party, the Greens political party, to not stand in the way of this action that we are taking in the parliament this week. Industry, home builders and homebuyers deserve the certainty from all political parties in the parliament that they will support this legislation to move through the parliament as quickly and effectively as possible, and that\u2019s why we are bringing it to the parliament this week. We don\u2019t want to see any games. We want to see it introduced straight away. Homebuyers are relying on it. So too are home builders. Tony Burke says Labor didn\u2019t try to legislate against hate out of fears of ugly debate The minister for immigration, Tony Burke, has said the government introduced envoys to Islamophobia and antisemitism, as opposed to legislating against such hate, to avoid an \u201cugly\u201d political debate. Burke was speaking at a conference on social cohesion in western Sydney earlier and said that while there were state laws to address hate based on faith, there was no federal law that protects communities from such hate. But he said that should the government try to change that, it would result in \u201cthe ugliest debate I could imagine\u201d. Instead, the government appointed Jillian Segal as the first antisemitism envoy and Aftab Malik as the first anti-Islamophobia envoy: In the absence of federal law, and certainly at the moment, should we try to change that, the debate in the parliament would be one of the ugliest debates I could imagine, which we aren\u2019t wanting to bring on to people. So the way of being able to make clear statements against discrimination on the basis of people\u2019s faith was to create two positions which did not require a vote of parliament. The reason is very simple, antisemitism has an element of racist bigotry and bigotry on faith, Islamophobia is entirely about faith \u2013 neither of them have the federal protection that is there against racism, against sexism, against other forms of bigotry. So in establishing those envoys, we are establishing a very clear principle that these forms of bigotry and hatred are completely unacceptable. Burke also dismissed claims refugee arrivals from Gaza did not go through the proper security checks, saying such claims only \u201cadded kerosene to the fire\u201d. Finally, he also addressed the government\u2019s decision to reject the visa of American rightwing pundit Candace Owens because she would undermine social cohesion. He said it was \u201cone of the easiest decisions\u201d of his life. Men think sexual harassment is improving, women don\u2019t There\u2019s a stark difference between male business leaders and female employees in their perceptions about sexual harassment in Australian workplaces, a recent survey of 500 leaders and 1,000 employees has found. More than 70% of male leaders said they had high confidence a colleague felt safe to report sexual harassment. This dropped to only one-in-two women, the survey commissioned by the violence prevention organisation Our Watch found. Almost 80% of male bosses said they had a high degree of confidence appropriate action would be taken by employers if a report was made, compared with about one-in-two female workers. Nearly 4 million women have experienced workplace sexual harassment in the past five years, which is a much higher rate than men and meant women had a more personalised experience with sexual harassment, the Our Watch vhief executive, Patty Kinnersly, said. Workplace leaders thought the insidious problem was improving but that isn\u2019t what the data reflected, she said. \u2013 Australian Associated Press \u2022 In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

Other international helplines can be found at ibiblio.org/rcip/internl.html Anthony Albanese has been asked a few times whether he called the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, directly about flight upgrades. He said: There is no accusations being made with any specifics at all about any of this. None. None. People are \u2013 Peter Dutton is making this statement. If there is a suggestion to be made, let it be made specifically and I will answer it, but I have said very clearly that I recall direct discussions with Alan Joyce over the flights, the Emirates, Qantas flight to Dubai and of course the first flight to Perth. They are the only times I was on a plane with Alan Joyce. Of the 22 flights, 10 of them were during the leadership ballot between myself and Bill Shorten in 2013 over a one-month period where both Qantas and Virgin provided upgrades for flights that were paid for by the Australian Labor party to make sure there was not any cost to taxpayers for what was internal business. Albanese reiterated his claim that his financial arrangements are completely transparent: In terms of transparency, Bridget McKenzie can answer questions herself about things. Peter Dutton can answer questions about his flights. I assume, his flights upgrades, the same circumstances I am in with the exception that I don\u2019t have access to a private jet on call, which has happened with Mr Dutton, and it is up to him to explain that. Just like all of my financial arrangements are completely transparent. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says he hasn\u2019t had to declare flights taken on the private jets of billionaires, answering questions on reports he sought free Qantas flight upgrades directly from Alan Joyce while serving as transport minister. He spoke to press from Newcastle a short while ago: Peter Dutton has declared some of his flights. There is a difference between both of us. My flights were commercial, with Qantas or Virgin, or Emirates. They were all declared in the appropriate way. I didn\u2019t have to declare any flights on private jets owned by billionaires like Gina Rinehart, because I haven\u2019t engaged in it. As simple as that. And it\u2019s up to Mr Dutton to explain how those flights were organised to private parties. More than 10% of Australian teenagers found to identify as gay, bisexual, pansexual or asexual More than one in 10 Australian teenagers identify as gay, bisexual, pansexual or asexual, a survey of high school students has found. Researchers surveyed 6,388 year 8 students between 2019 and 2021, finding that 12% of the teenagers reported diverse sexualities, while 3.3% identified as gender-diverse. The findings, the study\u2019s authors say, highlight an \u201curgent need\u201d for support services in schools and healthcare settings to mitigate against an increased risk of stigma, discrimination and violence. Read the full story here: \u2018Immense\u2019 contribution More on Dr Michael Brand, director of the Art Gallery of NSW, stepping down. Brand oversaw the $344m Sydney Modern project that included the opening of the award-winning new building, Naala Badu, and the revitalisation of the 153-year-old original building, Naala Nura, both completed almost two years ago. Brand did not reveal what his next move would be. The president of the board of trustees, David Gonski, who is stepping down from his role in December, said Brand\u2019s contribution to the AGNSW had been immense. AGNSW director to step down next year The director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Dr Michael Brand, is stepping down from in July 2025. Brand joined the gallery as director in 2012. He said: When we unveiled the Sydney Modern vision in 2013, I said it would be a green light for art, artists and audiences. I am extremely proud of all that we have achieved together in the last 12 years to create a unique art museum experience on Gadigal Country in Sydney for our local and international audiences. This ambitious project is what called me back to Australia so my decision to step down next year follows much reflection. As we are now building on the success of the Sydney Modern transformation, it feels like the right time to transition to a new generation of leadership for the next exciting chapter in the history of our 153-year-old art museum. The president of the board of trustees, David Gonski AC, said: We are indebted to [Brand\u2019s] ambition and vision to create a globally significant art museum in Sydney. A national and international search for a new director will commence soon, Gonski said. More on the overhaul of committal hearings in Victoria For the accused, audiovisual link appearances will become default position in committal proceedings, while the committal hearing process will be bypassed altogether for homicide matters after a successful pilot, which fast-tracked cases to the supreme court. The Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, says the reforms act on a number of recommendations made by the Victorian Law Reform Commission in its 2020 report into committal hearings. She says she knows her changes will be met with \u201cmixed reviews\u201d from the legal community but she was taking into account victim\u2019s experiences. Symes told reporters outside parliament: The most compelling evidence put to me is that when you have sexual offence cases in particular, but [also] family violence and stalking matters, where witnesses are being cross examined in a committal process, then having to repeat that process because the case is proceeding, that\u2019s unacceptable. There is lack of evidence to suggest that cases are being knocked out in the committal stage. It\u2019s just a rerun and so [the reform is] avoiding the retraumatisation of victims having to give repeated evidence and particularly be cross examined. There is no doubt the cross examination process, is an important process of a trial, but it is the most stressful for a victim and a witness and if we can avoid them having to do that twice, I think this is called for. She says there will be a 12-month implementation period and a review of the changes once they\u2019re in place. In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. Other international helplines may be found via www.befrienders.org Traumatic pre-trial cross-examinations will be banned in Victoria as part of a push to protect victims and witnesses in family violence, sexual offence and stalking cases. The Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, is announcing new laws she says will guarantee that victims of particularly traumatic cases will only have to give evidence at committal hearings. It will reduce the number of cross-examinations, which Symes says is one of the most challenging parts of the criminal trial process. The justice legislation amendment (committals) bill 2024, will also significantly reduce the amount of pre-trial evidence given by all victims and witnesses, ensuring only questioning that is essential to resolve matters earlier is permitted. The laws will also prevent child victims, witnesses and those with cognitive impairments from having to testify multiple times in family violence cases by allowing them to give prerecorded video evidence, as is already done in sexual offence proceedings.

Mehreen Faruqi calls on government to sanction Israel Greens deputy leader Mehreen Faruqi is calling on the Albanese government to sanction Israel after its parliament voted to ban UN relief agency Unrwa from the country and declared it a terrorist organisation. Faruqi said: Undermining and stopping UNRWA from providing aid to Palestinians has been a long term goal of Israel and it\u2019s outrageous that now they are even closer to achieving this because the world has refused to take action to stop them. The Labor government has been \u2018urging\u2019 Israel to abide by international law for a year, and all we\u2019ve seen is its war crimes and genocide escalating. Enough with the weasel words. It\u2019s time for Albanese and Wong to impose sanctions and expel the Israeli ambassador. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, condemned Israel\u2019s ban on Unrwa operations earlier today. Read more here: Myer to buy multiple brands including Just Jeans Department store chain Myer will buy Premier Investment\u2019s apparel brands in Australia and New Zealand, which includes Just Jeans, Jay Jays, Portmans, Dotti and Jacqui E, the companies announced today. The transaction involves Premier shareholders receiving Myer stock, which will give Premier chairman Solomon Lew control of just under one-third of Myer shares. Lew said: Myer and our apparel brands will be stronger together \u2013 delivering vertical integration, scale, additional margins and loyalty opportunities. Premier will retain the Peter Alexander and Smiggle brands along with its stake in Breville Group and various property assets. The transaction comes at a challenging time for Myer, which reported lower profits and sales as customers grappled with rising living costs, prompting the department store operator to discount its fashion brands. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has criticised new Israeli laws restricting the UN relief agency Unrwa\u2019s access to Gaza, saying that Unrwa \u201cdoes life-saving work\u201d. \u201cAustralia opposes the Israeli Knesset\u2019s decision to severely restrict UNRWA\u2019s work,\u201d Wong said in a statement posted to the social media site X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday. On Sunday, Australia joined Canada, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the UK to urge Israel\u2019s Knesset not to proceed with this legislation.\u201d Unrwa, the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, is the main provider of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Unrwa of engaging in \u201cterrorist activities\u201d against Israel, which the agency has denied. Overnight, the Israeli parliament passed legislation designating the agency a terrorist organisation, severing ties with it, stripping staff of diplomatic immunity and banning it from operating on Israeli soil \u2013 a move that severely hampers its capacity to deliver aid to Gaza. Australian Energy Regulator investigates power outages around Broken Hill The Australian Energy Regulator is investigating \u201cpower system events\u201d that left 20,000 people without power in Broken Hill and nearby areas, after severe weather hit far west NSW and the region\u2019s only working large-scale emergency generator failed. The investigation will review whether there has been any potential breaches of the national electricity rules, as put in a statement from the regulator. The rules require transmission and distribution networks to \u201censure their systems and infrastructure are properly operated and maintained\u201d. The AER will coordinate with the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal investigation into Transgrid\u2019s compliance with licence conditions and other obligations under state legislation.

Rishworth said the fallout \u201chas been a complete pile-on on the prime minister\u201d: I mean, he\u2019s publicly declared very, very clearly what he has been gifted. I think there\u2019s something to if you are in a glass house, don\u2019t throw stones. Asked if she has ever called in for an upgrade, Rishworth said: Me personally? No, no, I haven\u2019t rung Alan Joyce, anyone, [for] an upgrade. But, you know, quite frankly. Well, no, that is not something that I\u2019ve done. Host Karl Stefanovic responded to Rishworth, saying: It wasn\u2019t your most convincing answer, Amanda, I mean, it was a pretty simple question. He then asked McKenzie if she had ever called Qantas management for an upgrade. McKenzie said: Amanda\u2019s answers aside, this is a serious problem \u2026 The problem is that I don\u2019t know of another transport minister who had a hotline to the CEO of Qantas to request freebies for family holidays. Pressed to answer the question about calling in for an update, McKenzie said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to answer it,\u201d then went on: There\u2019s a difference to receive a gift and declare it on your register to actually getting on the blower and saying, \u201cListen, mate, the missus and I are going overseas on a holiday. How about upgrading those economy tickets?\u201d Again, McKenzie was asked whether she has ever called Joyce or Qantas management for an upgrade. She said: I do not have a hotline to request upgrades. I have received an upgrade in 2018 that I declared, but to my knowledge, no transport minister other than Anthony Albanese has done this. Jeffrey Pope to be new acting Australian electoral commissioner Special minister of state Don Farrell has announced Jeffrey Pope as the new acting Australian electoral commissioner, to take on that role from mid-December. Pope has been the deputy AEC commissioner since 2016 and made \u201csignificant contributions\u201d to the 2023 referendum process and recent federal elections, according to Farrell: This appointment marks the end of a successful 11-year term for the current electoral commissioner, Mr Tom Rogers. Farrell thanked Rogers for his work at the 2016, 2019 and 2022 elections, as well as the 2023 referendum, and praised him for overseeing significant reforms in Australia\u2019s electoral process: Mr Rogers leaves a legacy of stable leadership and a stronger democracy. Farrell appoints Pope as parliament watchers eagerly await the final details of the government\u2019s new electoral reforms, which will propose changes surrounding spending caps and donations at elections. We understand that legislation is now slated to appear in mid-November, just before the parliament finishes for the year. \u2018I haven\u2019t worked that out\u2019: Robbie Katter asked about his abortion strategy in Queensland Back to Robbie Katter on ABC RN a short while ago. Asked whether he would amend Queensland\u2019s abortion legislation or repeal it, Katter said he hasn\u2019t worked it out. He said he had been \u201cpulled\u201d into the abortion debate and that it wasn\u2019t meant to be a priority of the campaign: I was pushed to give a response saying that there\u2019s backbenchers that would say, if they were given the opportunity and they would to turn things around, they would. And they said, \u201cWould you entertain that?\u201d I said, \u201cOf course I would, like, that\u2019s what we do.\u201d And so I responded to a question, and then, you know, blew up from there. And everyone started hitting me up for details on that \u2026 this one isn\u2019t one of my priorities for the new government. But if you ask me, yes, I would try and turn things around, and to what degree, whether that\u2019s, you know, 22 weeks thing, or 16 weeks or 22 weeks, or repeal or new bill and amendment, I haven\u2019t worked that out, Steve, and I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t give you more detail, but it wasn\u2019t sort of front of centre of my consciousness when I entered the campaign and I got pulled into the debate. The Katter\u2019s Australia party leader has vowed to introduce a private member\u2019s bill to wind back abortion rights and access that would notionally spark a conscience vote. One person dead after car crash in Victoria One person has died in a two-vehicle collision in Nyora about 5.20am this morning, according to a statement from Victoria police. It is believed a male driver in a Holden sedan was travelling along the South Gippsland Highway when it collided head-on with a silver Mazda hatchback at the intersection of Nyora-St Helier Road. The driver of the sedan, yet to be formally identified, died at the scene. The driver of the hatchback, a Poowong man in his 30s, sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to hospital for treatment. Investigations are ongoing. The exact cause of the collision is yet to be determined. Robbie Katter, the Katter\u2019s Australia party leader, says babies deserve representation in parliament. In the final weeks of the Queensland state election campaign, Katter vowed to introduce a private member\u2019s bill to wind back abortion rights and access that would notionally spark a conscience vote. He was asked on ABC RN this morning: An argument you hear in the US, and it\u2019s an argument you hear in Australia, that it\u2019s always men who seem to want to change laws about women\u2019s reproductive rights. What would you say to them? Katter replied: I\u2019d say there\u2019s a lot of babies that are males and females, and there\u2019s 93 members of parliament in Queensland, and looks like [there will] again be four that vote against that vote for pro life. So there\u2019s pretty strong representation for inverted commas, women, those women. And, you know, I think that the babies deserve to have some representation as well. And four is a pretty small number in the Queensland parliament, but I think those babies deserve representation. A lot of those women you speak of, they were babies once too, and I\u2019m sure they would have preferred to have some representation when they were babies as well. Labor decriminalised abortion in 2018 and has sought to put the issue at the forefront of the campaign, saying there is a \u201cvery real risk\u201d that reproductive rights will be wound back if the LNP wins government. Read more from Ben Smee\u2019s report here: The significance of Thorpe\u2019s royal protest Independent senator for Victoria Lidia Thorpe\u2019s protest before King Charles in the Great Hall of Parliament House last week caught news attention around the globe. While it prompted a few reactions, it also started a conversation about the British monarchy\u2019s role in the lasting legacy of colonisation for First Nations people. For today\u2019s Full Story podcast, Reged Ahmad speaks to political editor Karen Middleton about why Australians can\u2019t stop talking about the royal protest and what it means for Thorpe\u2019s role as a senator. Listen here: Bowen deflects question about PM\u2019s Qantas flight upgrades Climate and energy minister Chris Bowens says Anthony Albanese is not focused on political debates \u201cabout what conversations he may or may not have had\u201d, after reports of the prime minister seeking free Qantas flight upgrades directly from Alan Joyce while serving as transport minister and opposition leader. He said on ABC Radio National: The opposition can focus on the cost of Qantas flights for their life. The Labor party and the prime minister is focused on cost of living for ordinary Australians. Whether it be the cost of housing and a housing package we want to get through cost of energy and our reforms there. I mean, Anthony Albanese is, I can tell you, as a senior member of his cabinet, focused like the laser on these issues, not on these sort of political debates about what he may conversations he may or may not have had, you know, 10 or 15 years ago. He\u2019s focused on issues today. Bowen derides Coalition\u2019s \u2018nuclear fantasy\u2019 Chris Bowen, minister for climate change and energy, is speaking on ABC Radio National this morning. He says going \u201cdown the nuclear road\u201d for power is not playing to Australia\u2019s strengths: If I was the energy minister of another country, I would consider the opportunities that I had in that country \u2013 but a country saying to Australia, with our excellent renewable resources, that we should go down the nuclear road when we have no nuclear industry, no nuclear expertise of the scale that we would need for a nuclear power industry, is like us going to Finland or Scandinavia and saying, \u201cListen, we know [you have] a lot of snow, but you should really try beach surfing.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t make any sense. We have to play to our strengths in Australia, and we have the best renewable resources in the world, and the opposition wants to stop us using them, and in turn, keep coal in the system for longer. They\u2019re quite explicit about that while we wait for this nuclear fantasy to come on board. That would be terrible for emissions and fatal for energy reliability. The opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s plan to build seven nuclear power plants has been scrutinised by government agencies and department officials. Read about it here: Victorian Greens criticise Labor\u2019s housing plan The Victorian Greens leader, Ellen Sandell, has dismissed Jacinta Allan\u2019s criticism, arguing her party has been campaigning for years for more housing: The difference between the Greens and Labor is that the Greens want this housing to be genuinely affordable, yet Labor\u2019s plan will only build expensive, luxury apartments. Labor\u2019s plan leaves things totally in the hands of profit-driven developers who have no interest in building homes for young people, nurses, teachers \u2013 the people who actually need them. Dr David Hayward, an emeritus professor of public policy at RMIT, welcomed the Greens\u2019 plan, arguing the private sector undersupplied housing to maximise profits: You can deregulate as much as you want, but unless those private actors can get their financial return, they\u2019re not going to build what you want. The direct intervention proposed by the Greens is a way of plugging that gap. A state-owned builder wouldn\u2019t be the main player, just an additional one. It could even be a not-for-profit that does it, it doesn\u2019t really matter, as long as the motivation is not financial return. The main driver is the need to provide housing. As we\u2019ve flagged for a while, it\u2019s looking unlikely that we\u2019ll see a La Ni\u00f1a weather event in the Pacific this summer. The latest Bureau of Meteorology models place just a 4% chance that La Ni\u00f1a thresholds will be crossed in January (and less of a chance in December and February). The bureau will provide a fuller update of the main climate drivers this afternoon. La Ni\u00f1as tend to mean we get wetter than usual weather over much of the country, particularly in eastern Australia (and more tropical cyclones than the average). But conditions in the Indian Ocean are tilted towards the negative phase of the ocean\u2019s dipole (which measures temperature differences across the basin). These indicate we might still get a relatively damp end to spring going into summer. And that\u2019s what the bureau\u2019s outlooks indicate too. That summer umbrella might turn out to be handy for both the rain and the sun. Greens policy costings The policy is similar to a federal Greens proposal announced in March. Based on a federal Parliamentary Budget Office costing conducted at the time, it was forecast renters could save more than $122 a week a household and first home buyers $260,157 on a home, compared with median prices. But the costing rested on the assumption that state and territory governments would also agree to waive stamp duty, which the PBO warned was unlikely to occur. The Victorian Greens are also calling for more homes to be sold than the federal plan, in which 75% would be rentals. Last week Jacinta Allan made several announcements designed to stimulate development in Melbourne\u2019s inner suburbs, with the most significant being a plan to densify 50 areas near train and tram stations. Allan on Thursday vowed to be \u201cthe premier who gets millennials into homes\u201d and described both the Liberals and Greens as \u201cblockers\u201d. The Victorian Greens are calling on the state government to enter the property development game, saying Labor\u2019s plan to get more millennials into the housing market will not work without such an intervention. In response to a series of housing announcements made last week by the premier, Jacinta Allan, the minor party is calling on the government to set up a \u201cpublic builder\u201d to construct affordable homes. Under the Green\u2019s plan, a state-owned developer would build 200,000 homes over the next 20 years and sell half for just 5% above the cost of construction. The remainder would be rented out for a maximum of 25% of household income. Distinct from public housing, the homes would be available for the wider public to buy or rent, though the party wants households on the social housing waitlist to be prioritised for rentals. They say the homes would be located near train stations and in regional areas and would be funded initially through \u201ctaxing big corporations\u201d, revenue collected from the state\u2019s vacant property and short-stay taxes, and a contribution from the commonwealth. Thank you Martin Farrer for kicking off the blog this morning! I\u2019ll be rolling your live news updates throughout the day \u2013 if you see anything you don\u2019t want us to miss, shoot it my way on X (formerly Twitter) @At_Raf Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth property markets performing better than other capital cities More on that housing price story from AAP: Domain\u2019s Nicola Powell said apartments performing better than houses in cities such as Sydney and Melbourne was evidence of stretched affordability and buyers seeking out the less expensive options. Inflation and wage growth \u2013 robust but not enough to keep up with the housing market \u2013 was weighing on demand, along with high interest rates clipping borrowing capacity. Powell said buyers were \u201cwaiting on the sidelines\u201d for firmer signals on interest rate moves. In the September quarter, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth continued to do better than other capital city property markets. House prices in Adelaide gained 4.2%, with 3.1% in Perth and 1.5% in Brisbane. Homebuyer budgets are finding a ceiling, slowing the pace of property price growth, Australian Associated Press reports. Domain\u2019s chief of research and economics, Nicola Powell, says the housing market appears to be shifting in favour of buyers: Supply is rising, days on the market are lengthening, discounting is also increasing. Everything points to a slowdown overall, and it\u2019s very possible that we could see a dip in price even over the final quarter of this year, on that aggregate capital city level. Prices were still going up in the three months to September. Domain recorded 0.8% growth in the quarter and slightly more for units, with both finding record highs. But prices are not rising as fast, with the pace of quarterly house prices in Sydney and Perth growing half as quickly as in the previous quarter. Anthony Albanese is due to announce two more clean energy-related projects in NSW and Victoria aimed at transitioning Australia\u2019s energy production and workforce away from fossil fuels. Albanese will announce federal funding for both projects under his government\u2019s Future Made in Australia scheme and contrast them with the Coalition\u2019s plans to develop nuclear power stations at seven sites around Australia if it wins office. Albanese will travel to the NSW Hunter region on Tuesday to announce a new $60m \u201cnet zero manufacturing centre of excellence\u201d at a Tafe campus in Newcastle, to be jointly funded with the NSW government. The centre will develop a new apprenticeship model focused on the skills required for modern, clean-energy manufacturing, training workers for jobs in the Hunter-Central Coast renewable energy zone. He will then travel to Wodonga in Victoria to announce a $17m federal funding injection for the nation\u2019s first concentrated solar thermal heat plant, expanding the application of solar power beyond electricity to heat generation. The government says the project will involve an 18 megawatt thermal plant with up to 10 hours\u2019 storage capacity which it says will halve the use of gas where it is installed and generate 80 jobs during construction. He will say: Creating jobs, investing in our regions, reducing emissions and bringing down power prices \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re delivering. Renewable energy is bringing new jobs and new industry across our country, including regional Australia. He is expected to demand again that opposition leader, Peter Dutton, reveal the costings for his nuclear-energy plans. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer with the best of the overnight stories before Rafqa Touma picks up the slack. Australian schools have an \u201curgent need\u201d for support services to help pupils at risk of stigma, discrimination and violence as a major survey indicates that more than 10% are LGBTQ+ or gender-diverse. More than one in 10 Australian teenagers in the survey identified as gay, bisexual, pansexual or asexual, with 3.3% of the more than 6,000 questioned identifying as gender-diverse. The Victorian Greens are calling on the state government to enter the property development game, saying Labor\u2019s plan to get more millennials into the housing market will not work without such an intervention. We\u2019ll have a full post coming up and we also have an op-ed piece today from housing policy expert Peter Mares who argues that only government intervention can redirect development to the kind of \u201cmiddle-density\u201d type needed to solve the crisis. Meanwhile, Domain\u2019s chief economist says the property market is beginning to cool and move in favour of buyers. Research by the property company shows that prices rose in the last quarter by 0.8% but the rate of increase is slowing, with the pace in Sydney and Perth, for example, half as quick as in the previous quarter. More coming up. Anthony Albanese is due to announce two more clean-energy-related projects in NSW and Victoria today, aimed at transitioning Australia\u2019s energy production and workforce away from fossil fuels. Details coming up."

            "title": "The big idea: is nostalgia killing politics? ",
            "date": "2024-10-21T11:30:34Z",
            "content": "The pop culture of past generations weighs like a dark cloud on the youth of today. Teenagers may have their own subcultures but the mainstream is all nostalgia. The big films are sequels, remakes or long-running sagas. The most watched shows on Netflix are 90s sitcoms, or paeans to the past like Stranger Things. The main stage at Glastonbury is full of OAPs performing tribute acts to their youth. The top music story of 2024 is the return of Oasis, a band whose songwriter was born during the Wilson administration. This is all a function of the internet, which makes the past ever-present in easily accessible form, leaving little space for the new or innovative. In a slightly more subtle way it\u2019s doing the same thing to politics, with more severe consequences than Champagne Supernova being played incessantly on the radio. This is most visible in the decline of the Conservatives, who have essentially become a boomer Facebook group in the guise of a political party. Their leadership contest has already seen calls for the return of grammar schools (most of which closed before anyone under the age of 60 could have attended one) as well as the standard attacks on \u201cmilitant trade union barons\u201d, as if they were still all bolshie miners rather than mostly female graduates in the public sector. At party conference, leadership hopeful Kemi Badenoch suggested that statutory maternity pay (introduced in 1987) and the minimum wage (1999) were among the innovations putting an undue burden on businesses. Most of all there is the worship of St Margaret, with the leadership candidates falling over each other in their haste to condemn Keir Starmer for moving her portrait from one room in Downing Street to another, and Robert Jenrick revealing his daughter\u2019s middle name is Thatcher. It\u2019s not quite as bad as the 2022 contest, when Liz Truss literally dressed up as the former prime minister while recreating her most famous photoshoots, but it\u2019s not far off. This doesn\u2019t just matter because of the fusty vibes it gives the party but because they\u2019re tied to supporting a rhetorical agenda that no longer makes sense. The political challenges of the future lie around climate change, AI and the rising cost of public services. The Conservatives are talking about grammar schools, right to buy, and bringing back national service. It feels like we\u2019re only a speech or two away from calling for the return of \u201cproper binmen\u201d, as per the nostalgia-drenched Facebook meme. It\u2019s hardly surprising, given all this, that, according to the pollster YouGov, just 13% of people under the age of 50 voted Tory at the election, compared with 42% of pensioners. This age split is not typical: as recently as 2015 the party got 34% among under-50s. It\u2019s hard to see how they can recover without breaking free from this backwards-looking politics, but they daren\u2019t risk alienating their remaining base, who are still voting for them because they remember the winter of discontent. Labour aren\u2019t, yet, as badly trapped by the past, and did much better with younger voters (though they didn\u2019t win a majority of votes in any age group). But they are at risk of turning Tony Blair into their own Thatcher-like totem. Starmer\u2019s policy agenda has important differences from Blair\u2019s. For a start it\u2019s more statist, as we can see with the renationalisation of the railway lines that aren\u2019t already back in public ownership, and Ed Miliband\u2019s creation of the state-owned GB Energy. The prime minister\u2019s personal politics are to the left of his predecessor\u2019s. But Starmer made sure to get Blair\u2019s personal blessing at a conference held by the latter\u2019s thinktank before the election, and has subsequently hired a load of Blair-era advisers. His effective number two in Downing Street is Pat McFadden, who was Blair\u2019s political secretary. His director of communications, Matthew Doyle, was the deputy director under Blair. His new \u201cadviser on effective delivery\u201d, Michael Barber, made his name running Blair\u2019s delivery unit. A whole swathe of New Labour ministers from Alan Milburn to Jacqui Smith have been brought back as advisers or Lords ministers. There is a logic to staffing up an inexperienced team with those who served Labour\u2019s most electorally successful leader. Yet, as with the Tories, the challenges of today are not the same as 1997. Perhaps the most telling example, so far, of the dangers of using an old playbook, was the decision to rule out raising any of the main taxes during the election. This is seen as a critical moment in Blair\u2019s success. But in 1997 there was strong growth that allowed money to be put into public services without tax rises. That isn\u2019t true now, and so the government have found themselves in a trap that is at least partly of their own making. It isn\u2019t possible to avoid tax increases, maintain rules around borrowing, and avoid a further wave of austerity. Something has to give. Likewise, when it comes to the NHS, it\u2019s all very well bringing back people like Milburn and Wes Streeting\u2019s adviser Paul Corrigan who ran New Labour\u2019s reform programme, but they did so under completely different circumstances, with whopping annual spending increases and more experienced staff. The approach to reform today will, by necessity, have to look very different. The need to do things differently doesn\u2019t just apply to policy, but to the way government communicates. Alastair Campbell revolutionised \u201cspin\u201d in the 1990s. His approach worked back in the pre-internet days but is far less effective now. Sticking out bad news at 7.30pm on a Friday night was a cynical but effective move when newspapers and BBC bulletins were the main ways voters got information, but today it just looks desperate, and doesn\u2019t make much difference to how much coverage the story gets. Even the phrases that only politicians use \u2013 like \u201cI\u2019ll take no lectures from\u201d or \u201chard-working families up and down the country\u201d \u2013 now seem archaic. Our most transformative prime ministers, for good or ill, are those who have departed from a stale consensus and tried a different approach. Thatcher and Blair themselves constantly demanded a break with the failures of the past, including those for which their own side were responsible. If today\u2019s politicians want to deal with the challenges we actually face, they need to stop anxiously conjuring the spirits of the past to their service, and learn to speak a new language. \u2022 Sam Freedman is the author of Failed State: Why Nothing Works and How We Fix It (Macmillan).

            "title": "Political violence in US could surge after elections, experts warn",
            "date": "2024-10-31T12:00:18Z",
            "content": "There could be a potential surge in political violence following the upcoming US election, and pro-Trump rightwing vigilante \u201cpoll watchers\u201d might surveil ballot drop boxes as Americans cast their votes, experts warned this week. A new report from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) highlighted alarming trends in online chatter, mirroring patterns observed in the lead-up to the 2020 election and the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Meanwhile, Princeton\u2019s Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI), issued a fact sheet with recommendations for dealing with conspiracy-minded monitoring groups like True the Vote, which spread false narratives in 2020 alleging that Democrats had sent paid \u201cmules\u201d to drop boxes with thousands of illegal votes in order to steal the election from Donald Trump. The twin reports highlighted risks to the elections and strategies for mitigating them, at a time when one man has been charged over armed attacks on a Democratic party office, and police in Oregon and Washington are investigating suspected arson attacks on ballot boxes in which some ballots were destroyed. The GPAHE report\u2019s warning is based on a rise in violent chatter on platforms known for hosting extremist content, including Telegram, Gab, Communities.win, and some communities across the decentralized social media network known as the Fediverse. The report shows that while the overall volume of messages on these platforms may be lower than in 2020, the sharp rise in violent rhetoric follows a pattern set ahead of the 2020 election. For example, in October, violent rhetoric related to election denialism increased by 317% on Telegram, 105% on Gab, 25% on communities.win, and 75% across a selection of Fediverse communities. The report says that across these platforms, users are indulging in violent rhetoric linked to election denialism. Some posts on Telegram this year have used election denialism to justify calls for violence, including calls for an \u201cinevitable civil war\u201d and urging users to \u201cshoot to kill any illegal voters\u201d. Don\u2019t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts On Gab, users have threatened perceived election fraudsters with treason charges, calling for \u201cfiring squads\u201d or \u201cthe rope\u201d, according to the report. It notes calls on the platform for \u201cpublic executions for all voter fraud\u201d and the shooting of elected officials labeled as \u201ctraitors\u201d, along with copious antisemitic conspiracy theories. Communities.win is a collection of forums that includes The_Donald, which was banned from Reddit for hate speech in 2020. According to the GPAHE report, users there have fantasized about a civil war in recent weeks, claiming that Democrats will not relinquish power and that a violent uprising is necessary for a \u201cGreat Awakening\u201d, a concept previously popularised by the QAnon conspiracy movement. In Fediverse communities, users have shared posts blaming the \u201cliberal media\u201d for inciting a \u201cwar\u201d and encouraging violence against perceived political opponents. GPAHE\u2019s report warns that \u201cignoring these worrying trends will only risk further acts of violence related to election denialism and anti-democratic sentiment\u201d. Heidi Beirich, GPAHE\u2019s co-founder, said: \u201cOur report shows that, when compared to violent election denial chatter in 2020, the numbers have been lower so far this year, but they are quickly rising as we approach election day.\u201d She added that \u201cunmoderated fringe sites\u201d were seeing \u201crising numbers of comments with violent political rhetoric \u201c and \u201cposts targeting election workers with violence, a sign that real world activity could escalate\u201d. BDI, meanwhile, warns against complacency after 2022, when vigilante poll watchers mostly stayed away from drop boxes, despite months of conspiracy-minded chatter about Democrats and the \u201cdeep state\u201d stealing mid-term elections from Republicans. According to the fact sheet, BDI data shows that in 2022, there were 44 incidents of physical monitoring at fewer than 20 drop box locations out of an estimated 13,000 active sites nationwide. That is, only 0.1% of drop boxes around the country were subject to monitoring activity. It warns, however, that threats of monitoring activity have resurfaced online during the 2024 campaign, and states including Arizona and Wisconsin have seen legal decisions that reduce restrictions on vigilante monitoring, opening the way for possible voter intimidation. The Guardian reported this week on an Arizona poll-watching group which has been casting doubt on the election result ahead of time, with members\u2019 paranoia being fueled by rightwing influencers and media outlets. The fact sheet makes a series of recommendations to poll workers ahead of the vote on ways to head off political violence, including de-escalation techniques; research to identify threats; communicating accurate information on elections; and community outreach and dialogue on election security. The BDI report says: \u201cThese steps can improve the US political violence early warning infrastructure and help prevent the amplification of rumors, false claims, and unfounded threat messaging aimed at suppressing voter turnout in targeted communities\u201d."

            "date": "2024-10-02T08:00:34Z",
            "content": "There was a strange feeling as the vice-presidential debate got under way in the CBS News studios on Tuesday night that only intensified as 90 minutes of detailed policy discussion unfolded: was the United States in danger of regaining its sanity? After weeks and months of being assailed by Donald Trump\u2019s dystopian evocation of a country on the verge of self-destruction, amplified by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019s dire warnings of democracy in peril, here was something very different. The two vice-presidential nominees were embracing that most endangered of American political species: agreement. \u201cTim, I actually think I agree with you,\u201d said JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, addressing his opposite number Tim Walz during the discussion on immigration. \u201cMuch of what the senator said right there, I\u2019m in agreement with him,\u201d said Walz, the Minnesota governor and Democratic nominee, as they turned to trade policy. It wasn\u2019t true, of course. The two men were no closer to agreement than their bosses, who in their own presidential debate last month showed themselves to be worlds apart. But on Tuesday it was as if the CBS News studio in midtown Manhattan had been transported back to a prelapsarian \u2013 or at least, pre-Maga \u2013 times. To an era when politicians could be civil, and to get on you didn\u2019t have to castigate your opponent as an enemy of the people. For Vance the metamorphosis was especially striking. He is, after all, running mate to the architect of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d. For his own part, the senator from Ohio has spread malicious untruths about legally resident Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating people\u2019s cats and dogs. Not to mention that he\u2019s the \u201cchildless cat-ladies\u201d guy. An unrecognisable Vance emerged on the New York stage. This one listened respectfully to his debating partner, spoke in whole and largely measured sentences, and went so far as to admit his own fallibility \u2013 three qualities that the former president rarely emulates. Vance had reason to present himself differently from Trump, perhaps. At 40, to Trump\u2019s 78, he has the future to think about \u2013 his own future. But his affable demeanor was also artifice. When it came to the content of what he said, the Republican vice-presidential nominee was as economical with the truth as his overseer. He lied with abandon, in fact. He just did it with a silken tongue. He talked about the vice-president presiding over an \u201copen border\u201d with Mexico when numbers of border-crossers are actually at a four-year low. He claimed he had not supported a national abortion ban \u2013 oh yes he did, repeatedly during his 2022 senatorial race. On the Middle East crisis, he accused the \u201cKamala Harris administration\u201d of handing Iran $100bn in the form of unfrozen assets \u2013 not true. It was $55bn, and it was negotiated under Barack Obama. Perhaps most egregiously, he said Trump had \u201csalvaged\u201d the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Obama\u2019s wildly popular healthcare insurance scheme commonly known as Obamacare. \u201cSalvaged\u201d was an interesting choice of word to apply to Trump, who tried 60 times to destroy the ACA without offering any alternative. Yet it would have taken an attentive viewer to see behind Vance\u2019s smooth comportment to the lies he was purveying. The former tech investor and bestselling author of Hillbilly Elegy looked comfortable on stage and in his own skin, presenting himself as the reasonable Trump, a Maga lion in sheep\u2019s clothing. Walz by contrast had moments in which he came across as tense and uneasy, the pre-debate nerves that had been reported by CNN appearing to have been genuine. While Vance beamed his piercingly blue eyes direct to camera, the Minnesota governor frequently looked down at his notes. The folksy, aw-shucks \u201cCoach Walz\u201d who has taken the US by storm since he was plucked out of Minnesota obscurity to be Harris\u2019s running mate was largely absent. He stumbled on occasion, garbling his words to refer to having become \u201cfriends\u201d with school shooters rather than their victims\u2019 families. And he mishandled a question about why he had wrongly claimed to have visited China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, woodenly trying to dodge the issue by calling himself a \u201cknucklehead\u201d. But when push came to shove, Walz came through. On the subjects that matter most to Harris in her bid to become the first female president, and the first woman of color in the Oval Office, he hit Vance hard \u2013 civilly, but hard. On abortion he followed his running mate\u2019s lead and spoke movingly about the personal impact of Trump\u2019s effective evisceration of Roe v Wade. He invoked the story of Amber Thurman, who died as she traveled in search of reproductive care from Georgia to North Carolina. That even extracted one of the most surprising \u201cI agree\u201d remarks of the evening from the staunchly anti-abortion Vance: \u201cGovernor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive \u2026 and I certainly wish that she was.\u201d There was only one point in the evening when the kid gloves came off, and the cod display of gentility was discarded by both parties. It came when Vance had the audacity to claim \u2013 silkenly, naturally \u2013 that Harris\u2019s attempts to \u201ccensor\u201d misinformation in public discourse posed a far greater threat to democracy than Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election on January 6. \u201cTim, I\u2019m focused on the future,\u201d Vance deflected when Walz asked him directly whether Trump had lost that contest. \u201cThat is a damning non-answer,\u201d the Democrat shot back, his face pained. In the last analysis, both men were only there playing the role of sidekick. They may have raised hopes that civility could make a comeback to US politics, but let Trump have the last word. \u201cWalz was a Low IQ Disaster - Very much like Kamala,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social site shortly after the debate had ended. And just like that, it was business as usual."

            "title": "The US election interference row tells us this: Starmer\u2019s political compass urgently needs resetting | Martin Kettle",
            "date": "2024-10-25T05:00:11Z",
            "content": "Gordon Brown famously brought his moral compass to the prime ministership. Boris Johnson, notoriously, did not. Under Keir Starmer, there is a moral compass in Downing Street once more. But something else has gone missing. Too often, Labour now seems to lack not a moral compass, but a fully functioning political one. It has never needed one more than it does today. Recent history suggests that any government\u2019s political compass is a powerful embodiment of its survival instinct. The compass addresses the dangers, as well as the attractions, of a course of action. It recognises that the way an action will be portrayed is a reality as powerful as the intention behind it. It prioritises grip, speed and proactive flair, as well as discipline about priorities. The most recent evidence that Labour\u2019s political compass has been lost is in the unnecessary and overwrought row about its role in the US election. Here, once again, Labour has allowed its actions to be defined by its critics. As such, it fits a pattern: the failure to spot the danger in the freebies-for-ministers revelations; the tangled rise and fall of Sue Gray; the peremptory cull of winter fuel payments. With a good political compass, all of these could have been avoided. The US election row shows how easily a small fumble can become a needlessly damaging challenge. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are already running massively well-funded campaign leviathans. They don\u2019t need Labour\u2019s assistance. But a formal Labour intervention would also be foolish, potentially embarrassing for Harris, and a propaganda gift for Trump. No one in the Labour chain of command seems to have spotted the dangers. Where was Labour\u2019s political acumen when it was needed? It is not clear whether Labour Harris campaigners were given advance legal advice about the rules on foreign involvement in US elections. Labour says the volunteers have not been paid or supported in other ways. The Trump campaign alleges they may have. The now withdrawn comment on LinkedIn by Labour\u2019s head of operations Sofia Patel that \u201cwe will sort your housing\u201d could imply some party subsidy. That Patel is a full-time Labour official could arguably be read as direct Labour involvement too. But here\u2019s the point. Where were Labour\u2019s political antennae in all this? For the last few weeks, perhaps like some of you, I have been bombarded with US emails asking me to donate to the Harris campaign. And, yes, part of me wants to do so. But, as a foreign national, I would be committing a federal offence by donating, and the Harris campaign would be doing the same by accepting one. So I cheer from the sidelines and stay within the rules. It would be surprising if nobody at the Labour party stopped to ask themselves similar questions. But they should have done. That\u2019s because Labour\u2019s responsibility goes beyond not breaking any laws. It extends to the prime minister\u2019s, the party\u2019s and the country\u2019s relations with Trump if he is elected next month. Here, in particular, is where an embarrassment should have been scrupulously avoided. Many readers will be bridling at all this. They will say Nigel Farage\u2019s US campaigning is far bigger but gets far less scrutiny. Or that the rightwing press is out to discredit anything that Labour does. Or that nothing Labour may do is remotely as dangerous as the Russian or Chinese tampering with western elections. They might go further, by saying that all UK parties get involved in US politics a bit, as ex-Tory minister Robert Buckland has acknowledged, so it is wrong to single out Labour. Or that it\u2019s useful for political professionals to get a close-up view of the latest campaign techniques in other countries. Perhaps, above all, they will say that the defeat of Donald Trump is so important that it has to be our business too. Some will also point out that this row is a textbook dead-cat manoeuvre. Throw a dead cat on the table and everyone starts obsessing about the new distraction, not something really important. On Wednesday, the environment secretary Steve Reed went on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme intending to talk about the shambolic state of the water industry, but had to talk about Labour and Trump first. Substance was ousted by marginalia. There is some truth in all of these objections. But they all miss the main one. The point is that Labour is in government. The UK and the US are allies. Allies don\u2019t mess in one another\u2019s elections. If they did, the voters would be angry, legitimately so. Imagine the indignation here if a rich megalomaniac offered UK voters the kind of rewards Elon Musk is currently deploying in Pennsylvania and other swing states. It could happen, and the UK government should look at the relevant law to make sure it does not. Getting involved in any foreign election puts the national interest on the line. Sensible governments with a strong sense of self-preservation don\u2019t mess with that. Labour has rightly tried to build a relationship with Trump, as any UK government always would. It may not work \u2013 and probably will not \u2013 but the national interest requires them to try. Stumbling into a row about a few Labour volunteers is just bad politics, even though most UK citizens want Trump to lose. Labour should not have done it. It is hard to dispute in principle that Labour activists, even employees, with an interest in US politics should be able to volunteer and learn on the campaign trail. Rightly or wrongly, many Labour people are always keen to plug themselves into a Democratic party campaign. Similarly, quite a few Tories are plugged into the Republicans. You can, even so, criticise this for being too starry-eyed and naive. There\u2019s a touch of West Wing envy in the fan trek that UK politicos make across the Atlantic every four years. Yet the longer I myself worked in the US, which I did for four years, the clearer I became that the more you know about US politics, the more foreign it feels. European countries offer just as many practical lessons. But German politics or Irish politics are not glamorous. In the end, the US election involvement row, along with the other rows that preceded it, are telling Labour something that still requires corrective action. Given how obvious it was for so long that Labour would win in 2024, it has proved remarkably badly prepared for government. This needs tackling before the next avoidable stumble occurs. Starmer is now at risk of allowing himself to be defined in the long term by stumbles over short-term issues that he considers marginal. This may well be an unfair outcome, but it is a real possibility. He cannot afford much more of it. A political compass would be telling him this. Everything now depends on trusting the compass unerringly over the budget next week. It will be a defining test.

            "title": "Jimmy Carter becomes the first former US president to turn 100",
            "date": "2024-10-02T05:56:45Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden led congratulations on Tuesday to Jimmy Carter on his 100th birthday, a milestone that makes Carter the first former US president to become a centenarian. Carter entered hospice care at his home in Plains, Georgia, 19 months ago. His grandson, Jason Carter, has said the former president is eager to cast his ballot for Kamala Harris, a fellow Democrat, in the presidential election. The White House paid tribute with a display of big lettering declaring \u201cHappy Birthday President Carter\u201d and the number 100 outside the north portico. Carter has asked Biden to eulogise him at his state funeral when the time comes. In a statement Biden, 81, who was the first sitting senator to endorse Carter\u2019s 1976 election campaign, said his predecessor has always been \u201ca moral force for our nation and the world\u201d. He added: \u201cYour hopeful vision of our country, your commitment to a better world, and your unwavering belief in the power of human goodness continues to be a guiding light for all of us.\u201d Barack Obama posted a video message on the social media platform X that said: \u201cHappy 100th birthday, President Carter! Thank you for your friendship, your fundamental decency, and your incredible acts of service through the @CarterCenter. Michelle and I are grateful for all you\u2019ve done for this country.\u201d About 25 family members filled Carter\u2019s home on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, enjoying cupcakes on the front lawn while second world war planes flew over in his honour. Chip Carter said his father\u2019s next goal is to make it to election day. \u201cHe\u2019s plugged in,\u201d Chip told the AP. \u201cI asked him two months ago if he was trying to live to be 100 and he said, no, I\u2019m trying to live to vote for Kamala Harris.\u201d Tributes flowed all day. Former president Bill Clinton tweeted: \u201cJimmy Carter\u2019s long, good life is a testament to love, work, and faith, and an enduring beacon to all people working to make better tomorrows. Happy 100th birthday, Mr. President.\u201d Jonathan Alter, author of the biography His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life, told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful to see that he is alive for the reassessment that I and others attempted almost a decade ago when I started this project. I wanted to contribute to a better understanding of who he is and what he accomplished. He\u2019s lived long enough to see that he\u2019s now appreciated.\u201d Alter added: \u201cAs journalists we judge politicians by how they\u2019re doing politically, how popular they are, but as historians we have a different responsibility and that is to judge them by how they changed the country and the world. And by that latter standard, he\u2019s getting the revival that we all hoped. It\u2019s nice to see and great he\u2019s lived to see it.\u201d Carter, who has lived longer than any US president in history, served a single term from January 1977 to January 1981 and was beleaguered by high inflation and the Iran hostage crisis. But more recently historians have argued that his record deserves reappraisal and he was ahead of his time in calling for action to tackle the climate crisis. His decades of humanitarian work after leaving office, including the promotion of human rights and alleviating poverty in countries around the world, earned him the Nobel peace prize in 2002. His birthday is being marked by the broadcast of a tribute concert by stars of country, rock and gospel music recorded at Atlanta\u2019s Fox Theatre last month. The concert raised more than $1m towards the international programme of the Carter Center, which he founded with his wife, Rosalynn Carter. The former president plans to tune in to the concert on Georgia Public Broadcasting, according to his grandson Jason Carter. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter were married for 77 years. Rosalynn Carter died in November last year and the former president was last seen in public at his wife\u2019s funeral, where he used a wheelchair and appeared frail. He has been diagnosed with cancer and other health issues, and decided to end medical intervention and enter hospice care in February 2023. Carter is expected to mark his birthday in the same one-storey home that he and Rosalynn built in the early 1960s \u2013 before his first election to the Georgia state senate. He taught Sunday school at his hometown Baptist church in Plains until a few years ago. Jason Carter, who is chair of the Carter Center governing board, told the Associated Press: \u201cNot everybody gets 100 years on this earth, and when somebody does, and when they use that time to do so much good for so many people, it\u2019s worth celebrating. \u201cThese last few months, 19 months, now that he\u2019s been in hospice, it\u2019s been a chance for our family to reflect and then for the rest of the country and the world to really reflect on him. That\u2019s been a really gratifying time.\u201d Early voting in Georgia begins on 15 October, two weeks into Carter\u2019s 101st year. Jason Carter added: \u201cWhen we started asking him about his 100th birthday, he said he was excited to vote for Kamala Harris.\u201d The Carters have worked with the non-profit group Habitat for Humanity International since the 1980s, and the ex-president has regularly joined other volunteers to help build homes for people affected by poverty or disasters. This week, to mark Carter\u2019s birthday, scores of Habitat volunteers, including country music stars Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, will build 30 homes in St Paul, Minnesota. Jonathan Reckford, Habitat\u2019s chief executive officer, said: \u201cThe Jimmy &amp; Rosalynn Carter Work Project serves not only as a way to honor the Carters\u2019 legacy, but also as a reminder of what is possible when people from all walks come together to work toward one common goal.\u201d"

            "content": "Good morning. Kamala Harris said that the US was \u201cabsolutely\u201d ready for a female president, insisting that voters cared about candidates\u2019 policies, not their gender. The vice-president\u2019s statement came during an interview with NBC News\u2019s Hallie Jackson, who asked if she thought voters were ready for a woman, and a woman of color, to lead the country. Harris responded: \u201cAbsolutely. Absolutely.\u201d \u201cIn terms of every walk of life of our country,\u201d Harris said, \u201cpart of what is important in this election is really, not really turning the page \u2013 closing a chapter, on an era that suggests that Americans are divided.\u201d She added that the overwhelming majority have more in common \u201cthan what separates us\u201d. What else did Harris say? She reiterated that she represented a break with the Biden administration, and said she was aware that Trump might try to thwart the election results. Trump alleges election meddling by UK Labour party volunteer door-knockers Citing the American revolution while misspelling Britain as \u201cBritian\u201d, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has filed a remarkable complaint against UK Labour, accusing it of election interference. It alleged that Labour recruited and sent party members to campaign for Harris in key battleground states, and sought to paint parallels with the American revolution. \u201cWhen representatives of the British government previously sought to go door-to-door in America, it did not end well for them,\u201d the letter from Trump\u2019s legal team to the Federal Election Commission in Washington says. The claims were rejected by the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who said party officials volunteering for Harris were \u201cdoing it in their spare time\u201d and not in a Labour capacity. Starmer told reporters that this was nothing new: \u201cThe Labour party \u2026 volunteers, have gone over pretty much every election. They\u2019re doing it in their spare time, they\u2019re doing it as volunteers, they\u2019re staying, I think, with other volunteers over there.\u201d If Trump wins, will this harm relations between the UK and US? Starmer has insisted it won\u2019t \u2013 that he has a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with Trump that would not be jeopardised by the complaint. With two weeks to go, what else is going on in the Trump campaign?

Israel confirms killing of Hezbollah\u2019s presumed next leader Israel has confirmed that it killed Hashem Safieddine, the presumed next leader of Hezbollah, in an airstrike on southern Beirut three weeks ago. Israel also killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last month. Safieddine was the head of Hezbollah\u2019s highest political decision-making body, the executive council, and had reportedly been chosen as Nasrallah\u2019s successor some years ago. The confirmation means that only Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s deputy secretary general, remains alive among the group\u2019s public-facing senior leadership. Who will lead Hezbollah? Israel says the strike that killed Safieddine also killed another 25 Hezbollah leaders. It remains unknown who will assume the role. What is the latest from Gaza? Israel\u2019s siege of northern Gaza means Palestinians there \u201care rapidly exhausting all available means for their survival\u201d, the UN\u2019s humanitarian office warned.

            "content": "The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) has declined to endorse a candidate ahead of next month\u2019s US presidential election, despite efforts by both the Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigns to court the union. \u201cThis decision, which we took very seriously, is the best way to preserve and strengthen our unity,\u201d the IAFF said in a statement. The union, which has almost 350,000 members, was a key part of the coalition built by Joe Biden \u2013 and the first union to back the president\u2019s run for election in 2020. It is the second leading trade union to refrain from endorsing either Harris or Trump as tens of millions of Americans prepare to cast their votes. The Teamsters International, a US transportation workers union that represents more than 1.3 million workers, also announced it would not back a candidate. Both campaigns had sought the IAFF\u2019s support, with Tim Walz, Harris\u2019s running mate, and JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, addressing the union\u2019s convention in August. Walz claimed in his speech that he had signed \u201cthe most comprehensive firefighter legislation in the nation\u201d as governor of Minnesota. Vance, who grappled with boos from the audience, claimed that he and Trump represented a \u201cnew kind of Republican party\u201d and would \u201cnever stop fighting\u201d for first responders. On Thursday, the IAFF said its executive board had voted by a margin of 1.2% to not endorse a presidential candidate. \u201cWe encourage our members \u2013 and all eligible voters \u2013 to get out and make their voices heard in the upcoming election,\u201d said Edward Kelly, the union\u2019s president. It is not the first time the IAFF has refrained from backing a candidate. While it endorsed Barack Obama in 2008, it reportedly shelved plans to publicly support Hillary Clinton, the Democrat presidential candidate in 2016."

The vice-president\u2019s statement came during an interview with NBC News\u2019s Hallie Jackson, who asked whether she thought the country was ready for a woman, and a woman of color, to be in the Oval Office. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cIn terms of every walk of life of our country,\u201d Harris said, \u201cpart of what is important in this election is really, not really turning the page \u2013 closing a chapter, on an era that suggests that Americans are divided. \u201cThe vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and what the American people want in their president is a president for all Americans,\u201d she said. Harris was asked why she hasn\u2019t leaned into the historic nature of her candidacy \u2013 that she is a woman of color running for the presidency. \u201cI\u2019m clearly a woman. I don\u2019t need to point that out to anyone,\u201d Harris said with a laugh. \u201cThe point that most people really care about is: can you do the job, and do you have a plan to actually focus on them?\u201d \u201cThat is why I spend the majority of my time listening and then addressing the concerns, the challenges, the dreams, the ambitions and the aspirations of the American people,\u201d Harris continued, saying that Americans deserve a president focused on them, \u201cas opposed to a Donald Trump, who is constantly focused on himself\u201d. Harris also said she was aware that Donald Trump might potentially try thwarting the presidential election results, noting that her team \u201cwill deal with election night and the days after as they come\u201d. Harris said that she is focused on campaigning over the next two weeks while noting \u201cwe have the resources and the expertise and the focus\u201d on any potential threats to election results. Jackson noted that Trump declared victory before all the votes were tallied in 2020. Trump, who has refused to accept the 2020 election results and claimed the race was stolen, has been stoking fears with unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud in the 2024 cycle. \u201cThis is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo the free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people who incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol, and 140 law enforcement officers were attacked, some who were killed. This is a serious matter,\u201d Harris told Jackson. Trump supporters on 6 January 2021 stormed the US Capitol in an effort to prevent certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. That day, four people died at the Capitol and a police officer working during the insurrection died several days later; four other police officers posted at the building on 6 January 2021 committed suicide, according to CBS News. \u201cThe American people are, at this point, two weeks out, being presented with a very, very serious decision about what will be the future of our country,\u201d Harris also said. Jackson also asked about voters\u2019 concerns about the economy, noting that many blame the US president for rising prices. Harris said her policies \u201cwill not be a continuation of the Biden administration\u201d and with inflation, \u201cI bring my own experiences, my own ideas to it.\u201d Jackson noted that if Harris won, her victory might coincide with Republican control of Congress, which would thwart protecting abortion at the national level. \u201cWhat concessions would be on the table?\u201d Jackson asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be making concessions when we\u2019re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body,\u201d Harris said. Harris said she would not \u201cget into those hypotheticals\u201d when asked if a pardon might be on the table for Trump. \u201cI\u2019m focused on the next 14 days.\u201d Harris was pressed on the pardon topic, asked if she thought it could help the country move forward together and be less divisive. \u201cLet me tell you what\u2019s going to help us move on: I get elected to president of the United States.\u201d"

            "content": "The delicate dance by Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign to simultaneously show deference to Joe Biden, separate herself from his presidency and thwart his ambition to campaign for her has reached a critical juncture as the 2024 election approaches its climax. The steps of the dance, which has been ongoing since Harris assumed the Democratic party nomination in August and involves efforts to shield the 81-year-old president\u2019s ego and feelings, became even more leaden overnight on Tuesday after Biden appeared to call supporters of Donald Trump \u201cgarbage\u201d. Though he clarified that he didn\u2019t mean Trump supporters but rather their attitude towards Latinos (the official transcript had Biden saying, \u201cThe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter\u2019s \u2013 his \u2013 his \u2013 his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American\u201d), the comment nevertheless set off echoes of Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d put-down of a section of Trump\u2019s supporters in 2016. In doing so, it threatened to at least partly undo the Republican campaign\u2019s self-inflicted damage caused by a guest at the Trump rally on Sunday who described Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d, as well as a string of racist remarks about Latinos, Black people and Jews. Trump\u2019s campaign immediately sought to distance itself from Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s remarks and to repair any loss of support in the critical 222 Corridor in Pennsylvania, which gets its name from route 222. For the Latino community, it is more than that. The regions of Easton, Bethlehem, Allentown, Lancaster, Lebanon, York, Harrisburg and Gettysburg and its surroundings are home to more than 50% of the state\u2019s total Latino population. Trump implausibly claimed to the Fox News primetime anchor Sean Hannity that he had \u201cno idea\u201d who Hinchcliffe was (\u201cSomebody said there was a comedian that joked about Puerto Rico or something\u201d), despite the fact he was booked at Trump\u2019s signature rally, that Hinchcliffe\u2019s podcast Kill Tony has a huge fanbase among Trump supporters, and that the rally organizers admitted they vetted each of the guests\u2019 speeches. But Biden\u2019s latest incident of apparently misspeaking \u2013 last week he said of Trump, \u201cWe got to lock him up,\u201d before immediately adding, \u201cPolitically lock him up\u201d \u2013 may seal the deal when it comes to Harris\u2019s willingness to allow Biden to campaign for her. Harris found herself having to address the latest gaffe on the the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday, where she noted that Biden had \u201cclarified his comments\u201d, and added: \u201cI strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.\u201d Asked if the incident could increase the country\u2019s political divisiveness ahead of the elections, Harris said: \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear with the American public \u2013 I respect the challenges that people face, I respect the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.\u201d While Biden\u2019s offers to join her, Axios reported, have for some time met with: \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you,\u201d the veteran Democrat strategist Hank Sheinkopf said it was now almost certain that Harris will aim not to be seen with Biden at all. \u201cLet him be president but keep him away from the campaign, because if he shows up it gives Trump a new target to take attention away from Harris,\u201d he said. \u201cSo long as people focus on Harris, they won\u2019t remember Biden, and Trump won\u2019t be able to bring the two together as the Biden-Harris administration.\u201d In public comments, Harris has sought to defend her record as his vice-president, but also to separate herself from Biden \u2013 whose approval rating stands at 39%, the lowest of the past seven US presidents at the end of their terms \u2013 in order to present herself as a candidate of change who will \u201cturn the page\u201d, not just on the Trump era but on the Biden one as well. Harris aides have likened the Biden-Harris relationship to a slow-moving breakup, according to Axios, which quoted an aide as saying: \u201cHe\u2019s a reminder of the last four years, not the new way forward.\u201d Biden\u2019s team have not taken the hint. Biden aides reportedly still believe \u201cScranton Joe\u201d could still help Harris with white, working-class voters in the Rust belt \u2013 and caught her campaign by surprise when they scheduled a Biden campaign stop in Pittsburgh over the weekend. Axios quoted a source saying: \u201cThey\u2019re too much in their feelings\u201d \u2013 and indeed the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, a key figure in Biden\u2019s dramatic withdrawal from a second term bid in July, recently confirmed to the Guardian she had not spoken to him since. The dynamic of president and vice-president is not set. Al Gore refused to let Bill Clinton campaign for him in 2000, a decision widely viewed as detrimental to Gore\u2019s campaign: he narrowly lost to George W Bush. And the Bush campaign strategist Karl Rove predicted back in September that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d Biden would make campaign appearances for Harris, predicting they would let him out on the campaign trail so that his feelings don\u2019t get hurt, but that the approach would be: \u201cLet\u2019s get it done and get it out of the way so we can say we\u2019ve done it.\u201d That deference may now be exhausted. \u201cVice-President Harris is grateful for President Biden\u2019s support and appreciates that he is campaigning for her,\u201d the Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams told the New York Times on Wednesday. It felt like cool understatement. \u201cWhen Biden shows up it creates chaos for her,\u201d said Sheinkopf. \u201cShe has to be focused on herself and the electorate focused on her.\u201d Keeping Biden as far away from Harris as possible is, he says, \u201ccritically important as this comes to an end\u201d."
