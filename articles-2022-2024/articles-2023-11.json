            "date": "2023-11-10T14:09:50Z",
            "content": "Law enforcement officials in the US are searching for the people responsible for sending letters with suspicious substances sent to election offices in at least five states, acts some election officials described as \u201cterrorism\u201d. Election offices in Georgia, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington state all were sent the letters, four of which contained the deadly drug fentanyl, the Associated Press reported. Some of the letters were intercepted before they arrived. The FBI and United States Postal Service are investigating. In Washington, election offices in four counties \u2013 Skagit, Spokane, Pierce and King, which includes Seattle \u2013 were evacuated as workers counted ballots from Tuesday\u2019s election. Two of the letters tested positive for fentanyl. Steve Hobbs, Washington\u2019s Democratic secretary of state, said the letters were \u201cacts of terrorism to threaten our elections\u201d. In Georgia, a letter was sent to Fulton county, the target of many of Donald Trump\u2019s baseless attacks. The Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said at a Thursday news conference the letters were \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d. The episode is the latest event to underscore the intensity of the threats and harassment election officials have faced since the 2020 election. Many of them are choosing to leave the profession, prompting concern that there will be a vacuum of experience in election offices that could be filled by novices or election skeptics, producing errors and delays in 2024. Twelve per cent of election officials started their jobs after the 2020 election, and another 11% say they may leave before 2024, according to an April survey by the Brennan Center for Justice. Forty-five per cent of election officials say they fear for the safety of other election officials ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election. Linda Farmer, the county auditor in Pierce county, released an image of the letter her office received. It said \u201cend elections now\u201d, and contained the antifascist symbol, a pentagram and a progress flag, according to the AP. \u201cStop giving power to the right that they don\u2019t have. We are in charge now and there is no more need for them,\u201d the letter said. Farmer told the Washington Post that a worker opening mail on Wednesday had discovered the letter and alerted her boss, prompting an evacuation of the facility. Farmer said she had later been told the substance contained in the letter was baking soda. The Oregon secretary of state\u2019s office also told the Washington Post that the election office in Lane county, which includes the city of Eugene, had received a letter, but that it would not affect completing the election. The California secretary of state, Shirley Weber, a Democrat, confirmed that letters had been intercepted and an investigation was ongoing. \u201cFederal and state authorities are investigating the incident, but there has been no confirmation that these envelopes contained any toxic substances,\u201d she said in a statement. Cisco Aguilar, Nevada\u2019s Democratic secretary of state, also said in a statement his office was aware of letters sent to offices there. Researchers have found that the risk of harm from accidentally touching fentanyl is low. \u201cThis isn\u2019t anything new \u2013 this is just a different tactic,\u201d David Becker, an election administration expert at the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, told the Washington Post. \u201cIt just represents the difficulty election officials have.\u201d"

            "title": "Groups increasingly use defamation law to ward off US election subversion",
            "date": "2023-11-18T12:00:20Z",
            "content": "Groups seeking to protect US democracy from a renewed threat of subversion in the presidential race next year wield a new weapon against Donald Trump and his accomplices: the little-used law of defamation. Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the My Pillow CEO, Mike Lindell, and conspiracy theorist Dinesh D\u2019Souza are among the individuals named in a spate of high-profile defamation cases targeting those who tried to overturn the 2020 election. Prominent rightwing media outlets such as Fox News and Gateway Pundit are also on the hook. Already the legal pain is mounting. Giuliani has been found liable for defaming two election workers in Georgia whom he falsely accused of criminally miscounting votes in 2020 in favour of Joe Biden. The case will go to trial in December with Giuliani facing possibly swingeing punitive damages. Lindell has notched up millions in legal fees in the $2bn defamation suits that have been brought against him by the voting machine firms Dominion and Smartmatic for falsely saying they rigged the count. His ongoing libel woes follow the April settlement in which Fox agreed to pay Dominion a shattering $788m for broadcasting similar lies. \u201cThis is lawfare,\u201d Lindell protested in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cLawfare hasn\u2019t been used in our country since the late 1700s, and that\u2019s what they are doing.\u201d The lawsuits are designed in part as a strategy of deterrence. Those pressing the libel suits hope that anyone contemplating a renewed assault on next year\u2019s presidential election, in which Trump is once again likely to be the Republican candidate, will look at the potentially devastating costs and think twice. \u201cWe aim to demonstrate that there is no immunity for spreading intentional and reckless lies,\u201d said Rachel Goodman, a lawyer with the non-partisan advocacy group Protect Democracy. \u201cEnsuring accountability for intentional defamation is a crucial part of deterring election subversion from happening again in 2024.\u201d Protect Democracy currently has five defamation suits on the go against individuals and outlets who propagated election denial. The defendants include Giuliani, the Gateway Pundit and the beleaguered undercover video outfit Project Veritas. D\u2019Souza is being sued over his widely derided and debunked movie 2000 Mules. In it he depicted a Black voter in Georgia, Mark Andrews, as a \u201cmule\u201d who illegally deposited ballots in a drop box when in fact he legally delivered the votes of his own family. The fifth case concerns Kari Lake, the Arizona Republican who refused to accept her defeat in that state\u2019s gubernatorial contest last year. The plaintiff is the top election official in Maricopa county, Stephen Richer, whom she falsely accused of injecting 300,000 phoney ballots into the count to swing the race against her. Defamation law has traditionally been sparingly used in the US, given the very high bar that plaintiffs have to meet. Under the 1964 supreme court ruling New York Times Co v Sullivan, they have to be able to show \u201cactual malice\u201d on behalf of the accused. \u201cWhen lawsuits are brought against public figures they can only prevail if they can show that the speaker knew that the statements were false, or very likely false, and made recklessly without further investigation or caring for the truth,\u201d said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA. The first Protect Democracy suit to reach trial will be that against Giuliani. A jury will convene in a federal court in Washington DC on 11 December to decide the scale of damages he will have to pay. Giuliani waged a \u201csustained smear campaign\u201d against two Georgia poll workers in the 2020 count of absentee ballots, Protect Democracy alleged. The mother and daughter duo, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, became the targets of a conspiracy theory in which they were said to have packed bogus ballots into \u201csuitcases\u201d which they then surreptitiously counted five times, transferring victory to Biden. Giuliani called their actions \u201cthe crime of the century\u201d, and labeled them \u201ccrooks\u201d. Georgia election officials and police investigators categorically disproved the falsehoods within 24 hours of Giuliani airing them. The suitcases turned out to be ballot storage boxes and the counting process was entirely normal, yet he continued to repeat the lies for months. Freeman and Moss faced a prolonged harassment campaign, including death threats from Trump supporters. At its peak, Freeman was compelled to flee her own home and to shutter her online business. In July, in an attempt to avoid disclosing evidence to the plaintiffs, Giuliani admitted that he had made defamatory statements and caused the pair emotional distress. The following month a federal judge ruled he was liable for defamation \u2013 leaving the jury to decide only the scale of damages. Goodman said the case summed up why Protect Democracy was bringing defamation suits against election denialists. \u201cRuby Freeman and Shaye Moss were Americans doing their civic duty, and they were put in the crosshairs of this election subversion machine \u2013 we should not stand for that.\u201d Most defendants have tried to shield themselves behind the first amendment right to free speech. In Arizona, Kari Lake has attacked the lawsuit against her as an attempt to \u201cpunish or silence\u201d her \u201ccore free speech about the integrity of the 2022 election\u201d. In his Guardian interview, Lindell said: \u201cI have a first amendment right. These defamation cases are damaging free speech \u2013 people are afraid to speak out, to come forward with anything.\u201d Protect Democracy countered that the first amendment does not provide blanket protection for mendacity. \u201cIt does not protect those who knowingly spread lies that destroy reputations and lives,\u201d Goodman said. Nina Jankowicz, an expert on disinformation, also rejects the idea that the first amendment shields reckless falsehoods. She is suing Fox News for what she claims were the \u201cvitriolic lies\u201d the channel spread about her in 2022 in her role as head of a newly created federal unit combatting misinformation. Jankowicz resigned from the Disinformation Governance Board, which was also disbanded, barely three weeks into the job. Her defamation complaint quotes the former Fox News star Tucker Carlson calling her a \u201cmoron\u201d on air and labelling her unit \u201cthe new Soviet America\u201d. Jankowicz said she took the decision to sue because she could see no other route to correct the public record. If there was a free speech component, she said, it was that her rights had been violated, not those of Fox News. \u201cTheir intention was to silence me, just as the defamation of election workers in Georgia was designed to silence them. That\u2019s pretty un-American.\u201d Fox has moved to have Jankowicz\u2019s case dismissed, arguing that she has failed to meet the actual malice standard. A ruling is expected soon. The billion-dollar question is: can it work? Can the strategy of deploying defamation as a deterrent force denialists to think twice before they embark on renewed election subversion in 2024? Jankowicz, despite pressing ahead with her own libel suit, remains skeptical. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any change in how these rumors and outright lies are being spread yet, and I do worry for 2024,\u201d she said. She added that change would only come \u201cwhen we see more big settlements, or juries siding with plaintiffs\u201d. Parties accused of peddling anti-democratic lies certainly remain vociferous. The Gateway Pundit, the far-right website which Protect Democracy is suing for having published the same falsehoods as Giuliani about the Georgia poll workers, has used the lawsuit as a fundraising tool. Lindell said that he would never be silenced, and continued to insist that his statements about Dominion\u2019s rigging of the 2020 election were \u201ctruths\u201d. \u201cI will continue to tell the truth, nothing\u2019s going to stop me from speaking out. I\u2019m not scared,\u201d he said. There are though tentative signs of a shift in behavior. The far-right channel One America News backtracked on its lies about the Georgia poll workers last year after having settled its defamation suit with Freeman and Moss. Since then the outlet has been dropped by several major cable providers. In the wake of the huge defamation settlement between Fox and Dominion, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and Trump himself complained that Fox News refused to give air time to 2000 Mules. Goodman is optimistic that defamation suits can help shore up the US\u2019s shaken democratic norms. \u201cThis is about accountability as a way of ensuring that our democracy can get back on track,\u201d she said."

            "title": "US Democratic senator Joe Manchin will not seek re-election in 2024",
            "date": "2023-11-09T22:53:43Z",
            "content": "West Virginia\u2019s controversial Democratic US senator Joe Manchin has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2024 and will instead \u201cfight to unite the middle\u201d. The 76-year-old senator, who for years has held an outsized degree of power within the Democratic party and often defied its leadership, appeared in July at an event held by a political group exploring a third-party presidential bid. Manchin\u2019s appearance with the centrist No Labels group fueled speculation that he was considering a run for the presidency, a scenario that alarmed Democrats as it could weaken Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy for another term in the White House. On Thursday afternoon, Manchin put out a statement saying: \u201cAfter months of deliberation and long conversations with my family, I believe in my heart of hearts that I have accomplished what I set out to do for West Virginia. I have made one of the toughest decisions of my life and decided that I will not be running for re-election to the United States Senate.\u201d He added: \u201cBut what I will be doing is traveling the country and speaking out to see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together.\u201d No Labels sees Manchin as a potential candidate for its centrist platform. Although No Labels, which has been around since 2010, mostly behind the scenes, has stated it will not field a candidate if their platform does not gain traction or if it appears it would swing the vote in favor of one party, the group has been actively fundraising and is seeking to get on ballots across the country. Maryanne Martini, a spokesperson for No Labels, released a statement praising Manchin as \u201ca longtime ally\u201d but declining to comment on his potential to run for president. \u201cRegarding our No Labels unity presidential ticket, we are gathering input from our members across the country to understand the kind of leaders they would like to see in the White House,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we have said from the beginning, we will make a decision by early 2024 about whether we will nominate a unity presidential ticket and who will be on it.\u201d Opinion polls show dissatisfaction with the current leading White House candidates, both the incumbent Biden and the Republican frontrunner Trump. Manchin\u2019s decision to step down will also jeopardise Democrats\u2019 narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate. Republicans hold the governor\u2019s office and the rest of the congressional delegation in a state that Trump won by a wide margin over Biden in 2020. Manchin won his last election with just 49.6% of the vote, 0.3 percentage points ahead of his Republican rival, in 2018. The US senator Steve Daines, the head of Republican senators\u2019 campaign arm, said in a brief statement: \u201cWe like our odds in West Virginia.\u201d The state\u2019s Republican governor, Jim Justice, has already launched a campaign for his party\u2019s nomination for Senate. Justice was a Democrat when he was first elected governor in 2016, but a year into office he switched parties and went on to cruise to re-election, winning 65% of the vote in 2020. Trump has endorsed Justice. Justice said on Thursday: \u201cSenator Joe Manchin and I have not always agreed on policy and politics, but we\u2019re both lifelong West Virginians who love this state beyond belief, and I respect and thank him for his many years of public service.\u201d Manchin\u2019s departure will raise the stakes for Democrats in several other Senate races including in Republican-leaning Montana and Ohio and highly competitive Pennsylvania and Arizona. Manchin, who took office in 2010, has been a key vote on every major piece of legislation of Biden\u2019s tenure as a moderate representing an increasingly conservative state. His support was critical to the passage of Biden\u2019s sweeping $1tn infrastructure law, one of the president\u2019s key domestic accomplishments. Together with the Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, who switched her registration to independent from Democrat in December, Manchin has secured major concessions and the scaling back of his party\u2019s legislative goals, winning him applause from conservatives and condemnations from many fellow Democrats. The pair stood together in protecting the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule, which requires that 60 of the chamber\u2019s 100 members agree on most legislation, in the face of intense opposition from their own party. Manchin\u2019s defence of the filibuster helped block Democrats\u2019 hopes of passing bills to protect abortion rights after the supreme court last year overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade decision that had established the right nationwide. Republican senators praised Manchin\u2019s commitment to bipartisanship. The Utah senator Mitt Romney, who is also not seeking re-election, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter: \u201cI will miss this American patriot in the Senate. But our friendship and our commitment to American values will not end.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-10T18:00:12Z",
            "content": "Attorneys for Arizona\u2019s most prominent election deniers have been dealt tens of thousands of dollars in sanctions \u2013 monetary punishments \u2013 for flouting facts. Michigan lawyers got hit with some for filing a baseless lawsuit. Colorado attorneys relied on inflammatory language instead of investigating, resulting in sanctions. In courtrooms across the country, lawyers who have brought cases alleging election fraud since the 2020 election without evidence or based on lies have received financial sanctions, one way the courts and democracy-defending attorneys hope to clamp down on frivolous lawsuits from those who won\u2019t accept election losses. The tactic is one way defendants, under attack from broad and baseless claims of widespread fraud, have sought to hold people accountable for spreading such claims, which have become increasingly common since former president Donald Trump lost in 2020. The sanctions join other forms of accountability, like defamation cases and criminal charges. Some attorneys have even faced disbarment or investigations by their state\u2019s bar organization because of their claims in election-fraud lawsuits. \u201cYou can\u2019t lie brazenly to the courts,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, who directs the democracy program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. Weiser said the wave of bad-faith lawsuits required a response from the judicial system to let attorneys and their clients know that \u201cthe law can\u2019t be used just as a political tool\u201d. A court sanction \u2013 typically an award of coverage of attorneys\u2019 fees to the government entity that defended against the lawsuit \u2013 can send a message not just to the attorneys and political actors bringing a case, but to those who would consider filing similar lawsuits in the future. In most instances, the sanctions are against the attorneys who bring the cases, not their clients, because attorneys are bound by ethical rules that should prevent them from making false statements. The sanctions also show the courts\u2019 role in accountability for anti-democratic actions, as standard-bearers of the law and the legal profession. \u201cPart of the attack on democracy is the attack on functioning government,\u201d said Jena Griswold, Colorado\u2019s secretary of state and the chair of the Democratic association of secretaries of state. \u201cIt ties us up into nonsensical, conspiracy-laden lawsuits. It\u2019s an affront to the justice system. And I do think that these people should be held accountable.\u201d As the 2024 election approaches, those seeking sanctions hope that the effort will stave off the worst election lawsuits, likely because politicians making wild claims won\u2019t be able to find a decent attorney. But the list of sanctions has grown since 2020, as more secretaries of state, attorneys general and local elections offices push back against lawsuits that have been costly and time-consuming to respond to. A judge in Michigan gave Republican leaders, including the state\u2019s GOP chair Kristina Karamo, and their attorneys nearly $60,000 in sanctions over an election lawsuit that \u201cmerely threw out the allegation of \u2018corruption in Detroit\u2019 as the reason for disregarding the Michigan Constitution in this state\u2019s largest city\u201d, the judge wrote. Two attorneys who brought a sprawling lawsuit in 2020 in Colorado against a plethora of companies and politicians, including Facebook, Dominion Voting Systems and elected officials in several states, saw sanctions after a federal judge said the case suffered from a \u201cwoeful lack of investigation into the law\u201d and made repeated \u201chighly inflammatory and damaging allegations that could have put individuals\u2019 safety in danger\u201d. The judge said the lawsuit was \u201cthe height of recklessness\u201d. In Arizona, the state\u2019s most prominent election deniers have been met with sanctions in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees multiple times. Kari Lake, the failed GOP gubernatorial candidate who\u2019s now running for US Senate, has seen sanctions in a case contesting her loss and in another attacking vote-tabulation machines. Mark Finchem, who lost his race for secretary of state, has brought cases that have gotten court sanctions, which he has said put a \u201ccold, wet blanket\u201d on opposing views. When seeking sanctions in a case brought by losing attorney general candidate Abe Hamadeh, the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office explained that the courts \u201cmust hold accountable those who materially misrepresent the facts in order to gain some kind of advantage \u2013 here, the ultimate goal being to usurp an elected office\u201d. \u201cDeliberately peddling misinformation to this Court demonstrates a profound disrespect for our democratic institutions,\u201d the office\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cIf people are truly suspicious of our election processes, doubt our election officials, or question the efficacy of our democracy, it is because misinformation continues to circulate unchecked.\u201d In one Arizona case, it was already clear other attorneys had passed on taking the lawsuit, a harbinger of what proponents of sanctions hope will continue to occur when plaintiffs seek representation for wild claims. The attorney sanctioned in that case had very little experience in election law and said in court that he took the case after more experienced lawyers passed on it, admitting he was at less risk of disbarment because he would retire soon, which the judge issuing sanctions called a \u201cconscious decision to pursue the matter despite appreciating that the contest had no legal merit\u201d. Weiser, of the Brennan Center, said the potential for sanctions and professional repercussions for attorneys is decreasing the number of lawyers, especially well-qualified ones, who are willing to take on these cases. \u201cDo I think that we are out of the woods? No,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing forward, people who might have been tempted are going to really think twice now that the personal consequences to them and to their firms are much more clear and stark.\u201d Griswold, the Colorado secretary of state, wants to see more requests for sanctions filed to meet the mountain of frivolous lawsuits elections officials have faced since 2020. \u201cWe have to strongly disincentivize bad acting,\u201d she said."

            "title": "With the US election a year away, most Americans don\u2019t want Biden or Trump",
            "date": "2023-11-05T16:00:13Z",
            "content": "Americans are one year away from a presidential election that\u2019s shaping up to be a historically unpopular rematch between the oldest ever sitting president, Joe Biden, a Democrat, and his Republican predecessor, the twice-impeached, serially indicted Donald Trump. With less than 10 weeks to go before Iowa\u2019s caucuses launch the 2024 Republican nominating contest, much can still change. As it stands, the country appears to be hurtling toward an election few Americans want \u2013 but that might be one of the most consequential in modern US history. Interviews with leading pollsters of both parties offer a portrait of a divided electorate, united only in its pessimism. Americans, surveys show, are deeply disenchanted with their prospects for president, the state of the economy and the direction of the country. \u201cWe have a situation where most Americans want both Trump and Biden not to run,\u201d said the veteran Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg. \u201cThat is the context for this election.\u201d If the top of the ticket looks like 2020, the dark mood of the electorate is reminiscent of 2016, said Frank Luntz, a prominent Republican pollster. \u201cIt looks like 2016, only worse,\u201d he said. In surveys and in focus groups, Luntz said, voters are expressing a level of disdain for politics and the electoral process that he\u2019s never seen before. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling like everyone\u2019s being forgotten and disrespected,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2016, that was primarily on the right, which is what led to Donald Trump. But people on the left now feel that way as well.\u201d Both leading candidates have glaring political liabilities, according to voters. Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024, without ever accepting his defeat in 2020, even as he faces felony charges over his attempts to overturn an election that was conducted freely and fairly. In total, Trump faces 91 felony charges in four separate criminal cases that have effectively tightened, rather than loosened, his grip on the Republican party. In campaign speeches, Trump thrills supporters when he claims to be the only person whose political prospects rise with every indictment. Grievance once again is at core of his candidacy, Trump\u2019s courtroom appearances often attract more attention than his campaign events. Meanwhile he has skipped all of his party\u2019s presidential debates, leaving the events a scrap for second place. In the early voting states and among Republicans nationally, Trump continues to dominate, leading his nearest challengers: Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor whose campaign has stalled, and Nikki Haley, his former UN ambassador, whose candidacy has shown signs of momentum in recent weeks. Biden, all but certain to be his party\u2019s nominee, is asking voters to keep him in office for another four years, well into his ninth decade. Anxiety about his age and fitness \u2013 Biden would be 86 years old at the end of a second term \u2013 weigh heavily on Biden\u2019s candidacy, though Trump is only three years younger. It is part of the rationale behind the quixotic primary challenge against him by Dean Phillips, the 51-year-old Democratic congressman from Minnesota. Some Democrats joke warily that, despite notching several significant legislative achievements during his first term, Biden\u2019s age is more than twice his job approval rating, which slipped to a personal low of 37% last month amid sharp erosion in support from Democrats, according to a recent Gallup poll. While voters consistently express deep dissatisfaction over his handling of the economy. The outcome of the 2024 presidential election, projected to be the most expensive of all time, will probably be decided by a few thousand votes in a handful of critical states. \u201cThis will be a very close general election,\u201d the Biden campaign manager, Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodrigue,z wrote in a memo, marking the one-year countdown to election day. In many national and battleground state surveys of a Biden-Trump race, the 2020 rivals are neck and neck. While a survey by the New York Times and Siena College of voters in six battleground states released on Sunday, 365 days from the election, showed Biden trailing Trump in all but one, Wisconsin. The margins ranged from three to 10 percentage points, and reflected an erosion of support among the fragile, multiracial coalition that elected Biden over Trump in 2020. \u201cTrump has been indicted in 91 times and yet he\u2019s even with or even a couple points ahead of Biden in those surveys,\u201d Luntz said. \u201cIf I\u2019m a Democrat, I\u2019m scared out of my mind.\u201d A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found the presidential race in effect unchanged despite the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas, a mass shooting in Maine and a courtroom appearance by Trump. In the poll\u2019s hypothetical matchup, 47% of registered voters say they would support Biden, while 46% say they would support Trump. \u201cTrump goes to war with the American legal system, while Biden wrestles with military conflicts on two fronts,\u201d said Tim Malloy, a polling analyst with Quinnipiac University. \u201cDespite the swirling tumult, the partisan criticism and rancor, the two candidates are still as tied as tied can be.\u201d The economy remains a top concern for voters. By official indicators, the US economy has roared back from the pandemic-induced recession. But a wide majority of Americans say they are unhappy with the trajectory of the economy despite consistent reports that inflation is easing and unemployment is close to a 50-year low. Polls underscore the challenge Biden faces as he tries to sell his economic achievements \u2013 Bidenomics \u2013 to voters. A recent Harris poll conducted for the Guardian found that 51% of Americans wrongly believe that unemployment is nearing a 50-year high, while two-thirds of respondents reported it was difficult to be happy about positive economic news when they personally feel financially squeezed each month. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a situation where the empirical data on the economy and the perceived economic experience by people has been at such a great disjuncture,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a prominent Democratic pollster. \u201cThis is the biggest gap we\u2019ve ever had on those two indicators and you\u2019ve got a solid majority of voters who say they\u2019re worse off.\u201d Democrats, she noted, have never won a presidential election without pulling even with or ahead of Republicans on the economy. A Trump-Biden rematch, as inevitable as it appears, would cast the country into a highly unpredictable election season with many variables. The outbreak of war in the Middle East, following the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, jolted the electoral landscape. Biden made a wartime visit to Israel to promise US allegiance to a longtime ally. As the death toll in Gaza rises under Israel\u2019s retaliatory bombing campaign, there are signs that the president\u2019s response to the conflict is dividing his fragile electoral coalition and eroding his support, particularly among young people. Abortion is once again poised to play a significant role. In blue and red states alike, voters mobilized in 2022 against Republican attempts to restrict access to a procedure that was, until last year\u2019s supreme court decision, a constitutional right. Many Republican leaders, including Trump, blamed a backlash over their abortion policies for their worse-than-expected performance in the midterm. A pending legal challenge to outlaw a commonly used abortion pill could spur an even greater backlash in 2024. Issues of democracy \u2013 residual alarm over the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, led by a mob of Trump supporters determined to block Biden\u2019s election; Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to \u201cbe your retribution\u201d; his continued attempts to undermine faith in the electoral system; fears of political violence \u2013 may also be driving factors, as they were in 2022, said Greenberg. \u201cMany view this as the last election if he were to win,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThose are the stakes.\u201d Perhaps nothing is more unpredictable than the prospect of third-party spoilers. \u201cThis is a prime election to have third-party voting being very strong,\u201d Greenberg said. Robert Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist and the nephew of president John F Kennedy, is running as an independent after abandoning the Democratic party, as is Cornel West, the philosopher and leftwing scholar. Meanwhile, No Labels, a new political party, is attempting to field a centrist third-party presidential bid in 2024. How these candidates will affect the race \u2013 and which party they will siphon support from \u2013 remains unclear. Luntz said there was the potential for third-party candidates to draw far more support than Ross Perot, whose independent presidential campaign won nearly 19% of the popular vote in 1992. In a four-way race, the Quinnipiac poll found Biden earned 36%, Trump earned 35% and Kennedy and West earned a combined 25%. However undesirable a Trump-Biden rematch may seem to voters now, the pollsters say partisans of both parties will probably fall in line behind their party\u2019s choice for president. \u201cThe sooner this election can become a contrast the better,\u201d Lake said. \u201cAs Joe Biden likes to say himself, don\u2019t judge me by the Almighty, judge me by the alternative. And in that choice he does quite well.\u201d As Republicans prepare to choose their nominee, Trump\u2019s election-year trials get under way and Biden begins to campaign in earnest, the contours of the presidential contest could change dramatically \u2013 or not. With so much at stake and so little margin for error, the only electoral certainty is the uncertainty. \u201cA year is an eternity in American politics,\u201d Luntz said."

            "date": "2023-11-19T23:24:27Z",
            "content": "Javier Milei, a volatile far-right libertarian who has vowed to \u201cexterminate\u201d inflation and take a chainsaw to the state, has been elected president of Argentina, catapulting South America\u2019s second largest economy into an unpredictable and potentially turbulent future. With more than 99% of votes counted, the Mick Jagger impersonating TV celebrity-turned politician, who is often compared to Donald Trump, had secured 55.69% of the vote compared with 44.3% for his rival, the centre-left finance minister Sergio Massa. \u201cToday the reconstruction of Argentina begins. Today is a historic night for Argentina,\u201d Milei told jubilant supporters at his campaign headquarters in Buenos Aires, calling his victory a \u201cmiracle\u201d. Milei promised \u201cdrastic changes\u201d to tackle Argentina\u2019s \u201ctragic reality\u201d of soaring inflation and widespread poverty. He also sent a message to the international community: \u201cArgentina will return to the place in the world which it should never have lost.\u201d Earlier, Massa - who received 11.5m votes to Milei\u2019s 14.4m - conceded defeat. \u201cArgentinians have chosen another path,\u201d said Massa, who said he had called Milei to congratulate him on his victory and hinted he would retire from frontline politics. \u201cObviously these are not the results we hoped for and I have spoken to Javier Milei to congratulate him because he\u2019s the president that the majority of Argentines have chosen for the next four years,\u201d added Massa, whose Peronist movement has governed for 16 of the last 20 years. Pro-Milei activists rejoiced at the triumph of their 53-year-old leader, whom they describe as an economic visionary poised to lead Argentina out of one of the country\u2019s worst economic crises in decades. \u201c[I\u2019m] happy, happy, happy,\u201d said Francisco Jim\u00e9nez, a 30-year-old delivery driver and Milei activist from Villa Soldati, a working-class area outside Buenos Aires. As he set off to join the party at Milei\u2019s campaign HQ, Jim\u00e9nez said he knew the result was likely to send Argentina\u2019s peso tumbling against the dollar and cause more economic pain. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there is another option than trusting him. Now more than ever,\u201d he added. \u201cThe situation is dire.\u201d During his campaign, Milei \u2013 who will take office on 10 December \u2013 vowed to abolish the central bank and dollarise the economy in order to overcome a financial calamity that has left 40% of Argentina\u2019s 45 million citizens in poverty and pushed inflation to more than 140%. \u201cI know how to exterminate the cancer of inflation,\u201d Milei proclaimed during last Sunday\u2019s final presidential debate which most pundits believed Massa had won. Milei\u2019s victory was celebrated by other big beasts of the global far-right including Brazil\u2019s former president Jair Bolsonaro, who had championed his campaign and has promised to attend his inauguration. \u201cHope is sparkling in South America once again,\u201d Bolsonaro wrote on X, hailing what he called a victory for \u201chonesty, progress and freedom\u201d. The former US president Donald Trump wrote: \u201cThe whole world was watching! I am very proud of you. You will turn your country around and truly Make Argentina Great Again.\u201d His victory was also celebrated by X\u2019s owner Elon Musk, who posted: \u201cProsperity is ahead for Argentina\u201d. Brazil\u2019s leftwing president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 who Milei has repeatedly insulted as a corrupt \u201ccommunist\u201d \u2013 recognised Milei\u2019s victory in a tepid social media post. \u201cDemocracy is the voice of the people and must always be respected,\u201d Lula wrote, without mentioning Milei by name. \u201cI wish the next government good luck and success. Argentina is a great country and deserves our complete respect,\u201d Lula added. Colombia\u2019s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro, lamented: \u201cThe extreme right has won in Argentina \u2026 [It is] sad for Latin America.\u201d \u201cNow say it without crying,\u201d El Salvador\u2019s right-wing president, Nayib Bukele, posted ironically in response. Milei\u2019s leftwing opponents reacted with shock and dejection to the election of a notoriously erratic figure whose radical ideas include legalising the sale of organs, cutting ties with Argentina\u2019s two biggest trade partners, Brazil and China, and closing more than a dozen ministries. Milei \u2013 a climate-denying populist who is known by the nickname El Loco (the Madman) \u2013 has also enraged millions of Argentinians by questioning the four-decade consensus over the crimes of its 1976-83 dictatorship, during which an estimated 30,000 people were killed by the military regime. His vice-presidential running mate is Victoria Villarruel, an ultra-conservative congresswoman who has played down the dictatorship\u2019s sins. \u201cHe is way more excessive and unstable than [Jair] Bolsonaro and Trump. So it\u2019s highly unpredictable what this person could do [in power],\u201d Federico Finchelstein, an Argentinian historian who studies the global far right, said on the eve of Sunday\u2019s election. Benjamin Gedan, the head of the Wilson Centre\u2019s Argentina Project, said he believed one word explained the scale of Milei\u2019s victory: desperation. \u201cThis vote just reeks of desperation. A lot of Argentines voted knowingly against their economic interests because they recognise that the status quo is catastrophic. And there was no reason to believe that the current finance minister could plausibly be the answer,\u201d Gedan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge gamble but not a completely irrational one.\u201d Gedan said the election of such a radical and inexperienced political outsider thrust Argentina into uncharted waters. \u201cThe real risk is that Argentina melts down in his attempt to radically transform the economy. That would look like massive social unrest, national strikes by unions, potential political violence and stresses against the democratic institutions. There is a pretty dark scenario if in fact he pursues aggressively his maximalist vision for Argentina.\u201d After hours of tension, there was an explosion of noise on the streets of Buenos Aires as news of the result spread and citizens reacted with a mixture of joy, apprehension and anger. \u201cVamos Milei, the change is coming!\u201d one woman could be heard shouting from a balcony in Recoleta, not far from the president-elect\u2019s campaign HQ. \u201cNever again!\u201d a male voice bellowed, in reference to the human rights violations that took place under Argentina\u2019s military regime. \u201cMilei is the dictatorship\u201d."

            "content": "At least 11,000 Ukrainian children are reportedly being detained at 43 re-education camps across Russia, thousands of miles from home, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence said on X. Russia may begin full mobilisation after the 2024 Russian presidential election on 17 March, secretary of the national security and defence council of Ukraine, Oleksii Danilov, has suggested. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has met Fox Corp CEO, Lachlan Murdoch, in the Ukrainian capital in what Kyiv said was a \u201cvery important signal\u201d of support. \u201cThe Head of State (Zelenskiy) thanked Lachlan Murdoch for his visit and emphasised that it is a very important signal of support at the time when the world\u2019s attention is blurred by other events,\u201d the president\u2019s office wrote. Ukraine sacked two senior cyber defence officials on Monday, a government official said, as prosecutors announced a probe into alleged embezzlement in the government\u2019s cybersecurity agency. US secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in an unannounced visit to Kyiv, and said that American support to Ukraine would continue \u201cfor the long haul\u201d, the Associated Press reported. Zelenskiy said Austin\u2019s visit was \u201ca very important signal for Ukraine\u201d. \u201cWe count on your support,\u201d he added, thanking Congress as well as the American people for their backing. Austin announced $100m in new military aid to Ukraine during his visit. Russian shelling killed three people on Monday and damaged power lines and a gas pipeline in the central Dnipropetrovsk and southern Kherson regions of Ukraine, authorities said. An elderly woman was killed and a man injured in Russian artillery strike on the town of Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk\u2019s governor said. \u201cA power line and a gas pipeline were damaged,\u201d Serhiy Lysak, the governor, said on Telegram. On Monday morning, two drivers were killed when Russian forces shelled a private transport company parking lot in Kherson, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. These claims have not been independently verified. From the Kyiv Independent: Russia\u2019s federal air transport agency has proposed Russian airlines begin regular flights to North Korea in the latest sign of increasing ties between the two countries, Russian state-controlled media Kommersant reported. The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, announced $100m in new military aid to Ukraine during his unannounced visit to Kyiv on Monday, Reuters reports. The US has provided more than $44bn in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. A joint Ukraine-US military industry conference in Washington, due to take place on 6 and 7 December, is intended to boost Ukraine\u2019s domestic arms production as the war drags towards the two-year mark. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that his talks with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, included discussion on \u201cbattlefield developments\u201d, the Black Sea and Ukraine\u2019s export corridor. At least 11,000 Ukrainian children are reportedly being detained at 43 re-education camps across Russia, thousands of miles from home, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said on X. Since the start of the war, children as young as four months living in the occupied areas have been taken to 43 camps across Russia, including in Moscow-annexed Crimea and Siberia, for \u201cpro-Russia patriotic and military-related education\u201d, the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab report, which was funded by the US state department, has previously found. The international criminal court issued arrest warrants in March for Vladimir Putin and his children\u2019s commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine \u2013 a war crime. Russia may begin full mobilisation after the 2024 Russian presidential election on 17 March, the secretary of the national security and defence council of Ukraine, Oleksii Danilov, has suggested. Danilov said in a speech to the International Security Forum in Halifax, Canada: Russia has managed to adapt, and constantly injects funds into its defence sector. Russia proved to be more resilient to the west\u2019s sanctions, as expected. Russia is increasingly putting its economy on a war footing. Total mobilisation may follow the 2024 presidential elections. Several sources have told Reuters that Putin has decided to run in the March presidential election, a move that will keep him in power until least 2030. In September, Ukraine\u2019s military said Russia could launch a big mobilisation campaign soon to try to recruit hundreds of thousands of soldiers from inside Russia and occupied Ukraine. Nato is examining a more permanent ramp up of troop numbers in the western Balkans to keep tensions in the region under control, Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. \u201cWe are now reviewing whether we should have a more permanent increase to ensure that this doesn\u2019t spiral out of control and creates a new violent conflict in Kosovo or the wider region,\u201d he told reporters on a visit to Kosovo. After fresh violence between ethnic groups in Kosovo in September, Nato had called in reserve forces. Nato\u2019s regional KFOR mission, which has been in operation since 1999, comprises over 4,500 troops from 27 countries. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has met Fox Corp CEO, Lachlan Murdoch, in the Ukrainian capital in what Kyiv said was a \u201cvery important signal\u201d of support at a time when global media attention has shifted from the war in Ukraine. Media titan Rupert Murdoch\u2019s eldest son \u2013 who was recently announced as chairman of both Fox Corp and News Corp \u2013 is a leading figure in media with a US Republican-leaning audience. \u201cThe Head of State (Zelenskiy) thanked Lachlan Murdoch for his visit and emphasised that it is a very important signal of support at the time when the world\u2019s attention is blurred by other events,\u201d the president\u2019s office wrote on its website. His remark appeared to be a reference to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has dominated headlines for more than a month, and significantly diverted global media attention from the war in Ukraine, which is nearing the 21-month mark this week. Zelenskiy said it was vital to keep the world\u2019s attention focused on the war in Ukraine. \u201cFor us, for our warriors, this is not a movie. These are our lives. This is daily hard work. And it will not be over as quickly as we would like, but we have no right to give up and we will not,\u201d he was quoted as saying by his office. Zelenskiy said Fox News journalist Benjamin Hall, who was badly injured covering the war in Ukraine last year, and The Sun journalist Jerome Starkey were also invited to the meeting with Murdoch, Reuters reports. An elderly woman was killed and a man injured in Russian artillery strike on the town of Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk\u2019s governor said. \u201cA power line and a gas pipeline were damaged,\u201d Serhiy Lysak, the governor, wrote on Telegram. These claims have not been independently verified. Kyiv hopes to hold a new round of talks with Poland and the EU this week to resolve an issue with Polish truckers blocking crossings at the Ukrainian-Polish border, a Ukrainian trade representative has said. \u201cThis week we hope to have negotiations in a trilateral format,\u201d Taras Kachka, the representative, said in televised comments, according to Reuters. Polish truckers earlier this month blocked roads to three border crossings with Ukraine to protest against what they see as government inaction over a loss of business to foreign competitors since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has congratulated Argentina\u2019s president-elect, Javier Milei, praising him on his \u201cclear stance\u201d in support of Kyiv. Milei, a rightwing libertarian who on Sunday won almost 56% of the vote in the election\u2019s second round, has previously said he would retreat from ties with countries including Russia, China and Brazil, citing disagreement with their governments\u2019 policies. Reuters reports that Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said on Monday it had lodged a formal complaint with the Finnish ambassador in Moscow over Helsinki\u2019s closure of four busy border crossings with Russia, a step it said impacted tens of thousands of people in both countries. Finland on Saturday closed the crossing points as it sought to halt a flow of asylum seekers it said was caused by Moscow, an allegation Russia has denied. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said that Finland\u2019s decision had been \u201crushed\u201d and that it violated the rights and interests of tens of thousands of people on both sides of the countries\u2019 shared border. Ukraine sacked two senior cyber defence officials on Monday, a government official said, as prosecutors announced a probe into alleged embezzlement in the government\u2019s cybersecurity agency, according to Reuters. Yurii Shchyhol, head of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP), and his deputy, Viktor Zhora, were dismissed by the government, senior cabinet official Taras Melnychuk wrote on Telegram. Melnychuk, the cabinet\u2019s representative to parliament, did not mention the reasons for the dismissals. Shchyhol wrote on Facebook that he was confident he could prove his innocence, Interfax Ukraine reported. There was no immediate comment from Zhora. Ukraine has stepped up efforts to curtail corruption as it pursues membership in the EU, which has made the fight against graft a key prerequisite for negotiations to begin. The US ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, has said Lloyd Austin\u2019s visit to the Ukrainian capital signalled Washington\u2019s \u201cunwavering support to Ukraine in its fight for freedom\u201d. The US secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, met with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and has said that American support to Kyiv would continue \u201cfor the long haul\u201d, the Associated Press reports. Austin, who travelled to Kyiv by train from Poland, met with Zelenskiy and was scheduled to meet with the country\u2019s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, and chief of staff Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi. In Kyiv, Austin said Ukraine\u2019s effort to defeat Russia\u2019s invasion \u201cmatters to the rest of the world\u201d and that US support would continue \u201cfor the long haul\u201d. Zelenskiy said Austin\u2019s visit was \u201ca very important signal for Ukraine\u201d. \u201cWe count on your support,\u201d he added, thanking Congress as well as the American people for their backing. \u201cI was honored to meet with President Zelenskiy in Kyiv today to reaffirm the United States\u2019 steadfast support for Ukraine,\u201d Austin wrote on X after his meeting. He said the US, together with allies and partners, would continue to support Ukraine\u2019s needs on the battlefield. As my colleague Shaun Walker writes, the war in the Middle East has meant that for perhaps the first time since February 2022, Ukraine has not been the main foreign policy issue on most western leaders\u2019 minds for a sustained period of time. A senior defence official traveling with US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has told reporters that the US expects that this winter Russia will go after Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure again, like the power grid, making air defences critical, the Associated Press reports. Earlier this month, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned Ukrainians to prepare for new waves of Russian attacks on infrastructure as winter approaches. Last winter, about 10 months into the invasion, Russia made waves of attacks on power stations and other plants linked to the energy network, prompting rolling blackouts in widely disparate regions. Finland\u2019s president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, has said it had become impossible to return asylum seekers who do not meet the criteria for protection, and that this had to be taken into account when policies are set, Reuters reports. Finland has closed four crossing points on its border with Russia as Helsinki seeks to halt a flow of asylum seekers it says was instigated by Moscow, leaving only four stations open. The Kremlin has denied sending migrants and said earlier that Finland\u2019s decision to shut border crossings reflected Helsinki\u2019s adoption of an anti-Russian stance (see earlier post at 09.41). The bodies of 94 Ukrainian soldiers were returned to territory controlled by the Ukrainian government on Monday, the official account for the Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War wrote on Telegram. In exchange, Ukraine transferred the bodies of an unspecified number of Russian soldiers killed in combat to the Russian side, the headquarters said. \u201cThe Armed Forces of Ukraine will ensure the transportation of repatriated bodies and remains to designated state specialized institutions for transfer to representatives of law enforcement agencies and forensic medical experts for identification of the deceased,\u201d it wrote. Here are some images from Kherson following reported Russian shelling (Reuters was not able to independently verify the location or the date when the video and the images were taken): The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said the public street protest in Moscow, led by wives of deployed Russian soldiers, on 7 November, was likely the first such demonstrations in the Russian capital since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last February. In its latest intelligence update, the MoD wrote on X: The protestors gathered in the central Teatralnya Square and unfurled banners demanding the rotation of their partners away from the frontline. Since February 2022, social media has provided daily examples of Russian wives and mothers making online appeals protesting against the conditions of their loved ones\u2019 service. However, Russia\u2019s draconian legislation has so far prevented troops\u2019 relatives from coalescing into an influential lobbying force, as soldiers\u2019 mothers did during the Afghan-Soviet War of the 1980s. Police broke up the Teatralnya Square protest within minutes. However, the protestors\u2019 immediate demand is notable. The apparently indefinitely extended combat deployments of personnel without rotation is increasingly seen as unsustainable by both the troops themselves and by their relatives. Here is what the governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, has posted on Telegram about the reports of two people being killed in Kherson by Russian shelling (see earlier post at 08.25) He wrote: In the morning, the Russian army shelled the parking lot of a private transport company in Kherson. As a result of the enemy attack, two drivers were killed, another person was injured. Cars and a residential building were damaged. These claims are yet to be independently verified. Nato supports Bosnia\u2019s territorial integrity and is concerned by \u201cmalign foreign interference,\u201d including by Russia, in the volatile Balkans region that went through a devastating war in the 1990s, Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Sarajevo is the first stop on Stoltenberg\u2019s tour of western Balkan countries that will also include Kosovo, Serbia and North Macedonia, the Associated Press reports. \u201cThe Allies strongly support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina,\u201d Stoltenberg told reporters. \u201cWe are concerned by the secessionist and divisive rhetoric as well as malign foreign interference, including Russia.\u201d There are widespread fears that Russia is trying to destabilise Bosnia and the rest of the region and shift at least some world attention from its war in Ukraine. The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, arrived in Kyiv on Monday for a visit. \u201cI\u2019m here today to deliver an important message: the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom against Russia\u2019s aggression, both now and into the future.\u201d Two people were killed early on Monday after Russian forces shelled a parking lot in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, authorities said. Regional prosecutors opened a war crimes investigation into the artillery strike, which occurred at about 9am (7am GMT) and injured one other person, the regional prosecutor\u2019s office reported. A Ukrainian soldier and a woman have died after a grenade exploded in a Kyiv apartment, police in the Ukrainian capital have said, but the cause of the blast, which injured a second man, was not immediately clear. Explosives technicians and investigators were working at the scene of Sunday\u2019s explosion in the Dniprovskiy district, Kyiv police said in a statement. The Ukrainian army said it had pushed back Russian forces \u201cthree to eight kilometres\u201d from the banks of the Dnipro River, which if confirmed would be the first meaningful advance by Kyiv\u2019s forces months into a disappointing counteroffensive. Ukrainian and Russian forces have been entrenched on opposite sides of the vast waterway in the southern Kherson region for more than a year, after Russia withdrew its troops from the western bank last November. A Ukrainian teenager who was taken to Russia from the occupied city of Mariupol during the war and prevented from leaving earlier this year has returned to Ukraine. Bohdan Yermokhin, who turned 18 on Sunday, appealed to Zelenskiy this month to help bring him back to Ukraine. \u201cI believed I would be in Ukraine, but not on this day,\u201d Yermokhin told Reuters while eating at a petrol station after crossing the border. About 3,000 mostly Ukrainian trucks, including those carrying fuel and humanitarian aid, were stuck on the Polish side of the border on Sunday due to a more than 10-day blockade by Polish truckers, Ukrainian authorities said. Polish truckers earlier this month blocked roads to three border crossings with Ukraine to protest against what they see as government inaction over a loss of business to foreign competitors since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Air defence units in Moscow intercepted a drone targeting the city late Sunday, mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. Sobyanin, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said units in the Elektrostal district in the capital\u2019s east had intercepted the drone. No casualties or damage were initially reported. Air defences had also thwarted a drone attack on the Russian capital overnight to Sunday, authorities said earlier. Russia launched 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones targeting Kyiv and the Cherkasy and Poltava regions overnight into Sunday, the Ukrainian military said, of which 15 were shot down. The overnight strikes on Kyiv were the second attack on the Ukrainian capital in 48 hours, said the city\u2019s military administration spokesperson, Serhii Popko. Five people including a three-year-old girl were injured in Russian artillery shelling of Kherson on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said. \u201cAll of them sustained shrapnel wounds. The child and the grandmother were walking in the yard. Enemy artillery hit them near the entrance,\u201d Klymenko said on the Telegram messaging app. The pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin, who is in custody awaiting trial for inciting extremism, said he wanted to run for president even though he understood the March election would be a \u201csham\u201d with the winner already clear. Girkin, who is also known by the alias Igor Strelkov, has repeatedly said Russia faces revolution and even civil war unless President Vladimir Putin\u2019s military top brass fight the war in Ukraine more effectively. A former Federal Security Service (FSB) officer who helped Russia to annex Crimea in 2014 and then to organise pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine, Girkin said before his arrest that he and his supporters were entering politics. The Kremlin, facing the prospect of a European Union ban on imports of Russian diamonds, said on Monday that EU sanctions tended to have a \u201cboomerang effect\u201d on those who applied them, Reuters reports. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was commenting on a proposed EU ban on diamond imports from Russia as part of a new sanctions package against Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia is the world\u2019s biggest producer of rough diamonds by volume. Peskov told reporters such a move had been anticipated for a long time, but was likely to backfire. \u201cAs a rule, it turns out that a boomerang effect is partially triggered: the interests of the Europeans themselves suffer. So far, we have been able to find ways to minimise the negative consequences of sanctions,\u201d he said. EU diplomatic sources said last week the proposal under discussion was to ban direct diamond imports from Russia from 1 January and from March to implement a traceability mechanism that would prevent imports of Russian gems processed in third countries. The Kremlin said on Monday that president Vladimir Putin will set out Russia\u2019s view of what it sees as the \u201cdeeply unstable world situation\u201d when he addresses an upcoming virtual G20 summit. Russian state TV presenter Pavel Zarubin said on his Telegram channel on Sunday that it would be the \u201cfirst event in a long time\u201d including both Putin and western leaders. According to the state RIA news agency, the G20 virtual summit will be held on Wednesday. The Kremlin said on Monday it regretted Finland\u2019s decision to shut crossings on its border with Russia, saying it reflected Helsinki\u2019s adoption of an anti-Russian stance, Reuters reports. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, speaking at a regular news briefing, also rejected Finland\u2019s accusation that Russia is deliberately pushing illegal migrants towards the border and said that Russian border guards were following all instructions. Finland, a member of the European Union and \u2013 from this year \u2013 also of the Nato military alliance, closed four crossings on its border with Russia on Saturday as Helsinki seeks to halt a flow of asylum seekers it says was instigated by Moscow. The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, arrives in Kyiv on Monday morning. Reuters reports that two people were killed early on Monday after Russian forces shelled a parking lot in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, authorities said. Regional prosecutors opened a war crimes investigation into the artillery strike, which occurred at about 9am (7am GMT) and injured one other person, the regional prosecutor\u2019s office reported. The Kherson governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said the two dead were drivers for a private transport business. Images posted on Telegram showed firefighters dousing cars that had been blasted apart, one day after a separate strike on the city wounded five people, including a three-year-old girl. Russian forces have regularly shelled Kherson from across the Dnipro River since the regional capital was reoccupied by Ukrainian troops last November. Ukraine said last week it had secured a foothold on the eastern bank of the Dnipro and that its troops were trying to push Russian forces further back. The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, arrived in Kyiv on Monday for a visit, he said on the X social media platform, Reuters reports. \u201cI\u2019m here today to deliver an important message: the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom against Russia\u2019s aggression, both now and into the future.\u201d The visit comes amid increasing division over Ukraine aid in the US legislature. A joint Ukraine-US military industry conference in Washington is due to take place next month. That event, due to be held on 6-7 December, is intended to boost Ukraine\u2019s domestic arms production as its fight against a full-scale Russian invasion nears the two-year mark. Reuters reports that a Japanese delegation led by senior industry and foreign ministry officials and including business representatives is visiting Ukraine on Monday for talks ahead of a reconstruction conference that Japan will host, the industry ministry said. Japan, which has been supporting Ukraine with funds and by accepting refugees since Russia invaded in February 2022, has also been promoting support for Ukraine at the level of the G7, which Japan chairs this year. Kazuchika Iwata, the state minister of economy, trade and industry (METI), and the state minister for foreign affairs Kiyoto Tsuji, are visiting together with representatives of Japan companies, METI said in a statement. In Kyiv, the delegation, which includes members of Keidanren, Japan\u2019s biggest business lobby, in charge of a committee on Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction, plans talks with the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, government officials and companies. Shmyhal said this month Ukraine would need budget support of about $42bn this year and next year to plug a massive deficit and aid reconstruction from the devastation caused by Russia\u2019s invasion. METI said the visit was an opportunity to hear about Ukraine\u2019s needs and to discuss specific projects and accelerate public and private efforts to help. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 who visited Japan in May during a G7 summit \u2013 and the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, agreed this month to hold a Japan-Ukraine Conference for promotion of Economic Reconstruction in Tokyo on 19 February. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. A Ukrainian soldier and a woman have died after a grenade exploded in a Kyiv apartment, police in the Ukrainian capital have said, but the cause of the blast, which injured a second man, was not immediately clear. Explosives technicians and investigators were working at the scene of Sunday\u2019s explosion in the Dniprovskiy district, Kyiv police said in a statement. \u201cA citizen contacted the police with a report that an explosion rang out in a neighbouring apartment,\u201d they added. The news came as Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed the commander of the military\u2019s medical forces, Maj Gen Tetiana Ostashchenko, and said \u201cnew priorities had been set\u201d in the operations of Ukraine\u2019s military after a meeting with the defence minister, Rustem Umerov. \u201cThere is little time left to wait for results. Quick action is needed for forthcoming changes,\u201d the Ukrainian president said in his evening video address. In other key developments: The Ukrainian army said it had pushed back Russian forces \u201cthree to eight kilometres\u201d from the banks of the Dnipro River, which if confirmed would be the first meaningful advance by Kyiv\u2019s forces months into a disappointing counteroffensive. Ukrainian and Russian forces have been entrenched on opposite sides of the vast waterway in the southern Kherson region for more than a year, after Russia withdrew its troops from the western bank last November. A Ukrainian teenager who was taken to Russia from the occupied city of Mariupol during the war and prevented from leaving earlier this year has returned to Ukraine. Bohdan Yermokhin, who turned 18 on Sunday, appealed to Zelenskiy this month to help bring him back to Ukraine. \u201cI believed I would be in Ukraine, but not on this day,\u201d Yermokhin told Reuters while eating at a petrol station after crossing the border. About 3,000 mostly Ukrainian trucks, including those carrying fuel and humanitarian aid, were stuck on the Polish side of the border on Sunday due to a more than 10-day blockade by Polish truckers, Ukrainian authorities said. Polish truckers earlier this month blocked roads to three border crossings with Ukraine to protest against what they see as government inaction over a loss of business to foreign competitors since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Air defence units in Moscow intercepted a drone targeting the city late Sunday, mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. Sobyanin, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said units in the Elektrostal district in the capital\u2019s east had intercepted the drone. No casualties or damage were initially reported. Air defences had also thwarted a drone attack on the Russian capital overnight to Sunday, authorities said earlier. Russia launched 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones targeting Kyiv and the Cherkasy and Poltava regions overnight into Sunday, the Ukrainian military said, of which 15 were shot down. The overnight strikes on Kyiv were the second attack on the Ukrainian capital in 48 hours, said the city\u2019s military administration spokesperson, Serhii Popko. Five people including a three-year-old girl were injured in Russian artillery shelling of Kherson on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said. \u201cAll of them sustained shrapnel wounds. The child and the grandmother were walking in the yard. Enemy artillery hit them near the entrance,\u201d Klymenko said on the Telegram messaging app. The pro-war Russian nationalist Igor Girkin, who is in custody awaiting trial for inciting extremism, said he wanted to run for president even though he understood the March election would be a \u201csham\u201d with the winner already clear. Girkin, who is also known by the alias Igor Strelkov, has repeatedly said Russia faces revolution and even civil war unless President Vladimir Putin\u2019s military top brass fight the war in Ukraine more effectively. A former Federal Security Service (FSB) officer who helped Russia to annex Crimea in 2014 and then to organise pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine, Girkin said before his arrest that he and his supporters were entering politics."

The president of Ukraine is considering and weighing the different pros and cons,\u201d Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing, adding that holding elections during the war with Russia would entail \u201cunprecedented\u201d challenges. Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine for weeks early this morning, hitting critical infrastructure in the west and south of Ukraine and destroying private houses and commercial buildings in Kharkiv. Russia intends to stick to a nuclear test ban moratorium despite withdrawing its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban treaty, the foreign ministry said. A Russian court sentenced Pyotr Verzilov, an activist linked to the Pussy Riot group, to eight and a half years in prison for breaching Russia\u2019s strict censorship laws. The 36-year-old was sentenced \u201cin absentia\u201d today as he has not lived in Russia since 2020, reported MediaZona, an opposition news site that he founded. A diplomatic adviser to Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has resigned, taking responsibility for a prank call fiasco, according to the PM. Earlier this week, Meloni\u2019s office said she had a phone conversation with a Russian comedian who successfully posed as a high-ranking African Union official. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has claimed that some western weapons supplied to Ukraine were finding their way to the Middle East through the illegal arms market and being sold to the Taliban. A handful of Ukrainian troops who have reached the occupied side of the Dnipro River are clinging to a foothold in Russian-controlled territory in the south of the country despite a fierce bombardment. The Kremlin has dismissed a new package of US sanctions, saying Russia had learned to \u201covercome\u201d such economic hurdles since the Ukraine conflict began. Washington yesterday sanctioned several Russian energy and finance companies it said were supporting Russia\u2019s offensive against Ukraine. The chief of Austria\u2019s Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) has said the timing of a sale or spin-off of its extensive operations in Russia is largely out of his control. Russia made up 45% of RBI\u2019s profit in the first nine months of the year, though it reported a 30% decline in the volume of its loans in Russia in the third quarter from a year earlier. The Russian Orthodox church called for an apology from Alla Pugacheva, the country\u2019s most renowned pop singer who returned home this week, over her criticism of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. An evacuation train that came under fire while en route to Irpin, in northern Ukraine, is now on display in St Michael\u2019s square in Kyiv as part of an exhibition. The UK ministry of defence has released its latest update on the situation in Ukraine. In the south, the Ukrainian advance remains relatively static between the two main lines of Russia\u2019s well prepared defensive positions. Around the Donbas town of Avdiivka, a large-scale Russian assault has floundered on strong Ukrainian defences. A major factor in this phenomenon has highly likely been the relative side-lining of tactical air power: both sides have maintained credible air defences, preventing combat jets from providing effective air support for assaults. Above all, the geographic size of the conflict has hampered the offensives: both sides have struggled to assemble uncommitted striking forces capable of a breakthrough because most of their mobilised troops are needed to hold the 1,200km line of contact. The US has begun sending smaller military aid packages to Ukraine to stretch out support given a stalemate in Congress over providing funding for Ukraine, the White House said on Friday. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the intention was to extend the ability to support Ukraine for as long as possible while Congress debates new aid. The US has announced a new $425 m (\u00a3343m) military assistance package for Ukraine that features air defence, artillery munitions and anti-tank weapons. That equipment, which also includes small arms ammunition, demolitions munitions and other items, is part of $125m in gear drawn from existing military stocks. The package also includes $300m in laser-guided munitions to counter drones, which will be funded via the Ukraine security assistance initiative (USAI). That means it will not immediately arrive on the battlefield, as the munitions need to be procured from the defence industry or partners, rather than drawn from American stockpiles. The Pentagon said in a statement that the USAI funding was provided by a continuing resolution passed by Congress in late September to temporarily fund the government. But it is now gone \u2013 the package \u201cexhausts the remaining USAI funds currently available to support Ukraine\u201d, the statement said. The Pentagon also made the case for Ukraine aid, saying it is \u201ca smart investment in our national security\u201d. It said: \u201cIt helps to prevent a larger conflict in the region and deters potential aggression elsewhere, while strengthening our defense industrial base and creating highly skilled jobs for the American people.\u201d The US is by far the biggest donor of security assistance to Ukraine, committing more than $44.2bn since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022. But some Republicans oppose continued assistance for Kyiv, putting the future of American aid for Ukraine in doubt. Ukrainian shelling of the Russian-occupied part of the southern Kherson region killed seven people today, the Moscow-installed occupational authorities said. \u201cThe Ukrainian army attacked civilian infrastructure in the Chaplynskiy district,\u201d local Moscow-backed Konstantin Basyuk said on Telegram. \u201cAccording to preliminary information, seven people are dead and seven wounded. Medics are fighting for the life of another two people.\u201d The town of Chaplynka lies around 100 kilometres (62 miles) south-east of Kherson, the regional capital controlled by Ukrainian forces. Basyuk said the strikes had targeted the local pensions office. Ukraine retook Kherson from Russian forces last year, but Moscow still controls most of the Kherson region. Serbia\u2019s intelligence chief, who has fostered closer ties with Russia and is under sanctions by the US, resigned today after less than a year in the post, saying he wanted to avoid possible further embargos against the Balkan nation. In July, the US imposed sanctions on Aleksandar Vulin, accusing him of involvement in illegal arms shipments, drug trafficking and misuse of public office. The US treasury department\u2019s office of foreign assets control said that Vulin used his public authority to help a US-sanctioned Serbian arms dealer move illegal arms shipments across Serbia\u2019s borders. Vulin is also accused of involvement in a drug trafficking ring, according to US authorities. Vulin became the director of Serbia\u2019s intelligence agency BIA in December 2022. The close associate of Serbia\u2019s populist president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, had previously served as the army and police chief, according to AP. Vulin is known for advocating close ties with Russia instead of the west, and promoting the concept of a \u201cSerbian World\u201d \u2013 a carbon copy of the \u201cRussian World\u201d advocated by Vladimir Putin \u2013 that would be made up of all ethnic Serbs living in neighbouring states. Vu\u010di\u0107 has said the real reason why Vulin has faced US sanctions is his position toward Russia and not corruption allegations. The US and the EU are looking for my head as a precondition for not imposing sanctions on Serbia. I will not allow myself to be the cause of blackmail and pressure on Serbia and the Serbian world. That is why I submit my irrevocable resignation. My resignation will not change the policy of the USA and the EU towards Serbia, but it will slow down new demands and blackmail,\u201d Vulin said, adding that he won\u2019t stop believing in \u201cthe inevitability of the unification of Serbs and the creation of a Serbian world. In August 2022, Vulin visited Moscow in a rare visit by a European government official to the Russian capital since the start of the war. The trip underscored Belgrade\u2019s refusal to join western sanctions against Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. German chancellor Olaf Scholz has spoke with Chinese president Xi in a video conference today, a German government spokesperson said. The leaders discussed economic cooperation, as well as the Hamas attack on Israel and the situation in the region, the spokesperson said in a statement. Scholz and Xi also discussed the war in Ukraine. Their conversation served to stress that nuclear war must not happen there and cannot be won, according to the statement reported by Reuters. Ukraine has harvested more than 67m tonnes of grain and oilseeds from the new 2023 harvest so far, the agriculture ministry said today. It said 47.2m tonnes of grain and about 20m tonnes of oilseeds had been threshed. The harvest ends late this year, depending on the weather. The volume included 22.4m tonnes of wheat, 5.9m tonnes of barley, 398,200 tonnes of peas, 17.1m tonnes of corn and smaller contributions from other cereals. The ministry also said farmers had harvested 4m tonnes of rapeseed and 11.3m tonnes of sunseed, reports Reuters. Last year\u2019s grain harvest was set to fall to 44.3m tonnes from 53.1m in 2022 as less acreage was sown due to the Russian invasion, according to a forecast. At the same time, gross production of oilseeds was expected to increase to 19.2m tonnes from 18.2m tonnes in 2022 due to a larger sowing area for the more lucrative crop. If the forecasts were correct, it would have added up to 62.5m tonnes \u2013 suggesting a bounceback for the harvest this year. The US has sanctioned a Russian national for helping Russian elites to launder and transfer hundreds of millions of dollars using virtual currency in contravention of existing sanctions imposed after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Ekaterina Zhdanova helped a Russian client hide their source of wealth to transfer more than $2.3m (\u00a31.8m) into western Europe through a fraudulently opened investment account and real estate purchases in 2022, allowing for sanctions evasion, the treasury department said. Zhdanova also used virtual currency exchanges to help oligarchs who had relocated internationally, it said. In one example listed by the department, a Russian oligarch asked Zhdanova to move more than $100m to the United Arab Emirates. She also established a UAE tax residency service for Russian clients and may have helped to obfuscate their identities, the statement said. To facilitate large cross-border transactions, the department said Zhdanova used virtual currency entities, including Garantex, a prominent Russia-based darknet market site and cryptocurrency exchange that was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for operating in Russia\u2019s financial services sector, Reuters reported. The department did not say where it believes Zhdanova is located. \u201cOur action today highlights the consequences of supporting corrupt Kremlin proxies, underscores the United States\u2019s efforts to address the abuse of virtual currency to launder illicit funds, and exposes an illicit actor\u2019s money laundering activities,\u201d state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. Under the US sanctions program that targets certain harmful Russian foreign activities, all of Zhdanova\u2019s assets in the US are blocked and US citizens are prohibited from dealing with her. Russia intends to stick to a nuclear test ban moratorium despite withdrawing its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the foreign ministry has said. \u201cWe intend to keep the moratorium that was introduced more than 30 years ago in place,\u201d said a ministry statement. The US formally withdrew from the landmark 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia in 2019 after claiming that Moscow was violating the accord, an accusation the Kremlin denied. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, proposed to the US and several western European Nato members that there should be a moratorium on the development of missiles previously banned by the INF treaty. But Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, who leads on arms control talks, said the US was \u201cmoving rapidly\u201d towards the deployment of such missiles in both Asia and Europe. \u201cAccordingly, our moratorium, which was announced by the president of the Russian Federation, in the light of such developments, of course, cannot be maintained,\u201d Ryabkov told the Kommersant newspaper. \u201cThe Americans think it doesn\u2019t matter. We believe that they are thereby delivering a new powerful blow to global stability and the security of the respective regions.\u201d The US publicly blamed Russia\u2018s development of the 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile, known in Nato as the SSC-8, as the reason for it leaving the INF treaty. Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine for weeks early this morning, hitting critical infrastructure in the west and south of Ukraine and destroying private houses and commercial buildings in Kharkiv. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 24 Shahed drones out of 40 launched by Russia, with Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv among the targets. Oleh Syniehubov, Kharkiv\u2019s governor, said drones had hit civilian infrastructure and caused fires in and near the city of Kharkiv. He said eight people, including two children, required medical help due to acute stress. A diplomatic adviser to Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni has resigned, taking responsibility for a prank call fiasco, according to the PM. Earlier this week, Meloni\u2019s office said she had a phone conversation with a Russian comedian who successfully posed as a high-ranking African Union official. During the call, which took place in September, Meloni spoke of international \u201cfatigue\u201d with the war in Ukraine and complained that Italy had little support from European partners in dealing with migration. Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive is not going as expected \u2026 It has not changed the fate of the conflict, and everyone understands that [the conflict] could last many years if we don\u2019t find a solution. The Ukrainians are doing what they have to do and we are trying to help them. \u201cThis matter was not handled well, we are all sorry, Ambassador [Francesco] Talo took responsibility for it,\u201d Meloni said, announcing that her aide had quit. The Russian Orthodox church has called for an apology from Alla Pugacheva, the country\u2019s most renowned pop singer who returned home this week, over her criticism of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The 74-year-old Pugacheva, for decades hugely popular in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union, left the country for Israel along with her husband several weeks after the war began. In September 2022, she sparked widespread attention by supporters and opponents of the conflict by saying that Russian soldiers were dying for \u201cillusory goals\u201d and that the country had become \u201ca pariah\u201d. She also suggested that authorities should name her a \u201cforeign agent\u201d \u2013 a statusapplied to her husband, Maxim Galkin, an actor and comedian, Reuters reports. Although Russia enacted a law after the start of the war that called for prison terms or fines for denigrating the armed forces, Pugacheva was not charged. She came back to Russia in May to attend the funeral of the fashion designer Valentin Yudashkin, where the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, was seen kissing her hand. She later left the country, but returned this week, Russian news agencies reported on Friday. Her reason for leaving Israel was not reported. The church spokesperson, Vakhtang Kipshidze, was quoted by the state news agency RIA-Novosti as saying that Russians \u201cwho accompanied their departure by insulting their people or if they made controversial statements should apologise. This also applies to Alla Borisovna\u201d Pugacheva\u2019s patronymic. The church has been a firm supporter of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In a tit-for-tat move, Russia has stripped a Moscow correspondent for Bulgaria\u2019s national radio of accreditation and expelled him after Sofia kicked out a Russian journalist on national security grounds, Reuters reports. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, had called the expulsion of Alexander Gatsak \u201canother unlawful move by Nato against Russian journalists\u201d. Relations between Bulgaria and Russia have been increasingly strained since Bulgaria expelled 70 Russian diplomats last year. Tass reports that earlier today Vladimir Putin said Russia was defending its culture and history in the occupied regions of Ukraine which it claims to have annexed since late last year. It quotes the Russian president saying: Why do we so reverence Alexander Nevsky as a saint? It was precisely for this choice - he thought about preserving the Russian people, and then all the peoples living on the territory of our huge country. In many ways, the same thing is happening today when we speak that we defend our moral values, our history, our culture, our language, including by helping our brothers and sisters in Donbass and Novorossiya to do this. Novorossiya is a historical name for the land of southern Ukraine including Crimea. Nevsky is a significant 13th century figure in Russian history. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that seven employees of Nova Poshta who were injured during the Russian attack on the company\u2019s distribution centre in the north-eastern Kharkiv region on 21 October continue to receive treatment in hospital. Before the war, few but journalists, lawyers and free speech campaigners paid much attention to Slapps, delicious acronym though it is. Strategic lawsuits against public participation: in other words, the rich and powerful using the legal system to silence anyone they don\u2019t want poking around their business. Since Russian troops flooded into Ukraine in February 2022, more people have realised that it might be unwise to allow legitimate scrutiny of those who make fortunes in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and elsewhere in the dictatorships of the former Soviet Union to be censored in this way. The latest Today in Focus tells the tale of a few remarkable Slapps, including one against me. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is considering the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of holding presidential elections next spring, his foreign minister has said. \u201cWe are not closing this page. The president of Ukraine is considering and weighing the different pros and cons,\u201d Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing, adding that holding elections during the war with Russia would entail \u201cunprecedented\u201d challenges. In August, Zelenskiy, responding to calls by a US senator to announce elections in 2024, said that voting could take place during wartime if partners shared the cost, legislators approved, and everyone got to the polls. However, he also expressed concerns. \u201cThe logic is that if you are protecting democracy, then you have to think about this protection even during times of war,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cElections are one of the protections. But there is a reason why elections are prohibited by law during wartime \u2013 it is very difficult to hold them.\u201d In 2019, the former actor and comedian had no political experience other than playing the role of president in a TV series when he won a landslide victory in Ukraine\u2019s presidential election. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has claimed that some western weapons supplied to Ukraine were finding their way to the Middle East through the illegal arms market and being sold to the Taliban. \u201cNow they say: weapons are getting into the Middle East from Ukraine. Well of course they are because they are being sold,\u201d Putin said. \u201cAnd they are being sold to the Taliban and from there they go on to wherever.\u201d Ukraine says it keeps tight control over any weapons supplied to it, but some western security officials have raised concerns and the US has asked Ukraine to do more to tackle the broader issue of corruption. Time magazine reported this week that, \u201cin recent months, the issue of corruption has strained Zelenskiy\u2019s relationship with many of his allies\u201d. It comes after the head of Interpol, J\u00fcrgen Stock, in June 2022 warned that some of the advanced weapons sent to Ukraine would end up in the hands of organised crime groups. Nonetheless, a report about the Ukraine war and the illegal arms trade by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime said in March that there was \u201ccurrently no substantial outflow of weapons from the Ukrainian conflict zone. \u201cHowever, every precedent suggests that, especially if the threat is not addressed proactively and imaginatively, when the current war ends, Ukraine\u2019s battlefields could and will become the new arsenal of anarchy, arming everyone from insurgents in Africa to gangsters in the streets of Europe,\u201d the report said. As winter draws in, Ukrainians are looking up into the cold, clear skies and wondering: When will it start? Everyone expects a repeat of what happened a year ago. A Russian bombing campaign targeted the infrastructure Ukraine needs to get through until spring, chiefly energy. Last winter, millions suffered power cuts. The Russians have been using some of their most formidable missiles sparingly of late, suggesting they may be gathering resources for major attacks. In the southern frontline city of Kherson this week, residents who have grown accustomed to daily bombardment with shells, tank rounds, mortars, bombs and drones were bracing for yet more. In the cafes and the market, there was a certain grim steeliness, given how thoroughly and endlessly Kherson is pummelled. The nights are dark and sleepless: there is no pattern to the barrage, just the random whistles and booms, some far off, some close. But the further west you go, the more the war can seem like something that\u2019s happening to other people. In Lviv, close to the Polish border, anyone fancying a night out last weekend could head to the main square and choose between a boisterous brass ensemble upstairs in a beer hall, a DJ playing drum\u2019n\u2019bass at an achingly hip bar, or just a pleasant stroll with no greater precautions against what might fall from the sky than an umbrella for the rain. Last night, Russia sent forth dozens of Iranian shaheed drones. The governor of Lviv region said 16 were aimed at the west. Ukraine\u2019s air defences took out 11. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d the governor posted on Facebook, \u201cthere are 5 hits in the critical infrastructure in our area. Fortunately, there were no victims or injured. There was a fire, it was quickly eliminated.\u201d It feels like just the beginning. What\u2019s different this year is Ukraine\u2019s capabilities. They have more long-range missiles such as Storm Shadows from the UK. \u201cWe realise that as winter approaches, Russian terrorists will try to do more damage,\u201d Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, posted on Telegram today. \u201cWe will respond to the enemy.\u201d Here is a snapshot of the main battlefield developments in Ukraine since the start of Kyiv\u2019s latest counteroffensive in early June, courtesy of Reuters. After Ukraine made spectacular territorial gains in the second half of 2022, hopes were high in Kyiv and among its allies for further significant successes this year along the frontline of up to 620 miles. Western weaponry including state-of-the-art tanks and long-range missiles had boosted such expectations. But the gains so far have been small, as improved Russian defences proved effective, and any momentum created in the south and east looks to have run out of steam for now. The weather is turning wet, making the ground boggy and difficult to navigate for heavy equipment, though freezing temperatures should eventually harden the earth and improve manoeuvrability as winter sets in. The devastated town of Avdiivka, close to the Russian-held Ukrainian city of Donetsk, has seen periods of fierce bombardment and fighting throughout the war. The pre-war population of 30,000 people has dwindled to around 1,500 as civilians flee missile attacks, shelling and air raids, as well as ground battles that intensified in recent weeks. Russian forces have begun to encircle the town, just as they did with the city of Bakhmut further north earlier in 2023, and while Ukraine has vowed to defend Avdiivka, supply lines in and out are coming under pressure. In late May, Russia\u2019s mercenary Wagner group claimed to have captured Bakhmut after some of the bloodiest fighting of the war. It was the only significant victory Moscow could claim since its forces left Kyiv\u2019s suburbs and then retreated around Kharkiv in the north and Kherson in the south in late 2022. Thousands of troops on both sides died in attritional fighting that reduced Bakhmut to rubble. Its strategic importance has been questioned by some military analysts. Despite that, Ukraine has committed significant resources to regaining territory around Bakhmut, and has reached the southern and western outskirts of the city. Reuters has this dispatch, from near Kreminna, eastern Ukraine, in which a soldier describes recent clashes, and the fatigue that he and his unit are experiencing. Istoryk, a 26-year-old soldier in eastern Ukraine, finally managed to fall asleep one morning, exhausted from the relentless battles against Russian forces in the pinewood forests near Kreminna. His rest was cut short just an hour later when a fresh firefight broke out, forcing the senior combat medic back into action in a fierce and lengthy exchange. \u201cWe had a firefight for over 20 hours,\u201d said Istoryk, identified by his military call sign. \u201cNon-stop fighting, assaults, evacuations, and you know, I managed it,\u201d he told a Reuters reporter visiting his position on Thursday. \u201cAnd we all managed it. We aren\u2019t very fresh, and right now we need to find strength.\u201d The soldiers also know that Russia has a far bigger army and more weapons and ammunition, raising the uncomfortable question of how Ukraine can ever repel the invaders once and for all in Europe\u2019s bloodiest conflict since the second world war. Istoryk, speaking in a broad west Ukrainian accent, recounts his grim experiences with a winning smile. Asked whether he could continue to fight for another year, or even two, he replied: \u201cI think so. For sure.\u201d A handful of Ukrainian troops who have reached the occupied side of the Dnipro River are clinging to a foothold in Russian-controlled territory in the south of the country despite a fierce bombardment. The marines have secured a beachhead that could allow Ukraine to reclaim more of the Kherson region that lies between Ukrainian territory and Crimea, seized by Russia in 2014, a fillip for a counter-offensive showing few gains elsewhere, but only if they can find a way to bring armoured vehicles and heavy weapons across the wide river separating the two militaries. When the Ukrainian marines landed on the east bank in mid-October, Russian infantry counterattacked, backed by artillery and drones. \u201cThe coastline and floodplains are littered with the bodies of Ukrainian fighters,\u201d said Volodymyr Saldo, the Putin-appointed governor of occupied Kherson. The Russian president called the attack \u201ca mistake\u201d, declaring at a press conference that the Ukrainians \u201chave started the long-announced and expected next counteroffensive now in the Kherson direction \u2013 there is no result yet\u201d. This week, however, Rybar, one of the Russian military bloggers whose information is regarded as more credible than official propaganda, said fresh teams of marines had crossed the river by night to replenish the Ukrainian contingent. A security source described the Ukrainian position as \u201cstable\u201d. The Kremlin has dismissed a new package of US sanctions, saying Russia had learnt to \u201covercome\u201d such economic hurdles since the Ukraine conflict began. Washington yesterday sanctioned several Russian energy and finance companies as well as individuals and firms in Turkey, China and the United Arab Emirates it said were supporting Russia\u2019s offensive against Ukraine, reports AFP.. \u201cOf course, sanctions create additional problems. But I will repeat once again, we have adapted to sanctions... We have learned how to overcome them,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. A massive hike in military spending and redirecting vital energy exports to China and India has helped Moscow avoid the West\u2019s early hopes that sanctions could push Russia into economic collapse. However, hundreds of Western companies have left Russia, and a volatile currency and high inflation continue to cause concern among Russian policymakers. After hitting statutory limits on import-export lending, South Korea is gathering local banks to help Poland buy $22 billion worth of weapons in Seoul\u2019s largest arms sale, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters. South Korea\u2019s defence exports totalled about $17 billion in 2022, according to its defence ministry, up from $7.25 billion a year before, as the war in Ukraine opened a door for Seoul\u2019s weapons exports. The 2022 arms deal with Poland established Seoul as a major player in global weapons exports, largely dominated by the US and Russia. Seoul is also seeking deeper security ties in Europe, an ambition with ideal timing for Poland, which borders Ukraine, as it ramps up arms imports amid tensions with Russia. \u201cFive local banks are reviewing a syndicated loan as a support measure\u201d to help Poland finance its purchase of South Korean rocket artillery systems and fighter jets, a South Korean government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing planning. It is the first indication that Seoul is working to remove Poland\u2019s financing hurdles to enable the two countries to strike South Korea\u2019s biggest-ever weapons arms deal, estimated at around 30 trillion won ($22.72 billion). The chief of Austria\u2019s Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) has said the timing of a sale or spin-off of its extensive operations in Russia was largely out of his control. One of the banks in Europe most exposed to Russia, RBI has been studying options for its business there since the invasion of Ukraine last year, warning its exit may take some time, reports Reuters. The bank said in a quarterly financial report today that it would \u201ccontinue to progress potential transactions\u201d but warned that market conditions were \u201chighly complex\u201d. It said: \u201cThe local and international laws and regulations governing the sale of businesses in Russia are subject to constant change.\u201d Scores of foreign businesses have quit Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 as western sanctions made it increasingly difficult to stay, but the Kremlin has also introduced measures to control asset sales. Russia made up 45% of RBI\u2019s profit in the first nine months of the year, though it reported a 30% decline in the volume of its loans in Russia in the third quarter from a year earlier. Earnings that RBI makes in Russia stay with the local subsidiary because of the western sanctions. RBI\u2019s chief executive, Johann Strobl, who in early August said the bank was aiming for a spin-off of the Russian business by the end of 2023, later that month would not commit to a timeframe. Today he said: \u201cWe depend on numerous regulatory approvals from Russian and European authorities and can therefore influence the pace only to a very limited extent.\u201d Russia\u2019s attempt to compare the country\u2019s Olympic committee suspension with the situation of Israeli athletes following the start of the conflict between Israel and Hamas was out of place, the International Olympic Committee has said. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday said the IOC was aligning itself with western political decisions after the Olympic body had said any discrimination against athletes at the games would be swiftly dealt with because they are not responsible for the decisions of their governments. The IOC had been responding to a question regarding Israeli athletes participating at next year\u2019s Paris Olympics and the potential refusal of other nations\u2019 athletes to compete against them over the ongoing conflict. Lavrov called the IOC statement \u201cshameful\u201d, saying it \u201cproves its political bias\u201d. He said: \u201cEverything that is [in the] interests of western countries, primarily the United States, it actively supports and tries to find formulations that will generally approve of this line.\u201d However, an IOC spokesperson said: \u201cThis [Russian] is a unique situation and cannot be compared to any other war or conflict in the world, because the measures taken and recommendations made by the IOC are a consequence of the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian army during the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022.\u201d The IOC did not ban the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) until last month after it recognised regional organisations from four territories annexed from Ukraine. The IOC said on 12 October the ROC would be banned with immediate effect after it recognised olympic councils from the regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. \u201cThis constitutes a breach of the Olympic charter because it violates the territorial integrity of the national Olympic committee of Ukraine, as recognised by the IOC in accordance with the Olympic charter,\u201d the IOC spokesperson said. My colleague Tom Burgis is in Kyiv. He reports that claims by Elon Musk about a purported lack of insurgency from Ukrainians living under Russian occupation gloss over how troops are constantly surveilling people and allegedly denying them access to basic services if they do not take take up Russian passports. A Russian court has sentenced Pyotr Verzilov, an activist linked to the Pussy Riot group, to eight and a half years in prison for breaching Russia\u2019s strict censorship laws. The 36-year-old was sentenced \u201cin absentia\u201d today as he has not lived in Russia since 2020, reported MediaZona, an opposition news site that he founded. The court said Verzilov\u2019s social media posts about Russian atrocities in the Ukrainian city of Bucha were \u201cfalse information\u201d - a criminal offence according to anti-dissent laws Moscow introduced in the opening days of its assault on Ukraine, AFP reports. Russia has sentenced dozens of high-profile critics to years in prison since it launched its offensive last February. Verzilov has told Russian media he travelled to Ukraine at the beginning of the conflict to film a documentary but was now fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. The case was based on social media posts by Verzilov in which he shared videos of dead civilians lined up in body bags in Bucha and compared Russian soldiers to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine for weeks early on Friday, hitting critical infrastructure in the west and south of Ukraine and destroying private houses and commercial buildings in Kharkiv. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 24 \u201cShahed\u201d drones out of 40 launched by Russia, with Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv among the targets. Ukraine\u2019s air force said the latest drones were launched in several waves and flew to different regions in small groups. Air alerts in some regions lasted for several hours during the night. No casualties were reported, but Lviv\u2019s governor said an infrastructure facility had been hit five times during the attacks on his region, a military facility was hit in Ivano-Frankivsk, and Kharkiv\u2019s governor said drones had hit civilian infrastructure and caused fires in and near the city of Kharkiv. Officials say Ukraine is bracing for a second winter of Russian air strikes on the energy system, which they warn is more vulnerable than it was last year as it has less excess capacity and little in the way of spare equipment. \u201cWe realise that as winter approaches, Russian terrorists will try to do more damage. We will respond to the enemy,\u201d president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said of the attack. In Russia, the foreign office spokesperson Maria Zakharova has dismissed the latest round of US sanctions against Russia. On state television, Reuters reports she said: \u201cThis is a continuation of the policy of inflicting as they call it \u2013 a strategic defeat on us. They will have to wait in vain forever before that happens\u201d. On Thursday, the US state department imposed new sanctions targeted at Russia\u2019s future energy capabilities, sanctions evasion and the manufacture of suicide drones. The Biden administration added a dozen Russian companies to a trade blacklist, and announced a crackdown on sanctions evasion in the UAE, Turkey and China. Vladimir Putin on Thursday signed a law withdrawing Russia\u2019s ratification of the global treaty banning nuclear weapons tests. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, criticised Russia for leaving the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and called on Moscow to commit not to test. \u201cUnfortunately, it represents a significant step in the wrong direction, taking us further from, not closer to, entry into force\u201d of the treaty, Blinken said in a statement. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Mattha Busby will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, has announced that the city has received three new fire-fighting vehicles from international donors. In a message posted to Telegram, Klitschko said: We thank our international partners for their comprehensive support and help that is very important for Kyiv. After all, in the conditions of war, the city needs to respond promptly and effectively to challenges and emergency situations. Let me remind you that since the beginning of the large-scale war, Kyiv has received a total of 54 fire trucks and 82 city buses as aid from European partners and benefactors. One of the overnight Russian drone strikes on Ukraine hit Kharkiv\u2019s college of transport technology. AFP has put out a longer video of firefighters working at the scene. Ukraine\u2019s emergency service has posted to social media to say that the fire in Kharkiv caused by the overnight drone strike has been extinguished. It states that at its height it covered 1,000 sq metres, and \u201calmost 70 rescuers and 12 units of equipment\u201d were involved in the battle to contain it. Russian shelling in Kherson has interrupted water and electricity supply in parts of the city, Suspilne reports. It cites the head of the city administration, saying: \u201cRepair crews are working, electricity is planned to be restored during the day.\u201d Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine for weeks early on Friday, hitting critical infrastructure in the west and south of Ukraine and destroying private houses and commercial buildings in Kharkiv. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 24 \u201cShahed\u201d drones out of 40 launched by Russia, with Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv among the targets. Reuters reports that the air force said the latest drones were launched in several waves and flew to different regions in small groups. Air alerts in some regions lasted for several hours during the night. Lawmakers have expressed concern that the resurgent conflict in the Middle East has diverted western attention from the battle in Ukraine, with MP Kira Rudik posting to social media that \u201csuch a news is increasingly commonplace for you, though it is so real and painful for us. The war in Europe continues. And we need your support.\u201d Maksym Kozytskiy, Lviv\u2019s governor, said an infrastructure facility had been hit five times during the attacks on his region, but did not elaborate on the damage. He reported no casualties. In the nearby region of Ivano-Frankivsk a military facility was hit, governor Svitlana Onishchuk said. Oleh Kiper, Odesa\u2019s regional governor, reported a strike on an infrastructure facility in the southern region. Oleh Synehubov, Kharkiv\u2019s governor, said drones had hit civilian infrastructure and caused fires in and near the city of Kharkiv. He said eight people, including two children, required medical help due to acute stress. Officials say Ukraine is bracing for a second winter of Russian air strikes on the energy system, which they warn is more vulnerable than it was last year as it has less excess capacity and little in the way of spare equipment. \u201cWe realize that as winter approaches, Russian terrorists will try to do more damage. We will respond to the enemy,\u201d president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said of the attack. In Russia, its foreign office spokesperson Maria Zakharova has dismissed the latest round of US sanctions against Russia. On state television, Reuters reports that she said: \u201cThis is a continuation of the policy of inflicting as they call it \u2013 a strategic defeat on us. They will have to wait in vain forever before that happens.\u201d On Thursday, the US state department imposed new sanctions targeted at Russia\u2019s future energy capabilities, sanctions evasion and the manufacture of suicide drones. The Biden administration added a dozen Russian companies to a trade blacklist, and announced a crackdown on sanctions evasion in the UAE, Turkey and China. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to social media to say that air defence was active in 10 regions of Ukraine overnight, and that there were no reported casualties from the Russian drone strikes that got through. Ukraine\u2019s president said: Our aircraft, air defence, and mobile fire groups worked hard in 10 regions of Ukraine, from east and south to the west. I thank our warriors for every kill! More than half of the enemy drones were shot down. Unfortunately, there were also hits. There were no casualties, according to preliminary reports. Consequences are being addressed. We are strengthening air defence and mobile fire groups. As winter approaches, Russian terrorists will try to cause more harm. We will be fighting back. The message was accompanied by a short video clip showing firefighters tackling a blaze at an unspecified location. Suspilne, Ukraine\u2019s state broadcaster, in its morning news roundup, states that Ukraine\u2019s armed forces claim to have shot down 24 out of 40 drones launched at Ukrainian territory by Russia overnight. In its report, it states that in the west of Ukraine, a military object was attacked in Ivano-Frankivsk region, where a fire started. It has been extinguished. Also in the west, \u201cfive drone strikes were recorded at a critical infrastructure facility\u201d in Lviv region. The governor there reported no casualties. Suspilne also reports: Around midnight, drones struck Kharkiv and its suburbs: a civilian object, private houses, an educational institution, and cars were damaged. There are no injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Odesa regional governor Oleh Kiper has said an infrastructure object was struck by a Russian drone overnight. He reported no casualties or significant damage, and claimed that two Shahed drones had been taken down by air defence. Russia claims its air defence systems destroyed a Ukrainian drone in the sky over the Belgorod region, Tass reports. The US is expected to deliver $425m in new military aid to Ukraine for its fight against Russia, including about $300m in long-term funding to buy laser-guided munitions designed to take out drones, according to the AP news agency, which attributes the line to unnamed US officials. It\u2019s understood the long-term money will be provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which funds contracts for larger weapons systems that need to be either built or modified by defence companies. The new agency says the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid has not yet been publicly announced. An announcement is expected on Friday. This would be the 50th package of aid pulled from Pentagon shelves and it resembles an aid package about a week ago that was for $150m. The smaller totals for the drawdowns come as Pentagon funding for the Ukraine war shrinks. President Vladimir Putin on Thursday signed a law withdrawing Russia\u2019s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Moscow said the move was needed to establish parity with the US. Putin said that rescinding the ratification of the treaty would \u201cmirror\u201d the stand taken by the US, which has signed but not ratified the nuclear test ban. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken said that Russia\u2019s move \u201crepresents a significant step in the wrong direction\u201d but added that \u201cRussian officials say Russia\u2019s planned move to withdraw its ratification does not mean that it will resume testing, and we urge Moscow to hold to those statements,\u201d Blinken said. Putin has noted that some experts argue for the necessity of conducting nuclear tests, but said he had not formed an opinion on the issue. According to the UN, the Soviet Union carried out its last nucelar test in 1990. The UK\u2019s last test was in 1991, and the US in 1992. The Russian Federation has never carried out a test. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said last month that Moscow would continue to respect the ban and will only resume nuclear tests if Washington does first. The CTBT was adopted in 1996 and bans all nuclear explosions anywhere in the world. But the treaty was never fully implemented. In addition to the US, it has yet to be ratified by China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, Iran and Egypt. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Russian president Vladimir Putin has signed a bill withdrawing Russia\u2019s ratification of a global nuclear test ban. US secretary of state Antony Blinken criticised the move and called on Moscow to commit not to test. \u201cUnfortunately, it represents a significant step in the wrong direction, taking us further from, not closer to, entry into force\u201d of the treaty, Blinken said in a statement. More on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: Russia rejected comments from Ukraine\u2019s most senior military official that their nearly two-year conflict had reached a stalemate. \u201cNo, it has not reached a stalemate,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \u201cRussia is steadily carrying out the special military operation. All the goals that were set should be fulfilled,\u201d he added, using the Kremlin\u2019s term for its full-scale military intervention. Peskov was responding to an interview in British media with Ukraine\u2019s commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Gen Valery Zaluzhny, who said the war in Ukraine was \u201cat a stalemate\u201d and there was likely to be \u201cno deep and beautiful breakthrough\u201d soon in the counteroffensive against Russia. Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, said on Thursday she was confident that the European Union next month would advance Ukraine\u2019s bid to join the bloc at a summit seen as a key milestone in Kyiv\u2019s efforts to integrate with the west. Germany proposed a detailed and innovative roadmap to expand the EU that would give candidate countries such as Ukraine early benefits including observer status at leaders\u2019 summits in Brussels before full membership. Mike Johnson, the US Republican House of Representatives speaker, has said that a bill pairing Ukraine aid with US border security \u201cwill come next\u201d, after the body\u2019s vote on a standalone Israel aid measure. Russia said on Thursday it had handed jail terms to two Ukrainian soldiers who fought in the city of Mariupol, as it continued to put dozens of captive soldiers on trial. Thousands of Ukrainian fighters were taken prisoner after Russia seized control of Mariupol last May, some of whom were sent to Russia or tried by Moscow-backed courts in occupied east Ukraine. Rights groups and western countries have criticised Moscow for putting captured Ukrainian soldiers on trial. Russian drones hit civilian targets and triggered a fire early on Friday in and near Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Synehubov, writing on Telegram, said some of the attacks targeted civilian infrastructure in the city, in Ukraine\u2019s north-east. Russian shelling on Thursday killed two people in Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region and damaged a critical infrastructure facility there, causing power cuts, local officials reported. Russia has claimed Ukraine was risking a nuclear disaster, saying nine Ukrainian drones were shot down by Russian forces near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear station, Europe\u2019s largest atomic power plant. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russia\u2019s foreign ministry, said: \u201cKyiv is continuing to \u2018play with fire\u2019 and is carrying out criminal and irresponsible provocations.\u201d Polish truckers will block several border crossings with Ukraine starting next week in protest at what they say is Ukrainian hauliers\u2019 free rein in Poland that is hurting their business, a co-organiser of the protest said. The Biden administration today added 12 Russian companies to a trade blacklist for supplying Russia\u2019s military with drones that could be used to aid Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the commerce department said in a statement. Russia is preparing to attack Ukraine\u2019s critical infrastructure once the temperatures drop, according to Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council secretary, Oleksiy Danilov."

            "title": "Nikki Haley wins Koch endorsement for Republican presidential nomination",
            "date": "2023-11-28T18:35:40Z",
            "content": "The influential rightwing US billionaire Charles Koch endorsed Nikki Haley for the Republican presidential nomination, choosing the former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador over Donald Trump, the clear frontrunner, and Ron DeSantis, the hard-right Florida governor. \u201cThe moment we face requires a tested leader with the governing judgment and policy experience to pull our nation back from the brink,\u201d Emily Seidel, senior adviser to Americans for Prosperity Action, the political arm of the Koch network, wrote in a memo first reported by the New York Times. \u201cNikki Haley is that leader.\u201d Trump is the clear leader in polling, nationally and in battleground states. But Haley has climbed into second, passing DeSantis with assured debate-stage performances (in contests Trump skipped) and consequent fundraising success. In her memo, Seidel lamented recent Republican electoral defeats widely seen to be fueled by Trumpist extremism and by the conservative movement as a whole on issues prominently including threats to abortion rights. \u201cRepublicans have been nominating bad candidates who are going against America\u2019s core principles [a]nd voters are rejecting them,\u201d the Americans for Prosperity memo said. But Seidel also accused Democrats of \u201cresponding with extreme policies that also cut against core American principles\u201d and said voters wanted to \u201cmove on\u201d from a political era represented by Trump and Joe Biden, who contested the 2020 election. Polls do show that more Americans think Biden is too old for a second Oval Office term, at 81, than think the same about Trump, who is 77. Seidel wrote, \u201cOur internal polling confirms what our activists are hearing and seeing from voters in the early primary states: Nikki Haley is in the best position to defeat Donald Trump in the primaries. \u201cBetween her surging to second place in the polls since August and being well-positioned among supporters of the other candidates, she is in a strong position to gather more support. \u201cIn addition, our internal polling consistently shows that Nikki Haley is by far the strongest candidate Republicans could put up against Joe Biden in a general election \u2013 winning every key battleground state and up nationally by nearly 10 points. \u201cWhile our polling shows Donald Trump loses to Joe Biden, Nikki Haley outperforms Trump by eight to 14 points in the key presidential battleground states.\u201d Haley, Seidel said, could also \u201cboost [Republican] candidates up and down the ballot, winning the key independent and moderate voters that Trump has no chance to win\u201d. The Koch network was not expected to back Trump, having indicated its wish for a new candidate in a similar memo earlier this year. On Tuesday, a Trump spokesperson called Americans for Prosperity \u201cthe political arm of the China First, America Last movement\u201d, which was spending \u201cshady money [and choosing] to endorse a pro-China, open borders, and globalist candidate in Nikki \u2018Birdbrain\u2019 Haley\u201d. Haley was appointed to her former UN role by Trump. The 51-year-old said she was \u201chonoured to have the support of Americans for Prosperity Action, including its millions of grassroots members all across the country \u2026 We have a country to save.\u201d A DeSantis spokesperson said the Koch endorsement showed the conservative \u201cestablishment \u2026 lining up behind a moderate who has no mathematical pathway of defeating the former president. \u201cEvery dollar spent on Nikki Haley\u2019s candidacy should be reported as an in-kind [contribution] to the Trump campaign. No one has a stronger record of beating the establishment than Ron DeSantis, and this time will be no different.\u201d Among commentators, Norman Ornstein, an emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, issued a warning over claims that Haley is a conservative moderate. \u201cPerennial memo to reporters and editors: any reference to Nikki Haley as a \u2018moderate\u2019 is journalistic malpractice,\u201d Ornstein wrote. \u201cNational abortion ban. Slash social security and Medicare. Blow up the federal workforce. Helluva platform.\u201d But Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic pollster, suggested that the Koch network may not be throwing its endorsement away. Offering \u201ca reminder to everyone writing about Nikki Haley today\u201d, Rosenberg said: \u201cTrump is only at 60% in the primary now. 40% of Republicans are not currently supporting him. This is a big number. \u201cTrump is under 50% in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina [the first three states to vote]. A majority of Republicans in these early states are not supporting him.\u201d"

            "title": "The Republican presidential debate was a televised temper tantrum | Moira Donegan",
            "date": "2023-11-09T16:00:39Z",
            "content": "Because I did something terrible in a past life and have to be punished for it in this one, on Wednesday night I watched the Republican presidential debate. It was the third in a series of televised temper tantrums by a dwindling field of eligible candidates, all pretending that there is a meaningful contest for the Republican presidential nomination and that any of them have the slightest chance of winning it. In the past, these events have ranged from the chaotic to the deranged, as characters like Tim Scott put a smiling, chipper, aw-shucks sheen on a lurid vision of enforced male supremacy, Ron DeSantis publicly indulges wild fantasies about sending American soldiers to conduct summary executions of Mexican drug cartel leaders on the soil of a sovereign foreign nation, and Chris Christie puts on a poor imitation of someone who believes in his own relevance. And like the past debates, there was plenty of rancor and personal barbs on Wednesday night, plenty of morbid daydreaming about future regimes of social control, and plenty of fact-free declarations about the supposed causes of America\u2019s plights. There was yelling, and there were insults. Somehow, the whole thing still managed to be incredibly tedious. Donald Trump, the man who will be the Republican nominee unless he dies before next November, was not on stage. The candidates did their usual dance of trying not to attack Trump or alienate his base \u2013 which meant, in effect, that none of them could make much of a case for themselves. Nikki Haley, once a member of Trump\u2019s cabinet, somewhat weakly suggested that Trump was not the right candidate \u201cfor now\u201d. Even Chris Christie, whose candidacy is largely seen as a kamikaze mission meant to hurt Trump rather than a serious bid for office, could barely manage to point out that the frontrunner\u2019s legal problems \u2013 he faces 91 felony charges \u2013 would probably distract him from the duties of office. For all of the five contenders on stage \u2013 Haley, Christie, DeSantis, Scott and Vivek Ramaswamy \u2013 their very candidacy suggests a discomfort with Trump: if they really thought he was the best guy for the job, they wouldn\u2019t be running. But a taboo on criticizing Trump remains the one constant that unites the fractious, dysfunctional and internally chaotic Republican party, the one thing that all of them know it would end their political careers to do. They couldn\u2019t go after Trump. So they went after each other. It would be wrong to say that the candidates\u2019 attacks on one another were exactly ideologically driven. As they gave rambling, euphemism-laden, largely dishonest answers to a series of policy questions, it was hard to discern anything like a coherent policy orientation from any of them \u2013 save for Haley, who as in every debate emphasized her foreign policy credentials and seemed interested in reviving some early-century neoconservative positions about the efficacy and usefulness of American foreign intervention. Others wandered and waffled in their policy prescriptions: when they were asked a question that confused or frustrated them, as happened frequently, both the Florida governor DeSantis and South Carolina senator Tim Scott would pivot to bizarre non-sequiturs about closing the southern border. Ramaswamy pushed an isolationist, \u201cAmerica-first\u201d approach, but nevertheless echoed calls by DeSantis to use the military to discipline southern border immigration. (Ramaswamy, it should be noted, did distinguish himself by also cautioning about crime and immigration at the Canadian border. \u201cBuild both walls,\u201d he said.) Tim Scott, a Christian conservative pitching his candidacy as a return to traditional social hierarchies, \u201cfaith-based morals\u201d and compassion, called for a military strike on Iran. They decried protests in support of Palestinian human rights as \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d and vowed to deport foreign students who participated, and to cut off the funding for any college or university that did not sufficiently suppress pro-Palestinian speech. They seemed united in encouraging Israel to take a genocidal, eliminationist approach to Palestinians in Gaza, with DeSantis telling Benjamin Netanyahu to \u201cfinish the job\u201d, Haley instructing him to \u201cfinish them\u201d, and Ramaswamy offering a disturbing fantasy about severed Palestinian heads being displayed on spikes. The candidates also largely agreed, as it happened, that they would cut Medicare and social security benefits. They set about arguing with each other about how much. The biggest rivalry of the night was between a pair who are emerging as recurring antagonists in these debates: Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy. The pair have opposing visions of foreign policy, with Haley calling for greater engagement and intervention abroad and Ramaswamy serving as a conduit for the Republican party\u2019s post-2016 return to nativist isolationism. But they also represent two distinct career paths for Republican politicians. Haley\u2019s rabid, sadistic conservatism is the result of an old-fashioned kind of political vetting \u2013 a long career of political ascent, coupled with an affect of credentialed competence. Ramaswamy, by contrast, is a public buffoon, someone with no political experience who has gained his spot on the debate stage with provocative, hateful, algorithmically boosted social media content of outlandish public quackery. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting, then, that the two had their most pointed clash over TikTok. The pair had been fighting all night: Ramaswamy made a misogynist remark calling Haley \u201cDick Cheney in three-inch heels\u201d. Haley shot back that her shoes were five-inch heels, and quipped, somewhat nonsensically, that she wore them \u201cfor ammunition\u201d. But they fought most bitterly when moderators asked the candidates if they would ban TikTok, the social media app that has become a bete noire on the right. Ramaswamy jumped in to point out that Haley had criticized him for campaigning on TikTok, even though her adult daughter also used the app \u2013 he suggested that Haley was not exercising adequate control over her family. Haley told him to leave her daughter out of it, and called him scum. It was a mistake, and it was also, perhaps, one of the more relatable moments for Nikki Haley, a politician so stuffy and rehearsed that one wonders if she has ever had a thought that does not occur to her in a pollster\u2019s voice. Ramaswamy is scum: he\u2019s self-interested and cynical, indifferent to truth, with a black hole of ambition in the place where other people might have a soul. She was right to be angry. But public expressions of anger rarely serve women. But what might have been most conspicuous about the debate was what was largely absent from it: for more than an hour and a half, the moderators did not ask about abortion, even though the issue has dominated American electoral politics up and down the ballot for nearly a year and a half. Anger over the overturning of Roe v Wade has become an abiding motivator for voters, with the issue persisting in relevance long after most pundits thought it would fade from national attention, and it is driving unlikely wins for Democratic candidates and their priorities. Abortion had delivered electoral wins for Democrats just on Tuesday, when the issue drove voters to the polls nationwide. Abortion proved to be a decisive issue not only in Ohio, where an abortion rights amendment to the state constitution was ratified by a wide margin, but also played a pivotal role in races in Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. When the moderators finally asked about \u201cthe way forward\u201d on abortion, in their last question of the night, the candidates mostly hemmed and hawed. Some backtracked or hedged their anti-choice stances; others doubled down. They could not deliver a real answer for the same reasons they could not attack Donald Trump: neither stating their real positions against abortion or admitting that the issue has become a political albatross for the Republican party would be viable paths for their continued careers. They\u2019re not ready to make a real argument on the issue to the American people. Luckily for them, I suppose, none of them will have to. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist"

            "date": "2023-11-23T13:10:36Z",
            "content": "Geert Wilders described it as the \u201cmost beautiful day\u201d of his political life. But for many across the Netherlands, news that Wilders\u2019 far-right, anti-Islam party had emerged with the most votes in Wednesday\u2019s election set off alarm bells over what might lie ahead in a country once regarded as a beacon of tolerance. \u201cThese election results are shocking for Dutch Muslims,\u201d said Muhsin K\u00f6ktas of the Contact Body for Muslims and Government. \u201cWe did not expect such a party with a programme that is against the basic principles of the rule of law to be so big.\u201d At the helm of the Party for Freedom (PVV), Wilders has long taken aim at Islam, describing it as a fascist ideology of \u201ca retarded culture\u201d and a \u201cbackward religion\u201d. Since 2004, he has been under police protection and in 2016 was convicted of discrimination after he called Moroccans \u201cscum\u201d at a campaign rally. Though he sought to soften his anti-Islam rhetoric in the lead-up to the elections, the party\u2019s manifesto includes a ban on mosques, the Qur\u2019an and Islamic headscarves in government buildings. As his party\u2019s gains became clear on Wednesday evening, Wilders vowed to push policies \u201cwithin the law and constitution\u201d. The apparent change in tone was of little comfort to K\u00f6ktas. \u201cWe have great concerns about the future of Islam and Muslims in the Netherlands,\u201d he said. He hoped that people from across the Netherlands would join together to defend and protect the rule of law. \u201cThis is absolutely necessary, not only for the future of Muslims but also for the future of the peaceful Dutch society,\u201d he added. With nearly all votes counted, preliminary results from Wednesday\u2019s election showed PVV taking 37 seats, more than any other party. \u201cThe distress and the fear are enormous,\u201d said Habib El Kaddouri, who leads a Dutch organisation representing Dutch Moroccans. \u201cWilders is known for his ideas about Muslims and Moroccans. We are afraid that he will portray us as second-class citizens.\u201d While it remains to be seen whether Wilders can cobble together enough support to form a majority or become prime minister, El Kaddouri pointed to the wider message sent by the Dutch embracing a man who has been labelled as a Dutch version of Donald Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Muslims are still safe in the Netherlands,\u201d he told the news agency ANP. \u201cI am worried about this country.\u201d Stephan van Baarle, leader of the minority rights party Denk, refused to congratulate Wilders on the PVV\u2019s election success. \u201cThe fact that the PVV is the biggest party is a threat for a million Dutch Muslims,\u201d he told broadcaster Nos. \u201cMr Wilders wants to take away their rights,\u201d he added, describing the electoral results as a \u201cthreat to our legal state\u201d and undeserving of any congratulations. \u201cIt\u2019s a reason to fight harder and harder against discrimination.\u201d On Wednesday evening, Wilders said he would seek to live up to the hopes of his voters and vowed that \u201cthe Netherlands will be returned to the Dutch, the asylum tsunami and migration will be curbed\u201d. At the Dutch Council for Refugees, the hardline stance on asylum was met with dismay. In a statement, the NGO noted it was \u201cvery concerned about the people who have to flee war and violence, now that a party that unequivocally advocates an asylum freeze has become the largest in the Netherlands\u201d. The council added that it was impossible to ignore the VVD and NSC. The two parties also advocate for fewer asylum seekers, and also received a significant number of votes as people in the Netherlands grapple with issues such as a housing shortage and the climate crisis. \u201cWe ask the next cabinet not to get bogged down in symbol politics that fuel polarisation,\u201d said Frank Candel, chair of the council\u2019s board. \u201cBut to get to work on solutions that address the concerns of citizens and are good for refugees.\u201d While the possibility of Wilders becoming the Netherlands\u2019 next prime minister remained small, the fact that so many voters had backed him was disappointing, said Mustafa Ayranci of the Turkish workers\u2019 association HTIB. \u201cThe Dutch people have made a statement. We must respect that,\u201d he told Dutch news agency ANP. Ayranci said that should Wilders win enough support to form a coalition with a working parliamentary majority, he would be watching to see if the far-right leader would keep his promise, made in the lead-up to the election, to act as a prime minister for all Dutch people. The hope, he said, would be \u201cthat he will not only become the prime minister of Jan and Piet, but also of Mustafa and Ahmed\u201d. Mohammed Aknin, a prominent Muslim leader in the city of Tilburg, said he had spent Wednesday evening fielding WhatsApp messages from worried members of the community. \u201cPeople are afraid that there will soon be a ban on headscarves, for example.\u201d What comes next is anyone\u2019s guess, he told the public broadcaster Omroep Brabant. \u201cThe fox may lose his hair, but not his cunning,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past 20 years he has been clear in what he thinks. We just have to wait and see what he can do next.\u201d"

            "content": "Two elected officials in a rural Arizona county who stalled certifying election results have been charged by Arizona\u2019s attorney general with conspiracy and interfering with an election officer. Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd, Republican county supervisors in Cochise county, face two felony counts for their initial refusal to certify the county\u2019s election results in 2022. A grand jury convened earlier this month to discuss the potential charges, which were filed on Wednesday. Crosby and Judd had to be ordered by a court to certify the November 2022 election results, passing the statewide deadline for counties to canvass results. Even after the court order, Crosby did not show up to vote on the canvass. The indictment alleges Crosby and Judd conspired to delay Cochise county\u2019s vote canvass and knowingly interfered with the secretary of state\u2019s ability to complete a statewide vote canvass on time. The two supervisors have repeatedly pushed false election claims and sought a hand count of all ballots, later deemed illegal. Earlier this year Democratic attorney general of Arizona, Kris Mayes, vowed to prosecute over election interference issues in the swing state, which has seen all manner of election denialism since the 2020 election. \u201cThe repeated attempts to undermine our democracy are unacceptable,\u201d Mayes said in a statement. \u201cI took an oath to uphold the rule of law, and my office will continue to enforce Arizona\u2019s elections laws and support our election officials as they carry out the duties and responsibilities of their offices.\u201d During the past year, local meetings have been mired in election arguments, with one contingent showing up to call for hand counts and limits to voting access and another group speaking out to defend how elections are run. Some in the latter group have long wanted to see Crosby and Judd charged and held accountable for their efforts to derail the vote count, though they\u2019ve also worried charges could galvanize election deniers more. Legal costs for the county mounted to the hundreds of thousands, not including the costs the supervisors have likely incurred to defend themselves outside county funds. Crosby has been crowdfunding for his legal defense on a rightwing platform after he received a subpoena for the grand jury, calling himself \u201can elections integrity proponent since before it became popular\u201d and saying that a legal case against him \u201cwill intimidate other AZ county supervisors into falling in line with the globalist plans of compromised elections, and forced use of voting machines\u201d."

            "content": "Happy Thanksgiving! Far-right figures have congratulated the Dutch anti-Islam, anti-EU populist politician Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) on being predicted to win the most seats in the Netherlands parliament, in an upset that opens the way for the PVV to play a key role in the formation of the next government. With nearly all votes counted, preliminary results in the Dutch election show the Party for Freedom (PVV) took 37 seats, more than any other party and significantly more than expected in opinion polling during the campaign. A GreenLeft-Labour party alliance (GL/PvdA) led by the former EU commissioner Frans Timmermans finished second, with 25 seats. The liberal-conservative Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), led by the outgoing justice minister, Dilan Ye\u015filg\u00f6z-Zegerius, got 24 seats. The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally party is the biggest single opposition party in the French parliament, congratulated Wilders. What did Le Pen say? She described Wilders\u2019 Party for Freedom (PVV) as an ally with her party in the European parliament, saying his election performance showed that \u201cmore and more countries at the heart of the EU are contesting the way it works \u2026 and want us to master immigration, which is seen by many European peoples as massive and totally anarchic today\u201d. What happens now? Much will depend on a coalition-building process. Energy companies still investing too much in fossil fuels, global watchdog says Energy companies are investing twice as much in oil and gas as they should be if the world hopes to limit rising global temperatures to avert a climate catastrophe, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The world\u2019s energy watchdog said the sector still had \u201cminimal\u201d engagement with the global clean energy transition, and continued to contribute just 1% of clean energy investment globally. In a special report before the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, which begins on 30 November, the agency called on the industry to show commitment to tackling pollution by balancing its investments in clean energy and fossil fuels. The IEA executive director, Fatih Birol, said the industry faced \u201ca moment of truth\u201d in which it must \u201cmake profound decisions\u201d about its role. What else did Birol say? \u201cWith the world suffering the impacts of a worsening climate crisis, continuing with business as usual is neither socially nor environmentally responsible,\u201d he said. Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal won\u2019t happen before Friday, Israeli and US officials say A four-day truce in Gaza and the release of some hostages will not start until tomorrow at the earliest, Israeli officials have said, delaying by at least 24 hours the proposed exchange of hostages held by Hamas in the territory for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The exchange of female and minor hostages and prisoners was due to take place following the start of the first ceasefire in seven weeks of war in Gaza, officials from both Hamas and Israel have said. The truce, which would initially last for four days, was announced early on Wednesday after days of speculation and raised hopes for a more durable pause in the violence. More than 100 Palestinians were reported killed within hours of the announcement as Israeli forces continued attacking Gaza from the land, sea and air. After a pause from late afternoon on Wednesday, rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza at 5am this morning. Is the deal still on track? Tzachi Hanegbi, the Israeli national security adviser, said shortly after midnight on Thursday the agreement remained on track. \u201cThe contacts on the release of our hostages are advancing and continuing constantly,\u201d he said in a statement. In other news \u2026 A speeding car crashed in flames on the bridge linking New York state and Ontario at Niagara Falls yesterday, killing two people in the vehicle and sparking a security scare that closed four US-Canadian border crossings. Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, said there was \u201cno indication of a terrorist attack\u201d. A jury has found the former head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police intelligence unit guilty of leaking state secrets, the first time a Canadian has been convicted under the country\u2019s Security of Information Act. Cameron Ortis was found guilty of three counts of violating the act and one count of attempting to do so. North Korea has said it will deploy new weapons and stronger armed forces along its heavily armed border with South Korea. In a sign of rising tensions, North Korea said it would restore \u201call military measures\u201d it had halted under a 2018 confidence-building agreement with South Korea. Cuba Gooding Jr was sued yesterday by two women whose sexual assault cases against the Oscar-winning actor underlie a criminal prosecution that ended with him pleading guilty but serving no jail time. Lawyers for Gooding did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ukraine has not reached a stalemate in its war with Russia because the west can help Kyiv by \u201cdropping five more queens on the board\u201d, according to an influential historian of eastern Europe. Timothy Snyder, a Yale professor, argued that continuing high levels of military aid could allow Ukraine to prevail. Don\u2019t miss this: \u2018Our little uniter\u2019 \u2013 New Jersey town bereft by capture of beloved wild turkey Residents of West Orange, New Jersey, have been left heartbroken after a wild turkey named \u201cTurkules\u201d, whose resilient nature and ability to evade capture \u201cbrought the town together\u201d, was finally snared by state officials. Turkules, who was named by a local man, first took up residence in West Orange, 25 miles west of New York City, over the summer. The bird\u2019s fearless attitude towards traffic and disregard for authority soon made him a local celebrity. Despite sometimes causing mile-long traffic jams, his popularity was such that on Saturday businesses organized a \u201cHometown Hero\u201d event in Turkules\u2019s honor. But after a weeks-long effort, Turkules has now been captured and relocated to Wharton state forest, 85 miles away, leaving the town bereft. Or this: \u2018It\u2019s not a public service, it\u2019s toxic\u2019 \u2013 welcome to the world of gossip surveillance TikTokers are sharing strangers\u2019 conversations, hoping to expose gossipers to the very people they\u2019re talking about. The videos \u2013 in which uploaders eavesdrop on strangers and report the \u201ctea\u201d to their TikTok audiences, sometimes offering identifying features of all those involved \u2013 have become a curious trend on the app. Dozens of these videos are popping up under various hashtags, airing out the dirty laundry of unsuspecting parties: baby daddies with secret families, fiances who cheated while on their bachelor trips, and friend groups complaining behind the back of an unwitting member. Is the humiliation worth it? Climate check: Ban private jets to address climate crisis, says Thomas Piketty Questions of social and economic class must be at the centre of the world\u2019s response to the climate crisis, to address the huge inequalities between the carbon footprints of the rich and poor and prevent a backlash against climate policies, the economist Thomas Piketty has said. Regulations will be needed to outlaw goods and services that have unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions, such as private jets, outsized vehicles, and flights over short distances, he said in an interview with the Guardian. Rich countries must also put in place progressive carbon taxes that take into account people\u2019s incomes, as current policies usually fail to adjust for people\u2019s real needs.

            "date": "2023-11-10T18:00:12Z",
            "content": "Attorneys for Arizona\u2019s most prominent election deniers have been dealt tens of thousands of dollars in sanctions \u2013 monetary punishments \u2013 for flouting facts. Michigan lawyers got hit with some for filing a baseless lawsuit. Colorado attorneys relied on inflammatory language instead of investigating, resulting in sanctions. In courtrooms across the country, lawyers who have brought cases alleging election fraud since the 2020 election without evidence or based on lies have received financial sanctions, one way the courts and democracy-defending attorneys hope to clamp down on frivolous lawsuits from those who won\u2019t accept election losses. The tactic is one way defendants, under attack from broad and baseless claims of widespread fraud, have sought to hold people accountable for spreading such claims, which have become increasingly common since former president Donald Trump lost in 2020. The sanctions join other forms of accountability, like defamation cases and criminal charges. Some attorneys have even faced disbarment or investigations by their state\u2019s bar organization because of their claims in election-fraud lawsuits. \u201cYou can\u2019t lie brazenly to the courts,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, who directs the democracy program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. Weiser said the wave of bad-faith lawsuits required a response from the judicial system to let attorneys and their clients know that \u201cthe law can\u2019t be used just as a political tool\u201d. A court sanction \u2013 typically an award of coverage of attorneys\u2019 fees to the government entity that defended against the lawsuit \u2013 can send a message not just to the attorneys and political actors bringing a case, but to those who would consider filing similar lawsuits in the future. In most instances, the sanctions are against the attorneys who bring the cases, not their clients, because attorneys are bound by ethical rules that should prevent them from making false statements. The sanctions also show the courts\u2019 role in accountability for anti-democratic actions, as standard-bearers of the law and the legal profession. \u201cPart of the attack on democracy is the attack on functioning government,\u201d said Jena Griswold, Colorado\u2019s secretary of state and the chair of the Democratic association of secretaries of state. \u201cIt ties us up into nonsensical, conspiracy-laden lawsuits. It\u2019s an affront to the justice system. And I do think that these people should be held accountable.\u201d As the 2024 election approaches, those seeking sanctions hope that the effort will stave off the worst election lawsuits, likely because politicians making wild claims won\u2019t be able to find a decent attorney. But the list of sanctions has grown since 2020, as more secretaries of state, attorneys general and local elections offices push back against lawsuits that have been costly and time-consuming to respond to. A judge in Michigan gave Republican leaders, including the state\u2019s GOP chair Kristina Karamo, and their attorneys nearly $60,000 in sanctions over an election lawsuit that \u201cmerely threw out the allegation of \u2018corruption in Detroit\u2019 as the reason for disregarding the Michigan Constitution in this state\u2019s largest city\u201d, the judge wrote. Two attorneys who brought a sprawling lawsuit in 2020 in Colorado against a plethora of companies and politicians, including Facebook, Dominion Voting Systems and elected officials in several states, saw sanctions after a federal judge said the case suffered from a \u201cwoeful lack of investigation into the law\u201d and made repeated \u201chighly inflammatory and damaging allegations that could have put individuals\u2019 safety in danger\u201d. The judge said the lawsuit was \u201cthe height of recklessness\u201d. In Arizona, the state\u2019s most prominent election deniers have been met with sanctions in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees multiple times. Kari Lake, the failed GOP gubernatorial candidate who\u2019s now running for US Senate, has seen sanctions in a case contesting her loss and in another attacking vote-tabulation machines. Mark Finchem, who lost his race for secretary of state, has brought cases that have gotten court sanctions, which he has said put a \u201ccold, wet blanket\u201d on opposing views. When seeking sanctions in a case brought by losing attorney general candidate Abe Hamadeh, the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office explained that the courts \u201cmust hold accountable those who materially misrepresent the facts in order to gain some kind of advantage \u2013 here, the ultimate goal being to usurp an elected office\u201d. \u201cDeliberately peddling misinformation to this Court demonstrates a profound disrespect for our democratic institutions,\u201d the office\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cIf people are truly suspicious of our election processes, doubt our election officials, or question the efficacy of our democracy, it is because misinformation continues to circulate unchecked.\u201d In one Arizona case, it was already clear other attorneys had passed on taking the lawsuit, a harbinger of what proponents of sanctions hope will continue to occur when plaintiffs seek representation for wild claims. The attorney sanctioned in that case had very little experience in election law and said in court that he took the case after more experienced lawyers passed on it, admitting he was at less risk of disbarment because he would retire soon, which the judge issuing sanctions called a \u201cconscious decision to pursue the matter despite appreciating that the contest had no legal merit\u201d. Weiser, of the Brennan Center, said the potential for sanctions and professional repercussions for attorneys is decreasing the number of lawyers, especially well-qualified ones, who are willing to take on these cases. \u201cDo I think that we are out of the woods? No,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing forward, people who might have been tempted are going to really think twice now that the personal consequences to them and to their firms are much more clear and stark.\u201d Griswold, the Colorado secretary of state, wants to see more requests for sanctions filed to meet the mountain of frivolous lawsuits elections officials have faced since 2020. \u201cWe have to strongly disincentivize bad acting,\u201d she said."

            "title": "Final New Zealand election results show National party will need populist NZ First to govern ",
            "date": "2023-11-03T03:32:50Z",
            "content": "After weeks of political limbo, the final results of New Zealand\u2019s election have been released showing the centre-right National party will need the support of the libertarian Act party and populist party New Zealand First to form a coalition government. The governing Labour party was ejected from office after six years in the October election, with preliminary results handing a slim majority to National and its traditional coalition partner Act. On Friday, the Election Commission released the results from about 600,000 \u201cspecial votes\u201d \u2013 those cast from overseas, or outside a voter\u2019s electorate. National dropped from 50 seats in the preliminary count to 48 seats. Act and New Zealand First seat numbers remained unchanged from preliminary results, at 11 and eight respectively. Labour won 34 seats, the Green party 15 seats and Te Pati M\u0101ori six seats. Incoming prime minister Christopher Luxon said the results were expected, \u201c... that is why we have been progressing and advancing the arrangement and relationships with both the Act party but also New Zealand first,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we can get cracking with it and accelerate those conversations.\u201d He said National would likely pursue recounts in the two seats that it lost to Labour by only a few dozen votes \u2013 ex-prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s former seat of Mount Albert and Nelson. Luxon said on Thursday it was likely negotiations to form a coalition government would continue well into next week. In 2017, when Peters was last in the kingmaker position, negotiations lasted two weeks with Ardern and the Labour party. Special votes in previous elections have favoured the left, and typically have cost the right one or two seats. Until Friday, a question mark hung over whether National would be able to govern comfortably alongside Act or whether it would be forced to cut a deal with NZ First leader Winston Peters \u2013 a maverick politician who could slam the brakes on some of National and Act\u2019s core policies. Andrew Geddis, a politics law professor from the University of Otago, said the final results show National and Act will need to rely on NZ First to form a coalition \u2013 significantly increasing Peters\u2019s hand in the negotiation process. \u201cNew Zealand First can approach the government formation process as \u2018You need us\u2019 rather than as the usual insurance policy to get a few more seats,\u201d he said. Political commentator Ben Thomas called the results a \u201cconfluence of surprises\u201d. National lost two seats by razor-thin margins in the special votes, with a recount potentially affecting the final results, Thomas said. Prof Geddis agreed, but added the outcome would not affect the need for National to form a coalition with Act and NZ First. The number of parliamentary seats has also increased \u2013 from 121 to 122 \u2013 as Te Pati M\u0101ori won more electorate seats than it would otherwise have been allocated from its share of the party vote. National has been in talks with Act and New Zealand First since the 14 October election about coalition agreements, but there is no defined timeframe for a decision.

            "content": "As he turned 81 on Monday, Joe Biden was presented with unwelcome gifts: more polling showing him struggling against Donald Trump, his likely opponent next year who is just three and a half years younger but whom many fewer Americans think is too old to be president. In its US Election Watch Report for November, the Morning Consult polling organisation said Trump was gaining ground among key voter segments including Black, Hispanic and young Americans. \u201cThroughout 2023, Trump has made up ground with Joe Biden in our head-to-head tracking by improving his margins\u201d among such groups, also including independents, it said. On Sunday, NBC said Biden\u2019s approval rating had reached its lowest point, 40%. It said its poll found Biden behind Trump for the first time in a hypothetical general-election match-up, \u201calthough the deficit is well within the margin of error for a contest more than 11 months away\u201d. Trump faces 91 criminal charges, for election subversion, retention of classified information and hush-money payments. He also faces civil suits over his business affairs and a rape allegation a judge called \u201csubstantially true\u201d. Trump has committed gaffes \u2013 for example, suggesting he thinks he beat George W Bush and Barack Obama \u2013 that might be seen to be symptoms of ageing. He has adopted increasingly extreme rhetoric, threatening dire action against political enemies and vulnerable social groups, prompting warnings he is a fascist. And yet, as majorities of Americans continue to say Biden is too old for a second term, Trump keeps closing in the polls. According to NBC, Biden is suffering over economic conditions at home and policy choices abroad, prominently including support for Israel in its war with Hamas. Jeff Horwitt, a Democratic pollster, told NBC: \u201cJoe Biden is at a uniquely low point in his presidency, and a significant part of this \u2026 is due to how Americans are viewing his foreign policy actions.\u201d Bill McInturff, a Republican, said: \u201cThis poll is a stunner \u2026 because of the impact the Israel-Hamas war is having on Biden.\u201d Horwitt, however, said Biden had chances to win voters back, adding: \u201cJury verdicts in Trump\u2019s trials, unforeseen events both foreign and domestic, and the rigours of a campaign all have a funny way of upending what may be true today.\u201d Biden also found more cheerful birthday reading from Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist who correctly played down fears of a Republican midterm \u201cred wave\u201d. \u201cI have a simple message,\u201d Rosenberg wrote in his newsletter. \u201cWe should be very optimistic about winning the presidential election next year.\u201d Rosenberg added: \u201cThe Republican party is in trouble. It keeps losing elections across the country. It has done two things since 2020, each of which could keep a political party out of power for decades \u2013 stripped women of fundamental rights, and led a party-wide conspiracy to overturn an election and end American democracy.\u201d He also pointed to a \u201cterrible\u201d New York Times poll that showed Trump ahead in battleground states but also asked what voters would do if Trump was sentenced to prison, which Rosenberg said was \u201clikely\u201d. Pointing to results including a 23-point swing to Biden in Nevada and an 18-point shift in Georgia, Rosenberg said: \u201cHere is what happens in the battlegrounds \u2013 huge swings, GOP devastation.\u201d The Biden campaign and its surrogates are also confident. Earlier this month, the Democratic operative Donna Brazile told ABC: \u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember that Ronald Reagan was trailing in 1980 for his re-election. I\u2019m old enough to remember when Bill Clinton was trailing, and Barack Obama was toast right before the 2012 re-election. \u201cDon\u2019t count out Joe Biden.\u201d"

The PVV was predicted to win 35 seats in the 150-seat parliament, according to exit polls, which means that to form a working majority, Wilders will still need to gain enough support to form a coalition. In an initial reaction after the vote, Wilders said: \u201cThe campaign is over and the voters have spoken. Now we will have to look for agreements with each other.

Belgium\u2019s Tom Van Grieken, the leader of the far-right Vlaams Belang, said: \u201cIt is clear: the population is yearning for real change. Not only in the Netherlands, but also in Flanders. Parties like ours are coming all over Europe!\u201d Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party leader, Santiago Abascal, characterised the result, in an election dominated by debates over immigration, as a clear signal: \u201cMore and more Europeans demand in the streets and at the polls that their nations, their borders and their rights be defended.\u201d The head of the anti-immigration League party and deputy prime minister of Italy, Matteo Salvini, called Wilders a \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201cally of the League\u201d, saying: \u201cA new Europe is possible.\u201d Alice Weidel, the co-leader of Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party, said: \u201cCongratulations on this great success.

We have to make a fist against exclusion, against discrimination.\u201d The Conservative party leader, Dilan Ye\u015filg\u00f6z, meanwhile, expressed scepticism that Wilders would succeed in forming a government, saying: \u201cIt is up to Wilders to show he can form a majority.

            "date": "2023-11-23T11:17:29Z",
            "content": "More than 80% of Taiwanese people think that the threat from China has worsened in recent years, while trust in the US has also declined in the past two years, in part because of the war in Ukraine damaging Washington\u2019s credibility. The results of a survey published this week reveal a portrait of Taiwanese society that is under increasing pressure as the self-governing island heads towards a presidential election in January that could have far reaching ramifications for its relationship with the world\u2019s two biggest superpowers. The American Portrait survey of 1,211 adults was conducted in September by the Institute of European and American Studies at Academia Sinica, Taiwan\u2019s top research institution. The findings were published on 20 November. It found that only 9.3% of the Taiwanese people think China is a \u201ccredible\u201d country and that 82.7% think the threat from China has worsened in recent years. The survey also revealed low levels of confidence in the US as a stable partner for Taiwan. Only 34% of people agreed that the US was a trustworthy country, a drop of more than 11 percentage points since 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the drop may come from the occurrence of the Ukraine war and how the United States government responded to the Ukraine war making a reference to Taiwan. People in Taiwan imagine that if a war breaks out in Taiwan, how will the US government respond to it?\u201d said Hsin-Hsin Pan, an associate professor at the Department of Sociology at Soochow University. The percentage of people who agreed that China was a \u201ccredible\u201d country has fallen from 13.5% in 2021 to 9.3% this year, in line with falling support for unification between Taiwan and China. Regarding identity, 78.4% of respondents said Taiwan and China did not belong to the same country. That finding was reflected across the political spectrum, with agreement from both DPP and KMT supporters. The incumbent DPP is seen as being pro-independence \u2013 although it has not formally declared that position \u2013 while the KMT supports closer ties with Beijing. More than 60% of respondents considered themselves Taiwanese, compared with just 2.3% who said they identified as Chinese. In terms of national defence, 65.9% support US arms sales to Taiwan. And a similar proportion said the public promise of US president, Joe Biden, to defend Taiwan would increase thee likelihood that the US would send troops to help Taiwan in the event of an assault from Chinese forces. \u2022 The caption on the image in this article was amended on 27 November 2023 because an earlier version referred to the troops meeting the Thai president when the Taiwanese president was meant."

            "date": "2023-11-22T21:29:20Z",
            "content": "Geert Wilders\u2019 far-right, anti-Islam Party for Freedom (PVV) is on course to be the largest party in the Dutch parliament, according to exit polls, in a major electoral upset whose reverberations will be felt around Europe. The PVV, whose manifesto includes calls for bans on mosques, the Qur\u2019an and Islamic headscarves in government buildings, was predicted to win 37 seats in the 150-seat parliament, more than double the number it won in the previous ballot in 2021. However, it is unclear whether Wilders \u2013 whose party has finished second and third in previous elections, but always been shut out of government \u2013 will be able to win enough support to form a coalition with a working parliamentary majority. \u201cI call on the parties,\u201d Wilders said in an initial reaction after the vote. \u201cThe campaign is over and the voters have spoken. Now we will have to look for agreements with each other. With a wonderful position of 35 seats, the PVV can no longer be ignored.\u201d He insisted in his victory speech that he was \u201cconfident we can reach an agreement\u201d, adding: \u201cI understand perfectly well we should not take any measures that would be unconstitutional.\u201d Far-right figures across Europe including Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini in Italy and Germany\u2019s AfD rushed to congratulate the PVV leader. But the heads of the three other biggest Dutch parties have all said they would not serve in a PVV-led cabinet. A left-leaning GreenLeft-Labour party alliance (GL/PvdA) led by former EU commissioner Frans Timmermans, forecast to finish second on 25 seats, has said it would not enter any coalition with the PVV as a member, as has campaigning centre-right MP Pieter Omtzigt\u2019s centrist New Social Contract (NSC) party, which is in fourth place with 20 seats. The liberal-conservative Party for Freedom and Democracy of the outgoing prime minister, Mark Rutte, whose projected 24 seats would leave it in third place, has said it was open to the idea \u2013 but this week ruled out supporting Wilders as prime minister. \u201cI have said I can\u2019t see that happening, because Wilders cannot form a majority,\u201d said Rutte\u2019s successor as VVD leader, the outgoing justice minister, Dilan Ye\u015filg\u00f6z-Zegerius. \u201cBut it\u2019s his move now. He has to show whether he can form a majority.\u201d Wilders, who has been under police protection since 2004 and in 2016 was convicted of insulting Moroccans for vowing, at a campaign rally, to ensure there were \u201cfewer\u201d of them, is likely to start sounding other party leaders out on Friday. Since 2004, he has been under police protection and in 2016 was convicted of discrimination after he vowed to ensure there were \u201cfewer Moroccans\u201d at a campaign rally. A court later cleared Wilders of inciting discrimination, though it upheld his conviction for insulting Moroccans. Although the party that wins the most seats traditionally provides the next prime minister, it is by no means guaranteed to do so. Rutte will remain in a caretaker role until a new government is installed, which might not be before next spring. The outcome of the election, set to usher in the Netherlands\u2019 first new prime minister in 13 years after four consecutive Rutte-led coalitions, could lead to \u201cconstitutional stalemate\u201d, said Kate Parker of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Analysts have predicted that coalition negotiations could prove even longer and more complex than after the previous 2021 election, when four coalition partners took a record 271 days to hammer out an agreement. The shape of the new coalition could have a major impact on the Netherlands\u2019 immigration and climate policies, as well as relations with its European partners. The country was a founding EU member and punches above its weight in the bloc. Rutte\u2019s fourth and final coalition resigned in July after failing to agree on measures to rein in migration, one of the key issues of the campaign, along with a housing crisis that especially affects Dutch youth, the cost of living, and voter trust in politicians. Wilders is an outspoken Eurosceptic and has long campaigned for the Dutch government to take back control of the country\u2019s borders to reduce immigration, slash payments into the union\u2019s budget and veto any further expansion of the EU. He has also demanded the Netherlands stop sending arms to Ukraine. Wilders has recently attempted to soften his more hardline anti-Islam language, apparently in hopes of entering a coalition government for the first time, conceding that there were \u201cbigger problems\u201d than bringing down refugee numbers, and that he could put some of his anti-Muslim positions \u201con ice\u201d. He would be \u201cprime minister for everyone\u201d in the Netherlands, he promised during the campaign, \u201cregardless of their religion, background, sex or whatever\u201d, adding that the cost of living crisis was a bigger priority. Tom van der Meer, a political scientist at the University of Amsterdam, described the result as \u201cthe biggest shift we have ever seen in the Netherlands\u201d. Wilders had surfed a wave of anti-immigration sentiment and frustration with cross-party coalitions, he told the public broadcaster NOS. Voting took place in polling stations including the Anne Frank and Van Gogh museums in Amsterdam, with voters facing a choice of 26 parties \u2013 18 of which could enter parliament \u2013 in one of Europe\u2019s most fragmented political landscapes. At the De Duif church in Amsterdam, Lisa, a 28-year-old architect, said she had decided to vote \u201ctactically\u201d for the GreenLeft-Labour alliance to prevent Wilders\u2019 far-right PVV from becoming the biggest party. \u201cI realised I had to vote for GreenLeft-Labour because I don\u2019t want PVV to win,\u201d she said. \u201cThe environment and cost of living crisis are the most important topics for me. I don\u2019t foresee a leftwing government, but this is the least I can do.\u201d Lisette, 47, a consultant, said she had decided to vote for the the VVD because of the \u201clong-term stability the party brings\u201d. \u201cInternationally, I have been very happy with the way Rutte has presented our country,\u201d she added. Stijn, 26, a student, voted for the pro-farmer BBB movement. \u201cI know how hard it is for them,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents are farmers and I know first-hand how much they struggle. Other parties go too far with their climate change proposals.\u201d Voting at the Anne Frank museum, Mirjam Stoker, 52, said she had opted for Green-Labour because she was \u201ca bit scared of the PVV\u201d. \u201cThe government needs to stay a bit in the middle,\u201d she said. \u2022 This post was amended on 24 November 2023 to clarify that Geert Wilders was convicted in 2016 of insulting Moroccans and inciting discrimination, but the latter conviction was overturned."

            "content": "Dutch voters are voting in a knife-edge general election that will usher in the country\u2019s first new prime minister in 13 years, with four parties from left to far right vying to become the largest in parliament. From the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam to the islands of the Dutch Caribbean, more than 13 million voters will cast their ballot between 7.30am and 9pm in elections that could set the country on a different course after Mark Rutte\u2019s four consecutive governments. With the latest polls indicating a rise in support for Geert Wilders\u2019 far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), the final days of campaigning have been marked by discussion over tactical voting and possible coalition arrangements. The leader of the largely economically and socially liberal People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), Dilan Ye\u015filg\u00f6z-Zegerius, has broken precedent by saying she would work with Wilders if her party garnered the most votes \u2013 although on Tuesday she ruled out supporting him as prime minister if he won the largest share. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening,\u201d she told Dutch radio. \u201cThe Netherlands is looking for a leader who can unite the country \u2026 who is for all Dutch people, who can lead our country internationally. I also don\u2019t see that Mr Wilders could build a majority.\u201d If the VVD triumphs, Ye\u015filg\u00f6z-Zegerius, a former refugee who champions stricter migration controls, could become the Netherlands\u2019 first female prime minister. Frans Timmermans, the former EU heavyweight who returned to the Netherlands to lead a GreenLeft/Labour alliance, has appealed to voters to keep out a government in which the far-right plays a role. According to EenVandaag research, it appears to be having an effect, with almost half of his supporters voting strategically for him instead of smaller parties. Pieter Omtzigt, leader of the New Social Contract (NSC) \u2013 a new centre-right party campaigning for better governance and controlled immigration \u2013 has also said he will not enter a coalition that contained Wilders\u2019 party. The most recent survey by EenVandaag showed a 10-seat gain by the PVV, to 27 seats of the total 150, putting Wilders closely behind the VVD, on 29. The PVV\u2019s manifesto calls for an immigration \u201cstop\u201d, a ban on Islamic schools, mosques and the Qur\u2019an. The last government fell in July over the issue of asylum seekers. Whatever emerges, this election will shift the Dutch political landscape, with 26 parties standing on pressing issues including housing, immigration, guaranteeing a basic standard of living and the climate crisis. \u201cThe two things we can expect are that we will no longer have any \u2018big\u2019 parties left \u2013 good luck finding a majority \u2013 and high volatility, which makes it extremely difficult to make any sort of predictions about the outcome,\u201d said L\u00e9onie de Jonge, assistant professor in European politics and society at Groningen University. Tom Louwerse, associate professor at Leiden University\u2019s institute of political science, who runs a poll averaging site, said the fact that it was a close battle between four parties meant that both a rightwing coalition and a left-centre-right one with Timmermans were possible. While the VVD is leading the polls, it is closely followed by the PVV, GreenLeft/Labour and Omtzigt\u2019s NSC. \u201cWe have seen quite some movement over the last week, with the PVV gaining and NSC losing ground,\u201d said Louwerse. \u201cStill, all of these parties are on somewhere between 12% and 19%, so this is testament to the large degree of fragmentation.\u201d Another major issue is mistrust in government, something that Amsterdam University political science professor Tom van der Meer calls a \u201ccrisis of trustworthiness\u201d since it stems from a series of government scandals. Both in voters with a minority ethnic background and those supporting far-right parties, says Utrecht University social scientist Marcel Lubbers, many Dutch do not feel their voices are heard. \u201cAmong voters with an immigrant background, a large majority feels their interests are not well represented in politics but we also see this among a very large group without immigration backgrounds who vote for anti-immigration parties,\u201d he said. The election, however, could shake things up. \u201cElections tend to boost trust, people recognise politicians listen to them but, more importantly, people are able to ensure the composition of the lower house is again in line with their aims and their values,\u201d said Van der Meer. \u201cAnd people are more willing to accept and even forgive a new set of politicians for not immediately being able to solve issues.\u201d Rozemarijn Lubbe, a pollster at EenVandaag\u2019s opinion panel, said that a decision by Wilders to take what appeared to be a slightly more moderate tone in recent weeks may have persuaded some voters to back him. \u201cThere are people who really want a rightwing party, not with Timmermans, and they support the PVV strategically. \u201cBut a poll is not a prediction and we know from the last election that 10% of people made their choice on the last day or even in the voting booth. Voter uncertainty, the final debate, strategic voting and the turnout will be decisive factors.\u201d According to I&amp;O Research\u2019s last poll on Tuesday, 63% of people had still not made a definitive decision on who to vote for. At the final election debate on Tuesday night, Wilders came under stout attack from all sides. He claimed that, despite his criticism of Islam, if he had \u201cthe honour to be prime minister, I would be that for all Dutch people\u201d. Ye\u015filg\u00f6z-Zegerius replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone believes that, and I don\u2019t think Wilders even believes it himself. \u201cIf you look at Wilders\u2019 plans honestly, they are shutting off the Netherlands from the world, bankrupting the country \u2026 and [saying] certain groups don\u2019t belong. Even if he tears up his manifesto, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Rob Jetten, leader of the liberal democratic D66 party, later stood up for the value of migration and internationalism and accused Wilders of using foreigners as a \u201cscapegoat\u201d for his \u201cpolitical earning model\u201d. He added: \u201cPeople of Turkish or Surinamese background are sitting on their sofas wondering: \u2018Do I belong here?\u2019 I will always resist intolerant policy.\u201d"

I have to take issue, though, with the idea that Israelis and Palestinians are faced with a choice between vengeance and reason. Unfortunately, the situation is even bleaker than that. What the Israelis are doing is not just vengeance. It carries its own rationale \u2013 that of a belief that a solution is impossible. Israeli leaders know they cannot fulfil their public aim and eradicate Hamas forever, that Hamas is an idea and will be back no matter what. But if you believe that Hamas represents simply the latest wave of antisemitism, which has always been with us and always will be, then scorched earth makes sense from a tactical point of view. Such a rationale is self-fulfilling, and brings its own nihilistic response in terms of the difference between the ideology of Hamas and the PLO before it, the escalation from secular into civilisational conflict. And of course we could debate which came first and who is most to blame. But the grim bottom line is: the dark side, for both sides, carries its own logic. And so we go on.

Gary Bennett Exeter If dogs could talk As a carefully distanced observer of SUVs, there appear to be two other criteria that drive their popularity (\u201cMonsters of the road\u201d, New Review). Both are especially influential in the UK. The first is dog ownership, which has soared by roughly 40% since the pandemic and which usefully offers another excuse for driving 3 tonnes of metal. If dogs could talk, they might say they are not bothered about their vehicle status as long as they get fed on time. The second is the increasing number of obese drivers for whom the SUV usefully offsets their own bulk. The need for a personal carbon allowance appears to be ever greater.

As a wheelchair user, I can testify to the harm the sketch caused in terms of increased harassment. When I first became ill, I was repeatedly mocked during a trip to hospital by a large group, clearly inspired by the programme, because I got up from my wheelchair and, with great difficulty and a lot of pain, walked a few steps. This is just one of the many hostile or suspicious reactions I have experienced as a disabled person, but perhaps one of the most humiliating. While I am glad Ellen calls out this horrible sketch, I feel she could have given it more attention. The portrayal was created and \u201cenjoyed\u201d against a backdrop of increasing hostility from the state, the media and the public towards disabled people as \u201cbogus scroungers\u201d. Name and address supplied Praise be Why are women far more likely than men to praise their colleagues\u2019 work (Comment)? Because women are more interested in \u201cpower with\u201d, as opposed to men\u2019s \u201cpower over\u201d. Bruce Higgins San Diego, California Life after life Bitter irony indeed that, while Jeff Bezos is making strenuous efforts to lengthen his own life, he employs workers under conditions that will almost certainly reduce theirs (\u201cBritain\u2019s biotech startups race US \u2018buff billionaires\u2019 for secrets of eternal youth\u201d, Business). The world of longevity research is producing important insights, but a bigger challenge remains reversing the decline in life expectancy affecting people in low-income occupations and deprived neighbourhoods. We urgently need an ambitious programme of social research targeting the poorest groups, ensuring that they too can have a healthy and secure later life.

            "date": "2023-11-20T05:00:12Z",
            "content": "Relatives of British citizens recently evacuated from Gaza and those waiting to return to the UK have criticised the government\u2019s repatriation guidance, as UK officials continue to support nationals crossing into Egypt. Ahmad Abou-Foul\u2019s family safely crossed from Gaza into Egypt on 3 November. He said they were \u201cshocked\u201d after arriving in Cairo when UK immigration officers advised the individuals with British passports to return to the UK with their children, and once there, start a reunification process for their Palestinian spouses. \u201cThey were asking us to split a four-month-old from his mother \u2013 and a one-year-old and two-year-old,\u201d said Abou-Foul, an NHS surgeon from Birmingham, whose 16 relatives \u2013 including young children \u2013 returned to the UK on Saturday. \u201cWe were shocked. Probably they didn\u2019t have a plan; this is what we felt,\u201d he said. After enduring weeks of Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 12,000 people, the family asked officials why they were being treated differently than in recent evacuations, such as those from Sudan, Ukraine and Afghanistan. Abou-Foul said the family were told that each situation was different. Abou-Foul paid \u00a316,000 in visa fees for three adults and two children. The family was not given any guidance or informed of any fee waivers, he said, and were asked to arrange their return at their own cost. The Guardian understands there have been repatriation cases in which individuals have had visa fees waived. \u201cWhat was the reason for us to be given this option?\u201d said Abou-Foul, adding he did not think it was intentional but due to insufficient planning by the UK government. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t we supported by the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office]? \u201cIf I have to do it again, I will do it again, because at that time I would have paid everything I have to get my family to safety.\u201d While the family is among the hundreds of foreign nationals who have escaped Israel\u2019s airstrikes and the spiralling humanitarian crisis, more than 2 million people in Gaza, almost half of whom are children, remain under siege after Hamas militants killed at least 1,200 people and abducted 240 hostages in a surprise attack on Israel on 7 October. The Rafah crossing first opened on 1 November to allow specific groups of foreign nationals and the seriously wounded to leave. By early November, more than half of the British nationals seeking to escape Gaza for Egypt had managed to do so. The Guardian understands that transportation to Cairo and two nights\u2019 of accommodation is being provided to British nationals and their dependants. While flights are not being facilitated, loans are being offered in a temporary exchange for passports. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to afford the cost of the four tickets,\u201d said a British national in Cairo who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cI can\u2019t think how I am going to pay back the loan while my medical centre is closed, maybe damaged, and we left everything in Gaza.\u201d For six weeks, the family lived under Israeli bombardment, moving from northern Gaza to Khan Younis, the biggest city in the south, where tens of thousands of people have been evacuated in recent weeks. After evacuating from Gaza seven days ago, the family has extended their stay in Egypt as they wait for a visa to be processed for a family member without a British passport. Tessa Gregory, a human rights team partner at the law firm Leigh Day, said: \u201cOur client and her British family who were living in Gaza have fled a war zone where they have survived desperate conditions and witnessed unspeakable violence. \u201cIn these circumstances the British government should be doing everything within its power to get the family back to the UK as quickly as possible so they can start to rebuild their lives. \u201cWe hope the Foreign Office will now reconsider its policy and cover the costs of flights for this family.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe safety of British nationals remains a top priority. \u201cWe are working at pace to support British families who have crossed the border into Egypt, making sure any dependants who need a visa can apply for one and that appropriate checks are carried out in a timely manner.\u201d"

            "title": "What are the roots of the Israel-Palestine conflict?",
            "date": "2023-11-16T16:17:48Z",
            "content": "As with almost everything to do with this conflict, it depends on whom you ask. Some will begin with the Romans. Others will start with the late 19th-century Jewish migration to what was then the Ottoman Empire \u2013 to escape the pogroms and other persecutions in eastern Europe \u2013 and the rise of Zionism. Or the Balfour declaration by the British government in 1917 in support of a \u201cnational home for the Jewish people\u201d in Palestine and the ensuing conflicts with Arab communities there. But the starting point for many people is the United Nations\u2019 vote in 1947 to partition land in the British mandate of Palestine into two states \u2013 one Jewish, one Arab \u2013 following the destruction of much of European Jewry in the Holocaust. Neither the Palestinians nor the neighbouring Arab countries accepted the founding of modern Israel. Fighting between Jewish armed groups, some of which the British regarded as terrorist organisations, and Palestinians escalated until the armies of Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan and Syria invaded after Israel declared independence in May 1948. With Israel\u2019s new army gaining ground, an armistice agreement in 1949 saw new de facto borders that gave the fledgling Jewish state considerably more territory than it was awarded under the UN partition plan. What happened to the Palestinians who were living there? About 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled \u2013 about 85% of the Arab population of the territory captured by Israel \u2013 and were never allowed to return. Palestinians called the exodus and eradication of much of their society inside Israel the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe\u201d, and it remains the traumatic event at the heart of their modern history. Arabs who remained in Israel as citizens were subject to official discrimination. They were placed under military rule for nearly two decades, which deprived them of many basic civil rights. Much of their land was expropriated and Arab Israeli communities were deliberately kept poor and underfunded. What is the Palestine Liberation Organisation? In 1964, a coalition of Palestinian groups founded the Palestine Liberation Organisation under the leadership of Yasser Arafat to pursue armed struggle and establish an Arab state in place of Israel. The PLO drew international attention to its cause with high-profile attacks and hijackings. How did the occupied Palestinian territories become occupied? In 1967 Israel launched what it said was a pre-emptive defensive war against Jordan, Egypt and Syria, as they appeared to be preparing to invade. The attack caught Arab governments by surprise and saw Israel achieve rapid victories including seizing the Sinai peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan. The six-day war was a spectacular military success for Israel. Its capture of all of Jerusalem and newly acquired control over the biblical lands called Judea and Samaria opened the way to the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which became central to the conflict. Israel placed the Arab population of the West Bank under military rule, which is enforced to this day. When did Hamas enter the picture? The PLO was a generally secular organisation modelled on other leftwing guerrilla movements of the time, although most of its supporters were Muslim. Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood had previously avoided armed conflict and were largely dedicated to working for a more religious society. But that position shifted under the leadership of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a charismatic quadriplegic living in Gaza who helped found several Islamist organisations in Gaza including Mujama al-Islamiya, which won support by establishing a network of social services including schools, clinics and a library. Shortly after the outbreak of the first intifada, Yassin used support for Mujama al-Islamiya as the foundation for the formation of Hamas in 1987 in alliance with other Islamists. Israel has always denied encouraging the rise of the Islamist movement in Gaza but it saw the groups as a way of undermining support for the PLO and recognised Mujama al-Islamiya as a charity, allowing it to operate freely and build support. Israel also approved the creation of the Islamic University of Gaza, which became a breeding ground of support for Hamas. What was the first intifada? Israel regarded the Palestinian population under its control as largely quiescent even as it went on expanding Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank and expropriating Arab land. Palestinians were also treated as a cheap source of largely manual labour inside Israel. That illusion was shattered in 1987 as young Palestinians rose up. The uprising was marked by mass stone throwing. The Israeli army responded with large-scale arrests and collective punishments. The intifada is largely recognised as a success for the Palestinians, helping to solidify their identity independently of neighbouring Arab states and forcing Israel into negotiations. It also strengthened Arafat\u2019s hand to make compromises with Israel, including adopting the principle of a two-state solution. Whatever happened to the peace process? As the first intifada wound down in 1993, the Oslo peace process started with secret talks between Israel and the PLO. Israel\u2019s prime minister at the time, Yitzhak Rabin, signed an agreement with Arafat aimed at fulfilling the \u201cright of the Palestinian people to self-determination\u201d although Rabin did not accept the principle of a Palestinian state. The Oslo accords established the Palestinian National Authority, granting limited self-governance over patches of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Further negotiations were intended to resolve issues such as the status of Jerusalem, the future of the Israeli settlements and the right of return for the millions of Palestinians still classified as refugees after their forebears were never permitted to return to their homes. Some prominent Palestinians regarded the accords as a form of surrender while rightwing Israelis opposed giving up settlements or territory. Among Israelis, the political charge against Oslo was led by the future prime ministers Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Netanyahu, who fronted rallies at which Rabin was portrayed as a Nazi. Rabin\u2019s widow blamed the two men for her husband\u2019s assassination by an ultranationalist Israeli in 1995. What caused the second intifada? Peace negotiations sputtered along until the failure of Bill Clinton\u2019s attempts to broker a final deal at Camp David in 2000, which contributed to the outbreak of the second intifada. The uprising was markedly different from the first intifada because of widespread suicide bombings against Israeli civilians launched by Hamas and other groups, and the scale of Israeli military retaliation. By the time the uprising ended in 2005, more than 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis were dead. The political ramifications of the intifada were significant. It led to a hardening of attitudes among ordinary Israelis and the construction of the West Bank barrier. But it also prompted the prime minister Ariel Sharon to say that Israel could not go on occupying the Palestinians\u2019 territory \u2013 although he did not say that the alternative was an independent Palestinian state. Is Gaza still occupied? One consequence of the second intifada was Sharon\u2019s decision to \u201cdisengage\u201d from the Palestinians beginning in 2005 with the closing of Israeli settlements in Gaza and parts of the northern West Bank. It is not clear how much further Sharon would have gone with this policy as he had a stroke and went into a coma the following year. The status of Gaza since the disengagement remains disputed. Israel says it is no longer occupied. The United Nations says otherwise because of Israel\u2019s continued control of airspace and territorial waters, and also access into the territory, along with Egypt. Israeli has also blockaded the enclave since Hamas came to power in 2006. In addition, many Palestinians in Gaza do not see themselves as a separate entity from the rest of their territories in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and so argue that as a whole they remain occupied. Why does Hamas control Gaza? Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections in part because of a backlash against the corruption and political stagnation of the ruling Fatah party. The Hamas leader Ismail Haniya was appointed prime minister. Israel began arresting Hamas members of the Palestinian parliament and imposed sanctions against Gaza. Deteriorating relations between Hamas and Fatah resulted in violence. An agreement to form a national unity government fell apart and Hamas led an armed takeover of Gaza while Fatah continued to control the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. There have been no elections since. Hamas has continued to attack Israel from Gaza, mostly using rockets until the latest ground incursion. Israel has maintained a tight blockade of the territory which has contributed to deteriorating living conditions and deepening poverty. Where are we now? Although western governments still pay lip service to a two-state solution, there has been no progress toward an agreement under Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said he will never accept a Palestinian state. His present government includes far-right parties that openly advocate the annexation of all or part of the West Bank to Israel and the continued governance of the Palestinians without full rights or the vote. Israeli and foreign human rights groups say Israel has increasingly carved out a form of apartheid in the occupied territories. The killing by Hamas of more than 1,200 people in Israel, and retaliatory Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip that have killed thousands, have moved the conflict into uncharted territory."

            "date": "2023-11-04T20:42:46Z",
            "content": "Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched through downtown Washington DC on Saturday in what organizers hoped was the largest US demonstration of its kind since Israel began its bombardment of Gaza after Hamas attacked the country last month. The crowd waved Palestinian flags, carried posters and chanted slogans during the National March on Washington: Free Palestine, which took place alongside similar events across the US and elsewhere in the world. Organizers representing or endorsed by dozens of pro-Palestinian groups directed marchers to Freedom Plaza in the nation\u2019s capital before looping past the White House. \u201cNow is the time to stand with the besieged people of Palestine! Gaza is being bombed by the hour. Its people are denied food, water and electricity by Israel. Tens of thousands more people are likely to die. We must ACT!\u201d the Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (Answer) coalition said on its website. The march, alongside protests in New York, Seattle and other US cities, was part of an intensifying push to demand both a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict and an end to US and western military aid to Israel. Demonstrations in support of Palestine were also staged in London, Berlin, Paris, Ankara and Istanbul with a similar message for both Israel and supportive western governments. In London, television footage showed large crowds holding sit-down protests blocking parts of the city centre. Protesters, Reuters reported, held \u201cFreedom for Palestine\u201d placards and chanted \u201cceasefire now\u201d and \u201cin our thousands, in our millions, we are all Palestinians\u201d. Brian Becker, the director of Answer, told the crowd in Washington that US public support for the Palestinian people had \u201centered a new era unlike any that had come before it\u201d. He drew a parallel with the anti-apartheid movement against South Africa four decades ago, saying that when it began the US Congress still considered Nelson Mandela a terrorist. But seven years later, Mandela was the president of South Africa. Change, Becker said, happens \u201cin leaps and bounds\u201d but not as a result of what happens in Congress or who is the White House, but what happens in communities and on the streets. \u201cThe change comes from us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re sending a strong message, a very strong message to Joe Biden: if you stand with genocide, we hold you guilty of genocide. \u201cWhen you kill 10,000 Palestinians not because of what they\u2019ve done but because of who they are, when you commit genocide against a people, and destroy a people in whole or in part, you are guilty of genocide and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to the White House,\u201d Becker added. Signs of a split between traditional, pro-Israel Democratic party supporters and younger voters, including Arab Americans, over the Israel-Gaza conflict were made apparent in a speech by Nihad Awad, the national director at the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations. \u201cThe language that President Biden and his party understands is the language of votes in the 2023 elections, and our message is: no ceasefire, no votes,\u201d Awad said, listing states that next year\u2019s presidential election could turn on. \u201cNo votes in Michigan, no votes in Arizona, no votes in Georgia, no votes in Nevada, no votes in Wisconsin, no votes in Pennsylvania.\u201d According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, at least 9,257 people in the territory have been killed \u2013 including thousands of children \u2013 23,516 wounded and hundreds of thousands more displaced since Israeli action started almost a month ago. The Israeli attack was in response to a Hamas assault from Gaza that killed 1,400 Israelis and took more than 200 hostages. On both sides, most casualties are civilians. Jewish groups advised against counter-protesting or engaging with the pro-Palestine marchers. Jen Zwilling with the Edlavitch DC Jewish Community Center, emailed members saying that engagement could \u201cincrease the potential for violence or antisemitic rhetoric\u201d. Sponsors of the Free Palestine march included the Palestinian youth movement, the American Muslim Alliance, National Students for Justice in Palestine and the Palestine Right to Return Coalition. It was also endorsed by American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Palestinian American Council and the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Speakers at the march included human rights attorney Noura Erakat, Palestinian writer and activist Mohammed El-Kurd, and figures from Muslim and Arab organizations in the US. Becker earlier told the Washington Post that he hoped the gathering would be \u201cthe largest demonstration in support of the Palestinian people in the history of the United States\u201d. \u201cPeople are mortified by the carnage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are equally mortified that the Biden administration has insisted that there not be a ceasefire.\u201d Last week, Joe Biden called for a humanitarian \u201cpause\u201d in the bombardment of Gaza but has not demanded a ceasefire."

            "date": "2023-11-28T12:00:10Z",
            "content": "Critics of Serbia\u2019s nationalist government who have documented the country\u2019s endemic corruption were targeted with military-grade spyware earlier this year, according to new findings by security researchers. The attempted hacking of two Serbian pro-democracy activists \u2013 who have asked not to be named to protect their safety \u2013 was ultimately not successful because both individuals\u2019 Apple iPhones had been updated with the latest iOS software, which the researchers said protected the devices from being infiltrated. The individuals were first alerted of the attempted hack by Apple, which sent both an alert that they may have been targeted by a state-sponsored actor. The warning was later confirmed after investigations by researchers at Access Now, the Share Foundation in Serbia, the Citizen Lab at the Munk School at the University of Toronto, and Amnesty International. The findings come just months after researchers revealed that Russian journalists who are critical of Vladamir Putin and living in the European Union had also been targeted with spyware. The Council of Europe and the European parliament have sought to advance policies that would curb the use of spyware, but the emergence of new cases inside the bloc point to an apparent willingness by some European governments to continue to use spyware to suppress and intimidate political critics. Natalia Krapiva, the tech-legal counsel at Access Now, said: \u201cThese findings are extremely worrying for the rule of law and democracy in Serbia. Uncontrolled use of commercial spyware is poison not only for human rights, but also security and democratic institutions in any country.\u201d The researchers found that the Serbians had been targeted about a minute apart from each other on or about 16 August 2023. Access Now and Citizen Lab discovered traces of the attempted attack, which sought to take advantage of a possible vulnerability in iPhone\u2019s HomeKit application. The researchers said use of the technical vulnerability was \u201cconsistent\u201d with those previously used by states improperly using one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated cyber weapons, known as Pegasus, which is sold by Israel\u2019s NSO Group. When Pegasus is successfully deployed against a target, it can essentially take over a mobile phone, including turning the phone into a portable listening device. It can also access information held in encrypted applications and view a user\u2019s photographs and messages. The researchers in the Serbian case could not definitively confirm what kind of spyware was used because available forensic indicators were limited. \u201cWe aren\u2019t attributing these attacks to a particular operator at this time, but we note that a decade of Citizen Lab investigations have found that Serbia is a regular customer for mercenary spyware and other commercial surveillance technologies,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab. NSO said in a statement to the Guardian that Citizen Lab and Access Now\u2019s report were \u201cinconclusive\u201d. The company has repeatedly said that Pegasus is sold to governments for the purpose of being used in serious crime and terror investigations and that its use \u201csaves lives\u201d. It added: \u201cNSO does not operate its technology and is not privy to the collected intelligence.\u201d While the researchers could not definitively attribute the attempted attacks in Serbia to a specific spyware, the attempted hacks are likely to renew focus on past findings involving covert data collection and surveillance by Serbia\u2019s Security Information Agency (BIA). The BIA\u2019s most recent director was Aleksander Vulin, who was placed on a sanctions list by the US Treasury in July 2023 for his support of Moscow and for using \u201chis political positions to build support for Russia\u2019s malign activities\u201d and fuel instability in Serbia. Vulin resigned from his position on 3 November. One alleged victim of the hacking attempt who was interviewed by the Guardian described their work as focused on being critical of Serbia\u2019s \u201cautocratic regime\u201d and the country\u2019s \u201cwidespread corruption\u201d, as well as the current government\u2019s pro-Russian foreign policy, which has not aligned with the EU on issues such as sanctions against Moscow. The attempted hacking, the person said, was likely an attempt to intimidate or discredit their work, \u201cto find something compromising against me\u201d. Both of the individuals who were targeted believed the attempted hacks could also have been connected to calls for official inquiries into the government\u2019s handling of a mass shooting that left 17 people \u2013 including children \u2013 dead last summer. Mass demonstrations erupted in the wake of the shooting, with protesters decrying the populist president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, who was blamed for creating divisions within the country that some alleged led to the mass shooting. The Serbian government did not respond to requests for comment."

            "date": "2023-11-04T09:00:35Z",
            "content": "Andrew Cuomo resigned as governor of New York in August 2021, amid a blizzard of sexual harassment allegations. None were prosecuted. Against this backdrop, he smolders. Once a giant figure in the Democratic ranks, he is out of a job. He \u201cdied as he lived\u201d, Lis Smith, a former adviser, wrote in Any Given Tuesday, her memoir published last year. Cuomo had \u201czero regard for the people around him and the impact his actions would have on them\u201d. Enter Melissa DeRosa with What\u2019s Left Unsaid, a full-throated defense of her own former boss. On the page and while promoting her book, Cuomo\u2019s chief adviser and most senior aide generally wields a sledgehammer. Except when she doesn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on Lis\u2019s book,\u201d De Rosa said, when asked by Vanity Fair. \u201cWe all lived through this in our own ways. We all had to cope with the fallout of it.\u201d Subtitled My Life at the Center of Power, Politics and Crisis, DeRosa\u2019s memoir is pocked with scenes of a marriage gone south, of trying to cope with Covid-19 and of general governmental strife. She punches hard. Her anger is white hot. Her book is deliberate and focused. She slams Cuomo\u2019s accusers. Letitia James, the New York attorney general, and Kathy Hochul, Cuomo\u2019s successor as governor, get it in the neck. Aides to James had sexual harassment-related problems of their own, DeRosa charges. She also calls out CNN and the New York Times for their own alleged deficits on that score. DeRosa has connections. She interned in Hillary Clinton\u2019s office, when Clinton was a New York senator. She thanks Clinton for helping put steel in her spine. She gives a shoutout to Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s close aide. DeRosa led New York operations for Barack Obama\u2019s political action committee. She rose through the ranks of state government and Cuomo\u2019s office. She charges Hochul with administrative and political ineptitude, echoing criticism, leveled by Nancy Pelosi, that Hochul cost the Democrats control of the US House by screwing up the New York redistricting process, handing Republicans seats. \u201cThe governor didn\u2019t realize soon enough where the trouble was,\u201d Pelosi told Maureen Dowd of the New York Times. But here, DeRosa can be myopic. According to Bill de Blasio, the former New York mayor, Cuomo was also at fault in the process that most observers say facilitated Republican gains. If a mere 89 more New Yorkers had been counted, the size of the state\u2019s congressional delegation would have suffered no loss in size. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, if the state had invested in the census, could you have found 89 more people to count? Sure, easily,\u201d De Blasio has said. \u201cThis was a lost opportunity by the state government to get the count right.\u201d DeRosa acknowledges tensions between mayor and governor but takes De Blasio to task for his embrace of leftwing politics. \u201cThat meant staking out a position that actively opposed police presence,\u201d she writes, blaming De Blasio for problems related to crime. She also calls him out for sidling up to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive star in Congress, and mocks his presidential run to nowhere. DeRosa also deals with the fractious relationship between Cuomo and the White House of Donald Trump, for so long a New York fixture and a former client of the Cuomo family law firm, Blutrich, Falcone &amp; Miller. In 2020, under Covid, New York lockdown policy put it at odds with the administration. \u201cWe\u2019ve done polling, and you guys are in the wrong place on this,\u201d a \u201csmug\u201d Jared Kushner is quoted as telling DeRosa, saying New York was out of sync with Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Florida. \u201cWe were in the middle of a pandemic, one that had already killed tens of thousands of people, and I was talking with President Trump\u2019s top adviser \u2026 about polling in swing states,\u201d DeRosa writes. In fall 2021, Ron DeSantis actively discouraged vaccination. The grim reaper had a field day on the governor\u2019s front lawn. Florida came to surpass New York in fatalities, in absolute and relative numbers. According to the Lancet, Florida\u2019s unadjusted death rate (per 100,000) was 416, for New York 384. DeRosa also attacks Trump for reneging on federal assistance to infrastructure projects. Why? Cuomo publicly criticized Trump. To quote DeRosa, \u201cthe president of the United States had lost his mind over four sentences in a convention speech.\u201d Yet Cuomo has more in common with Trump than DeRosa acknowledges. It went beyond being \u201ctwo tough guys from Queens, raised by larger-than-life fathers\u201d, as the author puts it. Confronted with pushback over his decision in 2014 to disband an anti-corruption commission which he himself appointed, Cuomo bellowed: \u201cIt\u2019s my commission.

            "date": "2023-11-27T09:24:43Z",
            "content": "In the run-up and year following the US supreme court\u2019s reversal of Roe v Wade in June 2022, there emerged a narrative of return: that abortion in states where it was suddenly banned would revert to the underground. It would be a return to 1972, when diffuse, partially anonymous groups such as the Jane Collective, a secret network of abortion providers in Chicago immortalized in the documentary The Janes and in a feature film starring Elizabeth Banks, stood in for legal reproductive healthcare. In reality, the end of Roe didn\u2019t so much send the US back to a pre-1973 landscape of unsafe abortions, but toward a bleak and unprecedented future of criminalized pregnancy. And the abortion underground never disappeared under Roe, anyway. Far from it \u2013 in a new book, the feminist historian, critic and poet Angela Hume draws on dozens of interviews with former unlicensed abortion providers, community clinic workers and volunteer clinic defenders who together formed the vibrant, multi-pronged and under-sung radical edge of the abortion defense movement. Deep Care: the Radical Activists Who Provided Abortions, Defied the Law and Fought to Keep Clinics Open is, in part, an oral history of the loose collective of activists and clinicians orbiting a single feminist clinic in Oakland, California, over three decades. It is part collage of organization tactics, art and poetry, the creative side of political consciousness. And it is part roadmap for how to practice small-group, community-based, intersectional care, within and outside of the law and often against extreme hostility, even while Roe was technically on the books. \u201cThis is a story about revolutionary deep care,\u201d Hume writes in the preface. \u201cCommunity care that transforms and empowers us from the inside out, through practice and over time.\u201d Hume, who is based in the Bay Area, initially set out to write a book about feminist poets and health advocates, and particularly the work of Pat Parker, a radical Black lesbian feminist and poet who worked at the Oakland Feminist Women\u2019s Health Center (OFWHC) from 1978 until 1988. But speaking to Parker\u2019s former co-worker Linci Comy, the clinic\u2019s director for more than 30 years, Hume began to see OFWHC as a critical community hub, a bastion of reproductive rights activism and linchpin of several overlapping, related movements. First, the oft-forgotten abortion self-help movement, a west coast-led political movement starting in the 1970s which encouraged lay people \u2013 as in, people outside the medical establishment \u2013 to learn about and practice gynecology on each other. This encompassed cervical self-exam and \u201cmenstrual extraction\u201d (suction abortion), with the goal of opening up the practice within their own communities. Self-help was a group educational practice defined against the clinic\u2019s service for a fee; the idea was that \u201cabortion is normal, and abortion is natural. It\u2019s a normal process and it\u2019s a natural process,\u201d said Hume. \u201cAnd that small groups of lay people, trained in sterile technique and menstrual extraction, could easily do this.\u201d After Roe protected the right to abortion, at least in name, some underground self-helpers shifted to the clinical setting; OFWHC, renamed West Coast Feminist Health Project/Women\u2019s Choice in 1988, was founded in October 1972 by 19-year-old Laura Brown as a self-help clinic that offered pregnancy screenings and abortion referrals as well as workshops on the female body. And many continued to work outside a clinical setting, guided by the certainty that medical tools and knowledge should proliferate outside the long discriminatory system of institutionalized medicine and the practicality that just because abortion was legal didn\u2019t mean it was affordable or accessible. \u201cSelf-helpers understood that abortion was legal for many people in name only,\u201d said Hume, particularly after the passage of the Hyde amendment in 1977, which barred federal Medicaid payments for abortion and effectively limited access for poor people. The Hyde amendment was evidence for what many of Hume\u2019s interviewees explain in the book: \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on the state to provide care,\u201d Hume summarized. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t then, and we can\u2019t now.\u201d The self-help movement \u201cteaches us about how to empower, defend, and care for each other\u201d, she said. \u201cAnd when we can do this, we can strengthen our community from the inside, and we don\u2019t have to rely on the state.\u201d Deep Care proceeds largely chronologically, as abortion defense expanded to include a street movement to defend clinics against escalating attacks by the Christian right, which grew more organized and violent throughout the 1980s and 90s. Hume spoke with several former volunteers and organizers of Bay Area Coalition Against Operation Rescue (later Bay Area Coalition for Our Reproductive Rights), a group organized in the late 80s against a radical anti-abortion group which blocked clinic entrances. She gets into the weeds: how they recruited, how they build and deployed an emergency response network, how and where they stood outside clinics to create literal pathways for access; meeting notes, posters, a street theater wedding mocking the right\u2019s faux piety, which drew on the creative tactics employed by the sister grassroots movement Act Up, to end the Aids crisis. The activists are astute on what drove the right\u2019s dogged focus on abortion, which by the late 80s had become a coalition-building issue: it was always an expression of social and political control. A decade into Roe-era America, Hume writes, citing the insight of a clinic defender named Laura Weide, \u201cthe right had figured out how to dog-whistle their racism and build their forces around abortion in a way that enabled their followers to feel moral,\u201d a strategy which has evolved into present-day attacks on healthcare. \u201cToday, the right is recycling the anti-abortion playbook to destroy access to healthcare or even its possibility for trans people. We\u2019re seeing the same information distortion, the harassment, the legislative attacks,\u201d said Hume. \u201cThe history teaches us that there will never not be a need for community-based care solutions.\u201d Whether in self-help circles, independent clinics or underground networks of clinic defense, small group and community capability is \u201cthe heart\u201d of the book, said Hume. \u201cDeep care takes time. It involves learning how to do intimate relationships differently. And it involves acknowledging that we share power by both taking care of each other and taking care of ourselves.\u201d Hume was finishing the book when the Dobbs decision came down, and it looms; she ends this work of astonishing historical record with notes for the future. Among them: accompany each other, fight to keep clinics open, band against the body cops. And critically, make the referral. \u201cHistory shows us that a key to safe abortion is the referral to knowledgable, trustworthy care, and the referral has for centuries been a tool of underground abortion workers,\u201d she said. With the spate of recent bans and widespread access to abortion pills by mail, above and underground, via such organizations as AidAccess or Plan C, the referral is \u201cmore important than ever before\u201d. And, crucially, the power of long-term, close-knit, compassion-based work at the local level \u2013 assisting with access, for example, or tracing funding for local crisis pregnancy centers that covertly discourage abortion, or combatting misinformation within one\u2019s community. \u201cWhen small groups of people work closely and securely and dynamically together, they can make revolutionary change,\u201d said Hume. \u201cIt can be challenging and it takes a lot of patience and practice, but when you do it successfully, you can really build community power. It\u2019s one of the most important political lessons that there is.\u201d Deep Care: The Radical Activists Who Provided Abortions, Defied the Law and Fought to Keep Clinics Open is out now This article was amended on 27 November 2023. A previous version incorrectly stated that the Hyde Amendment barred the use of federal Medicare, not Medicaid, funds for abortion."

            "content": "Donald Trump Jr is expected to take the witness stand in New York for a second time as defense lawyers for the family firm make their case in the $250m fraud trial. Trump Jr is the first witness to testify from the defense\u2019s witness list, which also includes Donald Trump and Eric Trump as witnesses, though it is unclear whether they will end up being called. The New York attorney general\u2019s office is suing Trump, his adult sons and other executives at the Trump Organization for inflating the value of assets on financial statements. They rested their case after Ivanka Trump testified last Wednesday. Trump faces a fine of at least $250m if found guilty at the end of the trial. The New York judge Arthur Engoron has already ruled Trump should have his business licenses revoked for fraud, though the ruling is going through an appellate court. Trump\u2019s eldest son had taken the stand on 1 November, where he said he did not work on the financial statements on the case \u2013 though he signed multiple documents affirming their fairness and accuracy \u2013 and said he expected banks to do their own \u201cdue diligence\u201d rather than relying on the financial statements. \u201cI know a lot of bankers that do their own due diligence,\u201d Trump Jr said on the stand. Trump\u2019s team did not question him during his first appearance. His lawyers will be trying to make their case that lenders were not harmed by and had actively sought out relationships with the Trump family. In testimony so far, the Trumps have downplayed the importance of the financial statements, saying they were exclusively handled by the organization\u2019s accountants and legal departments and that the family typically had enough cash on hand to conduct deals. Though they were presented with multiple documents showing they were consulted over the financial statements and had signed off on deals where the statements were used to affirm the family\u2019s net worth, the Trumps said they did not recall working on or using the statements. When Trump himself took the stand, he furiously ranted against the judge and New York attorney general Letitia James, whom he called a \u201cpolitical hack\u201d. His children, especially Ivanka Trump, were calmer on the stand but similarly tried to undermine the importance of the financial statements. Trump\u2019s defense team said they will wrap up their witness testimonies by 15 December. The trial is scheduled to go until 22 December, though it could end before then."

            "date": "2023-11-22T17:52:36Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s a looking-glass world. Up is down. Black is white. War is peace. Just a few months ago we were told the UK economy was in a desperate state: no room for tax cuts. Just more of the same. Suck it up. But in the last few weeks we\u2019ve been getting noises off. Anonymous briefings from Treasury ministers. All is well. Things have never been better. Thanks to the diligence of the Tories, we can all expect some more pocket money in the autumn statement. If you\u2019re confused by this, then spare a thought for Jeremy Hunt. The chancellor who was never meant to be chancellor. The chancellor who knows next to nothing about macroeconomics. Just think. A man of almost limitless ambition \u2013 he twice thought he would make a good prime minister \u2013 but who never once aspired to be chancellor. Because even he knew he would be hopeless at it. A glimpse of self-awareness. The entrepreneur who knows how to create a small business. Start with a big one. But greatness was thrust upon him. Or at least, necessity was thrust upon him. This time last year the Tories were in shit street. Kwasi Kwarteng had crashed the economy with his mini-budget and the Tory brand was on its knees. A new chancellor was needed. Someone who could be the grownup. And that person was Jezza. Not because of any ability. But because of his plausibility. He looked like the sort of Tory chancellor to which the country had grown accustomed. And now we\u2019re rather lumbered with him. At least for another year. An eighth chancellor in 13 years would begin to look a lot worse than carelessness. More like catatonia. A death wish. Long before Hunt stood up to give his autumn statement, his wife and children had filed into the back seats of the MPs\u2019 visitors\u2019 gallery. You got the feeling they all knew this would be his last but one big set-piece event in the Commons. Jezza certainly did. This wasn\u2019t the kind of budget you would give if you had any intention of being around for the next five years to oversee its delivery. This was a budget designed to destroy a future chancellor. So Hunt was just there to soak up the vibes. To enjoy it while he still could. The kindest interpretation is that Jezza was just too dim to know what he was doing. That he was just the useful idiot for Rishi Sunak. You certainly can\u2019t blame his ministerial colleagues in the Treasury. They are even more half-witted than Hunt. That\u2019s why they were chosen. Not that there is anyone better lurking on the backbenches. Hunt began by insisting he was putting the economy back on track. An odd admission. It rather acknowledged that the Tories had done untold damage over the last 13 years and were only now getting round to trying to fix the problem. Thanks for that. \u201cWe\u2019ve got inflation cracked,\u201d he boasted. \u201cJust as the prime minister promised.\u201d It was now only two and a half times the Bank of England\u2019s target \u2013 and its fall nothing to do with government intervention \u2013 so could we please have a two-minute love-in for Rish!? The Great Gratitude. Thank you, Supreme Leader. This was going to be an autumn statement for growth, he continued. Yup. Talk us through this one, Jezza. He did, slowly and with few signs of understanding what someone else had written for him. His eyes started to revolve anticlockwise in terror. As if every sentence was dynamite. Sweat formed on his brow. He could sense the danger. But he didn\u2019t know what direction it was coming from. No choice but to press ahead. The Office for Budget Responsibility had revised its forecasts. Down was up. It was fantastic news. Growth would more or less stagnate for the next five years. He was a man who was going places. Perdition. \u201cWe are taking decisions for the long term,\u201d he announced. Long term as in sheer desperation. Every government reset had failed \u2013 now there were at least two a week \u2013 and this was more or less the last throw of the dice. Thanks to his brilliance, he had managed to create extra fiscal headroom. Largely thanks to inflation and capped departmental budgets \u2013 hooray for inflation! \u2013 he had extra money to spend. So he was going to squander almost all of it on tax cuts and let public services die. Austerity 2.0. Here the speech rather meandered. Jezza isn\u2019t the best of readers and even the faithful Tory backbenchers could see this budget was a pig\u2019s ear. Many began to doze off. It would get a few half-hearted cheers in the Tory press for a day or so, but the electorate would soon see through it. There was nothing there to make you want to live. Though there was some gratuitous sadism. Or \u201ccompassionate\u201d cuts to the disabled. Work, you losers. Stop scrounging. Always scrounging. Most of you have deliberately chosen to have mental health problems. Finally, after some business tax cuts that even Hunt had to admit were well above his pay grade, we got to the 2p cut in national insurance. A cut to a tax that Rishi Sunak had raised. Go, Tories! And just in case everyone hadn\u2019t realised how screwed the government was, he was going to introduce the cut from January rather than March. Just so that everyone would feel better off before the election. Only, because of fiscal drag, the tax burden would be reaching its highest ever level in five years\u2019 time. The tax cut that wasn\u2019t a tax cut. The chancellor who isn\u2019t a chancellor. The sweat-stain of sheer panic. Rachel Reeves could barely contain her contempt in her reply. Where to start? She was all for tax cuts \u2013 what aspiring chancellor wouldn\u2019t be? \u2013 but this was just economic vandalism. And she would be the one left to pick up the pieces. She wasn\u2019t going to say no, obviously. But really? Did they have any more giveaways for the spring budget? There was a few billion left unspent. How about something for the most well-off? Like inheritance tax? Over on the government benches, Sunak and Jezza giggled and bounced up and down like children. A sure tell. They knew they were busted. If they had honour \u2013 a sense of grace \u2013 they might have given up there and then. But they mean to take us all down with them. They\u2019re so pretty, oh so pretty. They\u2019re vacant.

            "content": "Rishi Sunak has received no poll bounce after cutting taxes in last week\u2019s autumn statement, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. Following a week in which the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, described a reduction in national insurance as \u201cthe biggest tax cut on work since the 1980s\u201d Labour\u2019s lead has increased to 16 percentage points over the Tories. Labour is on 42% (up two points compared with a week ago), the Conservatives are on 26% (-1), the Lib Dems 11% (-1), Reform 8% (-1) and the Greens are unchanged on 7%. Opinion among voters was divided on the autumn statement in which Hunt was able to reduce some taxes only by further squeezing departmental spending in future years. The Office for Budget Responsibility also took any gloss off Hunt\u2019s announcements by making it clear that the overall burden of tax would still rise every year to a postwar high of 37.7% of GDP by 2028-29. Overall, 23% of people polled thought the autumn statement was good, against 27% who thought it was bad. Close to 50% were not sure. Decisions to raise the national living wage by almost 10% to \u00a311.44 an hour, and the state pension by 8.5%, were the most popular, with 78% saying the former was a good idea and 71% the latter. About 63% thought cutting national insurance by 2% for employees from January was a good idea, while 17% thought it was a bad idea. Approximately 25% of voters approved of the way Jeremy Hunt is doing his job as chancellor, while 40% disapprove, a net score of -15. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, does better with 24% approving of her performance compared with 23% who disapprove (a net score of +1). While more people back Labour to run the economy well than the Conservatives, Labour\u2019s leads on questions relating to economic management have fallen. About 30% now support Labour to run the economy, against 26% who would prefer the Tories. When the same question was last asked by Opinium, in late October, Labour\u2019s lead was 7%. Similar falls in Labour\u2019s lead are recorded when voters are asked to choose between the two parties on issues such as which would spend public money more efficientlyor improve public services."

            "content": "In 2012, the Star Wars creator, George Lucas, released his pet project: Red Tails, the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African Americans who fought in the second world war. Doug Melville assumed it would mean that his great-uncle, Benjamin O Davis Jr, would finally gain the recognition he deserved. \u201cI was invited to a screening and he was set to be the main character in the movie, played by Terrence Howard,\u201d Melville recalls, via Zoom from home in New York. \u201cThen, when the character came on the screen, he had a different name. \u201cI asked who had made the movie and they said it\u2019s not a documentary, it\u2019s an amalgamation. All those things are true but I couldn\u2019t understand how we could make a movie and not give some shine to the families who the movie is actually portraying.\u201d Seething, Melville went to his father Larry, now 90. He made clear the snub was just the tip of the iceberg. He described how Benjamin O Davis Jr and his father, Benjamin O Davis Sr, raised him \u2013 and how they were treated as if they were invisible because of their race. The tales piqued Melville\u2019s curiosity and desire to protect the family legacy. \u201cWhat I learned,\u201d he says, \u201cis that it\u2019s important, at least in the United States of America, to own your own narratives and to take ownership of the story before someone else does.\u201d Melville\u2019s research took him from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, from the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC to presidential libraries and the far corners of the internet. This culminated in a book, Invisible Generals, telling the story of America\u2019s first Black generals, a father and a son who strove to desegregate the military and create the Tuskegee Airmen. Melville, a 46-year-old diversity executive, says: \u201cAt the start of world war two there were 335,000 people in the United States military and there were only two Black officers: Ben Jr and his dad, Ben Sr. It was hard for me to believe that \u2026 that got me going.\u201d Benjamin O Davis Sr (1880\u20131970) held combat, diplomatic and administrative roles for the US army over more than 40 years. He was stationed in the Philippines during the first world war and stayed until 1920, eventually being promoted to captain. In 1940 he became the first Black army general. He served in Europe during the second world war and was lead adviser to President Harry Truman on the desegregation of the military in 1948. Benjamin O Davis Jr (1912-2002) was shunned at West Point because of his race in the 1930s but eventually commanded the Tuskegee Airmen and became the first African American general in the US air force. His career included drawing the median line separating China from Taiwan (\u201cthe Davis line\u201d), implementing security standards at commercial airports and leading the creation of a national speed limit, earning him the nickname \u201cMr 55\u201d. While he never had a son, Ben Jr raised his nephew, Larry Melville, from the time he was six. Ben Jr encouraged Larry to go into law. He became one of Connecticut\u2019s first Black superior court judges. Doug Melville traced the family\u2019s military associations to the mid-19th century. Ben Sr\u2019s father worked for John Logan, a Union general during the civil war, and was on the horse and buggy with President Ulysses S Grant at his second inauguration, his son on his knee. Melville recounts: \u201cBen Davis Sr wanted to fight for America so he left home and joined the Buffalo Soldiers in Wyoming and, when he was out there fighting, he realised being a great equestrian was an opportunity to get promoted. When he did that, he met Charles Young, who was a Black graduate of West Point and told him there\u2019s a way to get Blacks into West Point. \u201cWhen Ben Sr had a son \u2013 his wife died in childbirth \u2013 he brings his son on an aeroplane ride, barnstorming, and his son says, \u2018Daddy, I want to be a pilot.\u2019 He says, \u2018I\u2019m going to make sure to do everything that I can so you can live your dream.\u2019 He started training him from a child to get into West Point and that\u2019s how Ben Jr became a pilot and the captain and the commander of the Tuskegee Airmen.\u201d In 1932, Ben Jr became the fourth Black cadet to attend West Point and the first in the 20th century. Over four years, he had no roommate, ate in silence and had minimal interaction with other cadets. Despite this, he graduated in 1936, among the top 20% of his class. Melville, who regarded Ben Jr as a grandfather, says: \u201cBy the time he became a junior, people started waiting outside the bus for him \u2013 Black Americans, the chefs at West Point \u2013 and it did build that sense of camaraderie. When he graduated, it was front-page news all over America that he was America\u2019s number one graduate because he was able to survive it. They dealt with what they needed to deal with: performance over everything.\u201d Ben Jr demonstrated two leadership skills Melville finds pertinent now. First, use the system to defuse the system: \u201cSometimes the systems are set up and you just have to be a part of them to figure out ways to evolve them.\u201d Second, meet people where they are: \u201cDon\u2019t expect them to go on their own. That\u2019s another great tip and something that he lived by. For all of us, these are somewhat basics but things that still are relevant today. The impossible takes time but in time you can do the impossible and that\u2019s kind of how I look at this whole story of legacy. It takes generations to evolve it.\u201d Ben Jr enrolled at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama (now Tuskegee University) to train reserve officers. Ben Sr helped persuade President Franklin D Roosevelt to establish an all-Black unit within the army air force. Ben Jr earned his wings in 1942 and within a year assumed command of a unit comprising a thousand Black pilots, later famous as the Tuskegee Airmen. In Europe, they outperformed expectations, downing more than twice the number of aircraft they lost, sabotaging miles of railway lines, sinking more than 40 ships including a destroyer and never losing a bomber on an escort mission. The Tuskegee Airmen played a pivotal role in US military integration. Melville says: \u201cWhen [Ben Jr] took over as commander of the Tuskegee Airmen, the biggest challenge that he saw was if he gets shot down, he felt that there was a potential that they would cancel their own programme. \u201cThe interesting part is how the Tuskegee Airmen were created and then, when you look at how they had to operate, he knew how frail the system was to give them the opportunity. He wanted to make sure he never got shot down so he had to always debate should he command the mission or send someone else to command the mission. \u201cWhen Ben would do interviews, he would share that people didn\u2019t even know there was an all-Black fighter pilot group in world war two.\u201d The base where the unit was stationed did not appear on many of the Allied maps, Melville says, so, concerned that they could be the target of friendly fire, \u201che encouraged the tails to be painted red so people knew that he was part of America.\u201d \u2018The privileges of being an American\u2019 On 5 July 1852, Frederick Douglass asked, \u201cWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\u201d Some African Americans have expressed scepticism about fighting for a nation that discriminates against them at home. But more than 300,000 served in Vietnam, even as the US was engulfed in turmoil over the struggle for civil rights. Despite facing discrimination all his life, for Ben Jr there was no ambiguity about patriotism or assimilation. He once said: \u201cThe privileges of being an American belong to those brave enough to fight for them.\u201d Melville explains: \u201cHis attitude about everything was, we are so privileged and we are so fortunate that we can fight for a country that\u2019s a democracy and we can input into the change that we want to see. He was never negative. \u201cHe was positive to a fault because he just said, \u2018There\u2019s so many people that are doing so much worse from a lifestyle standpoint, from a nation state standpoint.\u2019 I mean, he\u2019s growing up before world war two so he got to see levels of poverty where there was hardly paved roads and running water may not have been in your place. \u201cHis whole thing was he just wanted to be known as an American. He fought more for that than anything in his whole life because he didn\u2019t like being called African American. He was OK with Black American, if you must, but he just wanted to be an American like everybody else. \u201cIt\u2019s a counter-thought to how we think today because sometimes we think everybody wants to have their own box and everybody wants to be separated. At the end of his life, a lot of people debated him about this. They were like, \u2018Why do you want to be an American?\u2019 But he just wanted to be an American with everyone else instead of in the box. \u201cWhen he would go speak at colleges, he would always dread the Q&amp;A portion when people would raise their hand, saying, \u2018I don\u2019t agree with you, this is the wrong way, we\u2019re African Americans, we\u2019re Black Americans.\u2019 He would say, \u2018I understand that.\u2019 His lived experience, though, is hard for us to relate to because he lived 100% segregation and even during world war two, the parts of the planes of the other pilots couldn\u2019t be used on his planes. \u201cThe food, the nurses, everything had to be 100% segregated so, at its largest number, the Tuskegee Airmen was essentially 15,000 people and a 100% segregated air force within the United States Air Force. If you\u2019re looking at it from that perspective, he just kept saying, \u2018This is so inefficient, we\u2019re all fighting the same war and you won\u2019t put his plane part on my plane because he\u2019s white and I\u2019m Black?\u2019 This stuff sounds wild but it was just in our lifetime.\u201d In 2017, West Point opened a barracks named in honour of Ben Jr. Two years later, the US Air Force Academy named its airfield for him too. Melville hopes his book will help make the generals invisible no more and encourage others to shed light on their own hidden figures. \u201cI want the world to hear this story. I want people to find their own legacy. I want people to search their own family history, understand who\u2019s in your living room, who\u2019s in your house, who\u2019s in your ancestry, that you have stories that you just don\u2019t know because there\u2019s a generation of people that just didn\u2019t talk and they\u2019re right there in your living room. \u201cSometimes the greatest stories are right there but you\u2019re worried about your kids and they\u2019re worried about their friends and you\u2019re worried about what you\u2019re going to do. The people right behind you in that living room, they have really great stories too, but a lot of the time we don\u2019t stop them and hear them.\u201d Invisible Generals is published in the US by Simon &amp; Schuster"

            "date": "2023-11-25T10:00:47Z",
            "content": "This book tells the important story of Benjamin O Davis Sr and Jr, America\u2019s first Black father and son generals. Triumphing over the harsh racism of the first half of the 20th century, their accomplishments were as important to the integration of the US armed forces as the achievements of men like Martin Luther King Jr and Bayard Rustin were in the civilian world. Their comparative anonymity is the reason the author Doug Melville called his book Invisible Generals. After Davis Jr was named commander of the first all-Black air unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron, and later of the 332nd Fighter Group, a larger all-Black unit, he led the celebrated Tuskegee Airmen, one of the most successful fighting units of the second world war. Melville\u2019s father was raised by Davis Jr, so the author was thrilled when he was invited to a gala screening of Red Tails, George Lucas\u2019s movie about the Tuskegee Airmen in 2012. But he was horrified when he discovered the movie had changed his grandfather\u2019s name from Davis to Bullard. That anger fueled Melville\u2019s determination to bring new attention to his ancestors. A self-described \u201centrepreneurial thinker and marketer\u201d, he is not an elegant writer, but his story is powerful enough to propel the reader all the way through. After Davis Jr was admitted to West Point in 1932 \u2013 a privilege denied his father, who nevertheless became America\u2019s first Black general \u2013 the younger Davis was completely ostracized by his white classmates, none of whom would speak to him, room with him or a share a table to eat. Nevertheless, Davis graduated 35th in a class of 276. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, he became only the second Black officer in the 20th century. His father was the first, commissioned in 1901. The difficulty of achieving those commissions is suggested by a heinous internal report produced by the army in 1925, which said the American \u201cNegro\u201d had not developed leadership qualities because of \u201cmental inferiority\u201d and an \u201cinherent weakness of character\u201d. Like every minority group that has fought to prove the truth of Declaration of Independence \u2013 that all men (and, much later, women) are created equal \u2013 Black people had to wildly outperform their white counterparts before their inherent talents would be recognized. The younger Gen Davis and the men under his command did that in the second world war. In its obituary of the younger Davis, the New York Times noted the Tuskegee Airmen had an extraordinary record \u201cagainst the Luftwaffe \u2026 they shot down 111 enemy planes and destroyed or damaged 273 on the ground at a cost of more than 70 pilots killed in action or missing. They never lost an American bomber to enemy fighters on their escort missions. As the leader of dozens of missions Gen Davis was highly decorated, receiving the Silver Star for a strafing run into Austria and the Distinguished Flying Cross for a bomber-escort mission to Munich.\u201d Almost every triumph of this father and son was tinged with disappointment because of virulent racism. When Davis Sr received a richly deserved promotion from Franklin D Roosevelt that made him the first Black US general, in 1940, the appointment was derided as an effort to appeal to the Black vote in New York and Illinois and \u201can appeasement\u201d of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Six years later, Davis Sr was appointed by Harry Truman to the president\u2019s committee on civil rights, to plan the integration of the armed forces. But instead of standing by Truman\u2019s side two years later when the president signed the executive order which was one of the first great triumphs of the modern civil rights movement, Davis was nowhere to be seen \u2013 because he had been forced to retire just six days earlier. Similarly, when his son was eligible for his fourth star as a general, Lyndon Johnson inexplicably refused to approve the promotion. The second half of Melville\u2019s book records some of the ways America has made amends. Years after the younger Davis retired, at the urging of Senator John McCain, Bill Clinton finally bestowed his richly deserved fourth star. But the ageing general barely understood what was happening, because of the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s. Melville played a significant role in the lobbying effort that led to his grandfather\u2019s greatest vindication. In a competition with William Westmoreland and Norman Schwarzkopf Jr, Benjamin Davis Jr finally won the respect from West Point he was denied in four years as a cadet. In 2017, less than one week after one of America\u2019s worst racist events in Charlottesville, Virginia, Melville traveled to West Point for the dedication of the Gen Benjamin O Davis Jr Barracks, a brand new dormitory at the center of the campus. Melville insisted that the construction men and women who worked on the dormitory be invited to the ceremony. One led him to at stone on which he had secretly etched a version of Psalm 118:22, 200ft from the entrance to the imposing new building. It read: \u201cThe stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.\u201d Invisible Generals is published in the US by Simon &amp; Schuster"

            "content": "The US military has identified the five special operations troops who were killed when their helicopter crashed in the Mediterranean Sea during training on Friday. Officials identified the army operatives as Stephen R Dwyer, 38, of Clarksville, Tennessee; Shane M Barnes, 34, of Sacramento, California; Tanner W Grone, 26, of Gorham, New Hampshire; Andrew Southard, 27, of Apache Junction, Arizona; and Cade M Wolfe, 24, of Mankato, Minnesota. Dwyer and Barnes held the rank of chief warrant officer 3 and 2, respectively, according to the US defense department. Grone was a staff sergeant while Southard and Wolfe were sergeants. The military said the five operatives were killed when their MH-60 Blackhawk helicopter was conducting aerial refueling and crashed as a result of an unspecified mid-flight emergency. The US army\u2019s combat readiness center on Monday was still conducting an investigation into the deadly crash. Citing anonymous sources, the New York Times reported on Sunday that the MH-60 went down off the coast of Cyprus, which is the closest European Union country to Gaza, where Israel and Hamas have been fighting since early October. The New York Times report said the army and navy had sent Delta Force and Seal team units to stand by in case they were needed to help evacuate American citizens from the region. Such commandos are trained in hostage rescue operations. Some of the hostages taken by Hamas included Americans. The White House has said it has no plans to put US military members on the ground in Gaza. Joe Biden issued a statement mourning the military members\u2019 deaths, noting that they died at the beginning of the weekend commemorating Veterans Day and said they embodied the reality that military members \u201cput their lives on the line for our country every day\u201d."

            "date": "2023-11-29T08:03:59Z",
            "content": "An Australian federal police officer has told the New South Wales supreme court he \u201cregrets\u201d providing it with incorrect evidence as part of a bid to intervene in the sale of a property that would fund the ex-US military pilot Daniel Duggan\u2019s legal costs. The AFP applied on 31 October to have the multimillion-dollar property on the NSW south coast owned by Duggan\u2019s wife, Saffrine, seized by the state under a foreign restraining order that was imposed by a US court early last month. Duggan is being held in prison in NSW while he fights extradition to the US over charges of conspiracy, arms trafficking and money laundering relating to allegations he accepted cash to train Chinese military pilots more than a decade ago. Saffrine had put the \u201cBundaleer\u201d property in Saddleback Mountain, where she and her husband were building a house, on the market to help pay his lawyers before the AFP applied to seize it on behalf of the US. Duggan\u2019s lawyers are fighting in the NSW supreme court to overturn the restraining order, arguing it is in the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d to prevent the property from being seized and to allow Saffrine to sell it. They also say the property\u2019s value far exceeds the amount of money that the US alleges are proceeds of Duggan\u2019s alleged crimes. It is still listed online, described as a partly completed luxury homestead on a 30-hectare (77-acre) block. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The AFP officer Simon Moore appeared before the NSW supreme court on Wednesday, where he was asked to explain why he had provided it with an affidavit in which he incorrectly named Duggan as the director of the company which owns the property. The property is owned by Saffrine\u2019s company, Power Art Trading, which is registered in Hong Kong. Saffrine is its sole director. Under cross-examination by Duggan\u2019s barrister, Gregory Jones, Moore said he had made an \u201cerror\u201d and that he regretted it had occurred. Moore acknowledged he obtained and reviewed a copy of Power Art Trading\u2019s company extract \u2013 a type of document providing an official record of a company\u2019s details including its directorship \u2013 on 1 November. The court was told the extract showed Duggan was not the company\u2019s director, but Moore said he did not the \u201cmake the connection\u201d when he reviewed it. The AFP did not notify the court of the error in Moore\u2019s affidavit until after it received a letter from Duggan\u2019s lawyers on 15 November alerting it to the inaccuracy. Jones also pressed Moore on why he had said in his first affidavit that an official in the federal attorney general\u2019s department had informed him Duggan was Power Art Trading\u2019s director and then in a later affidavit said he was not \u201cinformed by anyone\u201d. Jones said it was \u201ca truly unacceptable sequence of events\u201d. He said the court was not a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for US authorities and called for the restraining order to be thrown out. He argued that because Duggan was not the director of Power Art Trading he had no \u201clink\u201d to the Saddleback Mountain property. Barrister Greg O\u2019Mahoney, acting on behalf of the AFP commissioner, said Moore\u2019s mistake was \u201cinnocent\u201d and had not been \u201cdeliberate\u201d. He said there was no need for Duggan to be directly linked to the property under the mutual agreement Australia has with some foreign countries, including the US, about seizing proceeds of alleged crimes. Justice Nicholas Chen reserved his decision on Wednesday. Duggan, who is a naturalised Australian citizen, has consistently denied the allegations against him. But if convicted, the 55-year-old father of six faces up to 60 years in prison. His extradition case is being heard separately and has been adjourned until next year."

            "date": "2023-11-19T11:00:02Z",
            "content": "The body of a migrant worker who died under unexplained circumstances on the British-owned island of Diego Garcia more than a month ago, while working for a major US defence contractor, has yet to be returned to his family. [See footnote]. The Observer has learned that Saddam Ali died after a short illness on 18 October, on the secretive joint UK-US military base on the remote British overseas territory in the Indian Ocean. His family allege that KBR \u2013 Ali\u2019s employer \u2013 failed to get the 33-year-old Indian sufficient medical assistance, keeping him on the base, which does not have a hospital-grade facility. More than 1,000 migrant workers are contracted to work for KBR \u2013 a key Pentagon contractor that helped build Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba \u2013 on the military base, which the UK has leased to the US since the 1960s. Strategically located, the atoll of Diego Garcia is crucial for US interests, lying within range of east Africa, the Middle East and Asia. However, the treatment of migrant workers on its vast military base has become a source of increasing concern. \u201cIt was KBR\u2019s responsibility to evacuate Saddam for better treatment. They should have taken prompt action to evacuate him,\u201d said Dr Junaidul Hasan, his cousin. \u201cThey are not providing any information about why they did not.\u201d In a statement to the Observer, KBR said: \u201cSaddam reported ill to us Monday, 16 October and we transferred him to the naval doctors and called a medevac [medical evacuation] for him that same day.\u201d Ali, who had no underlying health conditions, became sick with a fever and died of a heart attack, KBR told the family. They have not been provided with any further details about what caused his death. Last night the defence contractor said Ali \u201cpassed before it [the medevac] could arrive.\u201d Hasan and three KBR workers claim Ali\u2019s body remains on Diego Garcia, part of the Chagos Islands archipelago. Questions over the potential mishandling of Ali\u2019s medical care comes amid allegations that KBR is \u201cmistreating\u201d its migrant workforce on the base. Ordered by a senior Royal Navy officer, the inquiry was launched after UK officials suspected KBR of recruiting undocumented workers for the military base. Last November, KBR flew three Filipino men, aged 36, 40 and 49, to the tiny British territory from Dubai, where they were believed to be working illegally on tourist visas, according to two KBR employees. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said its investigation concluded the men entered Diego Garcia legally but requested the Observer to withhold the names of the UK officers involved in the investigation. The three Filipinos are still working on the base, it is understood. KBR, a former subsidiary of controversial oil services giant Halliburton, which was run for five years by Dick Cheney before he became US vice-president, refuted allegations that it recruited undocumented workers and denied the FCDO investigation took place. \u201cIn late 2022, three employees who were properly documented arrived on the island without having taken their paperwork with them,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cThe BIOT asked us to look into this, specifically understanding at the time that the three employees may have simply forgotten their paperwork.\u201d However, Dr Maruja Asis, director of the Scalabrini Migration Center, in Manila, Philippines, said: \u201cFor these workers being hired in Dubai and then moving on to Diego Garcia, it is very possible that they may be rendered very vulnerable. The protections that the Philippine government can extend to them can be very limited.\u201d KBR, also known as Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, is the main contractor on the military base, located in the Chagos Islands. In the 1960s, the Chagos Islanders were forcefully removed to make way for the Diego Garcia base and have spent the past five decades in exile in Mauritius, Seychelles and the UK. KBR has held the military base\u2019s main operating support services contract since 2017, providing services including facilities management and IT. The company says those working for it are permanent full-time employees. A spokesperson added that, \u201cmany of them are skilled workers with sophisticated desk jobs, [such as] providing IT services, engineering, facilities management, and the like\u201d. The Observer has interviewed 14 current and former KBR employees on Diego Garcia and reviewed documents such as payslips, work contracts, photographs, KBR presentation slides and communications. All the interviewees requested anonymity. They allege a culture of fear on the base, with managers telling staff there is a zero-tolerance policy for workers who speak out. \u201cKBR is always making us scared about this, and we need work to provide for our families,\u201d said Maggie*. \u201cThey always say they can terminate our jobs.\u201d KBR recruited the workers after experiencing short staffing issues when the Philippines government blocked Filipinos from travelling to Diego Garcia to work for KBR unless they could show they would be earning more than the US minimum wage. In October 2021, the Philippine government demanded that companies on Diego Garcia pay their Filipino workers the US federal minimum wage of $7.25 (\u00a35.98) an hour. Other contractors on the base complied with this request, but KBR did not, triggering tensions with its employees and the government. Regular warnings are issued by the Philippines government against unlicensed recruiters hiring its citizens, stating they risk falling victim to human trafficking schemes and \u201cunfair labour conditions\u201d. \u201cKBR is trying to avoid hiring Filipinos from the Philippines because they\u2019d have to pay the minimum wage. If these workers don\u2019t have the proper documentation, that\u2019s human trafficking,\u201d said John*, a former KBR employee who resigned earlier this year. Because the Philippine government is blocking workers from travelling to Diego Garcia, workers can\u2019t travel home for vacations and say they are being forced to choose between their job and seeing their children. \u201cWe\u2019re tired and exhausted,\u201d said Maggie, a mother who has not seen her young children for more than four years because of the pay dispute. \u201cWhat KBR is doing to us is inhuman.\u201d To remedy the staffing issues, the British government recently approved hiring Indian and Kenyan workers. However, three Indian workers claim they have been misled over the salaries they would be paid, alleging they were hired in mid-2022 on an $800 a month package, which was then cut to around $500 a month when their annual contracts were renewed this year. \u201cThe HR manager said if you want to work, the salary is $500; if you don\u2019t want to work, go back. Many people resigned,\u201d said Rohan*, an Indian worker in his 20s. A small group of Mauritian employees also claim their compensation packages were recently slashed by almost half, with one worker alleging that KBR stated it was deducting a $300 per month meal allowance from them. This meal allowance was written into job offer letters as part of the salary compensation package offered to workers, according to documents seen by the Observer. \u201cWe have since invested in culturally appropriate food for non-Filipino employees. Accordingly, when these employees\u2019 contracts expire, we explain that new contracts would provide free meals instead of the food stipends if they want to continue working on the island,\u201d the KBR spokesperson said. \u201cKBR pays its employees on Diego Garcia lawful compensation and provides good and safe working conditions. Our Filipino employees choose to work for us because of this,\u201d the spokesperson added. Workers claim the British and US forces on the base are aware of the pay situation with KBR. Asis added: \u201cThe UK and US governments should take action. The frontline face of these military bases are British and American, but behind that is an army of workers coming from developing countries who are doing a lot of work, but whose responsibility are they?\u201d KBR has held meetings with its Filipino employees over the situation with one meeting slide showing that the company claims the Philippine government is \u201cusing a misplaced concept that Diego Garcia is a US territory\u201d, and that \u201cpaying the US minimum wage would represent a 235% salary increase\u201d. KBR\u2019s spokesperson told the Observer that the total compensation given to the Filipino workforce exceeds the Philippine government\u2019s mandated hourly rate \u201cwhen housing, food, medical coverage, and other benefits are included\u201d. * Names have been changed to protect their identities. Footnote added 11 April 2024: Prior to publication of this article the Guardian understood that, while the British Indian Ocean Territory performed the autopsy and was overseeing Saddam Ali\u2019s remains, KBR was responsible for organising the repatriation of his body to India. It had asked relatives for details of who would receive Mr Ali\u2019s body. After publication the company told us that although KBR was facilitating the repatriation logistics, BIOT \u201cperformed the autopsy, oversaw Mr Ali\u2019s remains, and made all decisions about when Mr Ali\u2019s body could and would be transported off the island. As soon as BIOT approved KBR to do so, KBR facilitated the repatriation\u2019s logistics.\u201d BIOT said it could not comment on individual cases \u201cbut takes any death [in the territory] extremely seriously and ensures that proper processes are followed\u201d. An earlier version also said KBR had been allowed to hire a \u201climited number\u201d of Indian and Kenyan workers; the company says there is no limit. A line was also added to reflect KBR\u2019s explanation that the workers are full-time employees, many of them are in skilled desk roles. It has also been clarified that the Chagos Islanders were forced out in the 1960s."

            "date": "2023-11-25T15:50:13Z",
            "content": "For western liberals and progressive champions of open, democratic government, a clutch of recalcitrant regimes around the world seems firmly stuck on what Barack Obama once called \u201cthe wrong side of history\u201d. Iran\u2019s misogynistic theocrats and Myanmar\u2019s genocidal generals are among the worst offenders. Then there\u2019s Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, harking back to largely illusory former glories. Belarus, Syria, Nicaragua, Cambodia and Eritrea meet the regressive criteria, too. What all these regimes have in common is denial of the basic human right to self-determination \u2013 the individual\u2019s right to have a say in how society is ordered. Yet for sheer malignity, few can match autocratic, anachronistic North Korea, personal fiefdom and Kafkaesque playground of dictator Kim Jong-un, oddball scion of a dysfunctional dynasty. Like his father and grandfather before him, jailer Kim imprisons North Koreans in a sort of darkness-at-noon, cold war hell. Kim\u2019s leadership history shows just how wrong-sided he is. To unaddressed poverty, chronic food shortages and economic bungling must be added his inept response to the pandemic. A police state, fortified by prison camps, condemns most of his subjects to silent misery. Democratic, prosperous South Korea next door is a constant reproach. For a while, around 2017-2019, it appeared Kim might change course. UN and US sanctions were hurting, domestic pressures mounted. But Donald Trump, having blagged a rare diplomatic opening, messed up big time. After that fiasco, Kim dropped the North\u2019s longstanding aim of normalising ties with the west \u2013 and lurched back to the dark side. Preferring fear and force to peaceful development, Kim and his nuclear arsenal grow evermore threatening. Tests of ballistic missiles, some capable of striking the US, have proliferated rapidly. Last week\u2019s first successful launch of a military spy satellite dangerously upped the ante once again. A grinning Kim was subsequently shown viewing supposed aerial surveillance photos of the US air force\u2019s Andersen base on Guam in the western Pacific. He vowed to build more satellites in order to extend the \u201cfist\u201d of North Korea\u2019s military, state media said. Officials in South Korea, Japan and the US angrily condemned the launch, which breached UN resolutions. In response, Seoul partially suspended a military pact agreed in 2018 to avoid accidental cross-border clashes. Now North Korea is threatening live-fire exercises along the demarcation line. And so the risk of confrontation grows. One worry is that wars in Ukraine and Palestine, and high-profile US-China sparring over Taiwan, are obscuring greater, existential dangers posed by Kim. \u201cWhile the world\u2019s attention is focused elsewhere, north-east Asia has become a nuclear tinderbox,\u201d Susan Thornton, former US assistant secretary of state for east Asia, warned this month. \u201cA full-scale arms race is under way. North Korea\u2019s stockpile of nuclear weapons and missiles has grown and Kim has called for an \u2018exponential increase\u2019 in its arsenal,\u201d she wrote. With all the regional actors moving towards \u201chair-trigger strategies\u201d, some American officials believed nuclear annihilation was only \u201cone bad decision away\u201d. The threat is ubiquitous and covert, too. UK security chiefs last week accused Kim of orchestrating cyber-attacks around the world. The claim came during a visit to London by South Korea\u2019s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, partly intended to boost defence ties. Kim\u2019s shift also has a strategic dimension \u2013 for he\u2019s clearly thrown in his lot with Russia and China. A recent summit with Putin focused almost entirely on armaments. The US believes Pyongyang is now supplying ammunition for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in exchange for Moscow\u2019s help with long-range missile and space launch technology. These developments have symbolic as well as practical import. In effect, Kim is betting on the success of China\u2019s attempt to usurp the post-1945, rules-based global leadership of the western democracies and substitute an authoritarian, human rights-free world order orchestrated from Beijing. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, buoyed by his \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Putin, makes no secret of his wish to supplant the US. His ambition is a rallying cry to despotic, illiberal and democratically challenged regimes everywhere \u2013 and North Korea has evidently heard Xi\u2019s siren call. It\u2019s Kim\u2019s big chance. Finally, or so he thinks, he could be on the right side of history. Is Kim wrong again? The jury is still out on the 21st-century\u2019s big geostrategic question. In the meantime, Xi\u2019s face-to-face talks with US President Joe Biden in San Francisco this month appeared to ease bilateral tensions. Regarding North Korea, the White House said, they discussed denuclearisation of the peninsula and Kim\u2019s possible next nuclear test. Biden is trying to contain the North Korea menace and simultaneously respond to China\u2019s rise, partly by strengthening regional alliances. The US, Japan and South Korea signed a trilateral security pact in August. That followed Biden\u2019s upgrading of the Quad, which groups the US, India, Japan and Australia; the new Aukus pact with Australia and the UK; and enhanced American support for the Philippines and Taiwan. China views these developments with a mix of hostility and paranoia. Yet when it comes to Kim\u2019s random, provocative antics, even Xi is not entirely sure what to expect. Beijing is the North\u2019s key trading partner. But it is suspicious, for example, of its growing military cooperation with Russia, not always a trustworthy friend to China. And like Japan and South Korea, it worries about nuclear security and stability. That\u2019s one reason, perhaps, why Xi has unexpectedly initiated a high-level dialogue with Tokyo and Seoul. It also suggests intensifying shared concerns about Pyongyang\u2019s unpredictable panjandrum could yet prove a spur to enhanced China-US collaboration, building on this month\u2019s talks. Strange to think that scary Kim\u2019s true historical destiny may not be to pick the \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d side \u2013 but to inadvertently act as a bridge between the world\u2019s two great superpower rivals."

            "title": "UAE approached to invest in Sizewell C nuclear power plant",
            "date": "2023-11-27T11:43:44Z",
            "content": "A United Arab Emirates investor has been approached to take a stake in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project in Suffolk, it has emerged. Ministers are searching for new investors in the project, which could cost between \u00a320bn and \u00a344bn, after removing the Chinese state-owned CGN last year due to security concerns over UK infrastructure amid poor Anglo-Sino relations. The Times reported on Monday that the UK government had lined up Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi fund run by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City football club, to back the energy project, with a decision due early next year. However, a source close to Mubadala denied the fund was interested in Sizewell but said other UAE entities were interested. A separate source said that Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, which is owned by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ, could be a good fit for the project. The UAE interest comes against the backdrop of Westminster tensions over a separate Emirati deal. Last week, RedBird IMI \u2013 a joint-venture between America\u2019s Redbird Capital and International Media Investments, an Abu Dhabi investor also backed by Mansour \u2013 announced a deal to take control of the Telegraph group. The government has indicated it will launch a public interest investigation into the newspaper deal. The Sizewell C plant aims to generate enough energy to power 6m homes. It is backed by France\u2019s EDF and the UK government, which has spent nearly \u00a3100m buying CGN out of the project. CGN had held a 20% stake. Rishi Sunak hosted Mubadala\u2019s Khaldoon Al Mubarak at a meeting of global business leaders at Hampton Court, south-west London, on Monday as he attempts to attract foreign investment to the UK. Although a formal search for outside investment launched in September, Sizewell C has been touted to potential investors \u2013 including sovereign wealth funds, infrastructure and pension funds \u2013 for years. The government earmarked a further \u00a3341m to develop the project in August. Bankers at Barclays have been tasked with procuring investment for the project, which has faced significant opposition in Suffolk. The interest from the UAE \u2013 host of Cop28, which begins this week \u2013 in Sizewell C has been mooted for more than a year. Last week, campaigners parked a sign reading \u201cSizewell C is a toxic investment\u201d outside the UAE embassy in London. Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: \u201cThere may be a dearth of UK interest in Sizewell C, but there is no energy security in handing chunks of the UK\u2019s critical national assets to countries that don\u2019t share our values. If the UAE is not good enough for the Telegraph, it\u2019s definitely not good enough for Sizewell C.\u201d Investors in Saudi Arabia and Australia have also previously reportedly been approached to back Sizewell C. However, a source close to the project denied there was active interest from Saudi investors. Last year, the Observer revealed that the British Gas owner Centrica \u2013 a minority investor in Britain\u2019s nuclear power stations \u2013 was interested. Greencoat Capital, the investment firm, has also expressed an interest. The project is set up as a 50-50 joint-venture between the government and EDF, which is behind the sister Hinkley Point C development in Somerset. That project is significantly over budget and years late. Ministers overruled the independent Planning Inspectorate to grant Sizewell C planning consent. Backers are seeking a development consent order that will precede a final investment decision by its backers. The plant is not expected to generate power until at least the mid-2030s, after most of Britain\u2019s nuclear power stations have been retired. Sunak\u2019s government hopes to kickstart a renaissance in the nuclear power industry, and launched a new delivery body, Great British Energy, in the summer. Separately, the boss of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, is expected to urge the government to back its plans to build small nuclear power plants at an investor day on Tuesday. Sizewell C and Mubadala have been approached for comment."

            "date": "2023-11-21T15:30:45Z",
            "content": "Three prominent US legal thinkers have announced a new organisation to champion conservative legal theory within the rule of law, to fight the threat of a second Donald Trump term. \u201cOur country comes first,\u201d the three wrote in the New York Times, \u201cand our country is in a constitutional emergency, if not a constitutional crisis. We all must act accordingly, especially us lawyers.\u201d The authors were George Conway, an attorney formerly married to Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s White House counselor; J Michael Luttig, a retired judge and adviser to Trump\u2019s vice-president, Mike Pence, who became a prominent January 6 witness; and Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia. The authors also rebuked prominent rightwing groups including the Federalist Society for not resisting the former president and his authoritarian ambitions. Their new group, the Society for the Rule of Law Institute, would \u201cwork to inspire young legal talent \u2026 focus on building a large body of scholarship to counteract the new orthodoxy of anti-constitutional and anti-democratic law \u2026 [and] marshal principled voices to speak out against the endless stream of falsehoods and authoritarian legal theories \u2026 propagated almost daily,\u201d they said. The Federalist Society and its chair, Leonard Leo, played a key role in Trump\u2019s judicial appointments, installing three hardliners on the supreme court who helped hand down rightwing wins including removing abortion rights and loosening laws on gun control, affirmative action, voting rights and other progressive priorities. Conway, Luttig and Comstock emerged among prominent conservative opponents of Trump, warning of his authoritarian threat before and after January 6, when rioters attacked Congress in an attempt to block Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win. Ninety-one criminal charges and assorted civil threats notwithstanding, Trump is now the clear frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination while polling strongly against Biden in battleground states. \u201cAmerican democracy, the constitution and the rule of law are the righteous causes of our times, and the nation\u2019s legal profession is obligated to support them,\u201d Conway, Luttig and Comstock wrote. \u201cBut with the acquiescence of the larger conservative legal movement, these pillars of our system of governance are increasingly in peril. The dangers will only grow should Donald Trump be returned to the White House next November.\u201d Trump, they said, would stock a second administration \u201cwith partisan loyalists committed to fast-tracking his agenda and sidestepping \u2013 if not circumventing altogether \u2013 existing laws and long-established legal norms. \u201cThis would include appointing \u2026 political appointees to rubber-stamp his plans to investigate and exact retribution against his political opponents; make federal public servants removable at will by the president himself; and invoke special powers to take unilateral action on first amendment-protected activities, criminal justice, elections, immigration and more.\u201d Saying Trump tried such attacks when in power but was blocked by lawyers and judges, the authors said the former president would if re-elected \u201carrive with a coterie of lawyers and advisers who, like him, are determined not to be thwarted again\u201d. Though they said the Federalist Society had long been \u201cthe standard-bearer for the conservative legal movement\u201d, they said it had \u201cfailed to respond in this period of crisis. \u201cThat is why we need an organisation of conservative lawyers committed to the foundational constitutional principles we once all agreed upon: the primacy of American democracy, the sanctity of the constitution and the rule of law, the independence of the courts, the inviolability of elections and mutual support among those tasked with the solemn responsibility of enforcing the laws of the United States. \u201cThis new organisation must step up, speak out and defend these ideals.\u201d"

            "content": "The Linnean Society of London was founded in 1788 in honour of Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy, the system of biological classification still in use today. It is the oldest biological society still in existence, and remains a national and global flagship for natural history research. Since 1857 it has been located at Burlington House, where Charles Darwin first presented his theory of natural selection on 1 July 1858, published in the following year as The Origin of Species. The society contributes more than \u00a38m in public value to the nation annually, but is threatened with eviction by its landlord, the housing ministry, if it fails to pay an extortionate rent which has risen by more than 3,000% in six years. Other important scientific societies at Burlington House are similarly threatened. It seems that the philistinism and cultural vandalism of a fast-fading administration are jeopardising the existence of the very institutions it should be cherishing and protecting, and we are threatened with the dismantling of a critical mass of scientific and biological expertise that can never be replaced. A new basis for tenure of one of our most valuable and durable assets needs to be urgently identified. Enough national family silver has surely now been sold off, and enough seed corn eaten, by Margaret Thatcher, George Osborne and their current political and spiritual heirs: we need to hold the line at Burlington House.

            "date": "2023-11-15T14:34:35Z",
            "content": "Slovakian journalists and international watchdogs have expressed alarm after the new prime minister, Robert Fico, described leading media outlets as hostile and threatened to restrict their access. Fico, who took over as Slovakia\u2019s leader in October as part of a coalition government led by his populist Smer party, said this week that some of the country\u2019s biggest outlets were not welcome in his office. \u201cI announced actions against enemy\u2019s media \u2013 TV Mark\u00edza, Denn\u00edk N, SME and the portal Aktuality,\u201d he said, claiming that they \u201copenly declare hatred and hostility against Smer and spread these trends with joy\u201d. \u201cI decided that we will check their permission to enter and work in the government office,\u201d the prime minister said, adding that \u201cuntil the decision is made, they will be unwelcome guests at the government office\u201d. Fico previously served as prime minister from 2006 until 2010 and again between 2012 and 2018, resigning after the murder of J\u00e1n Kuciak, an investigative reporter at Aktuality, and his fiancee, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1. The killings, which sparked a political crisis, put a spotlight on press freedom in the region. Now back in power, Fico has criticised the country\u2019s public broadcaster and made clear his dislike for independent media outlets. His comments have sparked concerns in Bratislava and abroad that Slovakia\u2019s press freedoms are under attack \u2013 and that Fico could put the country on a path similar to that of neighbouring Hungary. \u201cFico is waging a personal war with journalists and abusing the state for it,\u201d said Peter B\u00e1rdy, the editor-in-chief of Aktuality. While noting that it was still unclear whether Fico would actually ban media outlets from attending press conferences, B\u00e1rdy said on Wednesday: \u201cIf this happens, it will not allow us to confront them with the practical aspects of the politics they are doing.\u201d He added: \u201cBut what\u2019s worse is that this is how they continue their disinformation campaign against select media, feeding the public the idea that they can\u2019t trust us because we\u2019re lying and hostile.\u201d Beata Balogov\u00e1, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper SME, echoed some of these worries, writing on X: \u201cIf the European Union is serious about defending its own values, it should be more than concerned about the state of press freedom in Slovakia.\u201d Watchdogs have also expressed qualms about Fico\u2019s rhetoric. Pavol Szalai, the head of the EU and Balkans desk at Reporters Without Borders (RSF), said: \u201cBy discriminating against certain media, Fico also discriminates against a part of the citizens; as a matter of fact, the audiences of the four targeted media represent a big group of citizens. \u201cRSF condemns the ruling parties\u2019 verbal attacks, their attempts to restrict access to information and their questioning of the independence of the public broadcaster RTVS.\u201d Slovakia\u2019s government did not respond to a request for comment. The country\u2019s progressive president, Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1, defended press freedom. \u201cThe media is part of the bloodstream of democracy,\u201d she wrote on social media. \u201cI refuse and cannot support the division of parts of society into more or less noble, friendly or hostile.\u201d But experts also say that Slovakia is still in a far stronger position than Hungary when it comes to its media scene. Szalai said: \u201cThanks to its pluralistic, dynamic and economically sane media landscape benefiting from solid legal guarantees, press freedom in Slovakia is relatively strong.\u201d He noted that the country is ranked 17th on the watchdog\u2019s World Press Freedom Index, compared with Hungary\u2019s 72nd place. Nevertheless, he called for vigilance. \u201cFico must not hold back that progress or threaten the progress achieved in recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe call on him to stop his hostile rhetoric and actions in the name of the right to information of all citizens.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-02T13:52:38Z",
            "content": "Ady Barkan, an attorney and healthcare activist whose journey with motor neuron disease prompted a fight to overhaul the US healthcare system, has died at the age of 39 from complications with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Barkan\u2019s wife, Rachael Scarborough King, announced his death in a post to X, formally known as Twitter. \u201cYou probably knew Ady as a healthcare activist. But more importantly he was a wonderful dad and my life partner for 18 years,\u201d wrote King. \u201cAdy fought for the 24/7 care he needed to be home with us until the end of his life,\u201d King added, thanking Barkan\u2019s caregivers and \u201ctheir labor and care, which allowed us to live as a family through Ady\u2019s health challenges\u201d. \u201cEveryone should have that chance,\u201d she said. Barkan was first diagnosed with ALS in 2016 at the age of 32, the healthcare advocate wrote in a 2022 piece for the Guardian. The progressive degenerative illness targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and the brain. The disease is often terminal, with those diagnosed usually having a three to five year survival rate. Barkan lost his ability to walk and was unable to eat, speak or breathe on his own without the use of a ventilator machine. Since his diagnosis, Barkan said that he became acutely aware with the issues regarding the US healthcare system, especially for those dealing with a serious illness. \u201cI knew that US healthcare was broken before my diagnosis, but having a serious illness clarified the cruelty of our profit-driven system,\u201d Barkan wrote. Barkan\u2019s health insurance company denied coverage of critical medical supplies, including a ventilator and a FDA-approved ALS drug. He was only able to pay for his round-the-clock care after suing his insurance company in federal court, and with the help of friends who covered part of his care. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a team of lawyers, an experienced activist, and the generosity of friends and strangers to get the healthcare you need to survive,\u201d Barkan wrote. Barkan used his experience to advocate for universal healthcare and a complete overhaul of the US healthcare system. Barkan first went viral in 2017 after confronting the former Arizona senator Jeff Flake about Flake\u2019s support of tax cuts that would cause healthcare costs to soar, an encounter that was filmed by organizer Liz Jaff. \u201cThink about the legacy that you will have for my son and your grandchildren, if you take your principles and turn them into votes,\u201d Barkan said to Flake. \u201cYou can save my life,\u201d Barkan said. In 2018, Barkan co-founded the non-profit Be A Hero, an organization working to expand access to healthcare amid other political priorities. Jamila Headley, the organization\u2019s co-executive director celebrated Barkan\u2019s life and work in a post to X. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a world without [Ady Barkan] learning, strategizing, fighting, and laughing alongside me but his work lives on in [Be A Hero] and the powerful movement of patients we are building,\u201d wrote Headley. His activism was subsequently documented in the 2021 documentary Not Going Quietly, which showed his May 2019 testimony to Congress about his family\u2019s struggles to afford his care. Speaking through a computerized device, Barkan told lawmakers that his family paid $9,000 a month out-of-pocket to cover the remainder of his care. \u201cWe are cobbling together the money, from friends and family and supporters all over the country,\u201d he said to Congress. \u201cBut this is an absurd way to run a healthcare system.\u201d Barkan is survived by his wife Rachael and their two children."

            "date": "2023-11-23T14:17:51Z",
            "content": "The triumph of Geert Wilders at the Dutch polls is one of the biggest political upsets in European politics and, just like Brexit, will send reverberations across the continent. But in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, where the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) is now the biggest political grouping, the earthquake was met with more of a shrug than a gasp. \u201cWhile he said \u2018enough is enough\u2019 he is right: enough is enough,\u201d said Jeannette, 34, receiving a delivery of bags of potatoes for the chip shop where she works. \u201cWe pay too much tax, too much for healthcare, too much for rent. We can\u2019t take it any more.\u201d Like millions of other Dutch voters on Wednesday, Jeanette voted for Wilders, largely, she says, out of anger that she and her family face a struggle to make ends meet. Reeling off a litany of monthly costs she must pay out of her \u20ac2,422 (\u00a32,106) a month net salary, she appeared to have been drawn to his positioning as a champion of the ordinary person struggling amid the cost of living crisis. \u201cPeople from the outside think we are OK here in the Netherlands. We are wealthy compared to Belgium or Turkey, that is true. They don\u2019t understand why people voted for Wilders but if you are here you know why,\u201d she said. Jeanette said she did not agree with all Wilders\u2019 past anti-Islam declarations, including a call for fewer Moroccans in the country and a ban on the hijab \u2013 \u201cIf people want to wear that I understand.\u201d But amid her socioeconomic complaints there is a familiar whiff of resentment. \u201cWe are a wealthy country, but how do we in Holland have to pay that much and yet they say to migrants: \u2018Come on in, have what you like, we will give you everything\u2019?\u201d she asked. Jamie, 23, a waitress at the Grand Cafe in The Hague, just half an hour from the port, said only one of her circle of seven close friends had not voted for Wilders\u2019 PVV, including one who had previously voted for the outgoing prime minister, Mark Rutte\u2019s party. \u201cHe [Wilders] is a bit harsh in what he says, but he is a straight-talker and says it like it is. It is really a big change. Mark Rutte has been in for as long as I can remember,\u201d she said. Like Jeanette, she was drawn to Wilders for what he has said about housing and a promise of free transport for elderly people. But she also supported his deeply controversial policy on migration. On Wednesday the PVV leader vowed: \u201cThe Netherlands will be returned to the Dutch, the asylum tsunami and migration will be curbed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not against migrants,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cThey have to come through Belgium and Germany to get here, but they come here, they don\u2019t stay in the two neighbouring countries because we are an open country, it\u2019s better here.\u201d She claimed this was not fair. Matthijs Rooduijn, associate professor of political science at Amsterdam University, says such views are common among Wilders voters. \u201cWhen you look at the electorate of the PVV in general, it consists of people who experience more difficulties to get by. They are more lonely. They feel that they are being neglected. They have tough lives basically, economically but also culturally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe PVV, of course, is not a party that is really leftwing when it comes to socioeconomic politics, but it is a party that is also when it comes to socioeconomics is not really rightwing \u2026 Wilders presents himself as there for the poor: it\u2019s also what people sometimes call welfare chauvinism. So he argues that the people who have difficulties should be helped, but that is only true for what he calls \u2018Henk and Ingrid\u2019, the Dutch names that he calls his voters. And that\u2019s not \u2018Mohammed and Fatima\u2019, so to speak. So it is welfare, but only for, according to him, our people.\u201d Such opinions fill Esperansa, a 20-year-old film and literature student, with fear. Esperansa voted for the Frans Timmermans-led GroenLinks-PvdA alliance. \u201cI\u2019m not happy,\u201d she said. \u201cI never liked Wilders and his policies because he is an extreme-right politician. Some of his policies are disgusting: his Islamophobia, his ideas to forbid people from wearing the hijab or eating halal meat, or to close the mosques.\u201d Referring to Wilders\u2019 decision to soften some of his rhetoric during the campaign, she added: \u201cI think it\u2019s very stupid that a lot of people voted for him but Wilders presented himself as milder than extreme.\u201d For Franklin, a 71-year-old from Aruba, the result was not surprising if, like him, you had followed all the debates. \u201cIt is to be expected. Holland has changed a lot over the years and the big topics of discussion in the debates were migration, housing, the cost of living for all candidates,\u201d he said. \u201c[Wilders] is a very experienced politician and knows how to censor himself. He advanced his arguments in a very mild manner. Often opponents called him a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing but people voted for him. The far right are growing everywhere \u2013 look at Brazil, Argentina, the US, Hungary.\u201d Additional reporting by Senay Boztas"

            "date": "2023-11-19T05:00:40Z",
            "content": "In the early hours of Saturday morning, over piles of concrete and rubble, crowds of doctors and patients walked miles through the destroyed streets of Gaza City, forced to evacuate on foot from what remained of its hospitals. Medics said they feared leaving critically ill patients behind in a city now largely reduced to rubble and overtaken by Israeli forces, where hospitals had been operating without power, fuel, water or food. \u201cIt\u2019s basically hell on earth,\u201d said William Schomburg, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza, describing what remained of life inside the city. For weeks, tens of thousands of people had hoped that taking refuge in Gaza City\u2019s hospitals would provide the closest thing to safety as the enclave endured intensifying bombardments. But as Israeli forces drew closer to their facilities and then raided Gaza\u2019s largest hospital, Dar al-Shifa last week, thousands were displaced along with medical staff, walking through destroyed streets to the south of the enclave. The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said Israeli forces demanded the evacuation of al-Shifa hospital on Saturday morning, three days after a raid on the facility. Medics said they were told they had an hour to evacuate the hospital, formerly the centrepiece of Gaza\u2019s medical system. At least 12,000 people have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza since Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack, in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and some 240 people taken hostage. Medhat Abbas, director general of the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza, recalled a conversation he had with orthopaedics specialist Adnan Al Borsh who left al-Shifa in the early hours of Saturday. He said Al Borsh wept as he described the experience of walking out of the hospital with other medics and displaced people. Israeli soldiers, he said, patrolled the complex, with snipers deployed around the perimeter. \u201cWe could hear the wounded. We couldn\u2019t help them. People were dying,\u201d Al Borsh said. \u201cWe were forced to walk. As we walked out of al-Shifa hospital we saw bodies in the streets. The hospital was destroyed; no water, no oxygen, no medicine and attacks on every building [in the complex].\u201d Doctor Abbas also shared footage recorded by Al Jazeera cameraman Hamdan Dahdouh from the emergency room at al-Shifa hospital shortly after the evacuation order, filled with panicked people, some shouting as they tried to assess who they were able to evacuate. Dozens of wounded people lay sprawled on the tiled floor smeared with blood, some placed on to stretchers while two children sat on the ground as a third man attempted to bandage some of their wounds. The ministry of health said 530 patients were forced to evacuate along with medics, but that five doctors agreed to stay behind with 120 of the worst injured. Thirty of the 39 premature babies evacuated from the neonatal ward last Sunday had survived a week outside their incubators, lined up together for warmth in one of al-Shifa\u2019s operating rooms. Medical staff said they were attempting to find a way to evacuate the babies in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). \u201cMany patients cannot leave the hospital as they are in the ICU beds or the baby incubators,\u201d surgeon Ahmed Al Mokhallalati posted on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cI along with five other doctors will stay at al-Shifa hospital with 120 patients, as [they] cannot leave due to their health conditions.\u201d A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied that they had ordered an evacuation. Instead, they said, \u201cthe director of Shifa hospital requested that the IDF help secure an evacuation route from the hospital. The IDF therefore agreed and assisted evacuation efforts. At no point did the IDF order the evacuation of patients or medical teams and in fact proposed that any request for medical evacuation will be facilitated by the IDF.\u201d The raid on al-Shifa, Gaza\u2019s largest medical facility, began in the hours before dawn on Wednesday, when Israeli tanks entered the complex. For more than 12 hours, commandos roamed the emergency department and the surgical wing. According to witnesses who spoke to the BBC and Al Jazeera, Israeli forces used loudspeakers to demand every man aged between 16 and 40 enter the courtyard, before strip-searching many and detaining them at an unknown location. Doctors inside the hospital later reported that Israeli forces placed facial recognition scanners at the exits. Al-Shifa is not the only hospital in Gaza City that has been forced to evacuate. At al-Quds hospital, ambulances operated by the Palestinian Red Crescent Service (PRCS) managed to evacuate some patients and staff early last week after initially turning back because of intense shelling around the hospital. The PCRS shared footage on Thursday of some of the 14,000 people who had sheltered there passing bombed-out buildings and scaling piles of rubble, as they walked almost seven miles, some wheeling a seemingly unconscious man on a hospital bed through the destroyed streets. At al-Ahli Arab hospital in eastern Gaza City, the only facility able to take in new patients for much of last week, doctors said they went from being able to only perform life-saving surgeries to being unable to operate at all, before many were forced to evacuate. \u201cSince al-Shifa was surrounded and effectively collapsed as a hospital, all of the wounded were coming to al-Ahli,\u201d said surgeon Ghassan Abu-Sittah, who had left Shifa hospital for al-Ahli early last week. \u201cSo for that six-day period until the early hours of Thursday morning, we received over 500 wounded and had been operating flat out. Sometimes, certainly in the last night, for 20 hours straight. \u201cOn Thursday, in the early hours of the morning, we finished the last case and we were told that meant the last of the anaesthetic, and that the operating rooms were no longer capable of providing any kind of surgery. \u201cWe made the decision to evacuate the hospital on Thursday morning, at least the operating rooms, and to keep the rest of the hospital as a first aid station, since we were no longer able to operate on patients.\u201d Aseel Baidoun, of Medical Aid for Palestinians, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a total collapse of the health system,\u201d pointing to a crisis worsened by the periodic shutdown of the two Palestinian phone companies operating in Gaza because of lack of fuel, leading to repeated communications blackouts. \u201cThe ambulances can\u2019t communicate with hospitals, and people can\u2019t call ambulances,\u201d she said. \u201cI know people who have walked kilometres to a hospital just to tell the medical crew of the locations of a bombardment.\u201d Israeli officials have long claimed that Hamas operates from underneath medical facilities, including a command centre in bunkers beneath al-Shifa hospital. Both Hamas and Shifa hospital staff denied this. Observers noted that the raid on hospitals produced some evidence of Hamas activity, but fell short of demonstrating al-Shifa was used as a command centre. The BBC also questioned whether weapons were moved before their journalists entered to film inside al-Shifa. Israeli forces released footage of a spokesperson roaming the MRI department of al-Shifa hours after the raid, pulling what he termed \u201cgrab bags\u201d of military clothing and guns from behind a machine and showing photos of neatly arranged automatic rifles, grenades, books, military-style clothing, and a large box of dates they had gathered in one room. The IDF later released footage of the opening to a tunnel they said ran underneath the hospital, as well as images of a clutch of automatic weapons and military clothing they said were found inside a car within the hospital complex. They also released images of four automatic rifles, ammunition and equipment such as knives and walkie-talkies they said were discovered in al-Quds hospital. \u201cThey are piecing different things together, but it\u2019s not the smoking gun,\u201d said Mairav Zonszein of the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand what the IDF is doing, why it built up the issue of al-Shifa so much and then came out with basically nothing convincing. I think it\u2019s very hard for anyone to understand it, and at a basic PR level, it\u2019s just a disaster,\u201d she said. As thousands were forced to flee Gaza\u2019s hospitals on foot, teams from the PRCS pleaded for outside help for their emergency medical teams left behind who they said were \u201cbesieged\u201d, at al-Ahli hospital \u201camidst heavy bombardment and gunfire by Israeli soldiers\u201d, with Israeli tanks in the vicinity. Abu-Sittah said that when he and other medics managed to leave al-Ahli, walking south for five hours on Thursday, they could hear Israeli tanks and machine guns. At al-Shifa after the evacuation, just five medics remained to care for 30 premature babies and scores of critically ill patients amid the deserted ruins of Gaza City."

            "date": "2023-11-18T19:00:29Z",
            "content": "A $558m redevelopment of Albury Base hospital jointly proposed by the New South Wales and Victorian state governments has outraged healthcare workers and community groups, who claim both governments misled them during a years-long consultation. \u201cIf I was going to design a system to hide the dismal plans they\u2019ve provided us, I\u2019d design it exactly the way they\u2019ve done it,\u201d says Michelle Cowan from local community group Better Border Health. \u201cThese are the oldest tricks in the book. It\u2019s the most cynical exercise so they can say they\u2019ve ticked the consultation box.\u201d Dr Barb Robertson, the chair of local health advocacy group the Border Medical Association, says last month\u2019s announcement of a plan to redevelop the Albury hospital, rather than build a new combined health campus as was recommended in consultations with stakeholders, is \u201cstraight out of an episode of Utopia\u201d. \u201c[The state governments] clearly have no understanding that the largest regional health service between Sydney and Melbourne is operating at a severely compromised capacity,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cWe\u2019re in a perpetual fight every day for beds. Admitted patients are being left in waiting rooms. We have horrendous surgical waiting lists. This redevelopment will barely cover the significant gap in beds and theatres that we have now.\u201d For years, local health stakeholders called for the region\u2019s healthcare services \u2013 currently spread across two cities in two states \u2013 to be consolidated into one greenfield hospital development. But the new Albury Wodonga health master plan, published by both state governments in October, instead commits to the staged redevelopment of the current Albury Base hospital site. The NSW government says that further detail on how many new beds or facilities the redevelopment will include will be published in 2024. An earlier draft master plan, circulated internally in December 2021 and obtained by NSW Greens MLC Dr Amanda Cohn through a freedom of information request in September 2023, shows that both state governments appeared to agree with recommendations to consolidate both hospitals into one new site. Notes from a consultation held by Albury Wodonga Health in November 2021, attended by local health stakeholders and representatives from both state health departments, state that all parties \u201cagreed that the greenfield option would be adopted for the remaining processes involved in the development and completion of the master plan\u201d. Internal NSW Health notes prepared for a meeting in the office of then-treasurer Matt Kean in that same month note that local health stakeholders had \u201ca strong preference for the greenfield option\u201d. It said that was based on \u201cassessment against a number of criteria including improved amenity for patients and staff, ease of construction, timeliness of development and the likely adverse impact on operations associated with a staged \u2018brownfield\u2019 development\u201d. However, those notes also show NSW Health had already chosen redeveloping the existing site as its preferred option. \u201cNSW has previously indicated it does not support a new hospital in Albury,\u201d the notes read. \u201cThe NSW Government and the Australian Government have already made significant investments in infrastructure improvements to Albury Hospital, the benefits of which would not be realised if a new hospital was pursued.\u201d Community anger has been further stoked by revelations in the draft master plan that Albury Wodonga Health had not acted on internal warnings, dating back to 2016, that major engineering works were needed to prevent the potential collapse of Albury Base hospital\u2019s second medical ward. In a recent statement, Albury Wodonga Health says it \u201creassures staff, patients, and the community that Albury Hospital Campus Medical Ward 2 is safe to occupy\u201d. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Cohn, a former Albury deputy mayor who served on rotation as a junior doctor at Albury Base hospital, says the Covid pandemic reinforced the local perception that state governments are out of touch with the region\u2019s needs. \u201cDuring Covid, we had intensive care doctors trying to construct extra ventilators out of stuff they bought at Bunnings,\u201d she says. \u201cThe state border between our two hospitals was closed. The on-call paediatrician is usually based in Albury, so if a sick child presented in Wodonga, the on-call paediatrician would be held up by border control. It\u2019s sheer luck that nobody died because of the border closure.\u201d Cohn says the decision to go against stakeholder advice on the hospital redevelopment would mean \u201cthe anger in this community is just going to keep building\u201d. \u201cThe local joke is that \u2018NSW\u2019 stands for \u2018Nothing South of Wagga\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cAlbury Wodonga is one large connected regional community, and we\u2019re the main service centre for a wide region of smaller towns. But state governments treat us like we\u2019re two separate small towns right on the edges of their maps.\u201d Health Infrastructure NSW says the 2021 master plan process \u201cdid not fully consider matters relating to detailed cost, value for money and affordability\u201d. \u201cIt was considered these key issues would be addressed through future economic evaluation, the business case process, and the funding submission,\u201d they say, adding that the $558m redevelopment will deliver a new multi-storey clinical services building and more beds through expanded clinical and non-clinical services.

            "date": "2023-11-30T00:01:34Z",
            "content": "The NHS has been accused of \u201cunethical\u201d behaviour after it emerged that it has been recruiting record numbers of nurses and midwives from countries which have serious staffing shortages. Bringing in staff from \u201cred-list\u201d countries risked destabilising those nations\u2019 healthcare systems and breaching government guidelines, said hospital employers and the Royal College of Nursing. Prof Nicola Ranger, the RCN\u2019s chief nurse, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s over-reliance on unethical international recruitment from red-list countries has become the norm and cannot continue. It\u2019s a false economy. The government should invest in nursing staff in the UK, funding nurse education and fair pay \u2013 not destabilising other healthcare systems.\u201d Ranger spoke out after Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) figures showed that almost as many overseas trained nurses and midwives (15,036) joined its register between April and September as did those who were educated in the UK (15,067). \u201cWhile overseas healthcare workers in the UK are invaluable, the rise in joiners from red-list countries is concerning,\u201d said Miriam Deakin, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers. \u201cInternational recruitment must be done ethically, in line with the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s code of conduct.\u201d The NMC\u2019s latest biannual update on the makeup of its register shows that growing numbers of nurses and midwives are coming to work in the UK from red-list countries, despite government guidelines specifically prohibiting recruitment from them. \u201cThis includes significant proportional rises in joiners from Ghana and Zambia. There also remain a steadily high number of joiners from Nigeria,\u201d the regulator said. In a plea to NHS bodies to avoid red-list recruitment, Andrea Sutcliffe, the NMC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that employers continue to be mindful of the government\u2019s ethical recruitment code, since we\u2019re seeing many joiners from red-list countries. \u201cPeople from across the world want to come and work in the UK. However, employers must not undermine health systems in countries with the most pressing workforce challenges, through active recruitment.\u201d There has been a dramatic rise in the number of nurses and midwives arriving from India. Between April and September 7,223 people from India joined the NMC register \u2013 49% up on the 4,849 who did so in the same period last year. That level cements India\u2019s position as the country that accounts for more international recruitment into the UK than any other. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said that nurses from overseas made \u201ca vital contribution to social care and health services across the UK \u2026 that we will continue to rely on for some time yet\u201d. In June the government and NHS England launched the NHS long-term workforce plan. Under it the number of homegrown doctors, nurses, midwives and other health professionals will expand dramatically over the next 15 years, to give the health service the personnel it needs and to reduce its dependence on oversea staff. The NMC data also shows that there are 808,488 nurses, midwives and nursing assistants on the council\u2019s register, more than ever before."

            "title": "The Guardian view on the Covid-19 inquiry: a week that has probed deep | Editorial",
            "date": "2023-11-02T18:39:22Z",
            "content": "Lady Hallett has been holding hearings of the UK Covid-19 inquiry for much of the past two months. It is only this week, however, that the hearings have forced their way to the top of the news. There is no mystery about the reason. The evidence to the inquiry by senior civil servants, government advisers and health chiefs this week has been extraordinary and shocking. For most of us, the shock has been the graphic reminders from those at the heart of government of how poorly the UK state was prepared for the Covid pandemic, of how indecisively the government responded, and of the bitter rivalries between some of those taking life-and-death decisions at the top. Among the multiple serious issues that have been aired in the past four days, two in particular stand out: the absence of any national planning for the pandemic and the inadequacy of Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership. Others, however, are reacting very differently to the inquiry. On the right, indignation is focused on the inquiry itself, not the pandemic incompetence. The proceedings are being mocked as a circus or as a blame-fest. Lady Hallett is derided as presiding over an exercise in confirmation bias and of having no interest in science. Above all, she is accused of not embracing questions that are now dogma in parts of the rightwing press and the Tory party: whether lockdowns worked at all, whether masks did any good and whether testing and tracing was in fact a waste of time and money. Part of the answer to all this is that the critics should be more patient. This week has focused on a single \u201cmodule\u201d in the inquiry\u2019s programme, devoted to \u201ccore UK decision-making and political governance\u201d. This is just one module among six announced so far \u2013 others are preparedness, impact on healthcare, vaccines, procurement and the care sector. Other modules will follow. Since this week\u2019s focus is political decision-making, it is hardly surprising that politics was under the microscope. Like all ideologues, the inquiry\u2019s critics have already made up their minds. Fortunately, the inquiry has not. The other part of the answer is that this week\u2019s evidence matters. It matters that the prime minister could not make up his mind, was not on top of the detail and that he was on holiday when he should have been gripping the response. It matters that his advisers were constantly abusing one another and that they were mostly white middle-class males, giving little thought to issues of class, gender and ethnicity. It matters that ministers made statements that they must have known were untrue. Together, they let the country down, and with fateful consequences. Yet a lot of this would have remained hidden if it was not for the inquiry. Because the inquiry has teeth, it has the power to dig deep. Without it, for example, would we have ever known what the former NHS England boss Simon Stevens revealed on Thursday \u2013 that someone as ill-equipped as the then health secretary Matt Hancock wanted the power to decide which patients should live and which should die if England\u2019s hospitals became overloaded during the pandemic? It is true that Lady Hallett\u2019s work is proceeding at a stately pace. Her final report is not expected before 2026. But she is inquiring into the biggest nationwide trauma and the state\u2019s most significant domestic policy blunder of modern times. \u201cWhen the public needed us most, the government failed,\u201d said Dominic Cummings in 2021. It should be this era\u2019s epitaph. It is important that Lady Hallett should get the story right, in all its complexity, taking every argument into account and learning every lesson, however embarrassing they may be to those in power who let Britain down so badly."

            "date": "2023-11-29T13:35:23Z",
            "content": "A surge in respiratory illnesses in China, particularly among children, has reportedly swamped paediatric units in city hospitals, while authorities have urged calm, attributing it to a post-lockdown wave of illness. Many hospital wards are full, according to state and other media reports in China. The Global Times reported on Tuesday that the Beijing Children\u2019s hospital was receiving up to 9,378 patients a day and had been at full capacity during the past two months. It also said outpatient clinics, paediatric clinics, and respiratory departments at several Beijing hospitals were booked out for at least seven days. Photos and videos online and on state media showed crowded waiting rooms with beds lining hallways in a Hebei hospital. One report quoted parents in Jinan saying that half the students in their child\u2019s class were sick. Footage of students doing homework while in hospital reportedly prompted warnings from local officials that schools should not make children catch up on work while they are ill. In Hangzhou one parent told media that classes had been suspended because so many children were away. Last week the World Health Organization said it was monitoring an increase in \u201cundiagnosed pneumonia in children\u2019s hospitals in Beijing, Liaoning and other places in China\u201d. Available data suggests rates of flu-like illnesses are more than double those of recent years, but authorities have urged calm, attributing the rise in cases to the beginning of the first flu season since pandemic restrictions were lifted. At a press conference on Sunday the national health commission urged local authorities to open more fever clinics, extend service hours, and increase supplies of medications. \u201cWe also remind everyone to adhere to the hygienic habits of wearing masks, ventilating frequently, and washing hands frequently, and encourage key groups such as the elderly and the young to actively receive relevant vaccines,\u201d said Wang Huaqing, head of the CDC\u2019s immunisation programme. \u201cThose who can be vaccinated should try their best to get vaccinated to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases.\u201d They said the rise in cases was not being driven by any new pathogens, but instead by the spread of bacteria such as mycoplasma pneumoniae and common pathogens including influenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus and RSV. Chinese authorities responded to the WHO\u2019s request for information within 24 hours, and during a teleconference provided data that the WHO said indicated increases in doctor consultations and hospital admissions of children due to mycoplasma pneumoniae since May, and RSV, adenovirus and influenza viruses since October. It said this was not unusual given the contributing factors, and did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO department of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention, said the rise in cases was in line with \u201cwhat most countries dealt with a year or two ago\u201d. China was one of the last countries to lift restrictions when it formally ended its zero-Covid policies in January. Other nations saw spikes in respiratory illnesses after the end of Covid-19 restrictions. \u201cThis phenomenon of lockdown exit waves of respiratory infections is sometimes referred to as immunity debt,\u201d Prof Francois Balloux, of University College London, told the Independent. \u201cSince China experienced a far longer and harsher lockdown than essentially any other country on Earth, it was anticipated that those lockdown exit waves could be substantial in China.\u201d Some neighbouring countries have expressed concern, given the Chinese government\u2019s lack of transparency regarding previous outbreaks, in particular Covid-19. Some governments are monitoring the outbreak closely, including in Taiwan where the CDC issued warnings for people to take greater care with hygiene and symptom monitoring, given the high volume of cross-strait travel and exchange.

            "content": "Students of Northwestern University who have completed their coursework while serving time in prison are preparing to graduate on Wednesday and become the first such pupils to receive bachelor\u2019s degrees from the highly regarded college, according to academic officials. The class graduating from the Northwestern Prison Education Program (NPEP) is one of four cohorts with 20 incarcerated students. Four hundred incarcerated people applied for the program during the latest application cycle, with only 70 getting interviewed. Northwestern asserted that the members of the outgoing class are the first students who are incarcerated to receive bachelor\u2019s degree from a university ranked among the top 10 on the US News &amp; World Report. The pupils finished their degree requirements during the Covid-19 pandemic, when universities across the country transitioned to remote learning. To continue classes during the pandemic, Northwestern staff brought printed class materials and scanned assignments, given limited access to technology in the correctional facilities. \u201cWhat this cohort lived through \u2026 it\u2019s really nothing short of extraordinary,\u201d Jennifer Lackey, the NPEP\u2019s director, said to Axios. Students also navigated health challenges associated with Covid-19 as they attempted to finish their year. Broderick Hollins, a student of the program\u2019s second cohort, has said he had to teach himself thermodynamics after missing class because of a serious bout of Covid-19. He said that working towards a degree helped bolster his mental health, Axios reported. \u201cYour mind can get into a dark, deep depression. Your mind is what\u2019s imprisoned,\u201d Hollins said, according to Axios, adding that learning in the classroom was \u201cthe best exercise you could have in prison\u201d. In an interview published on Northwestern\u2019s website, Hollins added that chemistry was the most impactful course for him. He said that \u201cwith Covid-19 fighting us, our leaders are going to our chemists and living through science\u201d. The lauded writer and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates will be the commencement speaker for Wednesday\u2019s NPEP ceremony. Rob Scott, executive director of the Cornell Prison Education Prep (CPEP), applauded Northwestern\u2019s program and emphasized the difficulty of achieving a degree, especially for incarcerated people with limited resources. \u201cThis is a very difficult thing to do, let alone while you are incarcerated,\u201d said Scott, who is also an adjunct professor at Cornell University. \u201cThe men and women that get into college programs go even double duty on putting aside some of the few things that would give them relief in their daily lives in prison, to focus on school work.\u201d Like Northwestern, CPEP facilitates classes in correctional facilities in upstate New York. Enrolled students can earn an associate degree through SUNY community colleges. \u201c[Like Northwestern], we\u2019ve analyzed the situation and seen that we\u2019re laying waste to a huge population here by making them permanently incapable of restoration into the society that we have,\u201d Scott said. As Pell grant eligibility was expanded this year for incarcerated people, more colleges and universities will probably create higher education programs to earn bachelor\u2019s degrees in prisons, Scott said. An estimated 760,000 people will be able to access federal aid for education programs in correctional facilities. Scott noted that collegiate education programs in prison can help lower recidivism rates, but they also represent a broader cultural shift to move away from punitive methods that fail to address crime. \u201cIs our goal to simply imagine that they\u2019re a piece of waste that we can throw away? Because that\u2019s what we feel like the current system does,\u201d Scott said. \u201cOr are we trying to find some path to restoration and to [a] functioning, civil society? To me, that\u2019s all this is.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-08T06:00:31Z",
            "content": "South Korea\u2019s government has declared war on bedbugs, amid reports that an infestation is causing panic in a country that had practically rid itself of the nocturnal bloodsuckers. Starting next week, authorities will carry out inspections of \u201cvulnerable\u201d locations \u2013 including public bathhouses and lodging facilities \u2013 and immediately disinfect places where the bugs are found. The four-week campaign comes as confirmation that the outbreak, thought to have originated in France in September, is taking hold in South Korea. As of Tuesday, 30 cases had been confirmed nationwide, the Yonhap news agency said, adding that more than half were in the capital, Seoul. The crisis comes after an outbreak in France while it was hosting the Rugby World Cup and preparing to host the 2024 Olympics in the capital. Travellers posted photos and videos purportedly showing the insects on the Paris M\u00e9tro and high-speed trains, and at Charles de Gaulle airport. The infestation sparked concern that the outbreak would quickly spread to the UK, but some experts said the bugs were already present on London\u2019s public transport network and in cinemas, hospitals and other public spaces. The pest control company Rentokil said it had seen a 65% spike in cases of bedbugs in Britain in the second quarter of this year, compared with a year earlier. South Korea almost eradicated bedbugs during a nationwide disinfection campaign in the 1960s, and had recorded just nine cases in the decade before the recent invasion. The government has set aside 500m won [\u00a3310,000] and launched a special response team to address the infestation, and will meet weekly to review the campaign\u2019s progress. Officials warned that the number of cases was expected to rise and urged the public not to be embarrassed about reporting sightings. \u201cThere is a perception that bedbug appearances are down to individuals, so some people refrain from filing a report, fearing it could be seen as a sign of poor hygiene,\u201d Yonhap quoted an official as saying. Authorities have attributed the outbreak to the lifting of travel restrictions after the Covid-19 pandemic. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency has been offering guidance to people arriving from countries where outbreaks have occurred, including France and Britain, according to the Korea Herald. While the bugs can\u2019t transmit disease, they cause intense itching that can lead to secondary skin infections. The first case was reported at a university dormitory in the south-west city of Daegu in September, with more cases later traced to tourist hotels and a public sauna in Incheon near Seoul. The Seoul metropolitan government has begun inspections of more than 3,000 public baths, saunas and hotels as part of its \u201czero-bedbug city\u201d initiative, the Korea Herald said. \u201cWe will enhance pre-emptive measures as bedbugs cause serious economic and psychological damage,\u201d Park Yoo-mi, an official in charge of citizens\u2019 health at the city government, told the newspaper. Many people have changed their daily habits in the hope of staying clear of the bugs, according to South Korean media. Some avoid sitting down on public transport or eating out, while public health centres have reported a surge of visitors seeking advice on insect bites. Lim Myung-woo, 37, who runs a private English and maths school with his wife, said the couple had decided not to make their regular visits to the cinema for the time being. \u201cWe used to watch movies at reduced admission fees in the morning \u2026 but we decided to stop going for a while as we are worried about bedbug bites or carrying them to our workplace or home,\u201d Lim told the Korea Times. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 2023. Due to a conversion error, a previous version incorrectly said the sum of 500m won was equivalent to \u00a3312m, rather than \u00a3310,000."

Public health officers (PHOs) are highly trained to deal with outbreaks of disease. It was pointed out very early in the pandemic by a PHO that Covid would only be effectively controlled at local level because of the multiple factors influencing spread. This turned out to be correct, especially where domestic and cultural practices prevailed in spite of advice and regulation. Conservative governments are always reluctant to empower local government. The current one has so weakened and impoverished its local councils that they are actually going broke. The weakening of local government has dire consequences for the public, not only in disease control but also in housing, education, planning \u2013 just about everything where local input is valuable. We can see that Conservative ministers have difficulty in listening to their own experienced civil service team, let alone the regions \u2013 or indeed Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Public health officers (PHOs) are highly trained to deal with outbreaks of disease. It was pointed out very early in the pandemic by a PHO that Covid would only be effectively controlled at local level because of the multiple factors influencing spread. This turned out to be correct, especially where domestic and cultural practices prevailed in spite of advice and regulation. Conservative governments are always reluctant to empower local government. The current one has so weakened and impoverished its local councils that they are actually going broke. The weakening of local government has dire consequences for the public, not only in disease control but also in housing, education, planning \u2013 just about everything where local input is valuable. We can see that Conservative ministers have difficulty in listening to their own experienced civil service team, let alone the regions \u2013 or indeed Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

            "content": "Living in the UK in 2023 is no recipe for happiness, new official measures of the national mood confirm, but a solution may be at hand: move to a remote island in the north Atlantic. After improvements in overall wellbeing in Great Britain and Northern Ireland after the worst of the pandemic had passed, during the last year measures of life satisfaction and happiness have fallen and anxiety increased, meaning that overall, the people of the UK are still less content than before Covid hit. In England it means almost all of the wellbeing bounceback between March 2021 and March 2022 has been reversed, according to the Office for National Statistics. Scotland bucked the national mood slump with rising measures of happiness, and the people of the Outer Hebrides scored the highest average happiness ratings of anywhere, although with a small population the ONS said it might not be directly comparable with big towns and cities. The chain of islands, situated a ferry-hop away from the north-west coast of mainland Scotland, are known for their wildlife and white beaches and are described by the tourist board as \u201cyour very own slice of heaven\u201d. The people there also have the second highest life satisfaction score of any location in the UK. The most satisfied people live in the Shetland Islands, the equally blustery Scottish archipelago lying between Orkney, the Faroe Islands and Norway. Overall, the annual personal wellbeing figures showed a statistically significant fall in all measures in England, and an overall UK fall in scores people gave when asked \u201cHow satisfied are you with your life nowadays?\u201d, \u201cHow happy did you feel yesterday?\u201d and \u201cTo what extent do you feel that the things that you do in your life are worthwhile?\u201d. Anxiety levels rose overall and more than a quarter of women (27%) reported high levels of anxiety compared with one in five men. The last time the ONS reported this in 2016, the figure for women was 22%. \u201cThe proportion of people reporting poor wellbeing across the four measures remains higher than pre-pandemic levels,\u201d the ONS said. Richard Layard, a co-founder of the Action for Happiness campaign, said: \u201cThis report confirms that the top factor [correlating with happiness] is health and the next factor is human relationships, which includes employment, and the notion that household income is the one thing that matters is falsified.\u201d Samaritans, the charity that runs helplines for people who feel suicidal, described the report as \u201cworrying\u201d and \u201cyet further evidence of the huge mistake that the government risks making if local suicide prevention funding is allowed to run out\u201d. \u201cWith happiness levels down and anxiety increasing across the UK, it is clearly time to be investing more in the mental health of the nation not less and I urge the chancellor to right this wrong in his upcoming autumn statement,\u201d said Mubeen Bhutta, the head of policy, public affairs and campaigns at Samaritans. The places in England with the fastest-growing happiness were Mid-Sussex, Malvern Hills and Colchester; and the places with the greatest decreases in life satisfaction over the last year were Three Rivers (in Hertfordshire), Rushmoor (around Aldershot) and Worthing in West Sussex. The figures showed that adults who separated from their partner were more likely to report poor wellbeing compared with those who were married or in a civil partnership and that degree-level education could also help. Adults whose highest level of qualification was a degree equivalent or above were least likely to report poor wellbeing in terms of life satisfaction, feeling things are worthwhile, and happiness. But in the end, moving to a Scottish island is not the surest way of boosting wellbeing. Staying healthy is. \u201cSelf-reported health had a larger contribution on reported life satisfaction than any other characteristic or circumstance considered in the analysis,\u201d the ONS said. \u201cAdults in Great Britain reporting \u2018good health\u2019 rate their life satisfaction \u2026 16.6% higher than those reporting \u2018bad health\u2019 \u2026 Self-reported health was the only circumstance or characteristic to have a large contribution on feeling things done in life are worthwhile, happiness, and anxiety.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "content": "The UK is now worse prepared for a pandemic than it was when Covid-19 first swept the country, a former government health minister has warned. Lord Bethell, an under-secretary of state at the department of health in 2020, told the Observer that in terms of identifying future threats, and handling any new outbreak, he believes Britain\u2019s overstretched health system is now less able to respond to another major viral outbreak. \u201cBritain was poorly prepared for the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are waiting for important \u2018lessons learned\u2019 from the Covid inquiry and in the meantime our pandemic preparedness has gone backwards in key areas such as mass-testing, NHS resilience, global viral surveillance, Whitehall agility, vaccine supply and development, and the underlying health of the nation.\u201d This view is backed by leading scientists who have told the Observer there is little sign of new systems being put in place, as Lady Hallett\u2019s inquiry continues to expose the chaotic initial response of the government to Covid. Some believe the inquiry itself is acting as a brake on progress, with the government unlikely to act until after its final conclusions are published years from now \u2013 although initial reports on the country\u2019s \u201cpreparedness and resilience\u201d and on \u201ccore decision making\u201d are due to be published next year. A final report is not, however, expected until well after public hearings conclude in the summer of 2026. This point was emphasised by Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). \u201cOur surveillance is no better than it was in the beginning of 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the pandemic we set up an amazing surveillance system for tracking the disease and the virus variants that were causing it. Then, in 2022, as the pandemic was ending, the shutters came down and that stopped. Everything has gone back to where it was before 2020. The urgency has just dribbled away.\u201d Edmunds said the UK\u2019s Covid-19 figures put it in the middle of the league for European nations for pandemic deaths. The country started disastrously with a lockdown that was delayed until there were about 100,000 new cases a day but pulled back because the public stuck to lockdown rules and the nation\u2019s response improved. However, two major features of life in the UK worked against it doing well in the battle against Covid-19. \u201cThe first was the widespread health inequalities that exist in this country and the second is the simple fact that our health service was stretched to the limit \u2013 and still is,\u201d said Edmunds. This point was backed by other LSHTM scientists. \u201cIf there was a new pandemic outbreak today, we would be back to the same situation we were in in 2020 \u2013 no matter how much scientific advice has been given or how much political preparedness there has been,\u201d said Prof Martin Hibberd. \u201cWe would face being overwhelmed again because the NHS is still being run with no room for slack, so only a relatively small number of cases of a new disease could threaten the system. In that sense, nothing has changed.\u201d Other scientists fear that the inquiry\u2019s conclusions will come unnecessarily late. \u201cWe needed an inquiry far earlier than this,\u201d said Liam Smeeth, the school\u2019s professor of clinical epidemiology. \u201cAutumn 2020 would have been an ideal time to have a thorough, rapid no-blame inquiry. Then its conclusions could have been implemented speedily. As it is, we may have to wait years for changes to be recommended and implemented. Meanwhile, the threat of a new pandemic remains ever present.\u201d Others who criticise the government\u2019s failure to learn lessons from Covid point to the move to sell off the Rosalind Franklin Laboratory in Leamington Spa that was established during the pandemic to process Covid tests. The facility cost the taxpayer at least \u00a3455m. Decisions like these have led the former head of the vaccine taskforce, Dame Kate Bingham, to warn that the UK is \u201cnot in a much better place to deal with a new pandemic\u201d in contrast to other European countries that have increased their capabilities to face new viruses or variants of Covid. She said UK capabilities set up to tackle the Covid-19 crisis were now being \u201cdismantled\u201d."

            "date": "2023-11-14T11:12:28Z",
            "content": "A vaccine to protect against chickenpox should become a routine childhood jab in the UK, government advisers have said, adding that the move would not only reduce the number of children who become sick from the virus, but also cut the number of serious cases that can become fatal. At present, the jab, known as the varicella vaccination after the varicella zoster virus that causes the disease, is only available on the NHS to children and adults who are in regular or close contact with people who could become very ill from a chickenpox infection or have a weakened immune system. This includes healthcare workers who have not had chickenpox before, as well as close contacts of vulnerable people. However, under the new proposal from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the UK would join a number of other countries that already offer the varicella vaccination as part of routine childhood immunisation programmes, including Germany, Canada, Australia and the US. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, the chair of the JCVI, said that while chickenpox was well known, and often considered a mild illness among children, that was not always the case. \u201cFor some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox or its complications can be very serious, resulting in hospitalisation and even death,\u201d he said. \u201cAdding the varicella vaccine to the childhood immunisation programme will dramatically reduce the number of chickenpox cases in the community, leading to far fewer of those tragic, more serious cases.\u201d Pollard said decades of evidence from countries including the US showed such programmes were safe and effective, adding that the introduction of the jab as part of routine childhood immunisations in the UK would have a \u201creally positive impact on the health of young children\u201d. The Department of Health will have the final decision on implementing the vaccine. The proposal marks a shift in thinking: the JCVI previously warned such a move might result in an increase in cases of shingles in adults, as it would reduce the circulation of the chickenpox virus in the community. Shingles occurs in people who have previously had chickenpox when the varicella zoster virus reactivates in the body. However, community circulation of chickenpox can help to boost their immunity and prevent this from happening. The JCVI says data from the US suggests that vaccinating children would not result in a rise in cases of shingles among adults. Under the proposal, all children would be offered two doses of the vaccine \u2013 one at 12 months and another at 18 months \u2013 while the recommendations also include provision for a temporary catch-up programme for older children. The move appears to have been spurred, in part, by the impact of the Covid pandemic, when social restrictions led to reduced mixing and hence a larger pool of children who have not yet had chickenpox. Research suggests the introduction of the chickenpox vaccine as part of the routine childhood immunisation programme would have widespread support: a survey of about 600 parents published earlier this year by researchers at Keele University and University College London revealed around that three-quarters said they would support such a move, with 18% saying they were unlikely to accept such a jab for their child and about 8% unsure. \u201cThe addition of a vaccine to the UK vaccination schedule to protect children against chickenpox will be welcomed by many parents,\u201d said Helen Bedford, professor of children\u2019s health at UCL and a co-author of that research. \u201cAlthough chicken pox is usually a mild infection, children have an itchy rash and often a fever which makes them feel very miserable. Chicken pox infection can also result in serious complications such as nasty bacterial skin infections, pneumonia and inflammation of the brain. \u201cProviding our children with this additional vaccine would be a welcome addition to the highly successful UK vaccination programme.\u201d"

Artificial intelligence platforms such as ChatGPT contain safeguards that stop it from responding to prompts about illegal or harmful activities, such as how to buy illicit drugs. Two researchers from Flinders University in Adelaide, with no specialised knowledge of artificial intelligence, did an internet search to find publicly available information on how to circumvent these safeguards. They then aimed to generate as many blogposts as possible containing disinformation about vaccines and vaping in the shortest time possible. Within 65 minutes they had produced 102 posts targeted at groups including young adults, young parents, pregnant women and those with chronic health conditions. The posts included fake patient and clinician testimonials and scientific-looking referencing. The platform also generated 20 fake but realistic images to accompany the articles in less than two minutes, including pictures of vaccines causing harm to young children. The researchers also generated a fake video linking vaccines to child deaths in more than 40 languages. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The study was published in the US journal JAMA Internal Medicine on Tuesday. The lead author, pharmacist Bradley Menz, said; \u201cOne of those concerns about artificial intelligence is the generation of disinformation, which is the intentional generation of information that is either misleading, inaccurate or false. \u201cWe wanted to see how easy it would be for someone with malicious intent to break the system safeguards and use these platforms to generate disinformation on a mass scale,\u201d he said. The study concluded publicly available tools could be used for mass generation of misleading health information with \u201calarming ease\u201d. \u201cWe think that the developers of these platforms should include a mechanism to allow health professionals or members of the public to report any concerning information generated and the developer could then follow up to eliminate the issue,\u201d Menz said. \u201cIn our study, we did report the concerns, but we never received a confirmation or follow up, and the tool was never tuned in a way to prevent this from occurring in the future.\u201d Prof Matt Kuperholz, a former chief data scientist with PwC, said even though artificial intelligence platforms had been further developed and safeguards strengthened since the study was conducted, he was \u201cable to replicate the results in less than one minute\u201d. \u201cNo amount of inbuilt safeguards is going to stop the misuse of the technology,\u201d said Kuperholz, who is now a researcher with Deakin University. Kuperholz believes a combination of measures are needed to protect against disinformation, including holding publishers of the content to account, whether that be social media platforms or individual authors. He also believes technology can be built to assess the output of other artificial intelligence platforms and whether the information is reliable. \u201cWe need to move on from a world where we implicitly trust what we see, and build an infrastructure of trust where instead of blacklisting tools we don\u2019t trust, we whitelist tools and information we do trust.\u201d The \u201cincredible amount of good these technologies also should not be underestimated,\u201d he said. A professor of biomedical informatics at the University of Sydney, Adam Dunn, said the conclusions from Menz\u2019s study \u201care likely to create unnecessary scaremongering\u201d. \u201cWhile it might seem scary that artificial intelligence could be used to create misinformation including text, images, and videos, it can equally be used to create simple versions of evidence as well.\u201d He said just because the tools were being used to produce false information, it did not mean people believed it over trustworthy information. \u201cWe still do not have any strong evidence that the presence of misinformation online is associated with changes in behaviour,\u201d he said."

            "content": "In a Facebook group for parents, a mother asks for advice following the recent rise in measles cases. She\u2019s received a letter from the NHS asking her to take her young daughter for the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, as it\u2019s \u201cdangerous not to have it\u201d. But she doesn\u2019t know who to trust. \u201cI\u2019ve done some research but feel like a lot of the info on the web is pro-vaccine,\u201d she writes. Another mother is equally unsure. She\u2019s trying to decide whether she should take her eldest for their childhood jabs and wants to work out which ones are \u201cworth the risk\u201d. \u201cJust trying to learn about it all and make the right decisions. Thank you in advance,\u201d she writes. Within minutes, both posts have been flooded with replies \u2013 almost all of which give the same advice. \u201cNo no no. Avoid them all,\u201d one person says. \u201cOnce they\u2019re injected into the bloodstream, the metals and toxins have access to the brain and every organ!\u201d she claims falsely. \u201cArm yourself with information to decline because they will pressure you.\u201d Others share stories of children they claim have been damaged by the MMR vaccine. Some advise the parents to \u201cjust ignore\u201d communications from the NHS. \u201cI keep getting letters for all my kids. It\u2019s scaremongering. I\u2019ve threatened my surgery with harassment if they don\u2019t stop sending me letters,\u201d another person says. The onslaught of anti-vaccine comments seems to have the desired effect. Both mothers say thanks for the help. The one who received the NHS letter urging her to take her daughter for the MMR vaccine has made up her mind. \u201cI definitely won\u2019t be letting her have it,\u201d she writes. It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that these conversations would take place in a Facebook group where discussions about wellness and holistic health are common. But misinformation about the MMR vaccine is not confined to an obscure corner of the internet. Last week, several articles about the heightened risk of UK measles outbreaks \u2013 posted on social media by major outlets such as Sky and ITV News \u2013 were deluged with laughing face emojis and sceptical comments such as \u201cMore fear porn\u201d, \u201cThey want to jab the kids\u201d, \u201cFearmongering bullshit\u201d and \u201cMore fear so they jab their kids with MMR and poison them at best\u201d. Many comments indicated mistrust of the media, health services and the government. \u201cRule of thumb, anything the MSM [mainstream media] push, you do the opposite,\u201d said one. Anti-immigration rhetoric about the uptick in measles cases was also common. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from the small boat invasion,\u201d one person wrote. At the same time, influencers who gained large followings during the pandemic \u2013 including those at the forefront of sowing doubt about the Covid vaccines \u2013 appear to have refocused some attention on MMR. Amid a fall in childhood immunisation rates, the resurgence of misinformation is alarming health experts. The latest NHS figures show the MMR vaccine uptake is the lowest since 2010-11, with only 84.5% of children having received both doses by age five \u2013 well below the WHO recommended rate of 95%. Measles is also rising, with 149 lab-confirmed cases this year compared with 54 in 2022. Dr Selvaseelan Selvarajah, a GP in east London, is on the frontline of the fight to reverse this trend. Alongside his main practice in Tower Hamlets he is a clinical lead in Hackney, where MMR uptake is the lowest in England \u2013 with only 56.3% of five-year-olds having had both doses. Part of the problem, said Selvarajah, is that there is a \u201cmassive overhang\u201d from the days of Andrew Wakefield, who in the late 1990s pushed the debunked theory that the MMR vaccine causes autism \u2013 leading uptake to plummet. Those false claims still circulate in some parent circles, he added. General scepticism about vaccines has also risen post-pandemic: \u201cSince Covid we\u2019ve seen a lot more hesitancy. Theories about the MMR and Covid vaccines have merged.\u201d While for some the anti-vaccine views are deeply entrenched, others are \u201cnot anti-vaxxers but they want more information\u201d. In Hackney, there are particular challenges due to the makeup of the borough, which includes traditionally under-vaccinated groups, such as Orthodox Jewish and Somali communities, as well as a section of the \u201cwhite middle class\u201d who favour \u201cmore organic, holistic living and don\u2019t believe in vaccines\u201d. But pressures on the wider health system mean that where before Selvarajah could spend 30 minutes speaking to a vaccine-hesitant parent, now he cannot. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the time,\u201d he says. Instead, Selvarajah and colleagues are trialling initiatives including holding community talks and paying junior doctors to ring up the parents of unvaccinated children to more gently encourage them to come in. He also believes campaigns in nurseries and schools are needed, as well as increased \u201cpeer support\u201d. A parent sharing the message that their child had the MMR vaccine and was fine \u2013 or caught measles and was not \u2013 \u201cis a much more powerful message than expecting an overstretched GP system to do it\u201d, he said. Such a strategy would effectively be playing anti-vaxxers at their own game. \u201cWhat anti-vaxxers have been very good at is they\u2019re on Facebook, they\u2019re on Instagram, they\u2019re on TikTok,\u201d said Callum Hood, who leads research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate. \u201cPart of the strategy is to be really approachable and easy to access.\u201d Facebook generally permits such discussions, only removing misinformation it thinks is \u201clikely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm\u201d. Modelling by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) suggests failing to improve vaccine uptake could have severe consequences. While the risk of a nationwide epidemic is low, it believes an outbreak of between 40,000 and 160,000 cases could occur in London due to low vaccine uptake in the capital. Dr Vanessa Saliba, measles lead at the UKHSA, said her team was increasing its work with councils and local health teams to improve uptake of MMR and other childhood vaccinations, including \u201ctailoring and targeting\u201d interventions in \u201cdisenfranchised communities\u201d. Early next year, it plans to write to the parents of every unvaccinated child. Staff are also monitoring misinformation online, some of which was \u201camplified\u201d during the pandemic \u2013 however, Saliba is cautious not to overstate the impact of such content. Recent polling of 1,000 parents by the UKHSA suggests opinions of childhood vaccinations remain positive overall. \u201cParents tell us they see all kinds of information about vaccines from different sources, such as social media, but they don\u2019t trust those sources,\u201d she said. With measles outbreaks in other parts of the world, she said it was probably only \u201ca matter of time\u201d before UK cases \u201ctake off again in quite a big way\u201d. But she said there was now a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to ensure \u201cevery child\u201d was protected. \u201cOne in 10 children who get measles will get complications, and sometimes it can be fatal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s completely preventable with a vaccine. Every case we get is a real shame.\u201d The image at the top of this article was changed on 26 November 2023."

The second group of 30 healthcare workers received the Covid booster and flu shot on different days within the same month. The antibodies of both groups were then measured. The research concluded that the group that had their shots administered together had higher levels of immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1 \u2013 the antibodies that counter Covid-19 and that strain of influenza. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Guardian that it was an interesting finding. \u201c[It\u2019s] possibly due to enhanced stimulation of the immune system by both vaccines being present at the same time,\u201d Adalja said. \u201cThe key thing is to see if this has any kind of meaningful clinical benefit \u2013 do the higher levels of antibody translate into more protection against infection or disease?\u201d The study has not been peer-reviewed yet, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends \u201cgetting a flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccine at the same visit\u201d. The CDC does not give a reason for getting both together but assures it is safe. The CDC cited one of its own studies on the side-effects that follow getting both shots at the same time. According to the CDC\u2019s findings, although there are more side-effects associated with getting the Covid-19 booster and flu shot together, the side-effects are not as bad as only getting the Covid-19 booster. The CDC says: \u201cPeople who got a flu vaccine and Covid-19 monovalent vaccine at the same time were slightly more likely to have reactions including fatigue, headache, and muscle ache than people who only got a Covid-19 monovalent vaccine, but those reactions were mostly mild and went away quickly.\u201d Adalja said there also existed some data pointing to a possible small increased risk of strokes and mini-strokes in the elderly who get high doses of these vaccines, but said he did not believe it was a very meaningful increase in risk. Ultimately, whether for ease or the benefit of health, getting both the Covid and flu vaccines together seems to yield positive results. Adalja said: \u201cTaking both vaccines at the same time is something that has always been more convenient for patients but now may also have an added immunologic benefit and should be generally recommended for those eligible for both vaccines.\u201d"

            "content": "Australia is experiencing its ninth wave of Covid-19 but immunity built up through vaccinations and previous infections is resulting in fewer hospitalisations and deaths, according to the government and health experts. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Aged Care said national surveillance indicators, including average daily case numbers, hospitalisations and ICU admissions, outbreaks in aged care facilities and the dispensing of oral antiviral treatments, suggest that Covid-19 transmission has been gradually increasing since mid to late-August. \u201cThese increases have started from a low baseline, however in the past week the highest weekly increase since May 2023 has been observed,\u201d the spokesperson said. The government\u2019s most recent national weekly figures show Australia is reporting an average of 936 cases a day \u2013 a 23.6% increase in the week ending 24 October compared with the previous week. Cases have risen in every state and territory, with Victoria seeing the lowest increase, at 15.8%, while Northern Territory is reporting the highest, at 45.1%. The spokesperson said a sixth Omicron wave was being driven by a combination of Omicron sub-variants (mainly XBB), which the department considers Australia\u2019s ninth Covid wave. This wave is Australia\u2019s first since 20 October when chief medical officer Paul Kelly declared Covid-19 was no longer a communicable disease incident of national significance. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government\u2019s principal health protection committee said Australia had shifted to managing Covid-19 in a way consistent with other common communicable diseases. Prof Catherine Bennett, the chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, says it is important that people know the risk of infection is increasing so they can take precautions \u2013 especially if they are vulnerable to severe illness. Do you still need to report positive results? The health department says reported case numbers are an underestimate because of the changes in testing and reporting requirements. New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the ACT are no longer collecting information on Covid-19 self-reported Rapid Antigen Test results. Prof Dominic Dwyer, a medical virologist and infectious diseases physician at NSW Health Pathology\u2019s Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research, said \u201cactivity is much harder to measure now than two years ago because less people getting a PCR test done\u201d. Bennett said reporting of cases has been gradually dwindling and she estimates it\u2019s now about 5% of infections. However, while the government\u2019s surveillance systems don\u2019t capture every infection, they can predict trends. When did cases start rising? Southern states were hit by this most recent wave first, followed by northern states, Bennett said. Cases first started rising slowly in Victoria, then New South Wales, then Queensland, she said. The number of Covid-19 cases in hospital has increased by an average of 17.5% nationally compared with the previous week, according to the government\u2019s most recent weekly figures. The seven-day rolling average is 1,245 hospitalisations, including 31 in intensive care. But these are fewer than half those recorded during the June wave (2,776 at 6 June 2023), and under a quarter of the cases recorded in last year\u2019s July wave (5,377 at 27 July 2022). Bennett said case numbers in each subsequent Omicron wave haven\u2019t been as high as the previous peak. Cases have also tended to be milder as the majority of people have a combination of prior infection and vaccine immunity. What are the current rules around Covid? State and federal health departments have moved away from mandatory rules on Covid \u2013 and that\u2019s part of the transition to the disease being endemic, Bennett said. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep putting rules in and out each time you have a wave \u2013 this could go on for a very long time.\u201d Instead, Bennett said the approach will become like flu season where warnings are issued by authorities during peaks. Face masks are no longer mandatory in most places. While advice varies between state health departments, most recommend wearing them if you have Covid-19 and are in indoor settings outside your home, where you cannot maintain physical distance. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee also recommends staying home when unwell with Covid and wearing a mask both if you are at high risk of the disease or visiting places with people at higher risk of serious disease, such as aged care facilities. Are we still talking about Covid waves? The health department spokesperson said a new wave of transmission is considered to have started when multiple national surveillance indicators concurrently increase from relatively low levels. Bennett said she doesn\u2019t number Covid waves because before borders opened at the end of 2021 some states experienced waves while others didn\u2019t. Once borders opened waves became more clearly defined but the progressive waves have been declining in impact, she said. \u201cWaves are just identifying that increased risk of being exposed to the virus in the community.\u201d The director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services in Brisbane, associate prof Paul Griffin, said \u201cwe need to move more towards people understanding that Covid is going to be in our community basically forever with fluctuations in case numbers from time to time\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t go away between these so-called waves and perhaps we need to adapt our terminology accordingly,\u201d Griffin said. What\u2019s the latest on vaccinations? The health department spokesperson said 4.1m booster doses have been administered to all ages in 2023. \u201cFewer people have received a Covid-19 booster this year than previously,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe number of people getting vaccinated each week is good, but we would like it to be higher.\u201d Dwyer said vaccinations and boosters are very important, but the messaging around a vaccination like influenza is easier because it occurs every winter. The Australian technical advisory group on immunisation recommends that all adults aged 75 years and older should receive an additional Covid vaccine dose if it has been more than six months since their previous dose. Atagi advises adults aged 56-74, as well as anyone aged 18 and older who is severely immunocompromised, should only consider a booster if more than six months has passed since their last dose, after discussion with their healthcare provider. Atagi\u2019s advice is in line with the latest update from the World Health Organization, which advised only high-risk groups should receive ongoing Covid-19 booster doses."

            "content": "From bakeries to book shops, political parties and even individual authors, it has never been easier for consumers to flaunt their cultural allegiances through the clothes they wear. Now, a new category has entered the merchandise space: mental health. Online sellers offer sweatshirts in soothing millennial pink with slogans such as \u201cMental Health Matters\u201d or \u201cAnxious But Doing It Anyways\u201d. Others simply state the brand names of antidepressants. Bestsellers on Etsy include graphic T-shirts with \u201cDepressed But Make It Hot\u201d and \u201cThis Barbie Takes Prozac\u201d. Both high-street and high-end brands are getting involved. Streetwear favourite Praying sells a \u201cYou Matter Don\u2019t Give Up\u201d grey hoodie for \u00a3137 while Primark\u2019s \u00a37 \u201cempowering\u201d T-shirts include statements such as \u201cSurround Yourself With People Who Bring Good Vibes\u201d. This week, Stella McCartney launched a limited-edition bag featuring words by the American poet Cleo Wade, \u201cThe ride is long but it leads you home\u201d. It is part of a collaboration between the designer and the mental health advocate Deepak Chopra, championing equine therapy. While the subject of mental health has historically been resigned to covert helplines and hushed doctors offices, it is now much more widely acknowledged and discussed. On TikTok the hashtag mental health has been viewed more than 114bn times, with users, some with millions of followers, documenting their \u201cbad mental health days\u201d and talking about therapy. \u201cThis type of clothing can open up a conversation,\u201d says psychologist Dr Audrey Tang. \u201cIn the same way a blue badge allows you to park in a disabled space, wearing these type of tops expresses and gives an insight to others about how you are feeling.\u201d \u201cA lot of people cope with mental health issues through humour,\u201d adds Sarah Russell, the founder of the Etsy store Grocery Apparel, which sells \u201cHot Girls Take Antidepressants\u201d T-shirts, among others. \u201cHaving something silly like a T-shirt that makes it more relatable can make people realise they are not alone in dealing with it.\u201d Travis Baskin, who owns a brand called Own Your Stigma that sells sweatshirts with the slogans \u201cCoffee, Dogs and Mental Health\u201d and \u201cI Feel All The Feels\u201d, says the aim of the brand is to encourage conversation. It seems to work: \u201cSomeone was wearing our T-shirt that says \u2018It\u2019s OK, not to be OK\u2019 on a bus and a stranger came over and started talking to them about it. It normalises it.\u201d Much lies in the visual allure of the clothing itself. Bright colours and slogans are social media catnip. The messaging also encourages interaction through likes and comments, all elements that the algorithm rewards. It all goes to prove that, as with everything else, even psychological wellbeing can be commodified. Last year, in a series dedicated to speculating trends for 2023, Retail Wire revealed \u201cMental health-oriented messaging is quickly becoming table stakes for retailers that cater to next-gen consumers.\u201d However, similar to the way in which wearing a Renaissance tour T-shirt or carrying a tote bag with the name of your favourite deli signifies not only your love of Beyonc\u00e9 and bagels but also your cultural capital, there is an argument that mental health merchandise denotes much more than your emotional state. In the same way therapy speak has become part of the daily lexicon, is it reductive to those who have a genuine anxiety disorder? Tang argues that while slogan clothing may encourage conversation, it may still not leave wearers equipped with the ability to handle deeper conversation around it. She also sees problems with defining oneself via one\u2019s mental wellbeing. \u201cA mental health issue is a diagnosis and series of symptoms,\u201d Tang says. \u201cIt is not your identity.\u201d Tang also notes concerns with people wearing mental health merchandise for \u201csecondary gains\u201d, saying: \u201cThe primary gain of disclosing a medical condition or illness is for treatment. The secondary gain is the attention that comes from it. It\u2019s the \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 from strangers.\u201d Fashion and mental health have a problematic past. In 2001, Alexander McQueen set his show in a space that seemed to mimic a padded cell. (Vogue described it as: \u201cDemented girls, wearing hospital headbands and everything from extraordinary mussel-shell skirts to impossibly chic pearl-coloured cocktail dresses, slithered and strutted while uselessly attempting to fly over the cuckoo\u2019s nest.\u201d) Six years later, Vogue Italia featured a shoot by Steven Meisel entitled \u201cSuper Mods Enter Rehab\u201d, which included the model Lara Stone being dragged by nurses down a hospital corridor and locked up in cells. In 2019, the Gucci show opened with a series of models walking on a conveyor belt wearing what appeared to be a fashion take on straitjackets. In an unplanned protest, one of the models, Ayesha Tan-Jones, held up their hands, on which they had scrawled the words \u201cmental health is not fashion\u201d. Afterwards, they posted a statement to Instagram: \u201cPresenting these struggles as props for selling clothes in today\u2019s capitalist climate is vulgar, unimaginative and offensive to the millions of people around the world affected by these issues.\u201d So, is the commodification of mental health reductive? Russell says she wouldn\u2019t be \u201cterribly surprised\u201d if customers were buying medical themed merchandise without actually experiencing the conditions. \u201cBut,\u201d she says, \u201cno one is going to go to their doctor and say: \u2018I want this medication because I saw it on a T-shirt\u2019.\u201d To read the complete version of this newsletter \u2013 complete with this week\u2019s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved \u2013 subscribe to receive Fashion Statement in your inbox every Thursday."

            "date": "2023-11-07T05:00:02Z",
            "content": "A chubby bronze bird perches on the roof of a bright orange building at the Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital, craning its neck to keep tabs on all who enter. On a bench nearby, a smaller bird looks up, its wings tentatively spread, as though plucking up the courage to join its mother on the roof. Two more cartoonish creatures are engaged in conversation above the entrance canopy, perhaps mimicking some of the family discussions happening down below. It is a disarmingly cheerful entry to a place where most visitors arrive in acute distress, as the new home for young people\u2019s mental health services in the region. The \u00a320m project brings services together that were formerly scattered around Liverpool in a disjointed muddle of converted buildings, giving them a new base on the main hospital site, as part of Alder Hey\u2019s expansive parkland campus. Designed by Cullinan Studio, with artworks by Lucy Casson, the new centre points to a welcome alternative to the usual dreary hospital template of anonymous sheds housing wipe-clean, windowless corridors. It floats on the edge of the park like a rusty steel ship moored in a dry dock, enclosing a pair of light-flooded courtyards, with warm wooden interiors and thoughtful details throughout. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the NHS\u2019s wider drive to treat mental health with the same level of importance as physical health,\u201d says Lisa Cooper, Alder Hey\u2019s director of mental health services. The need could not be more stark. Since the pandemic, the number of young people seeking mental health support has reached a record high, with 1.4m school-age children requesting NHS help last year \u2013 a dramatic increase of 76% since 2019. Eating disorders have rocketed, thriving in the social isolation of lockdown, while anxiety and self-harm have also been on the rise, often triggered by the pressure of having to catch up with missed school time. \u201cOur young people usually come with multiple diagnoses,\u201d says clinical lead, Andrea O\u2019Donnell. \u201cIt could be an eating disorder like anorexia, in addition to OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder], with autism on top. They are complex, layered mixes.\u201d In the previous facility, children were ushered into a low-ceilinged waiting room, with plastic seats facing each other in an intimidating square, a welcome that couldn\u2019t be more off-putting. Now, they enter the new Catkin Centre into a space where a great wooden cone bursts through the ceiling, bringing light into the open foyer. The structure has benches and seating nooks built in, while deep window sills offer places to perch \u2013 doing away with the usual seats in serried rows or arranged around the edge, common to most NHS waiting rooms. From here, consultation and clinical rooms are arranged in clusters around a U-shaped courtyard, with smaller \u201csub-wait\u201d lobby spaces for each trio of rooms. The architects\u2019 drawings show these as alluring spaces, lined with upholstered cubbyholes, but they have become distinctly more workmanlike affairs in the contractor-led building process \u2013 something that is sadly a recurring theme throughout. The building next door, known as Sunflower House, is a higher-security inpatient facility, home to 12 bedrooms, where children aged between nine and 13 with more challenging mental health needs stay for an average of nine months. It takes a similar two-storey courtyard form, with timber-lined corridors facing on to a planted central space \u2013 equipped with a giant xylophone and spherical water feature \u2013 and bedrooms arranged around the edge on the upper level, each with a deep bay window. The nurses\u2019 office occupies a prime viewing spot, positioned like a panopticon at the end of the courtyard, so they can easily survey the whole scene. Open lounge spaces project into the courtyard, although it turns out most of the kids prefer to sit on the deep window sills, where they can look out, but also feel protected. \u201cWe found that children tend to seek small spaces within big spaces,\u201d says Roddy Langmuir, practice leader at Cullinan Studio. \u201cThe bay windows are designed so you can climb into them, while all the sills are deep enough to sit on, and feel a connection with the outside.\u201d During the design consultation, one child drew a sketch showing little private pods arranged on what look like umbilical cords extending from a central oval. \u201cNot linear shaped like a normal hospital,\u201d said the accompanying note. \u201cDifferent seating areas built in,\u201d said another. Both became driving principles of the design. \u201cThey all wanted \u2018getaway space\u2019,\u201d says Langmuir, \u201csomewhere to feel out of the public eye, but also be able to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d Children who feel too anxious to join classroom sessions downstairs can watch from the safe distance of an upstairs window sill, then they might come down to the courtyard to join a table tennis game, and eventually find themselves feeling comfortable at a desk. Multiple routes help soften the psychological barriers to entry. Such progression is aided by a multimedia \u201cimmersion room\u201d, where various scenes of the outside world can be simulated by interactive projections on the walls. One minute we\u2019re standing in a busy pedestrian shopping precinct in Liverpool (which feels more overwhelming than the real thing), the next an airport terminal, then a calming underwater scene, where fish swim in shoals across the floor, and the swipe of a hand conjures bubbles across the wall. Real-life classrooms can also be simulated, even down to where the child will be sitting, to help acclimatise them back into the feeling of being at school. The school canteen might be a comedown after time spent here. The consultation process determined that, above all else, the kids wanted to eat in an American diner. So that\u2019s what they\u2019ve got. It is washed in a Miami colour scheme, with minty walls, lilac banquettes, 1950s decals covering the walls, and a diner-style menu. The pastel palette continues elsewhere, in the vinyl upholstery covering the heavyweight anti-ligature furniture, and in the sloping architraves around the doors, designed so nothing can be tied or hung from them. The door handles are solid and also can\u2019t be tied on to, while the cupboards have sloping tops. \u201cOur challenge was to break through the institutional coding,\u201d says Langmuir, \u201cwhile having to use all the certified fixtures and fittings.\u201d They have mostly succeeded, although there are places where the vision hasn\u2019t quite found its way into reality. As is often the case, the NHS trust chose a \u201cdesign and build\u201d procurement route, whereby the builder rather than the architect is in charge, appointing contractor Galliford Try to oversee the project. The company boasts that it \u201crefined the design, delivering \u00a35m savings,\u201d but it seems that some of the joy was squeezed out in the process. The original wooden window mullions around the courtyard are now metal, creating a more harsh, officey feel, while the once-pitched bedroom ceilings have been flattened, making them feel more institutional. The cross-laminated timber walls feature gaps and cracks that look hastily filled, while suspended ceilings now hang where the timber would once have been exposed, and the vinyl floors are mismatched in places. Clunky glass balustrades add to the catalogue-chosen air. These might sound like small details, but they make a difference \u2013 and it\u2019s particularly galling when compared to the much more slickly finished research institute next door, the preserve not of patients, but staff and visiting academics. Thankfully, Cullinan Studio\u2019s primary design moves are strong enough to have survived most of the cost-cutting, but NHS procurement needs a rethink if it is to achieve the quality its patients deserve. \u2022 In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or email pat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and Ireland Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "content": "I was a bookish, quiet and nerdy child. I felt like an outsider, although I wonder if most kids feel that. I was rarely wild \u2013 being a black kid in east London, I was always aware of assumptions being made and of what others might get away with, but I might not. My earliest memory is having a picnic on the UK coast: sandwiches, chicken drumsticks in tinfoil and a windy car park. It\u2019s a happy one, for sure. Memories are often fallible. We often forget difficult times. Part of therapy is re-evaluating and reframing memories in light of new information. It\u2019s less about what happened and more about how we understand it. There has been a lot of neurological illness in my family \u2013 motor neurone disease, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, multiple sclerosis. I grew up with a familiarity with nerves that don\u2019t work as they should. It meant GCSE biology felt familiar. Then, I found psychology. I\u2019m incredibly conscious of the shortness of life. It\u2019s why I take risks and try new things: I\u2019ve done parachute jumps, paraglided solo in Nepal. I want to taste the whole human experience. I want that for my patients, too. To help them repair what is damaged, move on from what is ended, heal from pain, but also to see the opportunities in the here and now, and to make fun a key part of living. An English teacher recommended I apply to study at Oxford University. I didn\u2019t, because I was frightened I wouldn\u2019t fit in. I regret not trying. All trainee psychologists are dicks, myself included. With that first little bit of knowledge, you start to psychoanalyse everyone, impose concepts and theories on situations. Then you realise that going to a few lectures doesn\u2019t make you a leading expert. I\u2019m truly sorry for being insufferable. We like to think of ourselves as individual and smart, but actually we\u2019re all fairly predictable. Be honest with me, wherever possible. Being treated like a fool winds me up no end. We\u2019ll get on much better if you\u2019re straight with me. It\u2019s not just that I dislike dishonesty. Honestly? I think it makes you seem weak. Own the truth. Patients do tell me I don\u2019t let them get away with anything. They imagine I\u2019ll be lovely, chatty and passive, when in fact I think good therapy \u2013 while needing to feel safe and supportive \u2013 should also be challenging. You should be made to think not just about what has happened to you, but what you do to yourself, and to others. Eat more beans. Believe me, they\u2019re the answer to most of your, and the planet\u2019s, most pressing problems. You can\u2019t have good mental health without a well-functioning brain, and you can\u2019t have a well-functioning brain without good nutrition. People don\u2019t tend to give me advice. I come across, almost certainly, as a bit of a know it all. But I do appreciate it. Once, someone told me I always had my shoulders up, and a manicurist moisturising my hand once said: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to relax.\u201d These things helped me realise how tightly wound I was. I\u2019ve sat on lots of committees and boards, often applying because without me, there wouldn\u2019t be a black person at the table. There\u2019s a massive discrepancy between black people as users of mental health services and being providers of them. That needs to change urgently. Lying in the sun. Foraging for elderflowers. Making pickles. Dancing. Singing in a choir. These are the things that make me happy. Find yours and do them at every opportunity.

            "title": "England captain Owen Farrell to miss Six Nations and prioritise mental health",
            "date": "2023-11-29T15:44:18Z",
            "content": "Owen Farrell will miss the Six Nations next year after deciding to take a break from international rugby in order to \u201cprioritise his and his family\u2019s mental wellbeing\u201d. Farrell, who captained England to third place at the recent World Cup, has not put a timeframe on his international absence but will continue to lead his club Saracens in the interim. In a bombshell announcement, Farrell\u2019s decision to make himself unavailable for England leaves Steve Borthwick needing a new captain for next year\u2019s Six Nations and possibly longer. With Courtney Lawes retired from international rugby, Ellis Genge is favourite for the role, while George Ford is the leading contender to assume the No 10 jersey. Farrell\u2019s decision comes after he eclipsed Jonny Wilkinson as England\u2019s top points scorer and reached 112 caps during the World Cup but the criticism that has dogged the 32\u2011year\u2011old throughout his career continued in France and he was loudly booed before matches at the tournament. A red card during England\u2019s tournament warm-up win against Wales at Twickenham in August sparked a furore and led to his father, Andy, to hit out at what he called the \u201cdisgusting circus\u201d surrounding his son. Borthwick, who also sprang to the defence of his captain at the time, said on Wednesday: \u201cEveryone at England Rugby is fully behind Owen\u2019s decision. Since making his debut, he has been an integral part of the England setup for over a decade and the demands on elite athletes are extremely challenging. He is an exemplary player, captain and leader and always gives his all for his country. It is with typical courage that Owen has made this decision to open up in this manner. Together with all of us at England Rugby, I will do everything I can to ensure that he has the support he requires going forward.\u201d As much as Farrell has Borthwick\u2019s backing, his decision will be a blow to the England head coach who was keen to continue to build the next stage of his side\u2019s evolution around his captain. Borthwick is already without senior figures such as Lawes, Ben Youngs and Jonny May, who announced their international retirements after the World Cup, leaving the head coach short on senior leaders. Like Lawes, Genge was a vice-captain in France, but he lost his place to Joe Marler for the World Cup semi-final defeat by South Africa. Lawes has ruled out answering an SOS call from England, who begin their Six Nations campaign in Rome on 3 February, but recently tipped Genge as a future captain \u2013 a prediction that looks all the more salient given Farrell\u2019s decision. Responding to the news, the former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio wrote on social media: \u201cI\u2019ve said it many times [Owen Farrell] is our captain and potentially England\u2019s greatest ever player. The level of abuse he receives is sickening. I really think it\u2019s time for player sabbaticals, such are the demands of the game today.\u201d The Rugby Players\u2019 Association also released a statement promising support for Farrell. \u201cHe is a leader and figurehead in the English game, but is also an individual, husband and father,\u201d it said. \u201cHis wellbeing comes first and we will support him in every way we can going forward.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-22T20:00:37Z",
            "content": "Police should not be involved in responses to mental health because they can escalate the situation and mental distress, according to new research for the first time led by Australians with lived experience. A report by La Trobe University, Police apprehension as a response to mental distress, presents the research findings, principles and reform agendas to inform appropriate and dignifying responses to mental distress. The report comes as reform could be on the horizon in some states. New South Wales\u2019s minister for mental health this month flagged significant reforms to the way police respond to people in acute distress as she conceded there were instances in which the current system \u201chas failed\u201d, while Victoria has yet to implement the health-led response to mental distress which was recommended from its royal commission two years ago. The project was conceived by academics with a lived experience of police apprehension in a mental health crisis, with findings based on interviews over a 10-month period in 2021-2022 with 20 participants with experience of mental health-related police intervention in Australia. Removing police as responders was identified as the first of six reform agendas the report identified, as \u201cparticipants expressed a unanimous preference that police are not involved in responses to mental health\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Chris Maylea, an associate professor at La Trobe Law School, said \u201cpeople who we spoke to didn\u2019t see the police response as coming to help them. They saw the police response as coming to apprehend them, and take them away.\u201d Maylea said \u201cpeople told us they preferred ambulance responding rather than police. But when we asked them what they actually wanted, it wasn\u2019t either ambulance or police. What they wanted was someone to come and listen to them and talk to them and make them feel like things were going to be OK.\u201d Maylea said neither police nor ambulance workers are equipped for mental health responses as they don\u2019t have adequate time as both emergency agencies are often rushing off to their next job. Ambulance workers\u2019 skills are more focused on physical health, rather than mental health issues, he said. \u201cWhat people really wanted was a mental health-specific response to mental distress.\u201d In order of priority, the other five reform agendas were investing in alternative responses, developing peer response models, focus on prevention, accountability and reparations when harm is caused by services, and training for police in responding to people in distress. One of the interviewees, Arwin Kraze, a Melbourne man who lives with bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, found himself in a phone booth with a broken beer bottle and a garbage bin lid during the psychotic episode which preceded his third admission to hospital. After police failed to talk him out of the booth, they set police dogs on him and swung batons at him from either side of the booth, leaving him with lacerations on his forehead and hand, as well as dog bites on his leg. Kraze said he might have more easily emerged from the phone booth had a responder given him the time he needed, and simply offered him a bag of chips and a can of Coke. \u201cWhen I\u2019m unwell I\u2019m a pain in the rase, but I\u2019m not a criminal,\u201d Kraze said. Panos Karanikolas, a PhD candidate in criminology and a member of the lived experience group of academics leading the project, described the two occasions he was taken by police to mental health inpatient units as traumatic. \u201cMy entry to the mental health system at a young age was really was very confronting, to be taken by a police and it really impacted my trust with the mental health system in general. \u201cPolice training and culture is not suited to feeling understood, feeling heard, feeling supported,\u201d he said. La Trobe\u2019s report coincides with the release of Inner Melbourne Community Legal\u2019s report Community Legal Mental Health Partnership Project which has recommended police should not act as first responders in order to reduce the instances of people experiencing mental health crisis being charged for conduct that occurs during a crisis. IMLC\u2019s director of legal practice, Molly Williams, said \u201cToo often when people are responded to by police, they\u2019re criminalised in the context of that response.\u201d Williams said when police intervene, the person will often become more distressed, and the situation will escalate, leading to the person being sectioned under the Mental Health Act, or end up with criminal charges. The IMLC report recommends that community lawyers intervene in mental health patients earlier, as often there are pressures, such as debt, which can build up and precipitate a mental health crisis."

            "date": "2023-11-14T08:04:59Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s labour market has so far emerged largely unscathed from the slowdown in the economy, the latest official figures show. The latest health check from the Office for National Statistics found the jobless rate broadly unchanged, a small fall in employment and the strongest rise in pay adjusted for inflation in two years, as the pace of prices rises comes down. The ONS said the UK\u2019s unemployment rate in the three months to September had remained steady at 4.2% while the employment rate over the same period had dropped by 0.1 points to 75.7%. The estimate of payrolled employees in the UK for October 2023 increased by 33,000 on an upwardly revised September 2023 figure, to 30.2 million, the ONS said. A fresh fall in the number of job vacancies provided some evidence of labour market weakness over the summer, with the number of posts on offer dropping by 58,000 in the three months to October. Darren Morgan, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cOur labour market figures show a largely unchanged picture, with the proportions of people who are employed, unemployed or who are neither working nor looking for a job all little changed on the previous quarter. \u201cThe number of job vacancies fell for the 16th straight month. Nevertheless, vacancies still remain well above their pre-pandemic levels. With inflation easing in the latest quarter, real pay is now growing at its fastest rate for two years.\u201d The ONS said annual growth in regular pay \u2013 which excludes bonuses \u2013 was 7.7% in July to September 2023, down from 7.9% in the three months to August, but was still among the highest annual growth rates since modern records began in 2001. Annual growth in average total pay (including bonuses) was 7.9% in the quarter ending in September, down from 8.2% in the three months to August. In real terms \u2013 adjusted for inflation using the consumer prices index, annual growth for total pay rose on the year by 1.1%, and regular pay rose on the year by 1%, the ONS said. Real pay has picked up as inflation has started to come down. Figures published by the ONS tomorrow are expected to show a sharp slowdown in the headline rate of inflation, to 4.8% in October from 6.7% in September. The ONS has admitted to having problems collecting data for its flagship labour force survey but Tuesday\u2019s figures are the last guide to the state of the jobs market before next week\u2019s autumn statement. The chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cIt\u2019s heartening to see inflation falling and real wages growing, keeping more money in people\u2019s pockets. Building on the labour market reforms in spring, the autumn statement will set out my plans to get people back into work and deliver growth for the UK.\u201d Mel Stride, the secretary of state for work and pensions, said: \u201cWe are leaving no stone unturned to help people into work, with a record number of employees on payrolls \u2013 up nearly 400,000 in the last year alone with 3.9 million more people in work than in 2010.\u201d Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures are no real comfort for workers. Years of pay freezes and real terms pay cuts have meant that workers in Britain are worse off. That is why Unite will continue to fight for jobs, pay and conditions.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-10T17:53:35Z",
            "content": "Germany has come a long way in 100 years. Back in November 1923, people were trundling wheelbarrows stacked high with cash through its streets to buy a loaf of bread. Now its reputation is that of an economic powerhouse. That episode of hyperinflation left deep scars on the nation\u2019s psyche. Government printing presses were working flat out to produce mountains of worthless bank notes and the currency collapse was so severe a single US dollar was worth 1tn marks. \u201cNever again\u201d has been the mantra ever since. Germany\u2019s rebound from the triple shocks of the first half of the 20th century \u2013 the collapse of the currency in 1923, the Great Depression and defeat in the second world war \u2013 was remarkable. So spectacular was the recovery in the 1950s and 60s that a word was coined to describe it: Wirtschaftswunder \u2013 or economic miracle. That economic miracle is now in trouble. Nowhere near as much as it was 100 years ago, but the war in Ukraine, slower growth in China and the retreat from globalisation have taken a toll. Germany has deeper problems too: an ageing population and an industrial model showing its age. Evidence that Germany might just be an analogue economy struggling to make the transition to a digital age comes from the latest manufacturing data. Industrial production has fallen for five straight months and is more than 7% below its pre-pandemic levels. The International Monetary Fund expects Germany to be the weakest economy in the G7 group of leading rich nations this year, and the only one to see output fall. Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro at ING bank, says Germany\u2019s problems were a mixture of the cyclical and the structural. \u201cHow much is down to each? It is impossible to disentangle but it\u2019s both.\u201d After shrinking this year between July and September there was a good chance, according to Brzeski, of a similarly weak performance in the final three months of 2023. Those two consecutive quarters of contraction would leave the economy in a technical recession. Germany has managed to find alternative sources of energy to make up for the loss of Russian gas from the Ukraine war but it has been more expensive. Energy-intensive sectors such as chemicals have been particularly hard hit. There have been other adverse shocks. Germany\u2019s strong export performance in the years running up to the pandemic was in part due to strong demand from China, which has now moderated. Meanwhile, its motor industry is being attacked on two fronts \u2013 from cheap Chinese electric cars, and from the incentives provided by Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act for low-carbon manufacturing to migrate to the US. \u201cThe biggest issue was that companies did not see the need to change when times were good,\u201d Brzeski says. \u201cThat showed a lack of foresight. The good times were going to come to an end and companies should have acted pre-emptively.\u201d David Marsh, the chair of the thinktank OMFIF, agrees that Germany\u2019s problems are more than temporary: \u201cSomething structural is going on there. Many times in the past people have called time on the German economy and the German economy has always bounced back. This time it might be slightly different.\u201d Marsh says that after Angela Merkel committed to shutting down all of Germany\u2019s nuclear power stations in 2011 months after the Fukushima disaster in Japan, the country became over-reliant on cheap Russian gas to meet its energy needs. \u201cThey put all their eggs in the Russian basket,\u201d he says. Moreover, Germany\u2019s struggles had come at a time when other eurozone countries were becoming more efficient. Marsh suggests that if Germany still had its own currency it would be falling due to the need to regain competitiveness. \u201cI am surprised. I thought they would have done better. There has been a failure to digitalise the economy in many ways.\u201d The Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, became a symbol of the country\u2019s postwar success. Fiercely independent, it saw its role as ensuring there would be no return to the dark days of 1923, when a postage stamp cost as much as a villa had done a few years earlier. Money in circulation, which stood at 120bn marks in 1921, reached 2,500,000,000,000,000,000 marks in October 1923 and 400,000,000,000,000,000,000 marks the following month. Since the creation of the European Central Bank a quarter of a century ago, the Bundesbank no longer sets German interest rates or has responsibility for price stability, but its president, Joachim Nagel, remains an influential figure at home and abroad. Speaking in London this week, Nagel admitted it was a mistake for Germany to be so dependent on Russian gas, but expressed optimism about the economy\u2019s ability to bounce back. He said: \u201cSome people say Germany is the sick man of Europe. I don\u2019t believe this is the case.\u201d As a large open economy exposed to problems in global supply chains and the slowdown in China, the current weakness had come as \u201cno surprise\u201d to the Bundesbank, he said. \u201cBut we are not looking at a hard landing,\u201d Nagel said. \u201cThere is strong turnaround potential.\u201d Businesses would rise to the challenge as they had in the past. Brzeski said the success of reunification showed Germany could get out of tricky situations, but it wouldn\u2019t be easy. \u201cIt\u2019s not just energy. It is changing global supply chains. It is the role of China. It is demographics and an ageing population. I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the willingness of German companies to adapt and survive, but it\u2019s going to be a long and difficult process.\u201d"

            "title": "Would Javier Milei\u2019s dollar plan for Argentina be an economic experiment too far?",
            "date": "2023-11-20T17:07:22Z",
            "content": "Javier Milei\u2019s bigger-than-expected victory in the Argentinan presidential election suggests voters in South America\u2019s second biggest country have willingly opted for shock treatment to sort out the country\u2019s deep economic malaise. It is perhaps not hard to see why 56% of the electorate backed the rightwing libertarian: Argentina may have the world\u2019s best football team but its economy has performed disastrously in recent years. Inflation is running at 140% and a three-year drought has led to a sharp fall in agricultural production. Two out of five people live in poverty and the currency has lost 90% of its value in four years. Milei\u2019s big idea involves abolishing the peso and for Argentina to use the US dollar instead. A milder form of this policy was tried in the early 1990s, when \u2013 after a previous episode of recession and hyperinflation \u2013 the government in Buenos Aires fixed the exchange rate at one peso to the dollar. This strategy, known as convertibility, was abandoned in 2002 after a deep recession and violent street protests against restrictions on bank withdrawals made it untenable. Argentina\u2019s president-elect says he wants to go further. Under his proposal, the country\u2019s central bank would in effect be abolished and the economy fully \u201cdollarised\u201d. This would mean monetary policy for Argentina being set in Washington rather than Buenos Aires. Other countries \u2013 Panama and Ecuador \u2013 have gone down this route but never one as big as Argentina, which is a member of the G20 group of leading developed and developing nations. There are some obvious problems with Milei\u2019s economic experiment. The first is that Argentina and the US are very different economies, and so what might be the right monetary policy for the latter may be the wrong one for the former. Countries have to be careful about giving up the freedom to set their own interest rates and devalue their currencies. The second problem is more practical: where would Argentina get its dollars from? At present, the central bank has almost no US dollar reserves to speak of, and lacks the access to global capital markets to obtain the stocks that would be required to keep the economy going. In theory, Milei could apply to the International Monetary Fund for a loan, but the chances of success would not be high. Argentina is already the biggest borrower from the IMF and owes it $44bn (\u00a335bn). The IMF harbours doubts about whether dollarisation is feasible in the short term. The peso would require a substantial devaluation before dollarisation, and a weaker currency would push up prices and push up inflation still further. Third, even if a solution can be found to the technical problems associated with abandoning the peso, Milei\u2019s shock treatment could blow up in his face relatively quickly. Dollarisation is a one-way street \u2013 a policy gamble with no exit that could lock Argentina into an unsustainable course and crash land the economy. Mark Weisbrot, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research thinktank in Washington, said Argentina was paying a heavy price for the mistakes of a previous administration led by Mauricio Macri in the year after 2015. \u201cBut a crazed, economically suicidal approach would only make things worse \u2013 and as Argentina has experienced, things can get a lot worse,\u201d Weisbrot added. Milei\u2019s victory speech made no reference to dollarisation or abolishing the central bank, leading to speculation that he could row back on his radical plans. In addition to currency reform, these include deep cuts in welfare payments and closing more than a dozen ministries Nicol\u00e1s Sald\u00edas, a senior Latin American analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a research and analysis division of the Economist Group, said many of Milei\u2019s proposed reforms would be unpopular, especially with low-income Argentinians, and were likely to trigger social unrest by the country\u2019s powerful labour unions and social movements. \u201cAs a result, politics is likely to be highly polarised and divisive in the coming months, which is likely to result in a short honeymoon period for Milei.\u201d"

            "content": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s government is resembling a coalition of different rightwing factions before this week\u2019s autumn statement, rather than one united Conservative administration. Those listening to Jeremy Hunt in broadcast interviews on Sunday morning referring to the \u201cenormous challenge that we faced when we came in\u201d to office last year might have been forgiven for thinking he and the prime minister had taken power after a general election. But what went unsaid is that Britain is on its fifth Conservative prime minister in 13 years and that it was an ill-fated \u201cmini-budget\u201d under Liz Truss\u2019s premiership followed by a market meltdown and Tory rebellion that led to Sunak entering Downing Street. Kwasi Kwarteng, the architect of that disastrous mini-statement, now clearly feels that the time for wearing sackcloth and ashes is over as he pressed on Sunday for his successor at the Treasury to make significant tax cuts before the election, a drum that Truss and the libertarian right of the party have already been banging ever more loudly. Other Conservative factions had their own warnings for Wednesday. \u201cRed wall\u201d MPs seeking to increase their chances of survival in constituencies affected by the cost of living crisis are ready to hit the roof if the chancellor uses a fiscal windfall of up to \u00a320bn to deliver an inheritance tax cut for the rich, rather than prioritising ordinary people. Among the remains of the One Nation tradition in the party, meanwhile, the former cabinet minister Damian Green cautioned against tax cuts \u2013 except perhaps for those struggling \u2013 as he dismissed the briefings before the autumn statement. \u201cIf you read all the papers this morning, then practically every tax in the country is going to be cut on Wednesday. And I hate to spoil everyone\u2019s day, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he told Times Radio. While there will be some winners from the autumn statement, it is clear that Hunt will not be able to make everybody on the Conservative benches happy. There is already unease over other Tory faultlines that have emerged in recent weeks. While centrist Tories might share red wallers\u2019 support for tax cuts for lower-income voters, they have been unnerved by remarks from Lee Anderson, the Conservative deputy chairman, who said the government should \u201cignore the law\u201d after last week\u2019s supreme court defeat on its Rwanda plans and deport people there anyway. Green told Times Radio: \u201cWe were in danger of moving into territory where we appear to be saying that as a party we were to try and ignore the rule of law, and I do think that the absolute bedrock of a conservative attitude to life is that you want parliamentary democracy, individual freedom and opportunity and a respect for the rule of law.\u201d With the clock ticking on a general election, and Labour riding about 20 points ahead in the polls, the pressure for Hunt to announce or signal significant tax cuts is constrained not only by economic reality, but also by political divisions with his party. Add in rifts over basic questions about the rule of law and once again there is a recipe for Conservative internal combustion."

            "date": "2023-11-08T12:55:03Z",
            "content": "The governor of the Bank of England has called for greater cooperation on financial rule-making, warning that Brexit has affected the \u201copenness of the UK economy\u201d. In an apparent swipe at those calling for the UK to develop a separate rulebook for banking and insurance activities, Andrew Bailey said free trade needed strong regulation based on agreements with foreign watchdogs. Speaking in Dublin at a financial services conference organised by the Irish central bank, he argued against trade protectionism and regulatory fragmentation. \u201cAs a public official, I take no position on Brexit per se,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThat was a decision for the people of the UK.\u201d However, he added: \u201cIt has led to a reduction in the openness of the UK economy, though over time new trading relationships around the world should, and I expect will, be established. Of course, that requires a commitment to openness and free trade.\u201d Bailey said he hoped to see further close regulatory cooperation with his Irish counterparts to minimise fragmentation of financial markets after Brexit. The governor is known to be concerned that a series of panics in financial markets since the Covid-19 pandemic was declared in early 2020 have required strong central bank intervention. He said financial investments known as money market funds, which lubricate buying and selling in short-term securities, were especially vulnerable and needed to be overseen by more robust international agreements. In answer to questions about the health of the UK economy, Bailey said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that inflation would fall back to the Bank\u2019s 2% target within two years, but that interest rates, now at a 15-year high of 5.25%, would most likely need to stay elevated for longer to make that happen. \u201cPolicy is going to have to be restrictive for an extended period to see the second half out, which is where policy is going to have to do the work to bring inflation back to target, and I believe it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he told the Dublin conference. \u201cOur forecast suggests we will be back at the target in around the two-year horizon. I\u2019m optimistic. I think it will happen but I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve got to continue doing the work to make it happen.\u201d On Monday, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, said the central bank might wait until the middle of next year before cutting interest rates from their current 15-year high, adding that he was concerned about high borrowing costs plunging the economy into a recession. Pill said pricing in financial markets \u2013 which now points to a first rate cut to the bank rate in August 2024 \u2013 \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem totally unreasonable, at least to me\u201d. \u201cIt is at that point you might consider or reassess, if nothing new has happened, where we are going to have to be,\u201d Pill said during an online presentation organised by the Bank. \u201cBut, of course, it is very unlikely that nothing will change over that nine-month period.\u201d At a meeting last week, Bank policymakers held interest rates at 5.25% and stated that it was not thinking about cutting the cost of borrowing anytime soon as it continued to bear down on rising prices. Inflation stood at 6.7% in September, lower than a peak of 11.1% in October 2022 but still more than three times its 2% target."

            "content": "Fast fashion giant Shein has reportedly lodged confidential paperwork with US securities regulators, informing them of an intention to go public in the US. The listing would likely be the largest initial public offering (IPO) in years. Shein is one of the global leaders of fast fashion e-commerce, harnessing a network of small-shipment manufacturers in China, and a massive online advertising presence. JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have reportedly been hired as underwriters for the move, according to unnamed sources cited by the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, New York Times and Reuters. The news of the filing follows reports and rumours from at least the middle of last year that the company intended to go public in the US in 2024. Shein, a mass market online clothing retailer, was founded in China by entrepreneur Chris Xu, but is now headquartered in Singapore. Within a decade it reached a valuation of $100bn at an April 2022 fundraising round, making it the third most valuable start-up in the world. By May this year the company\u2019s value had dropped to a little more than $60bn but if it goes ahead with the IPO it is still expected to become the most valuable China-founded company to go public in the US since ride-hailing giant Didi Global\u2019s debut in 2021 at $68bn valuation. The company has reportedly told investors it hopes to receive a valuation of $80-90bn, Bloomberg reported last month. In recent years Shein has expanded manufacturing into Brazil and Turkey, and distribution processes into the US, Europe and Canada. However, the company has come under criticism for things such as allegedly poor working conditions in factories, alleged copyright infringement on independent artists\u2019 designs, along with criticism of fast fashion\u2019s impact on the environment. Shein has denied the accusations. Earlier this year Shein was accused, alongside its rival Temu, by a US house committee report of \u201cbuilding empires\u201d by using legislative loopholes to \u201cdodge US import taxes and sanctions checks\u201d.

Brilliant \u2013 Love Is War (1986) Brilliant\u2019s album Kiss the Lips of Life was a well-reviewed commercial flop. Love Is War \u2013 a more sophisticated, US soul-inspired production style than that which made SAW famous \u2013 still sounds great, but it buttered no parsnips with the pragmatic Pete Waterman. \u201cFuck that for critical acclaim, you can\u2019t pay the fucking rent with that,\u201d he later reflected. 16. Morgan McVey \u2013 Looking Good Diving with the Wild Bunch (1987) One of the weirder moments in SAW\u2019s catalogue: on the B-side of Morgan McVey\u2019s solitary flop single was a version featuring a rap by band member Cameron McVey\u2019s future wife Neneh Cherry. A year later, Cherry polished it up and re-recorded it as Buffalo Stance, thus affording SAW a hand in one of the coolest singles of the 80s. 15. Mandy Smith \u2013 I Just Can\u2019t Wait (The Cool and Breezy Jazz Version) (1987) The SAW track that unexpectedly became incredibly hip. Lurking on the second release of Smith\u2019s unsuccessful debut single was this remix that found favour as a Balearic anthem. It expunges almost all of Smith\u2019s vocal in favour of an acoustic guitar solo, and sounds suitably sun-drenched and blissful. 14. Lonnie Gordon \u2013 Happenin\u2019 All Over Again (1990) You could occasionally tell that Waterman had cut his teeth as a DJ in the 70s when the sound of northern soul seeped into SAW\u2019s productions. It\u2019s there on Happenin\u2019 All Over Again: you can imagine the glorious chorus transplanted from its chattering electronic setting and booming around a talcum powder-covered dancefloor. 13. Kylie Minogue \u2013 Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi (1987) The pick of Kylie\u2019s initial flush of SAW-produced singles, Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi was the first sign that the trio realised they had something special on their hands and stepped back from their blaring one-size-fits-all approach: a succession of earworm melodies that feels relatively subtle by their standards in the late 80s. 12. Hazell Dean \u2013 Who\u2019s Leaving Who (1984) Hazell Dean was SAW\u2019s breakthrough star, the author of a string of hits that melded the hi-NRG sound of mid-80s gay clubs with a keen pop sensibility. Who\u2019s Leaving Who is the best of the lot, boasting a melody that\u2019s not just Abba-influenced, but Abba standard: the bridge and chorus are fantastic. 11. Bananarama \u2013 I Heard a Rumour (1987) A Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a song made of repurposed samples \u2013 including a synth part from an old Samantha Fox track and a substantial chunk of a 1986 Italian hit by Michael Fortunati (\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Waterman had to do a deal,\u201d noted mix engineer Phil Hammond) \u2013 but the end result works: it pays to recycle. 10. Divine \u2013 You Think You\u2019re a Man (1984) From its Waterman-voiced Two Tribes parody intro to Divine\u2019s fabulously tone-deaf vocal snarl to its high camp lyric \u2013 \u201cThen walk away! From the greatest lover you have ever known!\u201d \u2013 You Think You\u2019re a Man is completely preposterous and entirely irresistible: there\u2019s something almost punk about how little it seems to care. 9. Princess \u2013 Say I\u2019m Your Number One (1985) Their bank managers would presumably disagree, but it was a shame SAW wound up sticking so doggedly to one musical blueprint. They could clearly do more than mass produce music to a template, as demonstrated by Say I\u2019m Your Number One: mid-tempo electro pop-soul, heavily influenced by the Brooklyn Bronx &amp; Queens Band. 8. Donna Summer \u2013 This Time I Know It\u2019s for Real (1989) SAW liked to paint themselves as iconoclasts, unimpressed by music history, but they clearly rolled out the red carpet when the queen of disco paid a visit to their Hit Factory studio: This Time I Know It\u2019s for Real is gleaming dance-pop with a nailed-on euphoric chorus. 7. Kylie Minogue \u2013 What Do I Have to Do? (1990) Most SAW artists who expressed a desire to do something different were shown the door, but fearful of losing key asset Kylie Minogue, the trio rose to the challenge, coming up with better songs and a hipper, less generic production style: house-fuelled, monster-chorused, What Do I Have to Do? sparkles. 6. Mel &amp; Kim \u2013 Respectable (1987) Respectable is all about the hook, but what a hook it is: the sampled vocals, the lurching, seasick chords beneath. Incredibly, the record company thought it was too gimmicky and demanded its removal, grist to SAW\u2019s us-against-the-world attitude enshrined in Respectable\u2019s lyrics: \u201cLike us, hate us, but you\u2019ll never change us.\u201d 5. Bananarama \u2013 Love in the First Degree (1987) You get the feeling SAW weren\u2019t used to artists voicing their opinions or contributing to songwriting, but no matter: however fraught its genesis, Love in the First Degree was magnificent, a song that earned the public approval of Motown boss Berry Gordy. 4. Kylie Minogue \u2013 Better the Devil You Know (1990) The song that launched a reinvented Kylie \u2013 more mature and sophisticated, less bubble gum-flavoured \u2013 was a luxurious disco homage at odds with SAW\u2019s reputation for a bargain basement, factory-line approach to production. The strings on the 12in version are particularly luscious, the lyrics slightly at odds with the utterly jubilant music. 3. Mel &amp; Kim \u2013 Showing Out (Get Fresh at the Weekend) (1986) Experimental is not an adjective that is often used when it comes to SAW\u2019s work, but 37 years on, Showing Out sounds appealingly odd. A pop-facing response to early house music, minimal and slightly disjointed, it\u2019s more a series of hooks strung together than a song, but it really works. 2. Rick Astley \u2013 Never Gonna Give You Up (1987) They had zero quality control, but at their best, SAW were far better songwriters than their detractors gave them credit for. If part of Never Gonna Give You Up\u2019s longevity is down to Rick Astley\u2019s self-deprecating charm and likability, it\u2019s also because it\u2019s a brilliantly written song. 1. Dead or Alive \u2013 You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) (1984) SAW began their career in the shadow of Trevor Horn\u2019s epic Frankie Goes to Hollywood productions, offering a tinpot Relax pastiche on their first single, The Upstroke by Agents Aren\u2019t Aeroplanes, and parodying Two Tribes on Divine\u2019s You Think You\u2019re a Man. But on You Spin Me Round, they matched Horn\u2019s work. Less melodically sugary than their previous hi-NRG influenced tracks, it is a breathlessly exciting single. It kicks straight in; the rhythm track is relentless, Pete Burns\u2019 imperious vocal growls and soars, and the chorus permanently lodges in your brain on first hearing. It\u2019s commercial pop music that captures a small-hours dancefloor\u2019s hedonism and hysteria."

            "date": "2023-11-25T06:00:42Z",
            "content": "A good stock needs good vegetables, which are poached in their own juices until very tender, then strained. It has always struck me as a huge waste to compost the spent veg, though, so I always try to find a way to eat them. Mashed up with olive oil or butter, say, they make a lovely side dish, or turn them into curries, soups and stews. Here, I use them up in a comforting pie, fortified with beans for bulk, texture and flavour. Leftover stock veg and bean pot pie Although I\u2019m an omnivore, I like to cook plant-based food when it makes sense. A plant-rich diet is widely accepted as one of the most healthy, and can also be more economical, especially when you practice root-to-fruit eating by using up every last morsel. In this recipe, for instance, flaxseeds and aquafaba take the place of eggs and milk, and are much cheaper. This rather humble pie is food at its most thrifty and nutritious, a filling and economical weekday meal that is also comforting, especially as the cold nights draw in. I try to avoid ultra-processed foods whenever I can, and that includes pastry, not least because it\u2019s hard to find a store-bought one that isn\u2019t; it\u2019s even harder to find a vegan pastry that doesn\u2019t include ultra-processed foods such as plant-based dairy alternatives. But vegan pastry can be tough to get right. However, I\u2019ve improved the texture of mne by adding flaxseeds, heritage grains and buckwheat flour. Heritage grains tend to be lower in gluten and buckwheat is gluten-free, which helps to shorten the pastry, too. Leftover aquafaba works as a great glazing agent instead of milk or eggs. Serves 4 For the filling 40g extra-virgin olive oil 50g wholemeal flour 1 tsp English mustard \u00bc tsp grated nutmeg 100g silken tofu 250ml vegetable stock 500g leftover cooked stock vegetables \u2013 eg, leeks, carrot, celery, onions 2 x 400g tins cooked white beans, such as cannellini or butter beans, drained \u2013 keep the aquafaba for glazing the pie (500g net weight) Salt and black pepper For the vegan pastry 30g ground flaxseeds 50ml aquafaba, plus extra to glaze 140g wholemeal flour \u2013 eg, khorasan, spelt, wheat 30g buckwheat flour, or 30g extra wholemeal flour 30ml extra-virgin olive oil \u00bd tsp sea salt First make the filling. Put the oil in a saucepan on a medium heat, then stir in the wholemeal flour and cook, stirring, for a minute. Add the mustard, nutmeg and tofu, then whisk in the stock a little at a time, until creamy (use an immersion blender to help things along, if need be). Cut the leftover cooked stock vegetables into large dice, add them to the pan, then stir in the white beans and season to taste. To make the pastry, mix the ground flaxseeds with the aquafaba (or water) and leave for a minute. Stir in all the flour and oil, then add the salt. Knead into a ball, cover with a bowl and leave for 30 minutes. Fill a large deep pie dish (or several individual pie dishes) with the bean mixture. Roll out the pastry to a 5-10mm-thick oval the size of the pie dish(es), lay this on top and seal the edges with a fork. Brush with aquafaba and cut two small holes in the top, to let out steam. Bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 30 minutes, or until golden."

            "title": "UK competition watchdog to investigate baby formula market",
            "date": "2023-11-29T14:55:20Z",
            "content": "The competition watchdog is launching an investigation into the baby formula market after finding manufacturers raised prices by 25% in two years and managed to increase profit margins during the cost of living crisis. There are just two dominant companies \u2013 Danone and Nestl\u00e9 \u2013 accounting for 85% of sales. The Competition and Markets Authority said it was concerned there was too little choice in the market, with a very limited number of own-label products, and that very few parents were switching to cheaper alternatives where available. If families did shop around, they could make savings of more than \u00a3500 in the first year of a child\u2019s life, the CMA found. The investigation was announced as the watchdog published its findings on the inflation in the grocery sector. The CMA concluded that over the past two years, about three-quarters of companies making popular brands in categories including baked beans, mayonnaise, pet food and baby milk had put up prices faster than their costs rose, allowing them to maintain big profit margins. The findings will increase accusations that brands have made the cost of living crisis worse by raising prices unnecessarily to protect profit, a phenomenon known as \u201cgreedflation\u201d. Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: \u201cFood price inflation has put huge strain on household budgets, so it is vital competition issues aren\u2019t adding to the problem. While in most cases the leading brands have raised prices more than their own cost increases, own-label products are generally providing cheaper alternatives.\u201d While shoppers tend to seek out cheaper options, parents are reluctant to change brands when it comes to formula. \u201cUnlike other products examined, there is little evidence of parents switching to cheaper branded options as prices have risen and very limited availability of own-brand alternatives,\u201d Cardell said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that parents may not always have the right information to make informed choices and that suppliers may not have strong incentives to offer infant formula at competitive prices. We will investigate this further and consider whether changes to regulations are necessary to ensure parents can get the best deal possible.\u201d Danone, which makes the Cow &amp; Gate and Aptamil brands, has a 71% share of the UK baby formula market, while Nestl\u00e9, which owns SMA and Little Steps, has a 14% share. Kendamil, the only British maker of baby milk products, has a 9% share. HiPP is the fourth biggest player in the market, with a 5% share. The CMA said the main difference between brands was cost, because formula makers have to follow strict government rules on ingredients. Of the 10 product categories it examined in depth, the CMA said it had the biggest concerns over baby milk. It will publish its findings on the sector next year. A spokesperson for Danone UK &amp; Ireland said the company\u2019s experience of the baby formula market was that it was competitive. They added: \u201cWe recognise the challenges faced by parents due to inflation. During this difficult period, we have worked very hard to absorb the significant cost increases we have faced, make savings, and minimise any price increases. We will also continue to engage with the CMA over the coming months.\u201d Nestl\u00e9 said it welcomed the CMA review and that it was open to \u201call constructive dialogue to help parents in the most effective way possible\u201d, adding that it wanted to \u201ckeep products affordable and accessible for parents while still paying fair prices to our suppliers, including farmers\u201d. HiPP and Kendamil were contacted for comment but did not immediately respond. Food price inflation continues to run at historically high levels despite falling to 10.1% in October, well above the overall inflation rate of 4.6%, with the consumer group Which? estimating that supermarket prices have increased by more than a quarter over the last two years. The watchdog\u2019s latest release, like its initial investigation into retail competition in the groceries sector published in July, found that most of the food inflation since early 2021 had been caused largely by passing rising input costs on to consumers and that overall profit margins had fallen across most branded manufacturers since 2021. However, it identified several product lines where price rises of branded goods had outstripped cost increases. Which? said cash-strapped consumers would be shocked to learn of the profit-increasing tactics used by the big brands, and raised concerns that shoppers reliant on smaller-sized shops and convenience stores did not have the choice of budget-priced options. \u201cThis will be shocking for many people who have been struggling to deal with food price inflation,\u201d said Sue Davies, the head of food policy at Which?. \u201cThe evidence reinforces concerns that shoppers relying on convenience store branches of the big supermarkets, which rarely stock the cheapest own-brand ranges, may struggle to find more affordable food.\u201d The CMA said it also intended to launch an investigation into loyalty scheme pricing in January, where supermarkets only offer deals to customers who sign up to their scheme. \u201cWe have seen an increase in the use of loyalty scheme pricing by supermarkets, which means that price promotions are only available to people who sign up for loyalty cards,\u201d Cardell said. \u201cThis raises a number of questions about the impact of loyalty scheme pricing on consumers and competition.\u201d"

            "content": "Britain\u2019s labour market has so far emerged largely unscathed from the slowdown in the economy, the latest official figures show. The latest health check from the Office for National Statistics found the jobless rate broadly unchanged, a small fall in employment and the strongest rise in pay adjusted for inflation in two years, as the pace of prices rises comes down. The ONS said the UK\u2019s unemployment rate in the three months to September had remained steady at 4.2% while the employment rate over the same period had dropped by 0.1 points to 75.7%. The estimate of payrolled employees in the UK for October 2023 increased by 33,000 on an upwardly revised September 2023 figure, to 30.2 million, the ONS said. A fresh fall in the number of job vacancies provided some evidence of labour market weakness over the summer, with the number of posts on offer dropping by 58,000 in the three months to October. Darren Morgan, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cOur labour market figures show a largely unchanged picture, with the proportions of people who are employed, unemployed or who are neither working nor looking for a job all little changed on the previous quarter. \u201cThe number of job vacancies fell for the 16th straight month. Nevertheless, vacancies still remain well above their pre-pandemic levels. With inflation easing in the latest quarter, real pay is now growing at its fastest rate for two years.\u201d The ONS said annual growth in regular pay \u2013 which excludes bonuses \u2013 was 7.7% in July to September 2023, down from 7.9% in the three months to August, but was still among the highest annual growth rates since modern records began in 2001. Annual growth in average total pay (including bonuses) was 7.9% in the quarter ending in September, down from 8.2% in the three months to August. In real terms \u2013 adjusted for inflation using the consumer prices index, annual growth for total pay rose on the year by 1.1%, and regular pay rose on the year by 1%, the ONS said. Real pay has picked up as inflation has started to come down. Figures published by the ONS tomorrow are expected to show a sharp slowdown in the headline rate of inflation, to 4.8% in October from 6.7% in September. The ONS has admitted to having problems collecting data for its flagship labour force survey but Tuesday\u2019s figures are the last guide to the state of the jobs market before next week\u2019s autumn statement. The chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cIt\u2019s heartening to see inflation falling and real wages growing, keeping more money in people\u2019s pockets. Building on the labour market reforms in spring, the autumn statement will set out my plans to get people back into work and deliver growth for the UK.\u201d Mel Stride, the secretary of state for work and pensions, said: \u201cWe are leaving no stone unturned to help people into work, with a record number of employees on payrolls \u2013 up nearly 400,000 in the last year alone with 3.9 million more people in work than in 2010.\u201d Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures are no real comfort for workers. Years of pay freezes and real terms pay cuts have meant that workers in Britain are worse off. That is why Unite will continue to fight for jobs, pay and conditions.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-30T12:36:07Z",
            "content": "Inflation across the eurozone fell by more than expected in November amid growing concerns about the strength of national economies after the sharpest rise in borrowing costs since the creation of the single currency. Consumer prices across the 20-country bloc increased at an annual rate of 2.4%, down from 2.9% in October, according to figures from the EU statistical agency Eurostat. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a higher reading of 2.7% for the month. Falling energy prices and weaker increases in the cost of buying food, alcohol and tobacco dragged down the headline rate to within striking distance of the European Central Bank\u2019s 2% inflation target, increasing speculation about the timing of interest rate cuts. In its flash estimate for November, Eurostat figures showed a monthly increase in consumer prices in only two eurozone countries \u2013 Austria and Slovakia \u2013 amid easing pressure on living standards across the bloc. Meanwhile, there are concerns about economic growth across the eurozone weakening further as households and businesses come under pressure from high living costs and elevated interest rates. Updated figures for the French economy on Thursday showed gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the three months to September \u2013 below the 0.1% rise first estimated, and down from a 0.6% expansion in the second quarter. Germany is expected to be the worst-performing developed country this year, according to forecasts released this week by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Europe\u2019s largest economy is on track to shrink by 0.1%, said the OECD. The latest figures show inflation fell to 2.3% in Germany in November, down from an annual rate of 3% in October, well below market expectations after a sharp fall in energy prices. French inflation fell from 4.5% to 3.8%, while in Italy the rate dropped to 0.7% from 1.8% a month earlier. The snapshot stands in stark contrast to the UK, where the latest available figures show inflation fell to 4.6% in October, sticking at the highest rate in the G7 group of advanced economies. Economists said cooling inflation and sluggish economic growth across the eurozone could force the ECB to start cutting interest rates again. Highlighting the risks to national economies from a sustained higher cost of borrowing, Fabio Panetta, the new governor of the Bank of Italy, warned that the ECB must not cause \u201cunnecessary damage\u201d to the economy and financial stability. A member of the ECB\u2019s governing council, Panetta predicted that the eurozone economy would remain weak into the new year. \u201cWe need to avoid unnecessary damage to economic activity and risks to financial stability, which would ultimately jeopardise price stability,\u201d he said. The ECB left its key deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits, at 4% in October, having lifted borrowing costs from -0.5% four years ago in response to the inflation shock after the Covid pandemic and the surge in energy prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, said now was \u201cnot the time to start declaring victory\u201d as the risk of persistent inflationary pressures remained. The central bank expects inflation will return to above 3% next year, before hitting its 2% target in late 2025, partly due to resilience in wage growth. Figures on Thursday showed unemployment across the eurozone held steady at a record-low 6.5%, despite the slowdown in economic growth, with joblessness levels in France, Germany and Spain unchanged. However, investors bet the ECB could become the first major central bank to cut interest rates next year amid a worsening growth slowdown, pushing the euro down by about 0.5% against the US dollar on global currency markets to trade at about $1.09. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said it had become \u201cincreasingly untenable\u201d for the ECB to claim it was not even thinking about interest rate cuts. \u201cWe are now pencilling in a first cut for next June, rather than September,\u201d he said. \u201cWith headline and core inflation likely to trend down in the new year it will hard for the ECB to ignore the extent to which the inflationary tide is turning.\u201d"

            "content": "The Bank of England\u2019s reliance on \u201cinadequate\u201d forecasting models and a lack of intellectual diversity within its most senior ranks contributed to inflation sticking at among the highest levels in decades, a Lords report has found. In a report critical of Threadneedle Street, the powerful Lords economic affairs committee said the central bank had made \u201cerrors\u201d in its handling of the inflation shock triggered after the Covid pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. While saying that all major central banks had incorrectly expected the toughest inflationary period in four decades to be \u201ctransitory\u201d, it warned that mistakes at the Bank had fuelled a \u201cdramatic\u201d fall in public confidence. Highlighting incorrect forecasts made in 2021 for inflation to cool, it said possible reasons included a \u201cperceived lack of intellectual diversity\u201d at the central bank. It also said a steady expansion in the Bank\u2019s remit to include a wider range of priorities \u2013 including economic growth and responding to the climate crisis \u2013 had risked jeopardising its ability to meet its primary objectives of managing inflation and financial stability. \u201cLooking at the most recent period it\u2019s important to stress in our mind that all central banks have made errors in the handling of inflation and seeing it as transitory; the Bank of England was not alone,\u201d said George Bridges, the chair of the committee. \u201cWhile it is true that the Bank wasn\u2019t alone, that doesn\u2019t mean to say there aren\u2019t lessons to learn.\u201d The Bank started increasing interest rates in December 2021 as the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate surged to more than 5% after the easing of pandemic restrictions. At the time, it expected inflation to fall back as global supply bottlenecks eased, while the end of the government\u2019s furlough scheme complicated its decision. The central bank has argued it was difficult to forecast Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine. Energy prices were rising before the war, but then surged to among the highest levels on record after the February 2022 invasion, driving UK inflation to peak at a 41-year high of 11.1% by October 2022. The Bank has since raised interest rates 14 times in succession, with inflation falling back to 4.6%. The central bank has appointed Ben Bernanke, the former chair of the US Federal Reserve, to review its forecasting, after facing heavy criticism from MPs over its forecasting record. Calling for reforms to help manage future inflation shocks, the Lords report said the government should \u201cprune\u201d the Bank\u2019s remit to reduce the number of issues it is focused on, while introducing a review of its responsibilities every five years. A spokesperson for the Bank of England said: \u201cWe\u2019d like to thank the Lords [economic affairs committee] for this report and will be giving the recommendations careful consideration. We\u2019ll respond formally in due course.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-14T18:13:10Z",
            "content": "The annual pace of price rises is expected to have slowed sharply when the latest official figure for October is released on Wednesday, easing fears that the Bank of England could increase interest rates next month. City economists polled by Reuters have signalled that inflation as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) will fall almost two percentage points to 4.8% from September\u2019s 6.7% reading. The decline does not mean prices are falling, just that they are rising less rapidly, and would remain well above the central bank\u2019s 2% target, but would be a significant signal to Bank rate-setters that prices are on course to come down over the next year without the need for further increases in the cost of borrowing. At the heart of the decline is a 23% cut in the UK energy price cap on the typical annual gas and electricity bill from \u00a32,500 last October to \u00a31,923 the same month this year. Food price inflation has dropped to single digits for the first time in a year and a half, according to industry figures, and is also expected to help reduce the headline rate. Grocery price inflation slowed to 9.7% in the four weeks to 29 October, according to the data company Kantar, after almost reaching 20% earlier this year. The forecast drop will be welcomed by Rishi Sunak, helping the prime minister fulfil one of five pledges he set at the start of the year \u2013 that of halving inflation by the end of 2023, to 5.3% or lower, from the 10.7% average in the last quarter of 2022. The expected tumble in the UK CPI comes after France, Germany and the US reported steep falls in inflation in October, easing fears that high levels of inflation across the industrialised world that followed the pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine will persist into 2024. US inflation fell on Tuesday to 3.2% from 3.7% in September, beating expectations of a 3.3% increase. Global stock and bond markets continued a recent recovery as analysts indicated that the improved situation would persuade the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates at its next meeting. Most of the UK\u2019s competitors have lower inflation. Inflation across the eurozone was 2.9% in October with France at 4% and Germany at 3.8%. US core inflation, which strips out food and energy, and is a much-watched measure of pressure from rising prices, fell to 4%, the lowest since September 2021. In the UK, core inflation is only expected to fall to 5.8% from 6.1% in September, following strong prices rises by large sections of the services sector. Last month the Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% and warned that 14 consecutive increases since 2021 had pushed the economy to the edge of recession. Oxford Economics, a consultancy, said in a global overview of inflation trends that the UK was already close to recession and inflation would continue to fall over the next few months, a trend that would usually prompt the central bank to cut interest rates. However, shortages of skilled labour would push up wages, limiting the ability of many firms to cut prices without hitting their profits. Rob Morgan, chief investment Analyst at the stockbroker Charles Stanley, said: \u201cWage growth is one of the key considerations for the Bank of England when it comes to setting interest rates \u2026 The persistence of pay growth will cause the Bank some concern that the fires of inflation won\u2019t be easily quelled and that interest rates will have to remain higher for longer.\u201d"

            "content": "The UK\u2019s annual inflation rate fell sharply to 4.6% in October on the back of cheaper gas and electricity, its lowest level for two years. Marking the steepest single month decline in the consumer prices index (CPI) since 1992, the fall from 6.7% in September also beat the 4.8% figure predicted by a poll of economists for Reuters. The decline does not mean prices are going down, only that they are rising less rapidly. Nevertheless, the reading is expected to ease fears that the Bank of England will increase interest rates again this year, despite being more than twice its 2% target. It also means Rishi Sunak has achieved his target set in January of halving inflation by the end of the year from the 10.7% average in the last quarter of 2022. The prime minister said: \u201cIn January I made halving inflation this year my top priority \u2026 Today, we have delivered on that pledge.\u201d Labour said the government should resist the urge to pop champagne corks after two years of rocketing prices that have left \u201cworking people worse off with higher mortgage bills, prices still rising in the shops and inflation twice as high as the Bank of England\u2019s target\u201d. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the price of food was about 30% higher than it was in October 2021. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said that while the figures suggested the UK had turned the corner in its battle against soaring inflation, \u201cthis owes more to the downward pressure on prices from falling energy costs and rising interest rates than any government action\u201d. Thiru added: \u201cAlthough subsequent declines will be more modest, the drag on demand from a softening jobs market and high interest rates may mean that inflation falls back to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target more quickly than they currently expect. This fall in inflation seals the deal on a December interest rate hold.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the government could take some credit after it \u201ctook some very difficult decisions to control borrowing and debt\u201d to limit spending in the economy and the pressure on prices. His comments appeared to signal that the autumn statement next month would be restrained in its spending commitments to maintain the trend for inflation to fall. Amid reports that the chancellor could try to save up to \u00a31bn by switching to using October\u2019s far lower inflation reading for next April\u2019s working age benefits uprating, rather than the usual September figure, charities said such a move would be \u201cindefensible\u201d and entail a \u201cbig cut\u201d for struggling families. Separate figures from the ONS showed UK house prices fell 0.1% in the year to September \u2013 the first annual drop in 11 years. The average house sale value, including cash buyers, fell to \u00a3291,385, down from \u00a3292,882 in August. Meanwhile, private tenants suffered a 6.1% average increase in rent in the 12 months to October, the largest annual percentage change since ONS records began in January 2016. At the heart of October\u2019s decline in CPI was the 23% year-on-year cut in the energy price cap for the typical annual gas and electricity bill, from \u00a32,500 last October to \u00a31,923 the same month this year. Food price inflation was the lowest since 2021 after a drop in the annual rate of increase to 10.1% in October, down from 12.2% in September and a recent high of 19.2% in March 2023 \u2013 the highest annual rate for more than 45 years. Restaurant and hotel prices, which have played a large part in driving inflation over the past year, remained the same between September and October, compared with a rise of 1% between the same two months a year ago. Shares rose on markets after the larger than expected fall in UK CPI. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares in London increased by almost 1% to 7,502, reinforcing bets by investors that the Bank of England is likely to begin cutting interest rates earlier than previously expected, and possibly as early as May 2024. The measure for core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy and food, also dropped by more than analysts expected but remained high. The ONS said it slid from 6.1% to 5.7%, slightly below the 5.8% forecast by City economists and the Bank of England. A comparison with other leading economies showed that UK inflation remained one of the highest. In the US, the CPI declined from 3.7% to 3.2% in October, while in France it fell to 4.5% and Germany to 3%."

            "date": "2023-11-07T14:00:43Z",
            "content": "In 2015, Dereck and Diti Hales left their corporate jobs to open Bad Shepherd Brewing in Cheltenham, in south-east Melbourne \u2013 a spacious venue with craft beers on tap, a menu of American-style barbecue and trivia on Thursdays. \u201cWe\u2019re a small business,\u201d Dereck says. \u201cThis is our life savings. This is our dream.\u201d Business was going well. But Diti says what was a good growth story for their business unexpectedly soured when the economic environment changed. \u201cCovid hit right when we were a medium-sized business ready to grow,\u201d Diti says. The initial cause of their trouble was a pandemic-era debt that became hard to service when, even after lockdowns lifted, diners were still hesitant to head out. Visits to the brewpub did not rebound to pre-Covid numbers. As the months wore on, things only became harder as production costs grew and interest rates rose, soaking up any extra cash people had for dining out. In October, Dereck and Diti called in the administrator to help them get a handle on the situation \u2013 and they weren\u2019t the only ones. Across the country craft brewers found themselves teetering on the edge after enjoying years of growth. In March, Brisbane\u2019s Parched Brewery entered voluntary administration while, in April, Sydney-based Tribe Brewing avoided liquidation when it was bought out by a founder of Kathmandu. Running With Thieves in Western Australia announced it was also going into voluntary administration in August. Ballistic Beer Co went into administration in January before it was bought out by fellow Queensland craft brewer Catchment Brewing in March, which traded the company out of trouble. Catchment\u2019s Matt Newberry says it is a tough time for the industry as \u201call mid-tier brewers are struggling\u201d. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning \u201cThe last six months have bitten a lot of people, particularly smaller breweries that are mum and dad operators who had mortgaged their house and don\u2019t have access to shareholders,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole range of things that are fighting against you all the time, you just got to keep pushing forward.\u201d Kylie Lethbridge, head of the Independent Brewers Association, says there are several factors behind craft brewers\u2019 recent struggles but the \u201ccatalyst\u201d for many were external decisions made during the pandemic. \u201cOne of the things we were allowed to do, because the federal government provided some support during the pandemic, was delays to payment of excise tax,\u201d she says. \u201cThen, a couple years in, the ATO, in all their wisdom, decided everything was fine and a brewery could start to pay that back, without taking into consideration any of the other external factors of where the industry was at or its input costs.\u201d From that point, Lethbridge says, Australia\u2019s craft brewers were hit with one issue after another and, as a result, her organisation\u2019s 600-strong membership has been getting squeezed. Of 212 IBA-associated brewers who responded to a recent membership survey, 91% said they had been extremely affected by the current economic climate and 66% said their business may not survive the downturn. IBISWorld analyst Matthew Reeves agrees with the bleak assessment and says craft brewers are \u201cfacing a number of headwinds at the moment\u201d. But looking into the future he expects conditions to ease as \u201cinflationary pressure cools\u201d. \u201cThis should help support a recovery in demand for craft beer, with the number of breweries expected to rise over the next five years,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, craft brewers will have to contend with declining per capita alcohol consumption, increasing their range of low and no-alcohol beers.\u201d Peter Philip of Sydney\u2019s Wayward Brewing says that, after years of growth, craft brewers are now experiencing a recession. In response, Wayward has released a \u201cRecession Ale\u201d \u2013 with a breakdown of production costs on the back of the tin \u2013 to raise customer awareness about how much it costs to make a can of beer. \u201cA third of a can of beer is consumed in tax and what\u2019s left at the end of the day when they\u2019ve paid all their input costs is virtually nothing and that\u2019s why breweries, very sadly, are struggling,\u201d Philip says. Partly in response to this operating environment, Wayward has adopted a novel strategy by partnering with Batch Brewing to create a beer cooperative. In October, the Sydney-based brewers founded the Local Drinks Cooperative, which acts similarly to dairy cooperatives. Philip says he had the idea while travelling in Europe. There, wine co-ops allowed individual winemakers to pool resources to sell and market their products, while retaining control of their brands. \u201cThe breweries are the shareholders in the co-op, the co-op doesn\u2019t own the breweries, the breweries own the co-ops,\u201d he says. \u201cTherefore, we\u2019re all in this together and we\u2019re all motivated to make the co-op work.\u201d If Australia\u2019s craft brewers are going through a period of consolidation and reorganisation, for Dereck and Diti Hales at least, business has recovered. As of November they are no longer in administration. \u201cFor us it\u2019s about investing in our community,\u201d Diti says. \u201cOur future is tied to the south side of Melbourne and Bayside community. \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-29T10:08:43Z",
            "content": "Continued tough action by central banks to tackle stubborn inflation risks tipping Britain and other developed countries into recession next year, the west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has warned. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the chances of policymakers getting it wrong were \u201cpretty high\u201d and posed a threat to its central \u201csoft landing\u201d forecast for the global economy. The Paris-based OECD \u2013 which has 38 rich country members \u2013 said its best estimate is that the UK would suffer a second year of sluggish growth in 2024, and foresaw little prospect of a pre-election surge in activity. In its half-yearly economic outlook, the OECD said UK growth would remain \u201cstable but low\u201d, with national output rising by 0.5% in 2023 and by 0.7% in 2024. Six months ago, it was predicting expansion of 0.3% this year and 1% next. Despite speculation that the recent fall in inflation would bring forward cuts in interest rates from the Bank of England to next spring, the OECD said it expected official borrowing costs to remain unchanged at 5.25% for the whole of 2024. Meanwhile, the phasing out of energy subsidies and the impact of freezing tax allowances and thresholds would mean the Treasury sucking 2% of gross domestic product \u2013 about \u00a350bn \u2013 out of the economy. Clare Lombardelli, the thinktank\u2019s chief economist, said a soft landing for advanced economies was far from guaranteed, adding: \u201cThe risks around it are pretty high.\u201d Lombardelli said the OECD had not calibrated the chances of a hard landing but added: \u201cThe risks of getting policy wrong are higher than they have been. It is unclear how much of the past tightening has fed through and how much is yet to come.\u201d Its report said Germany would be the worst-performing developed country this year, with Europe\u2019s biggest economy contracting by 0.1% before recovering to post 0.6% growth in 2024. Overall, the 20-nation eurozone is expected to expand by 0.6% this year, against 2.4% in the US. The OECD nations as a whole are forecast to grow by 1.7% in 2023 and by 1.4% in 2024. The world economy \u2013 boosted by growth in the non-members India and China \u2013 is predicted to expand by 2.9% in 2023 and 3% in 2024. Lombardelli said: \u201cIn the United States, the economy is demonstrating more strength than expected, and there is a risk that inflation proves to be persistent. In the euro area, the full impact of tighter monetary policy is still to appear and activity may be hit more strongly than we expect.\u201d The OECD expressed concern that the Israel-Hamas war could spill over into a wider regional conflict. \u201cHeightened geopolitical tensions due to the conflict following the terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas are a key near-term concern, particularly if the conflict were to broaden,\u201d the economic outlook said. \u201cThis could result in significant disruptions to energy markets and major trade routes, and additional risk repricing in financial markets, that would slow growth and add to inflation.\u201d Lombardelli said: \u201cInflation is easing but growth is slowing. The tightening of monetary policy needed to tackle inflation is taking effect. Despite stronger-than-expected GDP growth in 2023, tightening financial conditions weak trade and subdued confidence are taking a toll. Housing markets and bank-dependent economies, particularly in Europe, are feeling the impact. \u201cIn summary, the global economy is grappling with inflation, slowing growth, and mounting fiscal pressures. Policymakers must prioritise macroeconomic stability, structural reforms, smart fiscal policies and international cooperation to foster sustainable and inclusive growth.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-17T10:05:12Z",
            "content": "Retailers in Great Britain suffered a slump in sales in October as the impact of high borrowing costs and rising prices signalled a high street recession in the run-up to Christmas. Bad weather also played a part in a 2.7% year-on-year fall in retail sales that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said hit clothing and household goods stores the hardest. Emphasising the severity of the downturn, the ONS said the month-on-month drop in October was 0.3%, much lower than the 0.3% rise economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Figures for September were revised down to show sales dropped by 1.1% on the month, a sharper fall than the 0.9% first estimated. Retail sales volumes in October were at their lowest level since February 2021, during the Covid-19 pandemic, when there were \u201cwidespread and extensive restrictions to non-essential retail in England, Scotland and Wales\u201d, the ONS said. Several shop chains have warned of a difficult year ahead, with the luxury clothing retailer Burberry being the latest. The retail analyst Nick Bubb said there was plenty of evidence of retailers struggling to attract customers for much of the year, adding that the evidence from the US, where interest rates have also climbed steeply, was similar. The ONS said the soaring price of petrol and diesel was another factor deterring shoppers. A fall in car use meant consumers were less likely to visit out-of-town shopping centres or nearby towns to buy high-priced items. Food retailers reported a 7.7% increase in spending on a year ago and online retail sales were up by 6.1%, but volumes were down in both cases as inflation resulted in consumers paying more for less. The retail sales report also showed that shoppers are shunning specialist food stores in favour of supermarkets, in the cost of living squeeze. Supermarkets reported an increase in sales volumes of 0.2% in October, while specialist food stores such as butchers and bakers reported that sales volumes fell by 4.2%. Alcohol and tobacco stores were hit by a 10.4% drop in sales volumes. Feedback from these retailers suggested that consumers were buying cheaper products and prioritising important items, the ONS said. Danni Hewson, the head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said this is because middle-income households are being squeezed by rising mortgage costs. \u201cWhat is particularly interesting is the food sector. Even here spending is down but it\u2019s where that spend has fallen which alludes to the impact rising mortgage costs are having on middle-income families. \u201cSupermarkets which offer value brands and own-label deals maintained a bit of growth but speciality stores like butchers and artisan bakers saw trade drop off. \u201cLittle luxuries are an affordable ray of sunshine but everyday sustenance is another thing entirely and it\u2019s hard to justify an ancient grain loaf when a couple of slices from a prepackaged one does the job at a fraction of the price,\u201d she said. The \u201clipstick effect\u201d, a term coined to illustrate the demand for small indulgences during a squeeze on incomes, meant cosmetics and toiletries had another strong month, said the British Retail Consortium. More expensive purchases, such as laptops and electrical appliances, were being shunned as shoppers waited to pick up Black Friday bargains, it added. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said consumer confidence was weakening because of higher mortgage and rental costs. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cThe retail sector is unlikely to experience a significant uptick in fortunes in the near term. The impact of higher interest rates is building, with an extra 1.5 million households with mortgages set to see fixed-rate deals expire and roll on to higher rates before the end of 2024.\u201d However, like many economists, he said higher wage rises and falling inflation would soon increase household disposable incomes. \u201cRetailers aren\u2019t out of supports. In the short-term, October\u2019s drag from weaker fuel sales may reverse as recent falls in oil prices feed through to lower pump prices. \u201cMeanwhile, falling inflation, combined with still-strong pay growth, means momentum in real earnings is building. And the jobs market appears to be proving resilient despite a sluggish economy, with unemployment remaining at a low level in the latest data and job vacancies still above pre-Covid levels,\u201d he added."

            "content": "A global recession could be set in motion by the conflict in the Middle East as the humanitarian crisis compounds the challenges facing an already precarious world economy, two of Wall Street\u2019s biggest names have warned. The downbeat comments come as the City braces for another gloomy update on the UK economy, with the Office for National Statistics due to provide an update on how it fared during the third quarter on Friday. After barely growing during 2023, the UK economy is again expected to be almost at a standstill, according to estimates by City economists. There are also new downbeat figures on the housing market, with UK mortgage lending predicted to show decade-low growth during 2023 and 2024. In terms of the global economy, Larry Fink, chief executive of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, said a combination of the Hamas atrocities of 7 October, Israel\u2019s resultant attack on Gaza and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year had pushed the world \u201calmost to a whole new future\u201d. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Fink said: \u201cGeopolitical risk is a major component in shaping all our lives. We are having rising fear throughout the world, and less hope. Rising fear creates a withdrawal from consumption or spending more. So fear creates recessions in the long run, and if we continue to have rising fear, the probability of a European recession grows and the probability of a US recession grows.\u201d Jamie Dimon, the chair of America\u2019s biggest bank, JP Morgan, also told the same newspaper that the combination of Israel\u2019s war on Hamas and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 were \u201cquite scary and unpredictable\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening on the geopolitical front right now is the most important thing for the future of the world \u2013 freedom, democracy, food, energy, immigration,\u201d he said. The comments come three weeks after similar apocalyptic remarks from Dimon, who is one of the world\u2019s best known financiers. Last month, he warned that it was \u201cthe most dangerous time the world has seen in decades\u201d, with the escalating conflict potentially having \u201cfar-reaching impacts\u201d on energy prices, food costs, international trade and diplomatic ties. The negative Wall Street sentiment concerning the global economy is also being echoed elsewhere. Last week, the Economist published a leader article entitled: \u201cThe world economy is defying gravity. That cannot last.\u201d One of the reasons the conflict between Israel and Hamas is seen as posing a global economic threat is the world\u2019s reliance on the region\u2019s oil, which accounts for a third of the market. Economists often fear that spikes in the oil price can trigger global recessions. The economy\u2019s weak performance means the threat of recession is already hanging over the UK. Last week, the Bank of England said in its monetary policy report: \u201cUK GDP is expected to have been flat in 2023 Q3, weaker than projected in the [Bank\u2019s] August report. Some business surveys are pointing to a slight contraction of output in Q4 but others are less pessimistic. GDP is expected to grow by 0.1% in Q4, also weaker than projected previously.\u201d Meanwhile, UK mortgage lending is expected to record decade-low growth in 2023 and 2024, the EY ITEM Club is predicting. The economic forecaster expects mortgage loans in 2023 to rise by 1.5% net in 2023 \u2013 and 2% net in 2024 \u2013 representing the lowest growth over a two-year period in a decade. It blamed the sluggish market on high mortgage rates, subdued economic growth and weakening housing market sentiment. Anna Anthony, EY\u2019s UK financial services managing partner, said the UK is \u201cstill on track to avoid recession this year\u201d but the economic environment remains challenging. \u201cSignificant cost-of-living pressures continue to affect households\u2019 ability to spend, and an increasing number are finding it difficult to keep up with loan repayments.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-07T00:01:52Z",
            "content": "Fears that the UK is heading for a recession this winter have intensified amid signs Britain\u2019s hard-pressed households are cutting spending as they save for Christmas and higher fuel bills. Two monthly snapshots of retail activity found shops and online outlets struggling because of consumer budgets being squeezed by dearer mortgages and the UK\u2019s lingering cost of living crisis. The British Retail Consortium \u2013 the industry\u2019s lobby group \u2013 and Barclays said sales were down in October once inflation was taken into account. The Bank of England has raised interest rates 14 times since December 2021 but the downbeat reports from retailers suggest Threadneedle Street\u2019s action to bring down inflation has come at the expense of weaker consumer confidence and lower sales volumes. Barclays said card spending rose by 2.6% in the year to October, significantly slower than the 6.7% inflation rate measured by the latest consumer prices index. The BRC/KPMG monitor of retail activity said sales were up 2.5% on October 2022 but stressed its figures were not adjusted for inflation. News of the slowdown came as the latest health check on the UK construction sector from S&amp;P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed housebuilding contracting for an 11th successive month. The S&amp;P Global/Cips report showed all three categories of construction \u2013 infrastructure, commercial property and housebuilding \u2013 below the 50 level that marks the cut-off point between a growing and declining sector. But of the three, housebuilding was the weakest, registering a score of 38.5. Meanwhile, evidence that consumers are wary of committing to big-ticket items emerged from the latest car sales figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. These showed a near 30% year-on-year jump in fleet sales but only a 0.3% increase to 62,915 in sales to private buyers. Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cRetail sales growth slowed as high mortgage and rental costs further shook consumer confidence. Many households are also delaying their Christmas spending in the hopes they can grab a bargain in the upcoming Black Friday sales. The cost of living squeeze meant more was spent on lower-price indulgences, such as beauty products \u2013 the so-called \u2018lipstick effect\u2019. Meanwhile, the arrival of some colder weather helped to boost fashion sales, particularly for outdoor wear.\u201d Dickinson said retailers were cutting prices and streamlining operations as they sought to produce an affordable Christmas for their customers but this was being jeopardised by a \u00a3470m-a-year rise in business rates facing retailers next year. She called on Jeremy Hunt to freeze rates in this month\u2019s autumn statement to prevent extra cost pressure from pushing up prices. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u201cWhile consumers are now operating in a lower inflationary environment compared to October last year where inflation peaked at over 11%, there is no doubt that the last 12 months have taken a toll on confidence and their ability to spend. Coupled with a higher interest rate environment, dwindling Covid savings and the heating coming back on, beleaguered consumers are thinking very carefully about how they spend their money. As a result, the strong demand that has kept some retailers afloat over the last 18 months is now falling away.\u201d The Bank of England said last week it expected the economy to flatline in the second half of 2023. Threadneedle Street has pencilled in zero growth for the third quarter and 0.1% expansion in the final three months of the year. Official figures for the July to September period will be released on Friday. Barclays said consumers had detected a new form of shrinkflation known as slack-filling. Seven out of 10 shoppers had noticed examples of product packaging hiding unnecessary empty space inside, it said. Esme Harwood, a Barclays director, said consumers had been cutting back on non-essentials such as clothing and restaurants in October, with thoughts turning to saving for Christmas and budgeting for winter fuel bills. \u201cThe unseasonably warm weather also hampered spending on indoor experiences, including digital streaming services and takeaways. However, pubs, bars and clubs still achieved strong growth, boosted by England\u2019s performance at the Rugby World Cup, while the travel sector benefited from a rise in holiday bookings,\u201d she said. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2023. An earlier version said that the Bank of England has raised interest rates 14 times since December 2001, instead of 2021."

            "date": "2023-11-06T22:30:50Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s first king\u2019s speech will include a series of hardline criminal justice measures promising tougher sentences for rapists and killers in the run-up to a general election. With crime and punishment a major point of contention with Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour, the prime minister will confirm the introduction of a new sentencing bill under which murderers whose crimes involved sadistic or sexual conduct will face spending the rest of their lives in jail. The change in the law will mean that a whole-life order must be handed down in certain cases, with judges able to choose not to impose one only in exceptional circumstances. Criminals who commit rape and other serious sexual offences will spend every day of their sentence behind bars, the government will say, up from 50% of their sentence when the government came to power in 2010. Judges will also be given powers to order newly convicted prisoners to attend sentencing hearings, after high-profile offenders failed to appear for their sentencing. Through the criminal justice bill, the government will make clear in law that \u201creasonable force\u201d can be used to make criminals appear in the dock. If offenders still refuse, they will face a further two years in prison. The measures are being introduced after Lucy Letby, the nurse who was found guilty of murdering seven babies, and Thomas Cashman, the murderer of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel, refused to attend their sentencing hearings, leaving relatives of their victims distraught. Sunak\u2019s first king\u2019s speech is not expected to contain many surprises, with potentially less than a year for the government to pass legislation before the next general election. Instead, there are likely to be a series of measures that the Conservatives hope will open up clear dividing lines with Labour on issues such as the green agenda. Tory insiders said the prime minister wanted to concentrate on winning back voters who had turned against the party since the last election, and so was planning to offer them some policy \u201cred meat\u201d. Prison reform groups have pointed out that many of the new measures come in the face of a capacity crisis that has bought the system dangerously close to breaking point. It also comes weeks after the government announced that hundreds of prisoners, some of whom have been convicted for violent crimes, would be released 18 days early to ease the pressure on the Prison Service. Ministers have announced they will legislate to allow the government to rent prison places abroad, in order to help alleviate overcrowding in UK jails. The government is under pressure to outline plans for a \u201cMartyn\u2019s law\u201d: UK-wide legislation that will place a requirement on those responsible for venues to consider the threat from terrorism. Named after Martyn Hett, 29, one of 22 people killed in the 2017 Manchester Arena terrorist attack, the legislation was proposed by the government in December but has yet to be formally introduced into parliament. Sunak had promised Hett\u2019s mother, Figen Murray, that it would be on the statute before the summer recess so that it was not delayed by a general election campaign, sources said. The criminal justice bill is also expected to create a statutory aggravating factor at sentencing to ensure grooming gang members and their ringleaders receive tougher sentences. Murdering a partner at the end of a relationship will also become a statutory aggravating factor at sentencing, the government has said. Ministers are also expected to take new powers to block the parole of offenders and to stop them marrying in prison. Other measures include giving police the power to enter a property without a warrant to seize stolen goods, such as phones, when they have reasonable proof that a specific stolen item is inside. That could mean using a device\u2019s GPS tracking capability to lead police to where it has been hidden. In a statement, Sunak said: \u201cI want everyone across the country to have the pride and peace of mind that comes with knowing your community, where you are raising your family and taking your children to school, is safe. That is my vision of what a better Britain looks like.\u201d Shabana Mahmood, the shadow justice secretary, said: \u201cWhat further proof do we need that the Tories have completely run out of ideas than witnessing them using the most significant event in the parliamentary calendar to simply repackage ideas they\u2019ve announced multiple times? \u201cThe government should be focusing on delivering the prison places we actually need to keep criminals behind bars. They have utterly failed to manage the prison estate and the best they could come up with to fix it was letting criminals out early. Labour will rebuild public confidence in policing and the criminal justice system, and we\u2019ll restore the rule of law on Britain\u2019s streets.\u201d Starmer said: \u201cA government acting in the national interest would deliver a big build programme to kickstart growth in every region and begin to turn around 13 years of decline with a plan for a decade of national renewal.\u201d"

But thanks to emerging artists such as Genesis Owusu and Zimbabwean-born Tkay Maidza, that\u2019s changing. Maidza\u2019s righteous campaign to supplant Iggy Azalea as the Australian female rapper with international name recognition has recently gained considerable traction. Three EPs released between 2018 and 2021 laid out this indie self-starter\u2019s versatility of subject matter, genre and flow \u2013 a trajectory that faintly recalls Lizzo\u2019s, only with tougher talk. Sweet Justice levels Maidza up further with hotter producers (Flume, Kaytranada), another Duckwrth collaboration (on Gone to the West) and a slew of tracks that repurpose her inspirations \u2013 Nicki Minaj \u2013 into Tkay-patented bops worthy of mainstream attention. Party music looms large, thanks to tunes like Out of Luck, Ghost! and What Ya Know; range and depth comes in the form of Wasp\u2019s husky R&amp;B. But the feelgood moments, though nagging, can\u2019t help but feel slightly anodyne compared with Maidza\u2019s more lethal modes. The title of a menacing bop, WUACV, is short for \u201cwoke up and chose violence\u201d; Free Throws is musically and lyrically pugnacious. \u201cDon\u2019t sleep on me, I\u2019m the silent assassin,\u201d she purrs on Silent Assassin \u2013 and it\u2019s hard not to concur that not adding Maidza to your playlist would be remiss."

            "date": "2023-11-18T10:00:17Z",
            "content": "\u201cThe environmental problem can be solved through the distribution of property rights,\u201d says Bertie Benegas Lynch, a newly elected MP for the far-right party La Libertad Avanza in Argentina. \u201cWhy are whales on the brink of extinction while chickens or cows are not? The difference lies in the fence that protects them. When there\u2019s an owner, there\u2019s economical use, and this protects the fauna.\u201d Lynch is a prominent supporter of Argentina\u2019s far-right presidential candidate Javier Milei, a staunch advocate of privatisation of environmental assets. If the self-proclaimed \u201clibertarian\u201d candidate Milei wins the second round of the presidential election in Argentina on Sunday, Lynch will be among many with such views in his government. About 35.4 million Argentine citizens are eligible to vote in this weekend\u2019s elections. Milei is standing against the incumbent economy minister, Sergio Massa. Despite differing profiles and policies, they have in common a lack of attention to the region\u2019s most environmental pressing issues: the protection of Indigenous peoples, the climate crisis, renewable energy and the promotion of more sustainable agricultural and livestock practices. As Lynch puts it: \u201cAre we going to pass a law to protect an African mosquito from extinction? It doesn\u2019t make sense. Species extinction occurs every day and is a natural process.\u201d In that sense he is in lockstep with Milei, the \u201cArgentine Trump\u201d, who has adopted an extreme stance, vowing to disengage Argentina from the Paris climate agreement, adopted in 2015. His circle often makes aggressive statements around environmental issues, views shared by his supporters, for whom the expansion of agriculture and mining is more important than the impacts of deforestation, and who say the question of who is truly Indigenous \u2013 and so have specific rights \u2013 is controversial. When first elected as an MP in 2021, Milei said the climate crisis was a lie invented by the left. Today, he says: \u201cThere is a cyclical behaviour of temperatures in the Earth\u2019s history. Thus, all these policies blaming humans for climate change are false and only serve to raise funds to finance lazy socialists.\u201d In one presidential debate, Milei said he would not take political measures to tackle the climate crisis and would not stick to the Paris agreement agenda \u201cas we do not subscribe to Marxism and decay\u201d. In recent weeks, people more usually linked to science and education, as well as children of the \u201cdisappeared\u201d \u2013 as the victims of the Jorge Videla dictatorship of the late 1970s are known \u2013 have been coming out to campaign against Milei. \u201cI studied medicine at the public University of Buenos Aires [which Milei intends to privatise], where I was a professor until I retired,\u201d said one man, out leafleting on public transport in the capital. \u201cDo not let them privatise everything we have built \u2013 in education, science and human rights. Remember that Argentina has three Nobel prizes in science.\u201d A video of the man\u2019s argument has been widely circulating on social networks. Milei promises to privatise the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Conicet), a state institution founded in 1958 that brings together 300 institutes and thousands of researchers. It is a leading academic establishment in a country that spends 0.5% of its GDP on research and development. Massa, a pragmatic lawyer with a long political career, is a moderate and leads a much-criticised centre-left ministry of the economy. However, he has also refused to put environmental policies at the heart of his plans. \u201cOf course, Sergio Massa and Javier Milei are not the same thing. Massa has already stated he will continue to comply with climate commitments and not leave the Paris agreement. And recently, albeit a somewhat electoral measure, he stated he would impose a fine for environmental crimes,\u201d says Alejo Di Risio, of Ecosocial Justice Action Collective. \u201cHowever, if we study Massa\u2019s programme for government, it is clear he plans the country\u2019s economic recovery through a doubling or even tripling of Argentina\u2019s total exports,\u201d says Di Risio. This strategy has environmental consequences. Massa said this year that the area available for agricultural expansion is minimal, especially for soya and wheat, Argentina\u2019s key exports. In the agribusiness sector, distrust prevails. Fernando Boracchia, of the Sociedad Rural, says that Massa is more of the same. \u201cWe know whom he answers to,\u201d he says, referring to former leftwing president Cristina Kirchner. \u201cHis approach is protectionism, which means difficulties in exports. On the other hand, he is more of a dialogue-seeker and knows the businesspeople, which could be positive.\u201d Boracchia defines Milei \u201cas the novelty that scares a bit\u201d, adding: \u201cHis ideas about leaving Mercosur [the South American trade bloc] will isolate Argentina further and won\u2019t be good for business. Moreover, today\u2019s country agreements are made with a climate commitment. If he continues to appear as a global warming sceptic and leaves the Paris agreement, how will we sign so many free-trade treaties he wishes for?\u201d If expanding farmland isn\u2019t an option, mining may be. Di Risio says: \u201cMining and fracking are not so limited, which is very worrying as it undermines the quality of life of local communities and exhausts resources, such as water, compromised in these areas. This economic model is already in place, so we foresee that Massa will probably deepen the problems affecting many communities.\u201d Di Risio says people in regions linked to fracking are already affected, adding: \u201cWe see people abandoning their villages and camping next to landfills. This problem will require a response now, and I can hardly see how it would come from a candidate preaching to accelerate the causes of this situation.\u201d Indigenous rights and land appropriation also concern activists such as anthropologist Fernando Pepe, founder of Colectivo Guias, an NGO dedicated to land restitution. \u201cLand boundaries include territories currently occupied by agribusiness or mining entrepreneurs, often with the connivance of local authorities. The main problem is how to remove them from the Indigenous land,\u201d says Pepe. This situation is widespread in regions such as Salta, where agribusiness companies and entrepreneurs have encroached on forests. Almost 90% of native forest cover is gone. The problem is exacerbated by the economic power and political influence of families owning soya farms in the region, such as the former president Mauricio Macri in the Chaco Salte\u00f1o area. \u201cThe same happens in the south, where the displacement of Indigenous and peasant people progresses faster due to new tourist developments,\u201d says Pepe. In Jujuy and Salta, a severe drought is occurring, displacing local Wich\u00ed people, often far from rivers, drinking water and healthcare. \u201cThe only way to put a brake on deforestation is to protect the Indigenous people,\u201d says Pepe. \u201cThey are the guardians of the forests and their resources.\u201d In Jujuy, which has seen popular unrest, lithium exploitation is causing water scarcity and pushing people out, says Di Risio. \u201cCurrently, there are no obstacles to preventing lithium extraction companies from advancing without respecting either the licence granted by the government or international regulations. Honestly, I don\u2019t see this among the priorities of either Milei or Massa.\u201d Ayl\u00e9n Tapia, a member of the Mapuche people in Argentine Patagonia, says she is horrified by Milei\u2019s anti-environmentalism. \u201cIt is clear he is not thinking of any compensation for the people living here,\u201d she says. On the other hand, Massa does not inspire her trust either. She says: \u201cOur current conditions are bad. The local children\u2019s schools lack gas and hot water in winter.\u201d Tapia also says she has not forgotten Massa\u2019s past, referring to the 2015 elections, when he campaigned with a stricter line regarding Indigenous rights and the repression of protesters. \u201cHe wants to expand mining exploration. What more needs to be said?\u201d According to Tapia, most of her community will leave their voting paper blank. A minority will vote for Massa as a \u201clesser evil\u201d. She says of Milei and Massa: \u201cI know they are not the same, but they prioritise capital and plundering our wealth.\u201d"

            "content": "The writer Jan Needle, who has died aged 80, was best known for his books and TV series for children but he also wrote seafaring novels, brutal crime thrillers, plays and TV series for adults. The unifying theme of all his stories was a commitment to social justice and a willingness to explore societal issues in a way that was finely balanced and fair, but also provocative and controversial. This brought him success early in his career when his second book was shortlisted for the Guardian children\u2019s book prize. My Mate Shofiq (1978), which tells how a growing friendship between two boys, one white and one Pakistani, expands the horizons of both, was praised for its well-balanced reflection of a multicultural contemporary school experience. Jan showed an equally sure touch in the books that followed, including A Sense of Shame and Other Stories (1980), a short-story collection reflecting teenagers\u2019 experiences as they navigate prejudice and adult judgment, and Piggy in the Middle (1982), in which a young policewoman stands up against the institutional racism within her own community. His most direct social commentary came in Wild Wood (1981), illustrated by Willie Rushton, a lively version of The Wind in the Willows in which all those \u2013 human and animal \u2013 oppressed by Toad mount a rebellion and become the new heroes of the story. Set in the Falklands war, A Game of Soldiers, first a Bafta-nominated TV series (1984) then a novel (1985), was more hard-hitting in the vivid picture it gave of the shifting views of a xenophobic young soldier whose hatred turns to compassion after he meets a wounded Argentinian soldier. Jan relished both the threat of the government ban that the story provoked and that the book remained on school reading lists for many years afterwards. He liked comedy, too, though, as in The Size Spies (1979), a zany novel for younger readers, and in a picture book, Rottenteeth (1980), both illustrated by Roy Bentley. Born in Holybourne near Portsmouth, Jan was the son of Jim Needle, an engineer, upholsterer and inventor, and Dot (nee Brice), a cook for the Portsmouth water board, among other things. After a brief spell in North Wales, the family moved back to Portsmouth, where Jan went to Church Street school, before winning a scholarship to Portsmouth grammar school, where he claimed his greatest achievement was to introduce the Sea Scouts to the school. He left aged 17 having been told he was unlikely to pass any of his A-levels. Instead, in 1960 he got a job as a reporter on the Portsmouth Evening News, before moving to Manchester for work as a reporter and subeditor on the Daily Herald and Sun in 1964. In 1968 he went to the University of Manchester to study drama, graduating with a first in 1972. During his student years he wrote two radio plays and became the first writer-in-residence at the Contact theatre. Jan lived either in Manchester or the nearby countryside for the rest of his life. His first book, Albeson and the Germans, was published in 1975 and he quickly established himself as a strong voice in reflecting contemporary adolescence in children\u2019s fiction. He was a natural choice as a writer for three books based on the Grange Hill TV series and its spinoff, Tucker\u2019s Luck. He also wrote his own TV series, including Behind the Bike Sheds (1985), and books based on them. Other TV writing credits for children included episodes of Count Duckula, Sooty and Thomas the Tank Engine. Jan wrote five episodes of the Channel 4 soap Brookside in 1985-87. A deal to write six episodes of The Bill had just been completed when, in 1992, Jan was involved in a traffic accident, in which his stationary van was hit by a truck. Two people were killed in the collision and Jan was in a coma for several days. His recovery was slow but he was determined to get back to writing. His Sea Officer Bentley series reflected Jan\u2019s critical view of life in the English navy in the 18th century, and included an adult retelling of A Fine Boy for Killing, originally published for children in 1979. He spared readers nothing in exposing the horrors of life for the press-ganged sailors and the inhumane treatment of slaves in Jamaica. His later thrillers, including Kicking Off, which was serialised for TV as Underbelly, and its sequel The Bonus Boys, were similarly dark in their depiction of Britain\u2019s crisis-ridden prison service. Jan also created shorter, edited versions for children of classic adult titles including Dracula (2004), illustrated by Gary Blythe, and Moby Dick (2006), illustrated by Patrick Benson. I met Jan frequently during the 1980s when his rapid output of children\u2019s books and TV was giving him great success. He cared very much about what he was writing and enjoyed being a provocative but responsible contributor to children\u2019s reading. He was as compelling and passionate a storyteller in conversation as in his writing. He disappeared for several years after his accident. On his return, he was so lucid in his telling of it that it remains an unforgettable moment for me. Fortunately, he was also remarkably unchanged. He remained a keen sailor throughout his life and an enthusiastic musician, playing the penny whistle and the mandola. Jan married Elizabeth Groom, a primary school teacher, in 1966 and they had three children, Hugh, Sadie and David. He also had a long relationship with Viv Gardner, with whom he had two sons, Matti and Wilf. Jan is survived by Elizabeth and Viv, and by his children and two grandchildren, Issy and Finlay. \u2022 Jan (James Albert) Needle, writer, born 8 February 1943; died 9 October 2023"

            "content": "The New South Wales mental health minister, Rose Jackson, has flagged significant reforms to the way police respond to people in acute distress as she conceded there were instances in which the current system \u201chas failed\u201d. Jackson said the government and police were doing \u201ca big piece of work about what comes next\u201d and that she wanted mental health consumers and advocates to assist with designing the new system next year. \u201cWe accept that there has to be a new model. These conversations are ongoing,\u201d she told a parliamentary committee during a budget estimates hearing on Wednesday. Her promise follows a string of fatal interactions between NSW police and people in mental distress \u2013 Clare Nowland, Steve Pampalian, Jesse Deacon and Krista Kach, who were fatally wounded or shot by officers between May and September. Fifty-two people experiencing mental health distress died in interactions with the state\u2019s police during the past five years, including 15 people in the 12 months to June alone, as revealed by Guardian Australia. Jackson acknowledged there were \u201ca number of instances where the system has failed\u201d. \u201cI have been clear on the public record [that] the way that we respond to acute mental health crises in NSW needs to change. That process of exploring what that could look like is under way at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result of that, we will look to implement a new approach. Elements of what we are currently doing that are successful will feed into that.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Minns government has been under pressure over the recent deaths. It has lauded the police\u2019s Pacer program as a solution even though the force has separately disclosed it is looking to replace it. Under the Pacer program, mental health clinicians employed by NSW Health are stationed with police in Sydney to assist them with responding to mental health-call outs. Regional iterations have a mental health clinician provide virtual advice. However, it has been revealed that mental health clinicians are forbidden from talking with police during high-risk incidents where the person in distress has a weapon \u2013 even over the phone. Jackson on Wednesday said Pacer played an \u201cimportant role\u201d but \u201cin its current delivery framework, is not up to the task\u201d of assisting with all mental health call-outs. \u201cIt\u2019s not funded beyond 2025. That\u2019s because what\u2019s funded \u2026 is going to be different to what is delivered now,\u201d she said in response to questions from the Greens justice spokesperson, Sue Higginson, at the estimates hearing. Asked if police had changed anything about the way they responded to mental health call-outs since the recent deaths, Jackson said any questions about the force\u2019s \u201coperational response\u201d would have to be asked of the police minister. \u201cI think it is excellent that police are so open to acknowledging that things need to be done differently,\u201d Jackson said. The police commissioner, Karen Webb, has ordered an internal review of the force\u2019s mental health policies which is due to wrap up at the end of this month. Webb this week said she was \u201cvery much looking forward to receiving that report and any suggestions for change\u201d and that there was an \u201cappetite\u201d within the force to consider what it could do differently. \u201cI know that calls for service for mental health-related illnesses in NSW in the last 12 months has been more than 140,000 calls,\u201d she said. Separately, Jackson has requested that the Ministry of Health work with key mental health organisations to complete a detailed analysis of community care and come up with recommendations for immediate improvements as well as longer-term reforms."

            "content": "Michael Gove\u2019s flagship bill to end leaseholds on newly built houses in England and Wales contains no provision to end leaseholds on newly built houses in England and Wales, as the key clauses to do so were omitted in a last-minute rush to write it. The housing secretary unveiled his long-promised leasehold reform bill this week, after the government announced it in the king\u2019s speech. Gove has long promised to end what he calls the \u201cfeudal\u201d leasehold system, which is unique to England and Wales among developed nations. In a press release, the department said the bill would ban developers from selling new houses under leasehold, but the Times revealed on Wednesday that the bill does not actually do so. Officials said they were not able to include the clauses on banning new leasehold houses because of a last-minute wrangle between Gove\u2019s department and Downing Street over whether the bill would be included in the king\u2019s speech at all. They said they had not had time to finalise the complex legal text, but added the measures would be inserted into the bill via a government-backed amendment in the Commons or Lords. A government spokesperson said: \u201cLiberating leaseholders forms a vital part of the government\u2019s long-term plan for housing. That\u2019s why we are bringing forward the biggest changes to the system for a generation by giving leaseholders significant new rights, powers and protections through the leasehold and freehold reform bill. \u201cAs we laid out on Monday, we will bring forward amendments as the bill progresses through parliament and that includes the ban on leasehold houses.\u201d The omission has irritated leaseholders, who were already upset by the government\u2019s refusal to ban leasehold for newly built flats. Harry Scoffin, the founder of Free Leaseholders, a campaign group launched last week to campaign for stronger measures in the bill, said: \u201cIt is absolutely surreal that the leasehold new-build houses ban, the one leasehold policy that has survived six years and four prime ministers, doesn\u2019t feature in the actual wording of this government\u2019s supposedly landmark leasehold and freehold reform bill. \u201cMore seriously, the bigger crime is not to commit to a ban on future leasehold flats, where the real money is being made and abuse of homeowners [is] routine. While government has dodged commonhold, they could at least give new-build apartment buyers a share of the freehold for resident control from day one.\u201d Matthew Pennycook, the shadow housing minister, said: \u201cNot only does this long overdue piece of legislation not ensure that new flats will be sold as freehold, contrary to what ministers have claimed it doesn\u2019t even do what it says on the tin and ban the sale of new leasehold houses.\u201d Tory MPs have promised to amend the bill not only to include a ban covering new houses but to extend it to new-build flats as well. Labour has promised to end leaseholds on new flats and houses and to encourage a new system of common ownership of shared spaces. \u201cA Labour government will make commonhold the default tenure for all new properties as part of our commitment to fundamentally and comprehensively reform the leasehold system,\u201d Pennycook said. The government also said on Wednesday that it had not met its targets on housebuilding. It said 234,400 new homes were built in 2022-23, almost exactly the same number as the previous year and below the target of 300,000 new homes a year."

            "content": "Rachel Reeves is proposing to shake up Britain\u2019s pension system as part of a three-pronged plan aimed at boosting the economy\u2019s sluggish growth rate if Labour wins the next election. The shadow chancellor wants more of the money saved for retirement schemes to find its way into support for expanding UK businesses, and says her reforms could increase the size of the average pension pot by up to \u00a337,000. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, will announce plans to lift the economy\u2019s growth rate in next week\u2019s autumn statement but Reeves said the 25 tax increases announced by the government in recent years were evidence of its failure since 2010. \u201cIt is because the Tories have failed to grow the economy that they are picking the pockets of ordinary working people,\u201d she said. Labour has no plans to increase taxes beyond measures it has already announced: a toughening-up of the rules governing non-dom status, an end to tax breaks for private schools, and higher taxes for private equity bosses. Economists have estimated the three changes would raise up to \u00a37bn a year. The shadow chancellor said her ambition was to cut taxes for workers but she would not do so unless she could identify where the money was going to come from: \u201cI would like to lower taxes on working people but I am not going to go all Liz Truss and have unfunded tax cuts.\u201d Opinion polls currently suggest Labour is on course to win the election. \u201cI have no illusion about the scale of the challenge that will face us,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cGrowth is slow, public services are on their knees, people are feeling worse off. \u201cIf we can get the economy growing we can start to turn things around. There is some low-hanging fruit that we can pick to deliver results.\u201d Labour\u2019s growth plan involves speeding up the planning system; an industrial strategy with statutory underpinning; and reform of the pension system. On pensions, Reeves is keen on a French-style scheme under which institutional investors and defined contribution funds would come together to channel money into UK firms with growth potential. The shadow chancellor would also give the Pensions Regulator more power to reduce the number of UK defined contribution funds through a process of consolidation. A future Labour government would review the entire pensions system to ensure \u201cit delivers the full potential for British savers and UK plc\u201d, she said. There has been speculation that Hunt might use the autumn statement to announce an extension of 100% tax breaks for business investment beyond 2025-26. \u201cIf the chancellor extends full expensing by a year we will support that,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cIf the money is available to us we would look to extend it beyond that.\u201d She said NHS waiting lists were one reason why workforce participation rates had failed to return to their pre-pandemic levels, adding that some of the money from Labour\u2019s three tax increases would be spent on delivering 2m extra hospital appointments. \u201cWe would have a fairer tax system and use that money to invest in the NHS and schools,\u201d Reeves said."

            "date": "2023-11-26T16:49:42Z",
            "content": "Conservative MPs have not been offered money to defect to Reform UK, the party\u2019s leader, Richard Tice, has stressed, amid claims that Lee Anderson was offered \u201ca lot of money\u201d last month. Anderson, the MP for Ashfield and one of the Conservative party\u2019s deputy chairs, was recorded telling Tory activists last month: \u201cA political party that begins with an R offered me a lot of money to join them. I mean a lot of money, I mean a lot of money.\u201d The leaked recording, obtained by the Sunday Times, was from a \u201clagers with Lee\u201d meeting at Cambridge rugby club, hosted by the South Cambridgeshire Conservative Association, during which Anderson said Reform would win \u201czero seats\u201d at the next election. The Reform leader, Tice, rejected the claims, saying he had \u201cnumerous discussions with a number of Tory MPs, ministers and former ministers who are absolutely furious with the complete betrayal of the government\u2019s promises, furious with their failure to stop the boats, furious with opening the borders to mass immigration\u201d. But, he told the BBC\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: \u201cLet me make it absolutely clear, no cash or money has in any way been offered. What has been offered is the chance to change the shape of the debate.\u201d Tice went as far as claiming that Anderson had \u201cused the threat of defecting to Reform to negotiate himself the deputy chairmanship\u201d. Anderson has been approached for comment. It was reported earlier this year that the Conservative chief whip, Simon Hart, had reported Reform UK to the Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, over allegations that the party had offered MPs who defected a full salary for five years \u2013 even if the politicians lost their seats. Hart was reported as highlighting that Tories were being offered \u00a3400,000-plus \u201cbribes\u201d to defect. On Saturday night, the Conservative party confirmed it now had 10 deputy chairs, including Rachel Maclean, who was sacked as housing minister, and Sara Britcliffe, the youngest Tory MP elected in the 2019 election at the age of 24. The Conservatives are aware of the threat posed by the newly named Reform UK: the Brexit party, with Rishi Sunak warning disgruntled Tory voters: \u201cA vote for everyone who is not a Conservative is a vote to put Keir Starmer into office.\u201d His remarks were echoed by the chief secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott, who said she was not worried about Reform UK outflanking her party. Reform UK, previously named the Brexit party and headed by Nigel Farage, has never had any MPs. In the coming weeks, Reform will announce hundreds of candidates as it seeks to build on momentum behind a stated desire to \u201cdestroy\u201d the Conservatives. Even at the cost of splitting the rightwing vote, Tice has said every Tory candidate will face a Reform opponent in the next general election, dismissing any rerun of the 2019 deal in which the Brexit party stood aside in more than 300 Tory-held seats after Boris Johnson gave commitments on a hard Brexit. Anderson told activists in the recording that the Conservatives were \u201cnot perfect\u201d and that he hated campaigning with the motto that the \u201copposition\u2019s worse than us\u201d, but warned them that a vote for Reform was a vote for Labour. \u201cI spoke to the leaders of Reform \u2013 they want PR \u2026 they are hellbent and want us to get hammered in the next election \u2026 all they want is a bit of power in parliament.\u201d At the Reform party conference, Farage joined Tice in accusing the Conservatives of copying their rhetoric on immigration, \u201cbut not the actions\u201d. The pair have sought to paint the Reform party as an alternative for those on the Tory right who voted leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Farage has been seeking to win over television viewers with his stint on the reality show I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here!. Reform UK has only taken small proportions of the vote in recent byelections. Recent YouGov polling found that voters who supported the Tories in 2019 were more likely to switch to Reform than to Labour, and there have been suggestions that such switchers cost Sunak\u2019s party the recent byelection in Mid Bedfordshire."

            "date": "2023-11-18T05:58:53Z",
            "content": "Pacific Rim leaders have shown divisions over the wars in Ukraine and Gaza after a two-day summit of the Apec forum, while pledging support for reform of the World Trade Organization. The 21 economies that make up the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum \u2013 among them Russia, China, the US and Australia \u2013 did not mention either conflict in their final joint communique. Instead an accompanying chair\u2019s statement noted the bloc had \u201cexchanged views on the ongoing crisis in Gaza\u201d. Days of meetings involving Apec ministers and leaders were dominated by a summit on Wednesday between the US president, Joe Biden, and China\u2019s Xi Jinping aimed at cooling tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Apec is largely focused on trade and includes countries as disparate as Muslim-majority Indonesia and the US, Israel\u2019s most important ally. Biden used the Apec summit in San Francisco to highlight the strong US economy and its ties to other Pacific nations, even as his vision for greater regional cooperation to counter China\u2019s influence stumbled on the trade front over his bid to strengthen workers\u2019 rights. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said the Biden-Xi meeting was a badly needed signal that the world needs to cooperate more and a positive sign for cooperation on global challenges, especially climate change. Much US-China tension is linked to democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as its territory. Taiwan\u2019s Apec envoy, the semiconductor magnate Morris Chang, said on Friday he believed the Biden-Xi summit had been a \u201cgood meeting\u201d. He said he had informal interactions with Biden and his vice-president, Kamala Harris, and with Antony Blinken, Biden\u2019s secretary of state, but not with Xi. On the Gaza war, an Apec chair\u2019s statement noted the bloc had merely \u201cexchanged views on the ongoing crisis\u201d. The war is Israel\u2019s response to a Hamas terrorist raid from Gaza into Israel on 7 October that left about 1,200 people dead and 240 people taken hostage. \u201cSome leaders objected to the inclusion of this language in the accompanying 2023 Apec leaders\u2019 Golden Gate Declaration on the basis that they do not believe that Apec is a forum to discuss geopolitical issues,\u201d the chair\u2019s statement said. \u201cSome leaders also shared the united messages of the joint Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh on 11 November 2023.\u201d Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia in a joint statement said they were among the Apec members who supported the messages of the Riyadh summit, which had called for an immediate end to military operations in Gaza, rejecting Israel\u2019s justification of its actions against Palestinians as self-defence. The three countries also called for an \u201cimmediate, durable and sustained\u201d humanitarian truce, and for the unhindered provision of essential goods and services to civilians in Gaza. On Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the statement said there had been no accord but \u201cmost members strongly condemn\u201d the aggression. \u201cWe note with deep concern the adverse impact of the war in Ukraine and stress that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy.\u201d The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was not among heads of state at the meeting as he faces an arrest warrant from the international criminal court. Russia instead sent deputy prime minister Alexei Overchuk. The Apec leaders\u2019 declaration reaffirmed their determination \u201cto deliver a free, open, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, inclusive, and predictable trade and investment environment \u2026 We are committed to necessary reform of the WTO to improve all of its functions, including conducting discussions with a view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all members by 2024.\u201d With Agence France-Presse and Reuters"

A week before the 28th annual meeting of the United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention opens in oil-rich Dubai, it makes depressing reading. At the time of writing it is 422.36 parts per million. That is 5.06ppm more than the same day last year.

Now we know: the result is catastrophic heatwaves, storms, droughts, floods and rapidly increasing and unstoppable sea level rise. The figures underline the fact that after 27 annual meetings of the convention, all the efforts of nearly 200 member states to tackle the menace of the climate crisis have been a failure, so far.

            "content": "Australia will offer residency to people affected by climate change in the low-lying Pacific nation of Tuvalu, as part of a sweeping new treaty that also locks the two countries into close security ties. At a time when many Pacific leaders are pressing Australia to take stronger action against its fossil fuel sector, the treaty explicitly recognises the vulnerability of Tuvalu to rising sea levels. Tuvalu is a country of nine low-lying islands in the central Pacific, about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, with a population of about 11,200. Australia will offer up to 280 people access to permanent residency each year, but it has also promised to help the citizens of Tuvalu \u201cstay in their homes with safety and dignity\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the deal would also cement his country\u2019s status as Tuvalu\u2019s \u201csecurity partner of choice\u201d by offering it a form of security guarantee. The new treaty, announced on Friday, states that Australia will act on requests from its partner to respond to major natural disasters, pandemics or \u201cmilitary aggression against Tuvalu\u201d. In return for this security guarantee, Tuvalu will be required to \u201cmutually agree with Australia\u201d if it wants to strike a deal with any other country on security and defence-related matters. These topics are defined broadly to include \u201cdefence, policing, border protection, cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, including ports, telecommunications and energy infrastructure\u201d \u2013 all of which are of interest to China. Australia\u2019s military could be granted access and have a presence within the country if such activities are deemed necessary to provide assistance that had been requested by the Pacific country. The deal will be seen as a strategic win for the Australian government at a time when China has been vigorously pursuing closer ties with Pacific island countries. Beijing\u2019s signing of a security pact with Solomon Islands last year rocked the Australian defence establishment and prompted a pledge from Albanese\u2019s Labor government to more vigorously pursue engagement with its Pacific neighbours. Albanese announced the plans after three days of talks with fellow Pacific leaders at a key regional summit in Cook Islands, where the climate crisis was one of the biggest issues on the agenda. Australia and Tuvalu\u2019s relationship has been elevated to a new partnership to be known as the Falepili Union \u2013 a Tuvaluan word referring to good neighbourliness, care and mutual respect. Albanese said the new union recognised the \u201cspecial and unique challenges\u201d faced by Tuvalu and its exposure to climate change, including its geographical remoteness and scarce natural resources. The elevated partnership was requested by Tuvalu, the prime minister said, \u201cto safeguard the future of Tuvalu\u2019s people, identity and culture\u201d. \u201cThat is why we are assisting on adaptation, but we are also providing the security that these guarantees represent for the people of Tuvalu, who want to preserve their culture, want to preserve their very nation going forward as well,\u201d he said. Government sources said it was not anticipated that all Tuvalu residents would move to Australia, with no expectation of \u201cwholesale migration\u201d \u2013 but instead \u201cmigration with dignity\u201d for those who wanted to travel. Albanese met two days ago with the Tuvalu prime minister, Kausea Natano, who described himself as \u201cthe leader of a country that is going to be under the water\u201d if the world does not tackle the climate crisis. The multifaceted agreement includes a \u201cspecial mobility pathway\u201d and visa category for 280 Tuvaluan citizens each year to gain permanent residency in Australia, with rights to live, study and work, as well as access services. The new pathway will sit under the existing Pacific engagement visa. Australian government sources said Tuvalu would choose which citizens would be offered access to the new visa pathway. Natano, appearing alongside Albanese in Cook Islands on Friday, said the system would be designed to avoid \u201cbrain drain\u201d in the Pacific nation. \u201cThe dedication of Australia to supporting the people of Tuvalu goes beyond words and it has touched our hearts profoundly,\u201d Natano said. Tuvalu is one of very few nations in the Pacific to have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, although Solomon Islands switched allegiance to China in recent years. Natano told the press conference that Tuvalu would continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but said China had approached his country to seek ties. He said he and Albanese had briefed the Pacific Islands Forum \u2013 the 18-member regional grouping - earlier in the day during the leaders\u2019 retreat on the island of Aitutaki. Australia\u2019s pledge also includes further cooperation on the Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project, which would reclaim land in the capital, Funafuti, in the hopes of expanding the land mass by 6% to create more space for housing and other essential services and \u201cenabling people to remain living in Tuvalu in the face of sea level rise\u201d. The climate crisis is repeatedly cited by Pacific countries as their top security threat and many within the region are concerned about Australia\u2019s approval of new coal and gas projects. The leader of the Australian Greens, Adam Bandt, responded to the announcement by saying it \u201cwould be even better if Labor didn\u2019t cause the damage in the first place and stopped approving new coal and gas mines\u201d."

Question time was briefly paused on Tuesday afternoon after the trio unfurled banners from the public gallery, which promoted Friday\u2019s upcoming Schools Strike 4 Climate rally. The students \u2013 Joey Thompson, Myles Wilkinson and Diana, who asked for her surname not be published \u2013 sang, \u201cWhich side are you on?

The Speaker, Maree Edwards, ordered MPs to leave the chamber for about eight minutes before proceedings resumed.

Diana, 19, said young people should be out enjoying themselves but were forced to protest because \u201cpoliticians aren\u2019t doing their job\u201d. \u201cThe reasons students are taking time off school is because when politicians aren\u2019t listening to the educated people who have been in the field of research and climate catastrophes for decades, and they\u2019re not listening to the evidence, what\u2019s the point of me going to school?\u201d she said.

It\u2019s the politicians in this parliament who need to be taught the lesson that fossil fuels are not OK.\u201d Wilkinson, also 16, urged Victorian students to attend the upcoming rally. \u201cThe government is supposed to protect its people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut instead it\u2019s allowing and funding the continued extraction, exportation and burning of fossil fuels driving the climate crisis which threatens every species on the planet, including us. \u201cWe have come to parliament today to demand an end to all new coal and gas projects in Australia.\u201d In a statement, Victoria police confirmed they would not be pressing charges against the students. They said they were called to Parliament House after the students unfurled banners, then \u201cspoke to the teenagers and escorted them from the building\u201d. The premier, Jacinta Allan, briefly thanked parliament staff for keeping MPs \u201csafe and secure\u201d but made no mention of the protest when question time resumed. \u201cWe appreciate their assistance for having our question time resume. I am delighted,\u201d she said. The protest was backed by the Greens, including their four lower house MPs, who posed for a selfie mid-protest. \u201cCourageous school strikers demanding an end to coal and gas and a safe climate future,\u201d Richmond MP Gabrielle de Vietri posted on X. \u201cQuestion time shut down and protesters removed by PSOs. When the future of the planet is at stake, business as usual is no longer tenable.\u201d The manager of opposition business, James Newbury, called on Edwards to refer De Vietri to the privileges committee over the post. \u201cI\u2019m sure that I share the views of all members in this place that they\u2019re concerned about that photo being posted and that a member has both taken it and effectively advertised that protest,\u201d he said in the chamber. On Wednesday, Edwards asked De Vietri to apologise for the photo but she refused to. The chamber then voted to suspend her for the remainder of the sitting week without pay. Speaking outside parliament after her suspension, De Vietri said she had done nothing wrong and stood by her support of the students. She said her suspension was an attempt by the government and opposition to distract from the message of the protesters. \u201cLabor and the Liberals would rather focus on me taking a selfie in the chamber than they would focus on the fact that there are going to be thousands of kids out there on the streets demanding that they stop opening up coal and gas projects,\u201d De Vietri said."

            "content": "The number of listed threatened species in Australia\u2019s world heritage northern rainforests has increased by 25% since 2020, as ecologists say they are now clearly observing the long-predicted impacts of global heating. The management and conservation authority for the Unesco-listed Queensland wet tropics this week handed its latest environmental report to the state government, containing \u201csombre but pragmatic\u201d warnings about the declining health of some species, including the ringtail possum, that were believed robust when the area was given international protection in 1988. \u201cThe insidious and damaging threat posed by invasive species and diseases, and the impacts of climate change, present real danger to the continuing integrity of the area\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d the report says. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It found a number of additional species \u2013 including endemic rainforest frogs, ringtail possums, high-altitude birds and myrtle plants \u2013 that were considered secure at the time of world heritage listing, \u201cnow face significant challenges from accumulated and compounding threats\u201d. Stephen Williams, a rainforest ecologist and a director of the Wet Tropics Management Authority, says his analysis showed there had been a 25% increase to the number of listed threatened vertebrate species in the area in the past three years. Williams said previously predicted declines in some species were now being observed first-hand. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily climate \u2026 it\u2019s almost entirely climate,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe wet tropics as a world heritage area is in relatively good shape \u2026 but there is a rapidly increasing number of species that are either on the threatened list, or soon be on the threatened list. \u201cThis sort of thing is happening rapidly and it takes years to get something listed as threatened. Governments tend to only want to fund or even talk about things that are officially listed. \u201cBut whatever statistic we use, the problem is actually twice as bad as that. More species are declining than are currently listed.\u201d Williams said the situation had left the wet tropics \u201cat a real risk of losing the very things it was made a world heritage area to protect\u201d. Many species in the wet tropics have been affected by severe heatwave or droughts. More than 23,000 spectacled flying foxes were killed \u2013 about 30% of the entire population \u2013 during a two-day heatwave in November 2018. Williams said it was now clear that creeping average temperature increases \u2013 as opposed to short-term weather extremes \u2013 were also contributing to biodiversity stress in cool-adapted upland species like the ringtail possum, and some frog and bird species. \u201cSome of these are showing signatures of slow decline in increasing heat,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor those particular species \u2026 it\u2019s hard to imagine what you can do beyond climate action.\u201d Another increasing threat to rainforest biodiversity has come from bushfires. Previously the damp rainforest had been considered a natural fire barrier, but in recent years bushfires have caused serious damage. \u201cThe wet tropics region can expect more frequent and more intense fires due to hotter temperatures,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe capacity of the area\u2019s endemic rainforest species to regenerate after fire is poorly studied.\u201d In a statement, the management authority said \u201cthere remains a narrow window where we can bring threatened species back from the brink through bold new programs and partnerships\u201d Eastern Kuku Yalanji woman Christine Grant, the chair of the authority, said there was no \u201csilver bullet\u201d. \u201cThe best available science tells us the way to protect threatened species is through long-term planning, rethinking our investments, and prioritising landscape-scale restoration to tackle climate change with better fire management and projects that reduce other threats such as invasive species,\u201d Grant said. \u201cWorld heritage listing for the wet tropics has provided a measure of protection to save species, but invasive pests, diseases and more frequent and extensive storms and other natural disasters, particularly fires, threaten this internationally significant region.\u201d"

No one will escape the consequences of climate change, but people living in poorer countries are particularly vulnerable. Here are 10 ways the climate crisis is affecting global health: 1. Floods and disease As life becomes less tolerable for humans, animals and plants, things will get easier for disease-causing organisms. More than half of all known diseases have been made worse by the climate crisis, say scientists. A warming world makes outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio more likely. They spread when people eat or drink something that contains infected faecal particles, which is why outbreaks often happen where extreme weather events have damaged infrastructure and led to poor sanitation. World Health Organization data published in September showed there were twice as many cholera cases in 2022 than in 2021. Outbreaks were recorded in countries where cholera had been under control for years, including Yemen and Lebanon. Between February and March of this year, one of the strongest and longest tropical storms ever recorded displaced millions of people in five African countries. Cyclone Freddy lasted for eight weeks and travelled across Mozambique, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Mauritius. Its worst effects were seen in Malawi, which was already battling its deadliest cholera outbreak when the storm hit. Malawi recorded nearly 59,000 cases of cholera and 1,768 deaths by the time its health ministry said it had the outbreak under control in August. 2. Mosquitoes on the march Rising temperatures and frequent floods also unlock new places where disease-carrying insects thrive. The mosquitoes that carry the viruses that cause dengue fever and malaria, for example, have more stagnant pools of water to choose from when laying their eggs. Floods may create new pools of standing water and droughts can shrink flowing streams into stagnant puddles. People are also more likely to store water during droughts, often creating ideal breeding grounds. Warmer temperatures even increase the rate at which mosquitoes bite people and how effectively the insects spread disease, say scientists. Sudan experienced its worst dengue fever outbreak in 10 years in 2022, with heavy rains blamed. In Bangladesh, although dengue fever is common, the country recorded its biggest outbreak, with nearly 70,000 cases and 327 deaths between January and August this year. \u201cThe higher incidence of dengue is taking place in the context of an unusual episodic amount of rainfall, combined with high temperatures and high humidity,\u201d the WHO noted. An outbreak of dengue has also been declared in Jamaica. Nor is the disease confined to developing countries. There are fears that it is spreading in southern Europe, partly owing to the warm weather. More than 8 billion people could be at risk of malaria and dengue fever by 2080, scientists have warned. 3. Human-animal contact Many existing diseases will get more dangerous, but new illnesses could also emerge as people are increasingly forced into areas where there is wildlife. Diseases can jump from animals to humans. These diseases, such as Ebola, avian flu and Sars, are called \u201czoonoses\u201d and they make up the majority of new illnesses. Scientists have found that the climate crisis is helping to circulate diseases between species that previously did not encounter each other. As the planet heats up, many animal species are forced to move into new areas to find suitable conditions. It has been estimated that zoonoses are responsible for as many as 2.5bn cases of human illness and 2.7m human deaths worldwide each year, and that animals have played a major part in nearly every major disease outbreak since 1970. 4. Severe weather events Although governments are getting better at preparing for severe weather events, nine out of 10 deaths linked to weather disasters since 1970 happened in small island nations and developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America. Floods, drought, hurricanes and wildfires are becoming more frequent and putting vulnerable people at immediate risk. In September, Storm Daniel hit Libya, bringing catastrophic floods that killed an estimated 11,000 people, with thousands more still missing. Extreme weather disasters killed more than 18,000 people between the months of June and early September alone. 5. The air that we breathe Outside air pollution has been linked to numerous cancers and diseases and is estimated to be responsible for more than 4m premature deaths globally each year. Changing weather patterns are expected to make this already bad situation worse as more dust and wildfire smoke are added to the mix. Children are especially likely to get sick from air pollution because their brains, lungs and other organs are still developing. When researchers scanned the brains of nearly 9,500 US children over a two-year period, they found that even small amounts of exposure to air pollution changed the way their brains developed, particularly in the region that controls emotions. There are even signs that outdoor air pollution can make it more likely for people to develop type 2 diabetes, and that being exposed to four common air pollutants could also make people more likely to fall seriously ill or die as a result of diabetes-related complications. 6. The psychological cost Environmental deterioration has a knock-on effect on the economic and social systems that keep society productive and happy, setting in motion a downward spiral of psychological hardship. Research shows that wildfires, floods and heatwaves can cause anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder in the months following the event. In the long term, many adults are resilient in such crises, but children are more likely to carry these psychological effects into adulthood. If crops are destroyed during extreme weather events, children may get less nutritious food, the consumption of which is linked to psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression. When people can\u2019t get the help they need, they may self-medicate with alcohol or drugs, which in turn makes them more likely to engage in risky behaviour (such as unprotected sex) that could result in infections such as HIV, or illnesses that can result from spending time in crowded places, such as tuberculosis. In 2021, scientists studying evidence of a potential link between heat exposure and mental health found a 2.2% increase in mental health-related mortality per 1C rise in temperature. 7. Salty water and perilous pregnancies Drinking water is becoming saltier. One reason for this is that sea levels are rising, so there is more sea water flowing into rivers and other sources of fresh water during floods and tropical storms. Taking in too much salt can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension). Over time, this condition damages the body\u2019s veins, arteries and major organs (including the brain, heart, kidneys and eyes) since they\u2019re working so much harder overall. Hypertension is doubly dangerous for pregnant women and their babies. In the coastal Dacope Upazila district of Bangladesh, researchers tested pregnant women\u2019s urine and found they were getting up to 15g of salt each day through their drinking water alone (depending on where they got the water from). That\u2019s triple the amount the WHO recommends. Another study in the same area discovered a link between salty drinking water and developing high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia. Nearly one-fifth of Bangladesh will be under water by 2050. 8. Food insecurity More frequent and severe droughts and floods make it harder to grow the grains, fruit and vegetables that people need to eat to stay healthy. Small island states in the Caribbean, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean bear the brunt of the effects of the crisis, in part because most people live close to sea level. On these islands, between 80% and 95% of the food on supermarket shelves is imported from elsewhere, and in the Caribbean, there\u2019s some evidence to suggest that warehouses and supermarkets only have a month\u2019s worth of stock available at any given time. There are few commercial farms on these islands and people have struggled to get agricultural projects up and running because of the likelihood of severe floods and destructive storms. Imported foods tend to be highly processed and saltier, sweeter and unhealthier overall, causing high rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). As a result, people who live in one of the 39 small island nations are the most likely to die from one of the four main NCDs: cancer, diabetes, heart disease and lung disease. 9. The stress of extreme heat The scorching temperatures this year broke records in Europe, China and North America. Heat is one of the most dangerous effects of the climate crisis and the top cause of weather-related deaths in the US. One of the ways the human body keeps itself cool is by sweating, but there are limits to this function. When it gets too hot, the body\u2019s temperature rises faster than it can cool itself down, less blood flows to other organs, and the kidneys have to work harder. This puts strain on the heart and can lead to organ failure. Heatstroke is the most serious heat-related illness. In particular, people whose jobs require long hours of physical labour in the sun face an increased risk of kidney disease as temperatures rise, research suggests. Repeated instances of heat stress can lead to permanent damage and chronic kidney disease. In June, the Guardian revealed how young migrant workers were returning to Nepal with chronic kidney disease after working in extreme heat conditions in the Gulf and Malaysia. \u201cOne factor highlighted again and again is heat. Prolonged exposure to heat and repeated dehydration,\u201d Rishi Kumar Kafle, the director of Nepal\u2019s National Kidney Center, said. For people who live with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, the effects of heat stress can start much more quickly. When it\u2019s hot, more people with diabetes are admitted to hospital with dangerously low blood sugar. 10. Millions on the move It\u2019s hard to predict exactly how many people will be on the move because of the climate crisis, but extreme weather events are likely to make conditions worse for the more than 100 million displaced people around the world. Many of these people have been forced to move countries by conflict and violence, but the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, an international NGO, says that climate disaster is a significant contributor to the rising numbers of people displaced within their own countries. Flooding in Pakistan in 2022 led to 10 million internally displaced people out of a record 71 million globally. If nothing changes, the number of people who need humanitarian aid to recover from floods, storms and droughts could double by 2050, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. That means more than 200 million people will need aid annually. The displacement of millions of people also means cramped and often unsanitary living. For example, more than 900,000 Rohingya refugees live in makeshift shelters in Bangladesh, often built on unstable ground that\u2019s prone to landslides. On top of the illnesses that already spike in the rainy season (such as dengue fever and malaria), frequent storms also make diarrhoeal diseases more likely. Migration also makes it much harder to manage chronic illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and kidney disease."

            "date": "2023-11-13T00:01:17Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s carbon emissions could peak this year before falling into a structural decline for the first time from next year after a record surge in clean energy investments, according to research. Emissions from the world\u2019s most polluting country have rebounded this year after the Chinese government dropped its Covid restrictions in January, according to analysis undertaken for Carbon Brief. However, this rebound in fossil fuel demand emerged alongside a historic expansion of the country\u2019s low-carbon energy sources, which was far in excess of policymakers\u2019 targets and expectations. Beijing\u2019s solar and wind installation targets for the year were met by September, according to the report, and the market share of electric vehicles is already well ahead of the government\u2019s 20% target for 2025. \u201cThese record additions are all but guaranteed to push fossil-fuel electricity generation and CO2 emissions into decline in 2024,\u201d Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and the author of the report. The most striking growth has been in solar power, according to Myllyvirta. Solar installations increased by 210 gigawatts (GW) this year alone, which is twice the total solar capacity of the US and four times what China added in 2020. The analysis, which is based on official figures and commercial data, found that China installed 70GW of wind power this year \u2013 more than the entire power generation capacity of the UK. It is also expected to add 7GW of hydro power and 3GW of nuclear power capacity this year, said the report. Myllyvirta said the boom in clean energy generation could trigger a decline in China\u2019s emissions from next year despite a wave of new coal plants across the country. \u201cThis is because \u2013 for the first time \u2013 the rate of low-carbon energy expansion is now sufficient to not only meet, but exceed the average annual increase in China\u2019s demand for electricity overall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this pace is maintained, or accelerated, it would mean that China\u2019s electricity generation from fossil fuels would enter a period of structural decline \u2013 which would also be a first. Moreover, this structural decline could come about despite the new wave of coal plant permitting and construction in the country,\u201d Myllyvirta added. China had 136GW of coal power capacity already under construction at the end of June, with a further 99GW with planning permits. Another 25GW has been permitted since then, according to the research, which would breach a policy pledge made by the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to \u201cstrictly control new coal-fired power generation projects\u201d. China has forecast that its coal power capacity will peak at 1,370GW in 2030, which would require either an immediate end to new coal power permits, or an accelerated shutdown of existing and planned coal plants, said Myllyvirta. The findings support forecasts from energy experts that emissions from global electricity generation could reach a peak this year before a peak in all energy emissions from next year. A report by climate thinktank Ember last month found that the growth of renewables was so rapid that it was close to the rate required for the world to triple its capacity by the end of the decade to meet climate targets. In recent weeks, the International Energy Agency added that emissions from all energy sources \u2013 including fossil fuels used for heating and fuels \u2013 could peak in 2025 before starting to decline in a historic turning point for the energy industry."

The richest 1% of humanity is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest 66%, with dire consequences for vulnerable communities and global efforts to tackle the climate emergency, according to the most comprehensive study of global climate inequality ever undertaken. For the past six months, the Guardian has worked with Oxfam, the Stockholm Environment Institute and other experts on an exclusive basis to produce a special investigation, The Great Carbon Divide. It explores the causes and consequences of carbon inequality and the disproportionate impact of super-rich individuals, who have been termed \u201cthe polluter elite\u201d. The Oxfam report shows that that this elite group, made up of 77 million people including billionaires, millionaires and those paid more than US$140,000 (\u00a3112,500) a year, accounted for 16% of all CO2 emissions in 2019 \u2013 enough to cause more than a million excess deaths due to heat, according to the report. The report shows that while the wealthiest 1% tend to live climate-insulated, air-conditioned lives, their emissions \u2013 5.9bn tonnes of CO2 in 2019 \u2013 are responsible for immense suffering. Climate justice will be high on the agenda of this month\u2019s UN Cop28 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates. Twelve billionaires\u2019 climate emissions outpollute 2.1m homes. Who are they? The tycoons include the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, the tech billionaires Bill Gates, Larry Page and Michael Dell, the inventor and social media company owner Elon Musk and the Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim. What is the great carbon divide? We are not equally to blame for rising temperatures, and recognising that is an important step in identifying possible solutions. Jonathan Watts explains. Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter and former first lady, dies aged 96 Rosalynn Carter, wife of the 39th president Jimmy Carter, has died at the couple\u2019s Georgia home aged 96. Carter, who became one of the nation\u2019s leading mental health advocates during and after her husband\u2019s time in the White House, was diagnosed with dementia in May. On Friday, her family announced she had entered hospice care at home, joining her 99-year-old husband in end-of-life treatment in the Plains one-story residence they shared since before Jimmy Carter was elected a Georgia state senator in 1962. The former president has been in hospice care there since February after declining further medical intervention for his own health issues. What has Jimmy Carter said about his wife\u2019s death? \u201cRosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cShe gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it.

Israel warned residents of Gaza\u2019s largest refugee camp, Jabalia, and a nearby coastal camp to evacuate, while the military said on Sunday it was \u201cexpanding its operational activities in additional neighbourhoods\u201d of Gaza. After intense bombardment, an AFP journalist in the territory saw columns of smoke rising from Jabalia, in northern Gaza, yesterday. A Hamas health official said more than 80 people were killed in twin strikes on Jabalia on Saturday, including on a UN school sheltering displaced people. Social media videos verified by AFP showed bodies covered in blood and dust on the floor of a building, where mattresses had been wedged under school tables.

            "date": "2023-11-27T04:05:08Z",
            "content": "Planned gas developments on Western Australia\u2019s Burrup Hub led by Woodside Energy could result in twice as much greenhouse gas being emitted as any other Australian fossil fuel development up for approval, according to an analysis by environment groups. The analysis led by Greenpeace estimated the Burrup Hub expansion could lead to 6.1bn tonnes of CO2 across the decades ahead if fully developed \u2013 roughly 13 times what Australia emits annually. Most of the emissions would be released when the gas was sold and burned overseas. The scale of the development plans \u2013 including opening the proposed Scarborough and Browse gas fields and extending the life of Woodside Energy\u2019s North West Shelf liquified natural gas (LNG) processing plant until 2070 \u2013 was the focus of a Monday meeting in Canberra between independent, Labor and Greens MPs and WA climate campaigners. The roundtable discussion in federal parliament follows the WA government substantially increasing its rhetorical support for gas industry expansion. The premier, Roger Cook, told an energy transition summit earlier this month more WA gas could lead to emissions increasing in the state in the short-term but that would be good for the planet as it would lead to a \u201cdramatic reduction\u201d in global emissions by displacing coal overseas. The claim has not been backed by evidence. The proposed expansion has also been publicly backed by the federal government. The resources minister, Madeleine King, said the Browse gas field was \u201cimportant to the future gas supply of Western Australia and our regional partners\u201d. Federal independent WA MP Kate Chaney, who co-hosted the roundtable with Labor backbencher Josh Wilson, said politicians should understand the \u201csheer scale\u201d of what was planned on the Burrup Hub and what it meant for emissions. \u201cIt really is pretty extraordinary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt dwarfs anything else in this space and I struggle to see how we can reach our federal emissions reduction targets if it keeps expanding gas like this.\u201d Chaney said she was concerned WA\u2019s strong support for gas expansion risked creating \u201cstranded assets\u201d \u2013 the International Energy Agency has forecast demand for coal, oil and gas could peak this decade \u2013 and that there would also be an opportunity cost if the state directed limited resources and equipment to fossil fuel developments at the expense of renewable energy and critical minerals. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup She said the federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, should assess the full impact of the North West Shelf expansion given its national importance. Wilson, the member for Fremantle, said he supported efforts \u201cin the cause of environmental and climate protection\u201d, especially when it raised awareness \u201cabout the precious and fragile treasures\u201d in WA. \u201cAs we work to strengthen Australia\u2019s protective frameworks we should lean our weight towards protective outcomes because we know that up to now the balance in decision-making has too often been struck against the environment and against Aboriginal heritage,\u201d he said. The proposed North West Shelf processing facility life extension sits with the WA appeals convenor, which will make a recommendation to the state government. The WA Environment Protection Authority last year recommended it be approved. The project also needs federal approval. The federal environment said it had paused its assessment of the North West Shelf project extension until it received further information from the proponent. That consideration is running alongside calls from gas industry leaders for legal changes to allow faster approval of offshore gas developments, and to reduce the possibility of successful court challenges. Work on Woodside\u2019s $16.5bn Scarborough gas field and Santos\u2019 $6bn Barossa gas development has been delayed after the federal court found the companies had not properly consulted with traditional owners. King told the WA summit earlier this month she understood the gas industry\u2019s concerns and the government was working \u201cto address these issues\u201d, but the sector must \u201cdo better\u201d on consultation and should acknowledge it had also repeatedly delayed major investment decisions. She said if Australia stopped supplying LNG to its neighbours it did not necessarily mean that they would stop using it."

The Oxfam report shows that while the wealthiest 1% tend to live climate-insulated, air-conditioned lives, their emissions \u2013 5.9bn tonnes of CO2 in 2019 \u2013 are responsible for immense suffering. Using a \u201cmortality cost\u201d formula \u2013 used by the US Environmental Protection Agency, among others \u2013 of 226 excess deaths worldwide for every million tonnes of carbon, the report calculates that the emissions from the 1% alone would be enough to cause the heat-related deaths of 1.3 million people over the coming decades. Over the period from 1990 to 2019, the accumulated emissions of the 1% were equivalent to wiping out last year\u2019s harvests of EU corn, US wheat, Bangladeshi rice and Chinese soya beans. The suffering falls disproportionately upon people living in poverty, marginalised ethnic communities, migrants and women and girls, who live and work outside or in homes vulnerable to extreme weather, according to the research. These groups are less likely to have savings, insurance or social protection, which leaves them more economically, as well as physically, at risk from floods, drought, heatwaves and forest fires. The UN says developing countries account for 91% of deaths related to extreme weather. The report finds that it would take about 1,500 years for someone in the bottom 99% to produce as much carbon as the richest billionaires do in a year. \u201cThe super-rich are plundering and polluting the planet to the point of destruction and it is those who can least afford it who are paying the highest price,\u201d said Chiara Liguori, Oxfam\u2019s senior climate justice policy adviser. The twin crises of climate and inequality were \u201cfuelling one another\u201d, she said. The wealth gap between nations only partly explains the disparity. The report shows that in 2019 \u2013 the most recent year for which there is comprehensive data \u2013 high-income countries (mostly in the global north) were responsible for 40% of global consumption-based CO2 emissions, while the contribution from low-income countries (mostly in the global south) was a negligible 0.4%. Africa, which is home to about one in six of the world population, was responsible for just 4% of emissions. A less discussed but faster-growing problem is inequality within countries. Billionaires are still overwhelmingly white, male and based in the US and Europe, but members of this influential class of super-rich can increasingly be found in other parts of the world. Millionaires are even more dispersed. The report says this is bad news for the climate on multiple levels. The extravagant carbon footprint of the 0.1% \u2013 from superyachts, private jets and mansions to space flights and doomsday bunkers \u2013 is 77 times higher than the upper level needed for global warming to peak at 1.5C. The corporate shares of many super-rich are highly polluting. This elite also wield enormous and growing political power by owning media organisations and social networks, hiring advertising and PR agencies and lobbyists, and mixing socially with senior politicians, who are also often members of the richest 1%, according to the report. In the US, for example, one in four members of Congress reportedly own stocks in fossil fuel companies, worth a total of between $33m and $93m. The report says this helps to explain why global emissions continue to rise, and why governments in the global north provided $1.8tn to subsidise the fossil fuel industry in 2020, contrary to their international pledges to phase out carbon emissions. Oxfam is calling for hefty wealth taxes on the super-rich and windfall taxes on fossil fuel companies to support the worst affected, reduce inequality and fund a transition to renewable energy. It says a 60% tax on the incomes of the wealthiest 1% would raise $6.4tn a year and could cut emissions by 695m tonnes, which is more than the 2019 footprint of the UK. Oxfam International\u2019s interim executive director, Amitabh Behar, said: \u201cNot taxing wealth allows the richest to rob from us, ruin our planet and renege on democracy. Taxing extreme wealth transforms our chances to tackle both inequality and the climate crisis. These are trillions of dollars at stake to invest in dynamic 21st-century green governments, but also to re-inject into our democracies.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-14T05:00:20Z",
            "content": "Coal must be phased out seven times faster than is now happening, deforestation must be reduced four times faster, and public transport around the world built out six times faster than at present, if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown, new research has found. Countries are falling behind on almost every policy required to cut greenhouse gas emissions, despite progress on renewable energy and the uptake of electric vehicles. This failure makes the prospect of holding global temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels even more remote, according to the State of Climate Action 2023 report. The authors advise that world needs to: Retire about 240 average-sized coal-fired power plants a year, every year between now and 2030. Construct the equivalent of three New Yorks\u2019 worth of public transport systems in cities around the world each year this decade. Halt deforestation, which is happening to an area the size of 15 football pitches every minute, this decade. Increase the rate of growth of solar and wind power from its current high of 14% a year to 24% a year. Cut meat consumption from ruminants such as cows and sheep to about two servings a week in the US, Europe and other high-consuming countries by 2030. The prospect of staying within 1.5C will slip away altogether without drastic action, the authors warned. Sophie Boehm, research associate at the World Resources Institute and lead author of the report, said: \u201cGlobal efforts to limit warming to 1.5C are lacklustre at best. Despite decades of dire warnings and wake-up calls, our leaders have largely failed to mobilise climate action anywhere near the pace and scale needed. Such delays leave us with very few routes to secure a livable future for all.\u201d She added: \u201cThere\u2019s no time left to tinker at the edges. Instead, we need immediate, transformational changes across every single sector this decade.\u201d Public funding of fossil fuels continues, despite countries\u2019 commitments made two years ago in Glasgow at Cop26, to limit global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Many countries are also still expanding their fossil fuel production: for instance, in the UK, the government last week announced new annual licensing rounds for exploration projects in the North Sea. Countries including the UK are also increasing subsidies and tax breaks for fossil fuels. After Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, government financing for fossil fuels increased sharply: subsidies almost doubled from 2020 rates, to reach the highest levels seen in nearly a decade, according to the report. The State of Climate Action 2023 report, published on Tuesday and compiled by six climate thinktanks, examined all aspects of climate policy from governments across the world. Although other recent studies have found a rapid acceleration of the uptake of green technology around the world, including the expansion of renewable energy, the report found few bright spots. Sales of electric vehicles are booming, having more than tripled since 2020. But that is the only measure of the 42 indicators studied that was found to be progressing at the rate needed to cut emissions by nearly half this decade compared with 1990 levels, which is required to give the world a chance of staying within the 1.5C limit. According to the International Energy Agency, if all countries were to fulfil the pledges they have made to reduce carbon, global heating would reach about 1.7C above preindustrial temperatures. But this relies on countries implementing policies rather than simply stating goals, and the State of Climate Action report shows that countries have so far failed to come forward with the policy measures necessary to meet their goals, and to implement fully policies that they do have. Razan Al Mubarak, the UN high level champion on climate change, and part of the United Arab Emirates team that will host the Cop28 summit in Dubai later this month, called on all countries to re-examine their policies. \u201cWorld leaders must recognise the insufficient progress to date and chart a path forward that builds on the successes we are seeing. This moment should serve as a springboard for accelerated actions,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2023-11-29T05:20:09Z",
            "content": "Medical testing company Australian Clinical Labs had \u201cserious and systemic failures\u201d that resulted in a cyber-attack that led to more than 200,000 customer health records and credit card details being published on the dark web, the Australian information commissioner has alleged. In October last year, in the midst of the Medibank and Optus cyber-attacks, Medlab\u2019s parent company, ACL, confirmed it had been the victim of a cyber-attack eight months earlier in February. The hacker group responsible \u2013 known as Quantum \u2013 was able to exfiltrate 86GB worth of data, including customer passport information, health information, and credit card details including number, expiry date and CCV. The data had been published on the dark web on 16 June last year, four months before ACL publicly confirmed the attack. This month, the Office of the Australian information commissioner (OAIC) took ACL to court over its failure to protect customer data during the breach. The OAIC\u2019s concise statement, released last week, alleges significant failures by the company to protect customer data and inform the commissioner about the breach when required. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup According to the documents, within four hours from the time the first employee noticed the ransomware message on a desktop computer in Medlab, it had spread to other computers in Brisbane and Sydney, which were then encrypted by the attackers. ACL, which generated revenue of almost $1bn during the 2022 financial year, did not have a dedicated cybersecurity team, the documents state. Its response was led by an IT team leader, overseen by ACL\u2019s CIO and head of technical services, but the OAIC alleges none of these staff had formal cybersecurity qualifications or experience in responding to a cyber-attack. The head of technical services provided the IT team leader with the company\u2019s playbook for ransomware and malware, but the IT team leader had not been trained to use these books, and OAIC alleges critical steps in the playbook were not followed, including analysing the ransomware. The company then brought in a third-party company, StickmanCyber, to assist in the response. The OAIC found that monitoring agents were only deployed on three of the at least 121 computers infected with ransomware. StickmanCyber\u2019s short engagement with ACL, including reviewing one hour of firewall logs and dark web scans, concluded at the time no data had been taken. By 21 March 2022 the IT team leader, after a conversation with the company\u2019s general counsel, sent an email stating \u201cas per information available to the IT department there was no unauthorised access, disclosure, or loss of any personal information \u2026 as a result of the incident\u201d. The company did not inform the OAIC about the attack. On 25 March, the Australian Cyber Security Centre informed ACL it had intelligence that Medlab may be a victim of a ransomware attack, and reminded ACL of its notification requirements. ACL did not investigate further, OAIC alleges. ACSC alerted ACL again on 16 June that data had been published to the dark web. It would take the company nearly one month (10 July) to inform the OAIC, which OAIC alleges is in breach of the act. ACL would take until October to announce the breach publicly. The OAIC alleges ACL was \u201caware of serious deficiencies in its cybersecurity framework\u201d at least nine months before the cyber-attack, and did not take appropriate steps to protect personal information. The OAIC said the failures were \u201cserious and systemic\u201d, noting that ACL\u2019s IT budget was $1.3m in 2022, with a cybersecurity budget of $350,000 \u2013 \u201csignificantly lower than that of industry standards\u201d, the OAIC alleges. The OAIC is seeking civil penalties and costs. A spokesperson for ACL said the company is \u201cvigorously defending the action\u201d. The case continues. The OAIC is still investigating Optus and Medibank over cyber-attacks last year, which could lead to similar court action against the two companies."

            "date": "2023-11-15T02:41:21Z",
            "content": "Just days after a major ports company was forced to shut down operations due to a cyber-attack, the Australian Signals Directorate has issued a strong warning that Australia\u2019s critical infrastructure is under regular targeted and opportunistic cyber attack. DP World Australia, the country\u2019s biggest ports operator, closed its Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Fremantle port operations after detecting unauthorised access on its network on Friday. The company shut off its internet connection to stop the unauthorised access, meaning operations at those ports had to stop. Cargo and containers were stuck on the docks until Monday, when DP World was able to restore shipping operations. In its annual cyber threat report released on Wednesday, ASD revealed that in the last financial year the agency responded to 143 incidents at critical infrastructure entities such as ports, up from 95 incidents in the previous year. The vast majority of the reports related to low-level attacks or isolated issues, such as compromised accounts or credentials. ASD said critical infrastructure tends to have a broad attack surface, remote access, connected systems and third parties, which make it of interest to malicious actors. \u201cEven when [operational technology] is not directly targeted, attacks on connected corporate networks can disrupt the operation of critical infrastructure providers.\u201d Infrastructure entities are targeted by both opportunistic cyber criminals and state actors, ASD said. And some state actors \u201care willing to use cyber capabilities to destabilise and disrupt systems and infrastructure\u201d. ASD said such critical entities should err on the side of caution and report anomalous activity early. Air Marshall Darren Goldie, Australia\u2019s cybersecurity coordinator, told Guardian Australia on Monday that in DP World\u2019s case the quick return of operations showed the company had \u201ca solid security plan in place\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a highly effective response from the company \u2013 quick engagement of a commercial service provider and frequent and very transparent engagement with the commonwealth.\u201d He said the company had not received a ransom demand after detecting the activity, and there has been no determination as to who might have been behind the attack. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing ransomware actors going wherever they can find trade, and by definition our ports move a lot of material. There\u2019s a lot of money involved with the movement of cargo, so to them it would be seen as rich pickings. \u201cI have absolutely no information on that at all but I would say the criminal groups are moving from sector to sector to wherever they can find a vulnerability and are not being discriminate.\u201d Goldie was involved in a 16-week government response to the ransomware attack on the lawfirm HWL Ebsworth, which resulted in terabytes of client documents \u2013 including from 65 government agencies \u2013 being posted on the dark web. He is preparing a short public report on the attack to be published by the end of this year. Overall in the last financial year, ASD responded to 1,100 cybersecurity incidents, 10% of which were ransomware attacks. The agency informed 158 entities of ransomware activity on their networks."

            "content": "The British Library has confirmed that personal data stolen in a cyber-attack has appeared online, apparently for sale to the highest bidder. The attack was carried out in October by a group known for such criminal activity, said the UK\u2019s national library, which holds about 14m books and millions of other items. This week, Rhysida, a known ransomware group, claimed it was responsible for the attack. It posted low-resolution images of personal information online, offering stolen data for sale with a starting bid of 20 bitcoins (about \u00a3596,000). Rhysida said the data was \u201cexclusive, unique and impressive\u201d and that it would be sold to a single buyer. It set a deadline for bids of 27 November. The images appear to show employment contracts and passport information. The library said it was \u201caware that some data has been leaked, which appears to be from files relating to our internal HR information\u201d. It did not confirm that Rhysida was responsible for the attack, nor that the data offered for sale was information on personnel. Academics and researchers who use the library have been told that disruption to the institution\u2019s services after the serious ransomware attack was likely to continue for months. This week, the library advised its users to change any logins also used on other sites as a precaution. It added: \u201cWe have taken targeted protective measures to ensure the integrity of our systems, and we continue to undertake an investigation with the support of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Metropolitan police and cybersecurity specialists. As this investigation remains ongoing, we cannot provide further details at this time.\u201d The attack took place on 31 October. Since then, the library\u2019s website has been shut down, with updates posted on X and emailed to members. The library said: \u201cThe outage is affecting our website, online systems and services, as well as some onsite services including our reading rooms and public wifi. We anticipate restoring many services in the next few weeks but some disruption may persist for longer.\u201d Its sites in London and Yorkshire were open to the public as normal, it added. Earlier this month, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned of the threat posed by Rhysida. A joint statement said: \u201cThreat actors leveraging Rhysida ransomware are known to impact \u2018targets of opportunity\u2019, including victims in the education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government sectors.\u201d The group is behind recent attacks on the Chilean army, the Portuguese city of Gondomar and the University of the West of Scotland. An NCSC spokesperson said: \u201cWe are working with the British Library to fully understand the impact of an incident. Ransomware is the key cyber threat facing the UK, and all organisations should take immediate steps to limit risk by following our advice on how to put in place robust defences to protect their networks.\u201d Roly Keating, the chief executive of the British Library, said: \u201cWe are immensely grateful to our many users and partners who have shown such patience and support as we work to analyse the impact of this criminal attack and identify what we need to do to restore our online systems in a safe and sustainable manner.\u201d"

            "content": "A cyber-attack has shut down emergency rooms in at least three states, a hospital operator warned on Monday, forcing the organization to divert patients to other facilities. Ardent Health, which oversees 30 hospitals in states across the US, including New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, said it had been targeted by a ransomware attack over the Thanksgiving holiday. The attack had shut down a significant number of its computerized services, the company said in a news release. \u201cIn an abundance of caution, our facilities are rescheduling some non-emergent, elective procedures and diverting some emergency room patients to other area hospitals until systems are back online,\u201d Ardent Health\u2019s release said. Each of the affected Ardent hospital chains \u2013 Hillcrest HealthCare in Oklahoma, Lovelace Health in New Mexico, and UT Health in Texas \u2013 said that some of their emergency rooms were transferring patients to other hospitals. The hospital operator said the cyber-attack has affected computer programs that track patients\u2019 healthcare records, among others. In its statement, Ardent said the ransomware attack had taken its network offline. The company said it reported the issue to law enforcement as well as retained third-party forensic and threat intelligence advisers. \u201cAt this time, we cannot confirm the extent of any patient health or financial data that has been compromised,\u201d Ardent said. Ransomware attacks that disrupt healthcare providers\u2019 operations are becoming increasingly common. Brett Callow, an analyst at the cybersecurity company Emsisoft, told NBC News that there had been at least 35 in US this year. Attacks commonly occur over holiday periods when hackers believe there are fewer security staff on duty. Law-enforcement officials, including the FBI, advise victims of ransomware attacks to not agree to ransom demands. \u201cWe need victims not to pay the ransom because that\u2019s the gasoline that\u2019s pouring on the fire,\u201d the FBI director, Christopher Wray, said in February this year. \u201cThe more people pay, the price goes up and the more victims there are. So we have a shared common interest in not having the ransoms get paid.\u201d The targeting of hospitals \u2013 and demands for extortion payments \u2013 began in 2016, according to the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. The ransomware analyst Allan Liska told NBC in June that there had been at least 300 documented attacks a year on healthcare facilities since 2020. In June, St Margaret\u2019s Health in Spring Valley, Illinois, was forced to close, partly as a result of an attack. Ardent is believed to be the largest health operator to be hit so far. While there are no cases of patients dying as a result of an attack, studies had shown that there is a link between ransomware attacks on hospitals and increased mortality rates, according to NBC. Ardent, which started out running psychiatric hospitals, said that patient care continued to be delivered \u201csafely and effectively in its hospitals, emergency rooms, and clinics\u201d. But out of \u201can abundance of caution\u201d, the company said, it was rescheduling some non-emergent, elective procedures and diverting some emergency room patients to other area hospitals until systems are back online. \u201cArdent is still determining the full impact of this event and it is too soon to know how long this will take or what data may be involved in this incident,\u201d the company added."

            "date": "2023-11-24T16:00:24Z",
            "content": "A new name was added to the cyber-rogues\u2019 gallery of ransomware gangs this week after a criminal group called Rhysida claimed responsibility for an attack on the British Library. The library confirmed that personal data stolen in a cyber-attack last month has appeared for sale online. While the name behind the attack might be relatively new, the criminal technique is not. Ransomware gangs render an organisation\u2019s computers inaccessible by infecting them with malicious software \u2013 malware \u2013 and then demanding a payment, typically in cryptocurrency, to unlock the files. In recent years, however, in a process dubbed \u201cdouble extortion\u201d, the majority of gangs steal data at the same time and threaten to release it online, which they hope will strengthen their negotiating hand. Rhysida emerged as the assailant this week by posting low-resolution images of personal information gathered in the attack online, offering the stolen data for sale on its leak site with a starting bid of 20 bitcoin, or about \u00a3590,000. Rafe Pilling, the director of threat research at cybersecurity firm Secureworks, said: \u201cThis a classic example of a double extortion ransomware attack and they are using the threat of leaking or selling stolen data as leverage to extort a payment.\u201d While the British Library is a high-profile UK victim for Rhysida \u2013 named after a type of centipede \u2013 the group is also responsible for attacks on government institutions in Portugal, Chile and Kuwait. In August, it claimed responsibility for an attack on the US hospital group Prospect Medical Holdings. US government agencies released an advisory note on Rhysida last week, stating that the \u201cemerging ransomware variant\u201d had been deployed against the education, manufacturing, IT and government sectors since May. The agencies said they had also seen the Rhysida gang running a \u201cransomware as a service\u201d (Raas) operation, where it hires out the malware to criminals and shares any ransom proceeds. Rhysida\u2019s name is new to the public, but according to Secureworks it has emerged from a criminal operation established in 2021. Secureworks calls that group Gold Victor and it operated a ransomware scheme called Vice Society. This rebranding exercise is common among criminal gangs \u2013 they are often named after the ransomware variant they deploy \u2013 if their existing \u201cbrand\u201d becomes excessively notorious and attracts too much attention from law enforcement. The brand is often attached at the end of the encrypted file names left after an attack, in an act that Rafe describes as leaving a \u201ccalling card\u201d. The exact identity of the Rhysida gang is not known, but Pilling assumes that it follows the pattern of similar operatives who are usually from Russia or members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, whose constituents include Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. \u201cI would assume that they are probably Russian-speaking but we don\u2019t have any hard evidence,\u201d said Pilling. According to the US agencies, gangs using the Rhysida ransomware have used organisations\u2019 virtual private networks \u2013 the systems used by staff to access their employers\u2019 systems remotely \u2013 to get into systems, or have deployed the familiar technique of phishing attacks, where victims are tricked, usually via email, into clicking on a link that downloads malicious software or tricks them into handing over details such as passwords. \u201cThese are common access techniques,\u201d said Spilling. Once inside, the gangs typically lurk in the system for a period of time. According to Secureworks, that dwell time for attacks has fallen to less than 24 hours for cybergangs in general, compared with more than four days in 2022. This helps avoid detection. According to the US agencies document, cryptocurrency is a common form of ransom demand for Rhysida attackers, in line with the rest of the criminal hacking fraternity. A digital asset like bitcoin is popular with ransomware gangs because it is decentralised \u2013 it operates outside the conventional banking system and therefore bypasses standard checks \u2013 and transactions can be obscured, making them more difficult to track. Rhysida attackers send their ransom notes with the title \u201cCriticalBreachDetected\u201d in a PDF file. The note provides each recipient with a unique code and instructions to contact the group via a specialist web browser that makes communications untraceable. Paying ransomware demands in the UK is heavily frowned upon but it not illegal, unless you know \u2013 or suspect \u2013 that the proceeds are going into terrorists\u2019 pockets. According to the National Cyber Security Centre: \u201cLaw enforcement does not encourage, endorse nor condone the payment of ransom demands.\u201d In the US, payment of ransoms is also discouraged by the government, but an advisory note from the US Treasury in 2020 emphasised this was \u201cexplanatory only\u201d and did \u201cnot have the force of law\u201d. Ransomware payments are rising, according to the British cybersecurity firm Sophos. It reported that average ransomware payments have nearly doubled to \u00a31.2m over the past year. Against this backdrop, new ransomware \u201cbrands\u201d will continue to emerge."

            "content": "The US GDP figures show that the world\u2019s largest economy is still humming. The Federal Reserve must decide if it thinks that inflationary pressures are still present, or if the recent strength will prove to be a peak. If economic activity has peaked, then the Fed will want to engineer the fabled soft landing: a cooling economy without a recession. That would also help the White House in 2024, an election year. Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm, a wealth manager, said: While the GDP growth estimates were revised higher, price indicators were revised lower, with the personal consumption expenditure price indicator rising 2.8% versus a preliminary estimate of 2.9%. Today\u2019s figures prove that despite the Federal Reserve having raised its benchmark interest rates 11 times since March 2022, the US economy remains resilient, even as inflation has begun to slow. As we move into 2024, the focus will now be on when the Federal Reserve feels comfortable in reducing rates as it tries to pilot the US economy towards a soft landing. In other business news today: The competition watchdog is launching an investigation into the baby formula market after finding manufacturers raised prices by 25% in two years and managed to increase profit margins during the cost of living crisis. The regulator will also investigate the effect on consumers of the rise of loyalty card price cuts amid concerns that they could limit competition and lead to price rises for shoppers not signed up to such marketing schemes. A group of MPs including the former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith have asked ministers to use national security law to investigate the Barclay family\u2019s proposed deal to give control of the Daily Telegraph to a consortium backed by the United Arab Emirates. Continued tough action by central banks to tackle stubborn inflation risks tipping Britain and other developed countries into recession next year, the west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has warned.

JJ It will take more than a few rate hikes to tip up the US economy, if the third-quarter data is any guide. Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said: Today\u2019s US GDP revision for the third quarter shows an economy that keeps on rolling, despite the continued rate hikes and the risks that were spelled out from the OECD today. Compared to the second quarter, the US consumer is showing surprising resilience with spending called out by the Bureau of Economic Analysis as boosting the level of growth. Disposable incomes have increased by 0.1% in Q3 \u2013 much slower than the 3.5% growth seen in Q2 but nevertheless much better than the contraction pencilled into early Q3 estimates. James highlighted that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has predicted a soft landing \u2013 avoiding a recession \u2013 for the US economy. It raised its forecasts for 2024 from 1% to 1.3%. She said: The US economy is showing serious resilience in the face of strong economic headwinds. Ultimately this underlines the message from central banks of interest rates being \u2018higher for longer\u2019, and it will be some time before the Federal Reserve feels like it is in a position to cut. The US economy, the world\u2019s largest, grew faster than in any quarter since the end of 2021 in the third quarter. You can see the story of the US economy since the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns: a huge decline, followed by a huge snap back, and then more than a year of rapid growth thanks to huge government and central bank stimulus. The early 2022 slowdown is now far behind, but policymakers\u2019 thoughts have turned to how to engineer a \u201csoft landing\u201d: i.e., hoping that the economy will cool without a recession. It was mainly upward revisions to business investment that pushed US GDP higher than economists had predicted. There was a big increase in investment in buildings (\u201cstructures\u201d in the below table) by businesses, as well as in residential property, according to Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab &amp; Co, a broker: The strength of the US economy could worry the Federal Reserve, which is deciding whether to keep rates on hold, according to Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments. He said: Revisions higher in business investment and government spending seem to be the bigger needle movers in this GDP release while consumer spending advanced a more modest 3.6%. Even with this higher growth rate, the consensus seems to still suggest rates have peaked and that may be corroborated in modestly weaker consumer spending. However, the resilience of US growth will continue to worry the Federal Reserve. The US economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter of 2023, according to revised data. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 5.2% in the third quarter of 2023, according to the second estimate released by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Economists had expected an upward revision from the first estimate of 4.9%, but it was faster than the 5% annualised growth predicted in a poll of economists.

The deal with Guardian Media Group, the parent company of the Guardian and Observer newspapers and international digital businesses, will give SPE exclusive first-look rights to Guardian\u2019s global journalism. The collaboration agreement spans SPE\u2019s production companies \u2013 which include Left Bank Pictures, which made The Crown; Bad Wolf, which produced His Dark Materials; and Eleven, the company behind Sex Education \u2013 as well as the US giant\u2019s film division, which includes Columbia, TriStar and 3000. The Guardian picked up the best documentary short film Academy Award in 2021 for Colette, which told the story of 90-year-old Colette Marin-Catherine, one of the last surviving members of the French resistance. This followed Black Sheep, which made the Oscar nominations list in the same category in 2019. We can see it now: \u201cBusiness Live: The Movie\u201d (starring: Graeme Wearden; featuring: an assortment from the business desk). A group of MPs including the former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith have asked the government to use national security law to investigate the Barclay family\u2019s proposed deal to hand control of the Telegraph to a consortium backed by the United Arab Emirates. The group of 18 MPs, which also includes Alicia Kearns, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, have written to the deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, arguing that the proposed deal poses a \u201cvery real potential national security threat\u201d. Under the planned deal, RedBird IMI \u2013 a joint venture between the US company RedBird Capital and International Media Investments (IMI) of Abu Dhabi \u2013 has agreed to repay the Barclay family\u2019s debts to Lloyds, which seized control of the titles in June. IMI is the investment vehicle for Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates, which also provides most of the funding for Redbird IMI. The MPs call comes as Lloyds, the Barclay family and RedBird IMI, the Abu Dhabi-backed vehicle, are set to deliver a letter to Lucy Frazer, the culture secretary, giving her 48 hours notice that the \u00a31.16bn loan is ready to be repaid. Frazer is due to make a decision by Friday on whether to launch a formal investigation involving Ofcom and the competition regulator into the proposed deal on public interest grounds. Here is the letter from MPs in full: The UK\u2019s rail regulator will investigate Network Rail over poor train punctuality and reliability in between Wales and Cornwall and the capital, it said on Wednesday. The investigation will look at whether the government-owned Network Rail, which manages Great Britain\u2019s tracks, is meeting its legal obligations in Wales and the west of England, the Office and Rail and Road said. The region under investigation extends from London Paddington to Penzance via Reading, Swindon, Bristol, Exeter and Plymouth in the Western route and transports commuters to key locations such as Cardiff and Swansea in the Wales route. The passenger services are mostly operated by Great Western Railway, Transport for Wales, MTR Crossrail and CrossCountry. It said it would look at \u201cthe effectiveness of the region\u2019s performance improvement plan, whether assets are being managed appropriately and the impact of changes to the rail network on train performance\u201d. Feras Alshaker, the ORR\u2019s director of performance and planning, said: While Network Rail has begun making good progress in stabilising performance elsewhere on the network, performance in the Wales &amp; Western region has continued to deteriorate, meaning poor reliability and punctuality for passengers and freight. Our investigation will take a detailed look at the root causes of the region\u2019s performance issues and will consider wider contributing factors. As part of our work we will convene a roundtable with key players in the region to support Network Rail in taking pragmatic and effective action to improve performance for all the region\u2019s rail users. British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce wants to raise its profits by charging customers more, but the head of Dubai\u2019s Emirates airline has indicated it may have a fight on its hands. Emirates Airline president Tim Clark said he told Rolls-Royce of the \u201cneed to go back to basics\u201d and \u201cdesign engines that meet what the client base wants\u201d, in an interview with Reuters. Rolls-Royce boss Tufan Erginbilgi\u00e7 on Tuesday laid out plans to quadruple annual operating profits by cutting costs and increasing prices for customers, among them airlines who buy engines and contracts to maintain them from Rolls-Royce. The engine maker should not be \u201cover-greedy\u201d when it came to charging clients more, Clark said. He has previously criticised Rolls-Royce over problems with parts needing repair sooner than expected Clark said: If you have an engine \u2026 not performing as it should do, your costs are going to rise. But your ability to extract value from the client is going to fall simply because the client won\u2019t accept non-performance. It\u2019s a very clear kindergarten understanding of cause and effect. Get your product right, design it to what the client wants, give it that high level of reliability. And yes, paradoxically, you can extract more value for your money for your buck in terms of your investment. I would say get your engines right \u2026 I promise you: you come up with a good engine, and we will talk to you seriously about a sort of maintenance cost, which gives you the kind of returns that you seek without being over-greedy. At lunchtime in the UK and western Europe markets are fairly flat all around. The UK\u2019s benchmark FTSE 100 has barely moved, although grocery delivery company Ocado is the top gainer, up 4.8%. (An Ocado director buying shares may have helped.) Trainer retailer JD Sports was the second biggest, up 4.5%. The FTSE was held back by British banks and financials, however. Standard Chartered and HSBC lost more than 2% apiece. In Germany the Dax benchmark is up 0.9%, with engineering manufacturer Siemens and semiconductor manufacturer Infineon among the top gainers. France\u2019s Cac 40 has gained 0.4%. The president of Cop28 has denied seeing documents suggesting the United Arab Emirates is seeking to discuss oil and gas deals at the UN climate conference. Sultan Al Jaber is Cop28 president, tasked with overseeing the climate conference, while also being the chief executive of the UAE\u2019s national oil company Adnoc. His dual role has been labelled as \u201cridiculous\u201d and a big conflict of interest by environmental scientists. Leaked documents, obtained by the Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) and seen by the Guardian, showed \u201ctalking points\u201d for meetings between the Cop28 president and governments that included offers of working with the UAE\u2019s fossil fuel producer, Adnoc, on new oil and gas extraction. Jaber told a news conference on Wednesday that he had not seen any of the documents, according to Reuters. They were his first public remarks after the leak, which was first reported by the BBC. He reportedly said: These allegations are false, not true, incorrect, are not accurate. And it\u2019s an attempt to undermine the work of the COP28 presidency, I promise you, never ever did I see these talking points that they refer to or that I ever even used such talking points in my discussions. The London Metal Exchange (LME) has won a legal victory in a \u00a3450m lawsuit brought by traders over the cancellation of nickel transactions after prices surged at the start of the Ukraine invasion. Elliott Management, a US hedge fund, and Jane Street Capital, a market maker, sued the LME after it cancelled trades originally made on 8 March. The exchange said the cancellation was meant to avoid disorderly trading, but the traders argued it undermined the integrity of one of the world\u2019s most important commodity trading venues. London\u2019s high court dismissed the legal challenge in a written ruling published on Wednesday. An Elliott spokesperson said the investor would appeal against the ruling. The LME\u2019s owner, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said the LME welcomed the decision. Elliott said it was \u201cnaturally disappointed by the court\u2019s decision and concerned about the precedents that it establishes for market participants in the UK\u201d. Trades on many exchanges are generally recorded, before the various transactions are \u201csettled\u201d \u2013 when the actual money or assets change hands \u2013 in batches to be more efficient. That is particularly useful when algorithms can make thousands of orders in a short period of time. However, during the market turmoil the LME reversed some trades that had not yet been settled, outraging those companies that had thought they had made huge profits. An Elliott spokesperson said: This judgment raises fundamental questions for UK market participants, who trade not only on the LME but more broadly on other exchanges, about an absence of trade certainty prior to settlement, and about a lack of effective checks and balances on UK exchanges cancelling or varying trades in ways which may protect just one cohort of traders, or even the exchanges themselves. We therefore intend to appeal the judgment and will continue to seek redress for the LME\u2019s unprecedented cancellation of trades in March 2022. The chief executive of HSBC, Noel Quinn, has reportedly warned against bankers using the removal of the UK\u2019s cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses as an opportunity to take more risks. The Conservative government is hoping to encourage higher growth, and has argued that unleashing the banking sector would help to do that. Kwasi Kwarteng, who was briefly chancellor before provoking market turmoil, claimed removing the cap would spark fresh investment from global banks \u201chere in London, not Paris, not Frankfurt, not New York\u201d. However, speaking at the Financial Times Global Banking Summit on Wednesday, Quinn said: \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of just unleashing inappropriate amounts of risk-taking.\u201d UK households increased their borrowing at the fastest rate in five years in October, according to Bank of England data, in a sign of the impact of the rising cost of living. The annual growth rate for all consumer credit hit 8.1% in October, the highest since October 2018, the Bank said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said: \u201cSome of this might be because the cost of living crisis has forced some households to borrow to fund necessary spending.\u201d However, he added that the fact that borrowing was continue to rise \u201csuggests that higher interest rates are yet to significantly crimp unsecured borrowing\u201d. There were more mortgage approvals for house purchases in October than in any month since July, but they remained below levels hit before the sharp rise in interest rates. The Bank said net mortgage approvals for house purchases rose from 43,700 in September to 47,400 in October. Dales said: Looking ahead, as the mortgage rate for existing borrowers has risen by only a third of the rate for new borrowers, a lot of the effects of higher interest rates have yet to be felt. Premium baby food costs new parents more than \u00a3500 extra in the first year of life, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has said in its review of allegations of \u201cgreedflation\u201d in food. The regulator is launching an investigation into the infant formula market after saying it was \u201cconcerned that suppliers may not have the right incentives to offer infant formula at competitive prices\u201d. The CMA said the additional cost of a \u2018premium\u2019 brand over the own-label alternative, or the cheapest-available brand, is over \u00a3500. It said that manufacturers had been able to sustain high profit margins, and raised prices faster than input costs. The report suggested that there is no real reason to pay that premium: \u201call infant formula products providing all the nutrients a healthy baby needs, until complementary feeding is introduced.\u201d The CMA named Danone as the dominant baby formula maker in the report published on Wednesday: The market for infant formula is highly concentrated, with very limited own-label presence. There is one main manufacturer, Danone, which produces the Aptamil and Cow &amp; Gate brands. Other branded manufacturers have lower shares. The other baby food makers are Nestle (SMA and Little Steps), HiPP, and Kendamil. Danone was approached for comment. Branded food makers contributed to rising inflation by hiking prices on their products more than costs \u2013 the practice known as \u201cgreedflation\u201d \u2013 the UK competition regulator has found. But it won\u2019t be taking action against most manufacturers for now because it found that there was still a competitive market. The CMA said that the most successful branded products \u2013 it named Heinz Beanz, Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Felix cat food \u2013 had the ability to raise prices in a way that unbranded products cannot. Those shoppers who stick to well known brands have been hit as their makers took higher profits, the regulator said. Infant formula, baked beans, pet food and mayonnaise have the highest margins, while poultry and milk have the lowest, the CMA said. While the choices made by some brands to increase unit profitability may have contributed to inflation, we do not, however, consider that this indicates weak or ineffective competition in manufacturing across the relevant product category (ie including both branded and own-label suppliers). It used the example of an unnamed baked beans brand (although it only named Heinz elsewhere in the report) to point out just how much more expensive branded goods can be: In November 2023, one branded tin of baked beans was nearly three times more expensive per 100g than the standard level own-label equivalent, and five times more expensive when compared to the entry-level own-label version. The CMA found evidence that shoppers are \u201ctrading down\u201d in most categories of food where own-brand options are available. Branded baked beans makers have hiked prices by more than 50% over the last two years, but their share of the market has fallen by over 10 percentage points during that time. However, the regulator said it still has concerns about the infant formula market, which it will examine further. Aldi is the only supermarket that offers own-brand infant formula, so there is much more limited competition. The share price of Halfords Group has fallen by 18% after the motoring and cycling retailer warned it was seeing signs of a UK consumer slowdown with a \u201cchallenging\u201d market for new bikes. The London-listed company said it had seen volatile trading patterns and \u201csome market softening in our discretionary big-ticket categories, which has been reflected in slower LFL [like-for-like] sales growth.\u201d The market for bikes in particular was \u201cchallenging and below expectations due to well documented consumer environment\u201d, Halfords said. Investors are on the look-out for any signs of weakening consumer appetite, as rising interest rates add to difficulties for households hard-pressed by inflation. Halfords still managed to increase its revenues by 14% to \u00a3874m in the half year to 29 September compared with the same period last year, but that was mostly thanks to strong growth in its car services business. Retail sales rose by only 3.2%. Graham Stapleton, Halfords\u2019s chief executive, said: Despite the challenging and volatile trading environment and slower than expected recovery in some of our markets, we have made a good start to the year, with substantial sales and profit growth, and increased market share across the business. At the same time, we supported our customers through the ongoing cost of living crisis by delivering great value \u2013 when they need it most. In the face of continuing economic uncertainty, we remain fully focused on optimising every element of the business, and I\u2019m particularly pleased with the very strong performance of Autocentres, where we are delivering significantly improved returns. In light of this, we are accelerating capital investment in the garage services operating model and customer experience in 10 towns in the balance of this financial year. The FTSE 100 index in London has dipped by 0.3% in the opening trades.

Food brands in the UK have pushed up their prices by more than costs increased, the UK\u2019s competition regulator has said after examining the sector in response to concerns about \u201cgreedflation\u201d adding to the cost of living crisis. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that \u201cthree-quarters of brands that provided comparable data have increased their unit profitability during the recent period of high food price inflation\u201d, in a report published on Wednesday. The regulator added that \u201cin most cases, shoppers can find cheaper alternatives\u201d, suggesting it does not have concerns over unfair competition. However, the regulator said that this was not the case in the baby formula market. It will look at whether \u201cineffective competition in the baby formula market could be leading to parents paying higher prices\u201d. It also said it will look at the impact of loyalty scheme pricing by supermarkets. Sarah Cardell, chief executive of the CMA, said: Food price inflation has put huge strain on household budgets, so it is vital competition issues aren\u2019t adding to the problem. While in most cases the leading brands have raised prices more than their own cost increases, own label products are generally providing cheaper alternatives. The picture is different when it comes to baby formula, with little evidence that people are switching to cheaper products and limited own label alternatives. We\u2019re concerned that parents may not always have the right information to make informed choices and that suppliers may not have strong incentives to offer infant formula at competitive prices. Saudi Arabia buys 10% of London Heathrow airport Saudi Arabia\u2019s powerful Public Investment Fund (PIF) has paid \u00a31bn for a stake in London\u2019s Heathrow airport, as infrastructure group Ferrovial sells a quarter of the business. Ferrovial late on Tuesday said it had agreed the sale of a quarter of London Heathrow, which it has owned for 17 years, for \u00a32.4bn.

            "content": "The US added another 150,000 jobs in October, fewer than expected, amid signs that the white-hot US jobs market is cooling. The unemployment rate rose to 3.9% from 3.8% in September. Economists had been expecting the US to add 180,000 jobs over the month. The pace of job growth slowed sharply from September when the economy added a revised 297,000 \u2013 a still impressive figure and far higher than had been expected. Our other main stories today: Thank you for following us this week. Have a lovely weekend. We\u2019ll be back next week. Take care \u2013 JK The number of people who were out shopping in October fell sharply last month, as heavy rain (Storm Babet) kept consumers at home. According to the latest data from the British Retail Consortium, retail footfall dropped 5.7% year-on-year in October, worsening from September\u2019s 2.9% decline. Within that, high street footfall fell 4.6%, while retail parks and shopping centres posted declines of 4.3% and 7.3% respectively. Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive said: Umbrellas were up as heavy rainfall descended across the UK in October, leading many shoppers to stay at home. As inflationary pressures on households begin to ease, some people are shopping around slightly less, braving the rain only to make their final purchases.\u201d While consumer confidence may be higher than 2022, it is still very weak. The economic landscape remains tough, with input prices and cost pressures above normal levels. Britain\u2019s stubbornly high inflation will not necessarily fall quickly as demand slows, according to the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Huw Pill. He spoke a day after the central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 5.25% (the highest since the 2008 financial crisis) for a second meeting in a row. Pill said: The overall judgments of the MPC has a little bit switched from being associated with demand factors to be more associated with supply factors. We can be less sanguine about the idea that the slowing of demand, the slowing of activity that we are seeing will lead to inflation returning to target. Official figures show the profitability of UK companies declined in the second quarter of the year, indicating that fears of price gouging to boost profits margins are misplaced. The net rate of return for private non-financial corporations (PNFCs), which excludes oil and gas firms operating in the North sea, was 9.6% in the three months from April to the end of June this year, down from a revised estimate of 10.7% in the first quarter. The net rate of return is a measure of company profitability used by the ONS. A breakdown of the figures that shows the fortunes of services and manufacturing firms follows the same pattern. Company profitability was almost identical in 2019, before the pandemic, revealing that with a few minor ups and downs in the last three years, companies have maintained their profit margins. And these ups and downs were mostly related to government energy subsidies, which have reduced this year and lowered profit margins previously boosted by subsidies. This situation contrasts with the average household, which have also been helped by energy subsidies, but suffered low wage rises from these same companies (their employers) and seen disposable incomes sink during the same period. More data from the US: The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s services index fell to a five-month low of 51.8 in October, from 53.6 in September, indicating slower growth. Any reading above 50 indicates growth. This is more evidence that economic growth is slowing after a blockbuster third quarter, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. Unlike the renewed slump in the manufacturing index, however, the dip in the aggregate services index was driven not by a slump in new orders, but rather new-found weakness in current business activity, employment and inventories. The supplier deliveries index also dropped back further, indicating that supply shortages are largely a thing of the past. In contrast, the new orders index strengthened to 55.5, from 51.8. Cameron Misson, economist at the UK think tank Centre for Economics and Business Research, has also looked at the US jobs report. Today\u2019s data may be an early signal that the US labour market is cooling, reinforcing the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to hold interest rates at its November meeting. Subdued non-farm payroll growth, a slight uptick in unemployment, and slowing wage growth are all evidence the central bank\u2019s interest rate hikes are having the desired effect of slowing economic activity. However, wage and price inflation remain too high, so expect interest rates to remain elevated for an extended period of time. The Fed kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and along with other major central banks such as the Bank of England, is widely expected to keep borrowing costs at the current level for some time. Fed chair Jerome Powell said then that robust jobs growth showed more people were coming back into the workforce, and an uptick in immigration. \u201cThat\u2019s a big supply-side gain that is really helping the economy.\u201d Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has echoed this sentiment, telling the Financial Times in an interview last month that growth was a \u201cpositive, not a negative\u201d that reflected \u201cmore people wanting to work and finding jobs\u201d. Wall Street has opened higher: the Dow Jones rose nearly 150 points or 0.4% to 33,988. The S&amp;P 500 added 16 points, or 0.4%, to 4,334 while the Nasdaq gained nearly 70 points, or 0.5%, to 13,362 at the opening bell. Wall Street shares are expected to rise at the open, after the weaker than expected non-farm payrolls data, which showed slowing job growth and a surprise uptick in the unemployment rate to 3.9%. This boosted investor expectations that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t hike interest rates again. You can find the US Labor Department figures here. Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Management, said: It is consistent with the views of the market that the job market and the economy is decelerating and that\u2019s going to keep the Fed on hold and will cause central banks next year to cut rates. Here\u2019s more instant reaction. Daniel Casali, chief investment strategist at the wealth management group Evelyn Partners, said: While there is increasing evidence that US job creation is slowing, it is unlikely to change the Fed\u2019s plan to keep interest rates \u2018higher for longer\u2019 to address inflation in the near term. Nevertheless, overall employment is still expanding by around 2% per annum and that should provide support for consumption growth. Other measures of labour activity are also indicative of a relatively healthy labour market. For instance, weekly initial job claims are a timely signal for the unemployment trend. Given this was recently reported at an historically low level, this implies there are fewer workers seeking unemployment benefits. Similarly, the September reading for job openings (from the JOLTS survey) came in at 9.6 million, versus the pre-pandemic level of around 7m at the end of 2019. This shows that firms are still looking to hire. Indeed, the Manpower survey rebounded in the fourth quarter to show that a net 36% of firms were planning to hire in the 3 months, compared to 20% at the end of 2019. Importantly, average hourly earnings from the payroll report are slowing and that should give the Fed some comfort that wage-driven inflation is coming under control. Though recent bumper wage deals agreed between the United Auto Workers\u2019 labour union and major auto manufacturers is a risk to the overall inflation outlook. US factory jobs declined by 35,000 last month while government jobs increased by 51,000. There were also job gains in health care and social assistance. Andrew Hunter, deputy chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: The muted 150,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in October is another sign that the economy\u2019s strength in the third quarter is likely to unwind in the fourth. With wage growth also continuing to slow, it is increasingly hard to imagine the Fed hiking interest rates any further. Admittedly, recent strike action hit payrolls again last month, with 33,200 UAW (United Auto Workers) workers walking out during the October survey period. That helps explain the 35,000 fall in manufacturing payrolls, which will be reversed in November with the autoworkers\u2019 strike now over. That said, strikes can\u2019t explain the declines in employment in transportation &amp; warehousing, information and finance. Furthermore, payrolls are still being supported by growth in the non-cyclical government and health care &amp; social assistance sectors \u2013 excluding those, payrolls rose by just 22,000 last month. Finally, after a blip in September, the persistent pattern of downward revisions to past months has returned \u2013 with August and September payroll gains revised down by a cumulative 101,000. The UAW union struck deals with the car manufacturers Ford, General Motors and Stellantis in the past week, ending the car worker strikes. US government bonds rallied after the data, which showed employers hired fewer people than expected in October. This pushed bond yields lower (yields move inversely to prices). The yield, or interest rate, on benchmark 10-year Treasuries fell 11 basis points to 4.55%, the lowest in three weeks. Two-year yields dropped 10 bps to 4.87%, the lowest since early September. European bonds also rallied, as did sterling and the euro, rising 0.8% against the dollar to $1.2305 and $1.0714 respectively. The US economy added 150,000 jobs in October, fewer than expected, and previous months were revised lower, suggesting the economy is not quite as strong as thought. Economists had expected 180,000 new jobs. In September, employers hired 297,00 more people, less than the 336,000 previously reported, and in August, there were 165,000 new private sector jobs, revised down from 227,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9% from 3.8% in September. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, fell to a 10-day low. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog has closed its separate investigations into Meta\u2019s Facebook Marketplace service and Amazon marketplace, accepting commitments from both tech companies. The Competition and Markets Authority said Amazon\u2019s commitments \u201chelp ensure that third-party Marketplace sellers can compete on a level-playing field and that UK customers get access to the best deals\u201d. Meta welcomed the move. We welcome the CMA\u2019s decision to close its investigation into Marketplace on the basis of the commitments offered by Meta to put in place systems and controls designed to confirm and validate that advertiser data from competitors is not used in Marketplace. Ann Pope, senior director for antitrust enforcement at the CMA, said: We have accepted Amazon\u2019s commitments as they help thousands of independent UK sellers to compete on a level playing field against Amazon\u2019s own retail arm. This should also mean customers get access to the best product offers. The commitments secured from Meta mean the firm cannot exploit advertising customers\u2019 data to give itself an unfair advantage \u2013 and as such distort competition. Tim Moore, economics Director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles the UK services survey, said: A shallow downturn in UK service sector activity persisted in October as businesses struggled to make headway against a backdrop of worsening domestic economic conditions and stretched household budgets. Forward-looking survey indicators suggested that service providers will continue to skirt with recession. The degree of optimism towards the business outlook was the lowest in 2023 so far, despite relief that interest hikes have taken a pause this autumn. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: The composite PMI suggests that the economy is flirting with a mild recession, but we continue to think that one will be narrowly avoided. Unemployment rose slightly in the eurozone in September, according to the latest official figures. The jobless rate rose to 6.5% from 6.4% in August, with just over 11 million people out of work including 2.2 million young people (under the age of 25), the EU\u2019s statistics office Eurostat said. The youth unemployment rate ticked up to 14%. Across the EU, the overall unemployment rate was stable at 6%. Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club forecasting group, said: Although October\u2019s final services PMI came in slightly higher than September\u2019s reading, it still signalled a modest contraction in private sector activity. The EY ITEM Club thinks GDP should still grow in Q4, helped by a fading drag from strike action in the public sector, but the pace of growth is likely to be marginal. The Monetary Policy Committee will have had sight of October\u2019s survey in arriving at its November interest rate decision. The picture of weak activity, easing cost pressures and falling employment painted by the latest survey will likely have contributed to the committee\u2019s decision to keep Bank Rate unchanged again. A closely watched survey has shown a slight reduction in service sector output as lacklustre demand conditions continued in October, and optimism worsened to the lowest level so far this year. Services firms experienced another reduction in business activity, although the downturn was only marginal and slightly less marked than in September, according to the final reading from the monthly S&amp;P Global and CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index survey. Survey respondents typically cited cost of living pressures, high interest rates and weak consumer confidence as factors holding back customer demand. Job shedding continued in October, reflecting lower new orders and uncertainty about the business outlook. The degree of optimism among services companies regarding year ahead growth prospects was the lowest in 2023 so far. At 49.5 in October, the headline business activity index was up slightly from 49.3 in September and above the earlier \u2018flash\u2019 reading of 49.2. However, it remained below the crucial 50.0 no-change threshold for the third month running. Lower volumes of service sector output in recent months contrast with moderate growth earlier this year (the index averaged 53.3 during the first half of 2023). Regulators need to ensure that banks have adequate financial buffers as advances in technology increase the risk of bank runs, a senior Bank of England official has warned. Andrew Hauser, the central bank\u2019s executive director for markets, said challenges facing central banks included how to ensure that banks\u2019 liquidity insurance remains appropriate as technology change increases the risk of larger and faster deposit runs, of the kind seen this spring in the US. The sudden collapse of the Californian lender Silicon Valley Bank in March caught regulators by surprise, as people rushed to get their money out using online banking services. In a speech at a conference organised by King\u2019s College in London, Hauser said central banks need to assess where their balance sheets should settle, after expanding them massively over 15 years of emergency bond buying, as monetary policy makers return inflation \u2013 which remains far too high \u2013 to target, through a combination of higher interest rates and unwinding Quantitative Easing (QE) and other \u2018unconventional\u2019 policy interventions. A third challenge is: how to ensure the stability of the financial system as a whole in the face of the growing incidence of systemic liquidity shocks, not just in banks but increasingly in non-bank market finance too. You can read Hauser\u2019s full speech here. In a separate report, the FAO stuck to its forecast for world cereal production of 2.8bn metric tonnes this year, up 0.9% from 2022. Global wheat production in 2023 is forecast at 785.1m tonnes, 2.2% (18m tonnes) lower than last year\u2019s level. Turning to 2024, winter wheat plantings are underway across the northern hemisphere and area growth is expected to be limited, reflecting softer crop prices this year. In the United States, drought conditions have partially dissipated in key producing states, and with above-average rainfall forecast for the next months, weather conditions appear to be more favourable for early stages of the 2024 crop; plantings have progressed at an average pace as of October. In the European Union, comparatively dry and warm conditions are favouring sowing of the winter wheat crop, with plantings already nearing completion in northern countries. In Ukraine, the continuing effects of the war, including constrained access to fields and low farm-gate prices, along with less-than-ideal weather conditions, are seen engendering a reduction in the wheat area. The FAO Meat Price Index fell 0.6%, the fourth monthly decline, leaving it 3.4% below its value a year ago. In October, international pig meat prices fell for a third month, driven by persistently sluggish import demand, especially from some East Asian countries, while some leading suppliers had high exporting capabilities. By contrast, world poultry meat prices rebounded slightly, as avian flu outbreaks continued to constrain supplies from several world leading suppliers and consumer demand stayed robust, because poultry is more affordable than other meat. International beef and lamb prices also increased slightly, reflecting robust import demand from some leading importers, despite ample supplies of beef from Australia and Brazil and lamb from Oceania. The FAO Sugar Price Index dropped 2.2% in October after two consecutive monthly increases, but remained 46.6% above the level a year earlier. The decline was mainly driven by strong production in Brazil, despite the negative impact of rains on sugarcane crushing in the first half of October. The weakening of the Brazilian real against the US dollar and lower ethanol prices in Brazil also weighed on world sugar prices. However, persistent concerns over a tighter global supply outlook in the recently started 2023/24 season, together with shipment delays from Brazil, capped the declines in world sugar prices. Thinning maize supplies in Argentina placed upward pressure on world maize prices, but this was capped by higher seasonal supplies in the United States, where the harvest progressed, and strong export competition from Brazil, the FAO said. As for vegetable oils, a slight fall in that price index mainly reflected lower world palm oil prices, more than offsetting higher prices of soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils. The FAO Dairy Price Index rose 2.2% in October from September, following nine months of consecutive declines, but was still down 20.1% from its value a year ago. World milk powder prices increased the most, mainly driven by surges in import demand for both near- and longer-term supplies, especially from Northeast Asia. Tight milk supplies in Western Europe and some uncertainty over the impact of the El Ni\u00f1o weather conditions on the upcoming milk production in Oceania added further downward pressure on prices. Global butter prices also rose, boosted by increased sales ahead of the winter holidays in Western Europe and higher import demand from Northeast Asia. By contrast, international cheese prices dropped slightly as the euro weakened against the dollar, and because of higher exports from Oceania. Global food prices continue to drop, but at a slower pace, with prices for sugar, cereal, vegetable oil and meat down while dairy products went up in price. The UN food price index fell 0.5% in October from September to 120.6 points, its lowest level since March 2021. It was 14.8 points, or 10.9%, below its level a year ago. The slight drop in October reflects declines in the price indices for sugar, cereals, vegetable oils and meat, while the index for dairy products rebounded, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations said. Wheat prices fell by 1.9% in October because of higher-than-expected supplies in the US and strong competition among exporters, and rice prices dropped 2%. The world\u2019s largest asset manager expects US borrowing costs to hover around 5.5% for the next five years as the central bank and investors grapple with inflationary pressures. Ten-year Treasury yields are at 4.67%, but Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute and a former deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said markets were heading for higher long-term borrowing costs. These will come from ageing populations, geopolitics and costs associated with the energy transition to net zero, he said. He told the Financial Times: We think 5.5% long-term 10-year yields in the US is the level that seems consistent with the macro backdrop in the next five years. It\u2019s also consistent with the compensation for risks that bond investors should require to invest in long-term bonds. His comments come after a rally in government bonds on both sides of the Atlantic in recent days as investors become more convinced that central banks have reached the end of their interest rate raising cycles. On the markets, stocks and oil prices are heading higher today, notching up modest gains. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index rose 16 points, or 0.2%, to 7,463 while Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.3%, France\u2019s CAC edged up 0.1%, and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB advanced nearly 0.5%. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: After a dismal October for markets, November has opened with a different narrative and a very different performance. That the Federal Reserve held rates this week was no surprise, but the accompanying comments from Chair Powell lit the fire under stocks, with a noticeable fall in Treasury yields providing further fuel. While leaving the door slightly ajar to further rate rises should inflation unexpectedly tick higher once more, sentiment has switched to the belief that the hiking cycle is now over. Today, yields (interest rates) on US government bonds, known as Treasuries, edged higher again, with the two-year yield climbing above 5%, after tumbling the day before, on relief that the US government announced smaller-than-expected increases in Treasury supply. In the oil market, Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 0.5% to $87.30 a barrel. The Russian rouble edged up 0.4% to 92 versus the dollar, as the market digested the impact of the latest round of US sanctions against Moscow, following its invasion of Ukraine in February last year. Vladimir Putin\u2019s decree on mandatory foreign currency sales for some exporters is still lending some support to the currency. Yesterday, the US imposed new measures against Russia over its war in Ukraine, targeting its future energy capabilities, sanctions evasion, seven Russia-based banks and dozens of industrial businesses. The US tech billionaire Elon Musk has warned that technology could eventually replace all human jobs, as Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, announced that the most advanced technology companies will allow governments to vet their artificial intelligence tools for the first time. Musk, the founder of the electric carmaker Tesla and owner of Twitter, now known as X, said: We are seeing the most disruptive force in history here. There will come a point where no job is needed. You can have a job if you want a job \u2026 but the AI will be able to do everything. Companies including Meta, Google DeepMind and OpenAI have agreed to allow regulators to test their latest AI products before releasing them to the public, in a move that officials say will slow the race to develop systems that can compete with humans. Sunak made the announcement yesterday after a two-day summit at Bletchley Park at which a diverse group including the world\u2019s richest man, the vice-president of the US and a senior Chinese government official agreed that AI poses a grave risk to humanity. Speaking to reporters at the end of the summit, Sunak said: I believe the achievements of this summit will tip the balance in favour of humanity. The prime minister also announced international support for an expert body inspired by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to be chaired by one of the \u201cgodfathers\u201d of modern AI. The moves were welcomed afterwards by Musk in a conversation between the pair in central London, during which Musk described what he sees as a dramatically different future for humanity. Over in the United States, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, was found guilty on all counts of defrauding his customers in Manhattan federal court. The one-time mogul stood with his hands clasped facing the jury as he was found guilty on seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money. He faces decades in prison at a sentencing hearing that US district Judge Lewis Kaplan set for 28 March 2024. The verdict, reached after just four hours of jury deliberation, brought an end to nearly a month of court proceedings that featured stunning testimony from his closest allies and the disgraced entrepreneur himself. He maintained his innocence until the end. Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyer, said in a statement: We respect the jury\u2019s decision. But we are very disappointed with the result. Mr Bankman-Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him. The Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk is to cut 10,000 jobs, after posting a steep drop in profits and revenue in the third quarter, as it battles with lower freight rates and lower demand for container shipping. The Danish company now expects to revenues and operating profits to come in at the lower end of its forecast range. Chief executive Vincent Clerc said: Our industry is facing a new normal with subdued demand, prices back in line with historical levels and inflationary pressure on our cost base. Since the summer, we have seen overcapacity across most regions triggering price drops and no noticeable uptick in ship recycling or idling. In August, Maersk warned of a steeper decline in global demand for shipping containers by sea this year, due to slow economic growth and de-stocking in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Maersk said it intends to cut its workforce from 110,000 in January to below 100,000, which will result in saving $600m next year. It declined to comment on the impact on UK jobs. There was chaos at the Australian airline Qantas\u2019s annual general meeting, where shareholders shouted \u201cshame on you\u201d at the board\u2019s chairman, Richard Goyder, as investors overwhelmingly rejected the embattled company\u2019s executive pay deal. That result, which marked one of Australia\u2019s largest ever protest votes against executive pay, came after Goyder and the airline\u2019s chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, apologised to investors for a year of sagas that had seen the company\u2019s share price plummet. Qantas has been grappling with several potentially costly issues, including a looming compensation bill for illegally outsourcing ground handling jobs and regulatory action over allegations it sold tickets to thousands of already-cancelled flights. In Germany, exports fell more than expected in September amid weaker global demand, according to figures from the federal statistics office. Exports fell 2.4% from the previous month, worse than the 1.1% decline forecast by economists, while imports were down 1.7%. Most of Germany\u2019s exports went to the US despite a 4% drop, and most imports came from China, down 0.9%. Exports to the UK rose 2.3% to \u20ac6.3bn, while imports from the UK rose by 5.2% to \u20ac3.2bn. Germany is normally an exports powerhouse but exports have been a drag on the economy in four out of six quarters since the start of last year. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, said: Things are still looking pretty downbeat for Germany\u2019s economy. The cooling of global demand is currently worsening the structural problems and the weakening of the euro since the summer is still too small to have any significant impact on exports. Export order books remain weak. Last but not least, recently German technology groups warned that they were being hit by customs delays for exports to China. As a result, trade is no longer the strong resilient growth driver of the German economy that it used to be, but rather a drag. Maybe the only upside of today\u2019s disappointing data is that things can hardly get worse. However, as positive signals remain absent, the base case for the German economy over the next months remains stagnation at best. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Global stocks are on course for their biggest weekly gain in a year as investors are betting that there won\u2019t be any more interest rate hike in major economies, while bonds rallied. World stocks, as measured by the MSCI ACWI, which captures large and mid cap stocks across 23 developed markets and 24 emerging markets, are up 4.3% so far this week, the biggest rise since November 2022. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 564 points, or 1.7% yesterday, its best day since May. Investors are hoping that there won\u2019t be any more interest rate hikes, although central banks are signalling that rates will stay high for an extended period \u2013 painful for people with mortgages. The US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at a 22-year high on Wednesday as inflation continues to fade from its highest level in a generation \u2013 but its chairman Jerome Powell cautioned that the Fed\u2019s campaign to bring down price growth had \u201ca long way to go,\u201d leaving the door open for further hikes. The Bank of England kept its main interest rate at 5.25% yesterday for the second meeting in a row, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. It warned the economy will be on the brink of recession in an election year and signalled rates will stay high for a while to tackle stubborn inflationary pressures. It\u2019s US jobs day! We will get the latest US non-farm payrolls figures at lunchtime, which are expected to show that companies are still hiring strongly. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: The Federal Reserve hinted that the rate hikes could be coming to an end because the recent surge in US long term [bond] yields helped them tighten the financial conditions without the need for another rate hike. US growth is strong, and the jobs market remains healthy. The Fed thinks that solid labour-force participation and immigration explain the resilience of the jobs market. Any strength in job additions or wages growth data could bring bond trades back to earth and remind them that if the US jobs market - and the economy - remains this strong, the Fed could turn hawkish again. But strong jobs data in a context of higher supply is not necessarily inflationary. Also coming up: We have the UN global food index later this morning, and several Bank of England speeches at the Bank\u2019s Watchers\u2019 conference organised by Kings College. The Agenda 9am GMT: UN Food index for October 9am GMT: Bank of England Andrew Hauser keynote speech at conference 9.30am GMT: UK S&amp;P Global/CIPS Services PMI final for October 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment for September 12.15pm GMT: BOE chief economist Huw Pill speaks 12.30pm GMT: US Non-farm payrolls for October (forecast: 180,000) 2pm GMT: US ISM Services PMI for October"

            "title": "UK economy flatlines in third quarter amid high interest rates",
            "date": "2023-11-10T07:03:04Z",
            "content": "The UK economy flatlined between July and September, compared with the previous three months, as the impact of high interest rates and inflation weighed on consumers and businesses. Illustrating what one economist called \u201ca stagnation nation\u201d, the Office for National Statistics said zero growth in gross domestic product in the third quarter followed 0.2% growth in the second quarter. A slowdown in the property sector after a slump in house sales dragged down the services sector, while the transport sector was also hit by a downturn, indicating that firms cut back on shipping goods across the country. Over recent months, most business surveys have shown falls in output and employment in reaction to falling consumer demand in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. An increase in interest rates has dampened consumer spending, with many retailers signalling that they are prepared for a difficult festive period. Inflation was unchanged at 6.7% in September, reducing the spending power of many workers who received pay rises below the consumer prices index. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: \u201cFlatlining quarterly UK GDP suggests that our economy lost momentum as the squeeze from inflation and higher borrowing costs suffocated output.\u201d Thiru, who overseas one of the largest surveys of business sentiment, said firms were downbeat about the outlook for the final three months of the year, which could be negative. Responding to the GDP data, Jeremy Hunt said he planned to \u201cknock inflation on its head\u201d with an autumn statement on 22 November that would \u201cfocus on how we get the economy growing healthily again by unlocking investment, getting people back into work and reforming our public services so we can deliver the growth our country needs\u201d. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the figures showed the government was failing in its mission to revive the economy. \u201cAt the start of the year, Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt promised to get the economy growing. These figures show that growth is flatlining and the British people are paying the price, with 25 Tory tax rises and higher mortgages,\u201d she said. That was echoed by James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation thinktank. \u201cBritain is a stagnation nation that has struggled to secure sustained economic growth since the financial crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cAddressing this is the central task we face as a country, and must be at the heart of the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement in 10 days\u2019 time.\u201d The Bank of England last week left interest rates unchanged at 5.25% for a second time in a row, amid signs the UK economy is weakening. It had previously issued a run of 14 consecutive interest rates rises since the end of 2021. Thiru said the weakness of the economy should persuade the central bank to begin cutting interest rates sooner than financial markets expect next August. \u201cThese downbeat GDP figures suggest the Bank of England may have overdone the interest rate rises, and with that, the case for rate setters to pivot towards loosening policy is likely to strengthen,\u201d he said. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter decline in consumer spending was the first since the fourth quarter of 2022 \u201cand suggests higher loan rates are biting harder\u201d. There was better news from the professional, scientific and technical activities subsector, which grew by 0.6%, while the biggest area of growth was in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, which increased by 2.3%. Growth was also driven by the health sector, which was supported by fewer strikes. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a slightly worse third quarter, with a 0.1% contraction, but the economy grew by 0.2% in September, month on month, beating expectations of 0% growth."

            "date": "2023-11-10T08:52:35Z",
            "content": "Like a sailing ship trapped in the doldrums, Britain\u2019s economy is going nowhere. The latest official growth figures for the third quarter of 2023 show the sideways drift of the past 18 months continuing. Without population growth the performance would have been even weaker. Clearly, higher interest rates are having an impact. The UK economy is heavily reliant on the residential housing market to propel it forwards, and that engine has been shut off as a result of the steady increase in the cost of borrowing from the Bank of England since December 2021. Residential investment, which is especially sensitive to changes in interest rates, fell by 1.7% in the three months to September and has now dropped for four successive quarters. Household spending also took a hit as consumers tightened their belts. Meanwhile, the recent encouraging performance of business investment came to an abrupt end, suggesting some of its previous strength was down to companies bringing forward spending before the end of the super deduction tax break earlier this year. It is unusual for the UK economy to move sideways for so long a period. In the past, it would either have shown signs of recovery by now or fallen into outright recession. But that\u2019s because typically in previous cycles policy would have been eased. Either the Bank of England would have been cutting interest rates or the Treasury would have been cutting taxes or increasing public spending. Neither looks probable in the immediate future because of the fear of higher inflation. The economy is doing poorly but not poorly enough for Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee to yet contemplate cutting the cost of borrowing. Likewise, Jeremy Hunt has shown no sign that he will be using his autumn statement on 22 November to provide a stimulus package. The recent revisions by the Office for National Statistics to past gross domestic product data suggest it would be unwise to treat the 0.0% growth in the third quarter and the 0.1% growth in September alone as the last word on the subject. But the underlying picture is clear. Interest rates will remain at their current level. Housing activity will continue to be muted. Businesses will mothball investment plans. Consumers will count every penny. There is no sign \u2013 at home or abroad \u2013 of a wind rising that would fill the sails of the economy. Until one does spring up, the economy will flatline \u2013 at best."

            "date": "2023-11-19T11:55:06Z",
            "content": "If the opinion polls are right, Jeremy Hunt is on the political equivalent of death row. Voters have passed judgment on the government and it is only a matter of time before the sentence is carried out. That\u2019s not the way the chancellor sees it. For a condemned man, he was remarkably cheerful as he did the rounds of the TV studios in the run-up to Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement. His message was simple: things may look bleak for the government but all is not lost. There is too much negativity. The long-term prospects are \u201cfantastic\u201d. The chancellor is confident there will be an 11th-hour pardon from the British people. Hunt says the tough decisions on tax and spending taken a year ago are bearing fruit and that the public can be brought round gradually to the idea of a reprieve. Miracles do happen. Hunt may be able to pull off his own version of the Hollywood courtroom drama 12 Angry Men, with himself as Henry Fonda, but the chances of a not guilty verdict for the government whenever the election comes are vanishingly small. This is not the movies. There is no way back for the Tories without a marked improvement in the economy, and progress on that score is going to be slow at best. The autumn statement is unlikely to change voter perceptions. In part, that is because the package will be modest, even though the chancellor appears to have more money to play with than expected a few weeks ago. The preannounced \u00a34.5bn investment in strategically important manufacturing, for example, is spread over five years and in no way matches the ambition of Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. That act provides genuine incentives for green businesses to invest in the US; Hunt\u2019s money will barely touch the sides on its way down. That\u2019s not all, though. The measures the chancellor is apparently contemplating \u2013 such as reducing inheritance tax and not fully uprating welfare benefits \u2013 would be poorly targeted and politically tin-eared. Hunt played down weekend speculation that he would announce cuts to income tax or national insurance on Wednesday. Ultimately, whatever Hunt does will be too little too late. The removal of Liz Truss was supposed to mark the nadir of the Conservative party\u2019s fortunes but even with the \u201cgrownups\u201d back in charge, poll ratings have not improved. The latest poll by Ipsos shows almost eight out of 10 voters \u2013 including 70% of Tory supporters \u2013 think public services have got worse over the past five years. In Hunt\u2019s best-case scenario, the economy avoids going into a recession this winter and starts to recover gently in early 2024. Consumers feel better off because earnings are rising faster than prices. Inflation continues to fall, prompting the Bank of England to cut interest rates next spring. Cheaper borrowing reignites the housing market. The improvement in the public finances provides the scope for a giveaway budget. Voters feel less negative about the government and \u2013 at the last minute \u2013 produce a stay of execution. This, though, is based on two questionable assumptions: that the economy avoids recession this winter and that the public is prepared to forgive the government for the squeeze on living standards caused by a two-year cost of living crisis. The chances of avoiding a recession would be markedly improved were the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates. In previous economic cycles, growth this weak would have already led to lower borrowing costs but rates will be stuck at 5.25% until well into next year. The Bank\u2019s concern about the risk of a wage-price spiral means there is no real chance of borrowing costs coming down any sooner, and that means there is no real prospect of the economy generating a head of steam until after the election. Given that interest rates have been going up and taxes have been raised, it is surprising the economy has held up as well as it has in 2023. A small increase in unemployment and stagnant growth represents a soft landing. In all the circumstances, things could have been a lot worse. Hunt and Rishi Sunak have received zero credit for the economy outperforming expectations, which is what tends to happen to governments when they have the misfortune to preside over an economic crisis after such a long period in office. After 13 years, the signs are that voters think it is time for a change, just as they did at the 2010 election. By then, the economy had started to recover from the deep recession caused by the global financial crisis but Labour still lost. Hunt will find the money to announce some tax cuts on Wednesday and will no doubt be even more generous in next spring\u2019s budget. He will only be able to do so by ignoring the fragile state of the public finances, which are in a much worse state than he is prepared to admit. Interest rates are not going to return to rock-bottom levels and this means the government will have to run a tighter ship if it is to meet its own rules for the public finances. As far as Hunt is concerned, though, that\u2019s a problem that can be put off until the other side of the election. He can come up with tax cuts and implausibly tough plans for public spending, knowing that someone else will have to deal with the consequences. That someone will almost certainly be Rachel Reeves. The shadow chancellor needs to learn a key lesson from Labour\u2019s defeat in 2010: the importance of seizing control of the political narrative and blaming the outgoing government for any tough decisions she needs to take. Because, make no mistake, there will be some."

            "date": "2023-11-29T21:52:44Z",
            "content": "Hello, US politics live blog readers, it\u2019s been a lively day \u2013 and week so far \u2013 for news and there will be more action on Thursday as the House is due to vote on whether to expel New York Republican congressman George Santos. Do join us again then but, for now, this blog is closing. The Guardian\u2019s global live blog on the war between Israel and Hamas continues, meanwhile, and you can follow it here. How the day went: Joe Biden attacked rightwing Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert as one of the \u201cleaders of this extreme Maga movement\u201d, upon visiting her district in Colorado to promote a factory there building equipment for offshore wind energy plants. The president spoke in Pueblo about how his administration has helped businesses like CS Wind, a turbine manufacturer, shift jobs back to the United States. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a leader of the far-right GOP bloc in the House, proposed once again that Congress should impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, homeland security secretary, for his handling of the US-Mexico border and migration. Republican House speaker Mike Johnson said the chamber will vote on whether to expel George Santos on Thursday, and he is leaving it up to lawmakers to decide whether the New York congressman should be removed from office for embellishing his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and allegedly breaking federal law. George Santos struck a defiant tone after House Democrats introduced a motion on Tuesday to expel him from Congress, insisting in a speech that he would not resign and saying to reporters \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d about the campaign against him. Joe Biden said that raising $440bn over 10 years through his billionaire\u2019s tax policy would strengthen programs such as social security and Medicare. \u201cJust by paying 25% instead of 8%. Imagine what we could do if we made billionaires pay their taxes like everyone else,\u201d he said, during his speech in Colorado moments ago. \u201cWe could strengthen the social security and Medicare systems, instead of cutting them like \u2026 Trump and Boebert want to do,\u201d he said. He said the extra revenue would help with government subsidies for childcare and senior care costs. \u201cThis is not about help for poor folks, this is about smart economics,\u201d he said. And such assistance allowed more carers to go out to work, generating economic growth, he said. The president closed out his speech without any further digs at his Republican thorns, and has now departed the stage. Joe Biden is touting his billionaire\u2019s minimum tax policy and decrying that rightwing congresswoman Lauren Boebert, whose district he\u2019s visiting in Colorado, and her ilk only want to cut taxes for the richest. He said that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, there were 750 billionaires in the US and \u201cnow there are 1,000\u201d and typically, the president said, they pay income tax at 8%. \u201cRaise your hands if you pay more than 8%\u201d Biden told the crowd, as a sea of hands were raised. \u201cThat\u2019s less than firefighters and teachers pay,\u201d he said. Biden said he wants a 25% tax for billionaires, projecting that would raise $440bn in revenue for the US over a decade. He also complained about giant corporations paying no taxes on huge profits. \u201cIf anyone thinks the tax code is fair, raise your hand,\u201d he said. As he promoted the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies he said are helping communities across the country, Joe Biden singled out for criticsm Lauren Boebert, the rightwing congresswoman who represents the district containing Pueblo, Colorado, where he\u2019s speaking. \u201cThe historic investments we\u2019re celebrating today is in Congresswoman Boebert\u2019s district,\u201d the president said. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the leaders of this extreme Maga movement. She, along with every single Republican colleague, voted against the law that made these investments in jobs possible. That\u2019s not hyperbole. It\u2019s a fact. And then she voted to repeal key parts of this loan. And she called this law, \u2018a massive failure\u2019. You all know you\u2019re part of a massive failure?\u201d He then took credit for companies in Colorado hiring thanks to his administration, and asked the audience: \u201cNone of that sounds like a massive failure to me. How about you?\u201d Joe Biden just took the stage in Pueblo, Colorado, where he\u2019s speaking about how his administration has helped businesses like CS Wind, a turbine manufacturer, shift jobs back to the United States. \u201cPeople seeing this on television may not be certain they used to make all their wind towers abroad,\u201d the president said. \u201cThen they decided to make them here in America as well. Today the CS Wing factory in Colorado is the largest wind turbine manufacturer in the entire world \u2026 has over 170 employees. As I said for a long time when I think climate, I mean this sincerely, I think jobs, jobs.\u201d Speaking of international engagements, US prosecutors have accused an agent of India\u2019s government of directing an attempted assassination of a Sikh activist on US soil. A similar accusation by Canada has led to a diplomatic spat with New Delhi, and the indictment from US prosecutors could complicate the Biden administration\u2019s resolve to work with Narendra Modi\u2019s government to build alliances against China. The Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner, Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Leyland Cecco are on the story: US prosecutors have accused an agent of the Indian government of directing the attempted assassination of an American citizen on US soil, according to a superseding indictment released by the Department of Justice, which revealed new details about India\u2019s alleged targeting of Sikh activists around the world. The indictment made public on Wednesday also provided new evidence that the Indian agent \u2013 who is not named \u2013 ordered the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Sikh activist who was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia in June. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced in September that there were \u201ccredible allegations\u201d that agents of the Indian government had carried out the assassination of Nijjar. The allegations were denied by India, which called the claim \u201cabsurd\u201d and politically motivated. The US indictment now appears to confirm, however, evidence of a global plot allegedly orchestrated in India to silence and kill vocal critics of the Indian government who support the creation of an independent Sikh state. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the target of the alleged assassination plot, told the Guardian that the indictment revealed a \u201cblatant case of India\u2019s transnational terrorism\u201d \u2013 adding that the attempt on his life had only galvanized his efforts to pursue a symbolic referendum on an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan. \u201cIf death is the cost for running the Khalistan referendum, I am willing to pay that price,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFirst by assassinating Nijjar in Canada and then attempting to assassinate me on US soil, India under [prime minister Narendra Modi] has extended to the foreign soils its policy of violently crushing the Sikhs movement for right to self-determination.\u201d The White House has meanwhile confirmed that Kamala Harris will travel to Dubai on 1 and 2 December to represent the United States at the Cop28 conference on fighting climate change. \u201cThroughout her engagements, the vice-president will underscore the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s success in delivering on the most ambitious climate agenda in history, both at home and abroad. The vice-president will be joined by dozens of senior US officials representing more than 20 US departments and agencies,\u201d Harris\u2019s press secretary Kirsten Allen said in a statement. Biden was expected to go, but canceled his travel plans earlier this week: The man who nearly booted Lauren Boebert from office last year \u2013 and could succeed next year \u2013 is Adam Frisch, a Democrat and former council member in resort town Aspen. The Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly spoke to him last October about why he thinks voters in his western Colorado district are ready for change: Adam Frisch is in his second congressional campaign, crossing and re-crossing Colorado\u2019s third US House district, a space bigger than Pennsylvania. Thirteen months out from election day, time is one thing he does not lack. But Frisch has a unique way of counting it anyway: before and after Beetlejuice. \u201cBefore Beetlejuice,\u201d the Democrat says, of polling in his Republican-leaning district, \u201cwe were up by two points, Trump was up five.\u201d After Beetlejuice, the thinking goes, Frisch\u2019s position may well improve further. Frisch, 56 and a former banker who now lives in Aspen, is the Democratic candidate to challenge Lauren Boebert next year. Boebert, a former restaurant owner and proud grandmother at 36, is the far-right Republican who won the seat in 2020 and has proven relentlessly controversial since \u2013 so much so that last year, even in a conservative district, she survived Frisch\u2019s first challenge by the skin of her teeth. Boebert won after a recount, by just 546 votes, then went back to Washington DC to stoke the usual fires. But last month a bigger blaze flared up, when the congresswoman was shown to have behaved outrageously during a performance of the musical Beetlejuice in Denver. On security footage, Boebert sang and danced, took selfies, vaped and even appeared to grope her date as he fondled her in return. Both were ejected. For once, Boebert voiced something close to contrition. But to Frisch, the episode was just further proof that Boebert is there to be beaten. \u201cWe\u2019re resonating with a lot of people,\u201d he said, by phone, during another day of meeting and greeting. \u201cIn February of 22, when I first launched, there were two themes I started to work on. The Republicans laughed at me, the Democrats laughed at me, the media and the donor class laughed. But the themes are the people want the circus to stop, and they want someone to focus on the district. \u201cAnd every day since then, [Boebert] has just been one of the national leaders of the circus. And obviously, it\u2019s just gotten worse and worse \u2026 it\u2019s just a mess and people are sick and tired.\u201d Joe Biden arrived in Colorado yesterday, and spoke at a campaign reception where he made a point to criticize Lauren Boebert, the far-right Republican whose district he is visiting today. The president\u2019s itinerary will bring him to a wind turbine factory and see him tout his administration\u2019s renewable energy investments, but its also a direct confrontation to Boebert, who barely won re-election in her district last year despite its Republican tilt, and is expected to face a tough race next year. \u201cWith the progress we\u2019ve made, we haven\u2019t gotten a whole lot of help from the other side. Tomorrow, we\u2019re going to be in \u2026 Congresswoman Lauren Boebert\u2019s district \u2026 one of the leaders of the extreme right, the Maga movement,\u201d Biden told guests at the fundraiser. He continued: We\u2019re going to a wind energy company that plans to invest an additional $200m to expand the facility in Colorado, double its production, add 850 new jobs \u2013 good-paying jobs, the governor will tell you. But the congresswoman, along with every single one of her Republican colleagues, voted against the law I signed that made these investments possible. And then she vowed to repeal it. And she voted to repeal it, and she called it a massive failure. It\u2019s in her district. She called it a massive failure. And she went on and voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. She called it garbage. It\u2019s building bridges, roads, Internet, et cetera. And she called it a scam. I find it pretty unbelievable. Joe Biden will promote his economic and clean energy policies this afternoon in Colorado, while taking on rightwing Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert, a close ally of former president Donald Trump, Reuters reports. Biden, who blamed Trump at a fundraising event in Denver on Tuesday for taking away US women\u2019s right to an abortion, will visit a wind tower manufacturer in Pueblo, part of Boebert\u2019s congressional district. Biden has presided over a stronger-than-expected US economy and big federal investments in infrastructure and clean energy, but the clean energy industry is now struggling with high costs. Facing weak opinion polls, Biden has turned in his re-election campaign to more directly taking on Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, as unfit for the presidency and a threat to American democracy. Boebert, whom the White House calls a \u201cself-described Maga Republican\u201d, referencing Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again agenda, is expected to become a default target for those attacks today. Boebert faces a tough re-election battle herself against Democrat Adam Frisch, who has out-raised her in donations. During his visit, Biden will speak about clean energy investments and \u201chighlight how self-described Maga Republicans like Representative Lauren Boebert are threatening those investments, jobs, and opportunities,\u201d the White House said. Biden set a goal of deploying 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind along US coastlines this decade to fight climate change. That may be unattainable due to soaring costs and supply chain delays, Reuters reported in September. Former president Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers have suggested their strategy in his election interference case in Washington involves distancing him from the horde of US Capitol rioters, whom he has embraced on the campaign trail, the Associated Press reports. Special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s criminal investigation team has signaled it will make the case Trump is responsible for the chaos that unfolded on January 6, 2021, and point to the Republican ex-president\u2019s continued support of the rioters, in order to help establish his criminal intent. The competing arguments highlight the extent to which the insurrection will inevitably form the backdrop in a landmark trial set to begin March 4 in a courthouse just blocks from the Capitol. Trump\u2019s defense attorneys failed in an effort to strike references to that day\u2019s violence from the indictment but have made clear their strategy involves distancing the former president from the horde of rioters, whom they describe as \u201cindependent actors at the Capitol\u201d. While Trump\u2019s glorification of January 6 defendants, who have been arrested and charged by the hundreds, may boost him politically as he vies to retake the White House in 2024, his lawyers\u2019 approach lays bare a concern that arguments linking him to the rioters could harm him in front of a jury. Much may depend as well on the evidence permitted by federal judge Tanya Chutkan. It\u2019s impeachment season among House Republicans. Their leadership is pressing forward with their campaign to impeach Joe Biden for alleged corruption, while rightwing lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene has proposed a resolution to impeach homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, though the chamber turned down a similar attempt just a few weeks ago. The clock is also ticking down for George Santos, the New York congressman and admitted fabulist. House speaker Mike Johnson said the chamber will vote tomorrow on expelling him, and reports indicate the support is there to kick him out of office. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: House Democrats say the GOP is doing Donald Trump\u2019s bidding with its impeachment inquiry into Biden. Mourners gathered in Plains, Georgia for the funeral of former first Rosalynn Carter. Her husband Jimmy Carter was in attendance. Mike Pence\u2019s son played a role in convincing his father to stand up to Trump on January 6, according to a report. In Georgia, mourners are attending the funeral of former first lady Rosalynn Carter, including her husband Jimmy Carter: Joe and Jill Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Melania Trump and Michelle Obama were among the dignitaries who traveled to Atlanta yesterday for a tribute to Carter, a noted advocate for mental health and the eradication of diseases worldwide: On the House floor, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a leader of the far-right GOP bloc, again proposed impeaching Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of security at the southern border and the inflow of migrants into the United States: Republicans have made Mayorkas into the public face of what they call the \u201cBiden Border Crisis\u201d, and earlier this year were mulling impeaching the secretary. However, impeachments of cabinet secretaries are exceedingly rare \u2013 the last time one happened was 1876 \u2013 and party leaders appear to be focusing instead on their slow-moving impeachment inquiry of Biden for alleged and thus far unproved corruption. Last month, a small group of Republicans joined with Democrats to halt an earlier attempt by Greene to impeach Mayorkas, who would likely be acquitted in the Democratic-controlled Senate anyway. Tom McClintock, one of the eight GOP lawmakers who opposed the attempt, said he did so because it could backfire on the party: If Greene is successful in redefining impeachment, then the next time Democrats have the majority, we can expect this new definition to be turned against the conservatives on the Supreme Court and any future Republican administration. And there will be nobody to stop them, because Republicans will have signed off on this new and unconstitutional abuse of power. One of the reasons Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election failed was because of the resistance of Mike Pence, his vice-president who recently abandoned his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. As the Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly reports, Pence\u2019s son played a role in convincing his father to say no to Trump: Mike Pence reportedly decided to skip the congressional certification process for Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win, because to preside over it as required by the constitution would be \u201ctoo hurtful\u201d to his \u201cfriend\u201d, Donald Trump. He was then shamed into standing up to Trump by his son, a US marine. \u201cDad, you took the same oath I took,\u201d the then vice-president\u2019s son Michael Pence said, according to ABC News, adding that it was \u201can oath to support and defend the constitution\u201d. Ultimately, Pence did supervise certification, even as it was delayed by the deadly January 6 attack on Congress. Trump incited the attack by telling supporters to march on the Capitol and \u201cfight like hell\u201d in his cause \u2013 the lie that Biden\u2019s win was the result of electoral fraud. Some chanted for Pence to be hanged. Nine deaths have been linked to the riot, more than a thousand arrests made and hundreds of convictions secured. Throughout the investigation of January 6 by a House committee, Pence was praised for standing up to Trump and fulfilling his constitutional duty. He later released a memoir, So Help Me God, about his time as Trump\u2019s No 2. But according to ABC, which on Tuesday cited sources familiar with Pence\u2019s testimony to the special counsel Jack Smith, investigating Trump\u2019s election subversion, Pence offered details not included in his book, including how he had to be prodded into doing his duty. Before he was House speaker, Mike Johnson was the architect of a brief signed by dozens of Republican lawmakers that supported Donald Trump\u2019s failed attempt to convince the courts to disrupt Joe Biden\u2019s election win. The Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly reports that in her new book, Liz Cheney, the Wyoming congresswoman who lost her seat last year in large part due to opposing the former president, accuses Johnson of duping his allies about the effort: In a new book, the anti-Trump Republican Liz Cheney accuses the US House speaker, Mike Johnson, of dishonesty over both the authorship of a supreme court brief in support of Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overthrow the 2020 election and the document\u2019s contents, saying Johnson duped his party with a \u201cbait and switch\u201d. \u201cAs I read the amicus brief \u2013 which was poorly written \u2013 it became clear Mike was being less than honest,\u201d Cheney writes. \u201cHe was playing bait and switch, assuring members that the brief made no claims about specific allegations of [electoral] fraud when, in fact, it was full of such claims.\u201d Cheney also says Johnson was neither the author of the brief nor a \u201cconstitutional law expert\u201d, as he was \u201ctelling colleagues he was\u201d. Pro-Trump lawyers actually wrote the document, Cheney writes. As Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden progressed towards the deadly January 6 attack on Congress, Cheney was a House Republican leader. Turning against Trump, she sat on the House January 6 committee and was ostracised by her party, losing her Wyoming seat last year. Asked about the effort to impeach Joe Biden, the Democratic caucus chair, Pete Aguilar, accused the GOP of doing Donald Trump\u2019s bidding. From the House Democrats\u2019 press conference earlier today: From earlier, here\u2019s the moment Mike Johnson weighed in on the resolution to expel George Santos: Many lawmakers, Democrats included, have worried that expelling Santos would set a bad precedent. Earlier this month, Jamie Raskin said he voted against removing the New York Republican from office over due process concerns. The Maryland Democrat has since changed his mind after the release of the House ethics committee report into Santos\u2019s conduct, and now says he supports giving him the boot: Republican House speaker Mike Johnson also made clear to reporters the party will press on with its impeachment investigation into Joe Biden. He announced the establishment of a website dedicated to the inquiry, which focuses on alleged corruption on the part of the president and his family. Here\u2019s more from Johnson: The GOP has for years leveled corruption allegations against Biden, but has yet to make public any proof that he benefited from his son Hunter Biden and other family members\u2019 business dealings overseas. Since taking control of the House at the start of the year, Republicans have used its investigative power to pursue those claims, but the single hearing they have thus far held in the impeachment inquiry was not considered a success: Republican House speaker Mike Johnson said the chamber will vote on whether to expel George Santos on Thursday, and he is leaving it up to lawmakers to decide whether the New York congressman should be removed from office for embellishing his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and allegedly breaking federal law. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve said as the leadership team is we\u2019re going to allow people to vote their conscience. I think it\u2019s the only appropriate thing we can do. We\u2019ve not whipped the vote and we wouldn\u2019t. I trust that people will make that decision thoughtfully and in good faith,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cI personally have real reservations about doing this, I\u2019m concerned about a precedent that may be set for that. So, everybody\u2019s working through that and we\u2019ll see how they vote tomorrow.\u201d Politico has been surveying House lawmakers and reports enough Republicans support removing George Santos from office that an expulsion motion will probably pass: If he is removed, the GOP\u2019s majority in the House would drop to just three seats, though the party will try to win the special election that will be held to determine who will serve out the rest of Santos\u2019s term. In the House GOP\u2019s private conference meeting today, Punchbowl News reports that majority whip Tom Emmer said a vote to open impeachment proceedings against Joe Biden is still being planned: Former speaker Kevin McCarthy announced the start of the impeachment investigation shortly before he was removed as leader, but several Republicans have publicly doubted whether the effort is worth it. The latest is Montana\u2019s Matt Rosendale: Politico reports that Republican speaker of the House Mike Johnson will not whip the expulsion vote against George Santos \u2013 meaning lawmakers won\u2019t be feeling formal pressure from leadership as they decide whether to remove the New York lawmaker from office: House Democratic whip Katherine Clark\u2019s office has sent its members notice of what legislation the chamber will be voting on today, and the George Santos expulsion resolution is not mentioned. That could change if the House Republican leadership decides to bring the proposal up for a vote today. They still have time \u2013 the privileged motion called up by two Democratic lawmakers has until tomorrow to be voted on. There is also a chance the GOP will instead decide to vote on a separate expulsion resolution introduced by Republican Michael Guest, the chair of the ethics committee. George Santos struck a defiant tone after House Democrats introduced a motion to expel him yesterday, insisting in a speech on the House floor that he would not resign and saying to reporters \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d when asked about the effort to remove him from office. Here\u2019s his floor speech: And comments to the press afterward: He is correct that this will be the third time an expulsion motion against him is voted on. The first effort was referred to the ethics committee, which later issued a damning report against him, while the second was rejected by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, many of whom were concerned removing Santos would set a bad precedent. But that was before the ethics report was out, and it appears to have convinced many lawmakers that Santos has to go, though whether that number will rise to two-thirds of the chamber remains to be seen. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Republican congressman George Santos may be down to his last hours in office, after a pair of House Democrats yesterday called up an expulsion resolution against him that must be voted on within 48 hours. The New York lawmaker has admitted to fabricating much of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 following his election last year, has been indicted on an array of federal fraud charges and, crucially for his position in Congress, was found by the House ethics committee to have committed \u201cgrave and pervasive campaign finance violations and fraudulent activity\u201d. That most recent development has dramatically shifted sentiment against him in Congress\u2019s lower chamber, and while the expulsion resolution needs a two-thirds majority support to pass, enough lawmakers may finally be willing to boot him. While Santos has already said he will not stand for a second term, he yesterday insisted he will not resign his post. Thus, the question is, will the House\u2019s Republican leaders bring up the expulsion resolution for a vote today, or Thursday, and will it pass? Here\u2019s what else is happening today: Joe Biden is in western Colorado to promote a new wind turbine factory he says his policies made possible, and also to explicitly criticize Lauren Boebert, the far-right lawmaker representing the area. Chuck Schumer, the Senate\u2019s Democratic leader, plans a 10am eastern time floor speech on antisemitic attacks in the United States since the start of the war in Gaza. Those along with violence against Arabs and Muslims have spiked in recent weeks. Senate Republicans are demanding a deal to tighten border security policies in exchange for approving new aid to Israel and Ukraine. We\u2019ll see if there\u2019s a breakthrough in negotiations, or if they fall apart, as talks over immigration reform so often do."

            "date": "2023-11-10T00:24:05Z",
            "content": "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson has revealed that multiple political parties approached him last year to see if he would run for US president, after a poll revealed 46% of Americans would support his campaign. Appearing as the first guest on Trevor Noah\u2019s new Spotify podcast What Now?, the actor and former WWE wrestler said a 2021 poll of 30,000 American adults led to \u201cthe parties\u201d contacting him to ask if he was interested in running at the end of 2022. \u201cThat was an interesting poll that happened and I was really moved by that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI was really blown away and I was really honoured. I\u2019ll share this little bit with you: at the end of the year in 2022, I got a visit from the parties asking me if I was going to run, and if I could run. \u201cIt was a big deal, and it came out of the blue,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was one after the other, and they brought up that poll, and they also brought up their own deep-dive research that would prove that should I ever go down that road [I\u2019d be a real contender]. It was all very surreal because that\u2019s never been my goal. My goal has never been to be in politics. As a matter of fact, there\u2019s a lot about politics that I hate.\u201d However, Johnson, who has described himself as a \u201ccentrist\u201d and \u201cpolitical independent\u201d and publicly endorsed US president Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign, has openly shared his interest in running in the past. In 2016 he told GQ: \u201cI can\u2019t deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring.\u201d A year later he told Variety the 2024 presidential campaign was a \u201crealistic consideration\u201d. His sitcom Young Rock even hinges around him running for US president in 2032, with Johnson playing his future self as he gives interviews about moments in his early life that structure every episode. Responding to the aforementioned poll in 2021, Johnson wrote on Instagram: \u201cI don\u2019t think our Founding Fathers EVER envisioned a six-four, bald, tattooed, half-Black, half-Samoan, tequila drinking, pick up truck driving, fanny pack wearing guy joining their club \u2013 but if it ever happens it\u2019d be my honour to serve you, the people.\u201d But last year he seemed to have changed his mind, telling CBS Mornings it was \u201coff the table\u201d because of his duties as a parent of three daughters, who are now aged 22, seven and five. \u201cThe most important thing to me is being a daddy, number one, especially during this time, this critical time in my daughters\u2019 lives,\u201d he said. On Noah\u2019s podcast, Johnson said his job as a wrestler often took him away from his eldest daughter, Simone, \u201cand I don\u2019t want that for my little ones now\u201d. \u201cThat was one of my primary discussions with the parties, who were ultimately like, \u2018Yeah, but the other ones have done it like this\u2019,\u201d he added. Johnson didn\u2019t rule out running in the future, telling Noah: \u201cIf that\u2019s ultimately what the people would want, then of course I would consider it.\u201d"

            "title": "Shapps accuses Labour of \u2018playing politics\u2019 over Braverman protest comments",
            "date": "2023-11-12T12:50:07Z",
            "content": "Grant Shapps has accused Labour of \u201ctrying to play politics\u201d over far-right protests in London, blamed in part on Suella Braverman\u2019s rhetoric, as ministers began an apparent defence of the beleaguered home secretary. Following the violent scenes around the Cenotaph on Saturday, where far-right groups fought officers in what was billed a counterprotest to a much larger pro-Palestine demonstration, Labour said Braverman had intentionally inflamed tensions and undermined the police. But in a round of interviews, the defence secretary insisted that the protesters, described by police as mainly football hooligans, had already decided to march before Braverman\u2019s statements calling the pro-Palestine demonstration a \u201chate march\u201d and accusing police of dealing less robustly with leftwing protests. Shapps defended Braverman\u2019s actions, while saying he would have used different language, and criticised politicians including Keir Starmer and Sadiq Khan for \u201ctrying to play politics with the serious points which are being made\u201d by the home secretary. He told GB News: \u201cI\u2019m not really keen on the idea that in retrospect, whether it\u2019s the leader of the opposition or the Labour London mayor, that they come in and try and politicise this weekend of all weekends. It should not be about politics.\u201d Such a robust defence marks a considerable shift from late last week, when Braverman appeared on the verge of getting sacked after a clearly furious No 10 said she had submitted a controversial article to the Times about the marches without making requested changes. The supreme court is expected to rule on the legality of the government\u2019s Rwanda deportation scheme for asylum seekers this week and there is speculation that Sunak might remove Braverman in a later reshuffle, potentially after this month\u2019s autumn statement. Allies of Braverman expect her to be in the job for Wednesday\u2019s court ruling. In other interviews, Shapps argued that while the bulk of the 126 arrests on Saturday were among the far-right crowds, this was likely to change as officers pored over footage of seemingly antisemitic placards and chants at the pro-Palestine march. Asked whether Braverman had in part provoked the far-right violence \u2013 a view seemingly taken by the Met police, which said \u201ca week of intense debate about protest and policing\u201d had contributed to inflamed tensions \u2013 Shapps said it had not. \u201cThe counterprotest was already going to happen,\u201d he told Sky\u2019s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips show. \u201cThose people who were going to come and try and disrupt this weekend had already said they were going to do it. They were doing it, in their own twisted way, because they were protesting themselves against other marches.\u201d Speaking before Shapps on Sky News, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said both Braverman and Sunak had \u201cmade it harder for the police to do their jobs, both in inflaming tensions but also undermining confidence and respect in the police\u201d. Asked whether this had helped distract attention from Labour divisions over whether to back a ceasefire in Gaza, Cooper said: \u201cI think this is much more serious than that. Suella Braverman decided to launch an unprecedented attack on the impartiality of the police, and also to deliberately inflame tensions in the run-up to remembrance weekend. \u201cNo home secretary has ever done that before. Her job is supposed to be to support the police and to work with the police and to calm tensions. She did the opposite. And she did the opposite in a really damaging and irresponsible way.\u201d In an overnight comment article for the Sunday Telegraph, Starmer said Braverman\u2019s recent comments, including a description of homelessness as a \u201clifestyle choice\u201d showed \u201ca total lack of respect for this country\u2019s values and its principles\u201d. He wrote: \u201cFew people in public life have done more recently to whip up division, set the British people against one another and sow the seeds of hatred and distrust than Suella Braverman. In doing so, she demeans her office.\u201d Writing in the Sunday Mirror, Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said that if Sunak did not sack Braverman, \u201che\u2019s too weak or agrees with her\u201d. Sacking Braverman would, however, prompt anger from her allies on the right of the Tory party. One of them, the MP for Devizes, Danny Kruger, said the main lesson of the weekend had been that \u201cmaybe it would have been best if the [pro-Palestine] march hadn\u2019t been allowed to go ahead\u201d."

There are also mounting divisions ahead of the UK supreme court\u2019s ruling on Wednesday on whether or not government plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda are lawful. Clarke, another former cabinet minister, said on Tuesday he agreed with criticism by the former business secretary Rees-Mogg of Rishi Sunak\u2019s sacking of Suella Braverman as home secretary and the implications of that for the aftermath of the ruling. Rees-Mogg made a distinction between Braverman\u2019s desire for the UK to overturn Britain\u2019s obligations under an article of the convention and the position of her replacement, James Cleverly, who has defied the Tory right by arguing that the UK should remain a signatory of European convention on human rights (ECHR). The MP and GB News presenter told BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight: \u201cIn the public mind she was in favour of controlling migration and being tough on crime and dealing with marches that were intimidating people. The prime minister has now put himself on the side of not controlling migration and not being tough on crime. For a Conservative minister that is a strange position to be in.\u201d Rees-Mogg claimed that the Conservatives were in danger of losing votes to the Reform UK party and said the champagne would be flowing at its headquarters. Its leader, Richard Tice, claimed on Tuesday that hundreds of new recruits had already come over to it after a day of what he described as \u201cTory chaos\u201d. Another Tory MP, Andrea Jenkyns, published a formal letter of no confidence in the prime minister on Monday. A noted supporter of Boris Johnson who served as schools minister under Liz Truss, she tweeted her letter to the party\u2019s backbench 1922 Committee, saying: \u201cEnough is enough \u2026 It is time for Rishi Sunak to go and replace him with a \u2018real\u2019 Conservative party leader.\u201d The new Conservative party chair, Richard Holden, said Sunak\u2019s reshuffle had created a \u201cvery broad team\u201d. Asked about the appointment of Cameron as foreign secretary, he said: \u201cYou always want to bring in some experience and, also, you want to bring in some younger people like Laura Trott, one of the new cabinet ministers, as well.\u201d He declined to give a view on Braverman\u2019s sacking but told Sky News she was \u201ctotally entitled to her opinions\u201d."

            "date": "2023-11-09T18:04:40Z",
            "content": "Despite the fast-moving, wildly unpredictable and frequently improbable turns Spanish politics has taken of late, very few pundits could have predicted the scenes that played out in Belgium on Thursday. A little after 2pm, a 60-year-old Catalan politician and fugitive from Spanish justice addressed a packed conference at the Brussels press club. As reporters brimmed with questions that would go unanswered, Carles Puigdemont appeared to be relishing his moment. \u201cWe are entering an unprecedented stage that must be explored and made use of,\u201d he said. His words were hardly an understatement. Thursday\u2019s deal \u2013 in which Puigdemont\u2019s separatist, centre-right Junts party agreed to support Spain\u2019s socialists back into government in return for an amnesty for those who had taken part in the failed push for Catalan independence that he himself had masterminded \u2013 was historic. The pact, unthinkable even six months ago, marks a new act in Puigdemont\u2019s political career, bringing him from peripheral self-exile to one of the unlikeliest kingmakers in Spanish politics. Although Puigdemont, a former journalist, remains one of the many and assorted b\u00eates noires of the Spanish right because of his role as the architect of the illegal and unilateral referendum of October 2017, his political star had appeared to be waning. After fleeing Spain six years ago to avoid arrest for his role in the botched secession, leaving others in his cabinet to face trial and imprisonment, he reinvented himself in the small Belgian town of Waterloo as an MEP and the leader of what he termed a Catalan \u201cgovernment in exile\u201d. Others, less charitably, had viewed him as an \u201coperetta nationalist\u201d and a spent, diminished figure. Quim Torra, who succeeded Puigdemont as Catalan president, failed to attract the devotion his predecessor had inspired, and was ridiculed for saying that Catalonia was suffering \u201ca humanitarian crisis\u201d. Torra\u2019s previous, vehemently anti-Spanish tweets also came back to haunt him. A few years earlier, Torra had suggested that \u201cSpaniards know only how to plunder\u201d, claimed that Catalonia had been under Spanish occupation since 1714 and said Spaniards had long since removed the word \u201cshame\u201d from the dictionary. He later apologised \u201cif anyone was offended by the tweets\u201d. With Puigdemont abroad and his former vice-president, Oriol Junqueras, jailed for his part in the secessionist gamble, ever wider cracks began to appear in the Catalan independence movement. Puigdemont\u2019s Junts wanted a hardline, high-stakes continuation of his earlier strategy, while Junqueras\u2019s more pragmatic Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) party favoured a longer-term and less confrontational approach to securing regional independence. By October last year, the two parties were at such loggerheads that Junts abandoned the regional coalition government, leaving the region in the minority hands of the ERC. Little by little, the once united independence movement began to sputter and stall. Neither were the efforts of some within the movement to carry on demonising the Spanish state helped when Pedro S\u00e1nchez became prime minister in 2018. Unlike his conservative predecessors \u2013 who had baited the Catalan independence movement, ignored it as it reached critical mass and then sent in the police to use force to stop people voting in the 2017 referendum \u2013 the socialist leader proffered carrots rather than sticks. His softly-softly approach, aimed at healing the fractures within Catalan society and in the region\u2019s relationship with the rest of Spain, yielded dividends, as did his controversial decision to pardon Junqueras and eight other separatist leaders in the interests of \u201ccoexistence and harmony\u201d. The Catalan branch of the socialist party finished first in the Catalan regional election held in February 2021, even though Junts and the ERC went on to form a government. But it was only after finishing second in July\u2019s inconclusive general election \u2013 and sitting down to do the electoral maths \u2013 that S\u00e1nchez showed precisely how placatory he was prepared to be in return for winning the support he needed from the ERC and Junts. The question now is whether S\u00e1nchez\u2019s latest gamble will pay off \u2013 and how long Puigdemont\u2019s newly acquired sense of political flexibility will last. The Spanish right, and some socialist voters, are unlikely to forgive S\u00e1nchez for what they see as a cynical and self-serving deal with the devil. The ERC is also probably less than thrilled to see the spotlight swinging back to Puigdemont and his uncompromising brand of politics. But whatever exultation Puigdemont and others may be feeling at the prospect of the amnesty law today, the fact remains that neither Spain nor Catalonia are the places they were six years ago when the then regional president climbed into a car and fled abroad in secret. When the push for independence plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in decades, a survey by the Catalan government\u2019s Centre for Opinion Studies found 48.7% of Catalans supported independence while 43.6% did not. Another survey, conducted by the same centre in July this year, suggests a dramatic reversal of fortune, with 52% of Catalans opposed to independence and 42% in favour."

            "content": "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson has revealed that multiple political parties approached him last year to see if he would run for US president, after a poll revealed 46% of Americans would support his campaign. Appearing as the first guest on Trevor Noah\u2019s new Spotify podcast What Now?, the actor and former WWE wrestler said a 2021 poll of 30,000 American adults led to \u201cthe parties\u201d contacting him to ask if he was interested in running at the end of 2022. \u201cThat was an interesting poll that happened and I was really moved by that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI was really blown away and I was really honoured. I\u2019ll share this little bit with you: at the end of the year in 2022, I got a visit from the parties asking me if I was going to run, and if I could run. \u201cIt was a big deal, and it came out of the blue,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was one after the other, and they brought up that poll, and they also brought up their own deep-dive research that would prove that should I ever go down that road [I\u2019d be a real contender]. It was all very surreal because that\u2019s never been my goal. My goal has never been to be in politics. As a matter of fact, there\u2019s a lot about politics that I hate.\u201d However, Johnson, who has described himself as a \u201ccentrist\u201d and \u201cpolitical independent\u201d and publicly endorsed US president Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign, has openly shared his interest in running in the past. In 2016 he told GQ: \u201cI can\u2019t deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring.\u201d A year later he told Variety the 2024 presidential campaign was a \u201crealistic consideration\u201d. His sitcom Young Rock even hinges around him running for US president in 2032, with Johnson playing his future self as he gives interviews about moments in his early life that structure every episode. Responding to the aforementioned poll in 2021, Johnson wrote on Instagram: \u201cI don\u2019t think our Founding Fathers EVER envisioned a six-four, bald, tattooed, half-Black, half-Samoan, tequila drinking, pick up truck driving, fanny pack wearing guy joining their club \u2013 but if it ever happens it\u2019d be my honour to serve you, the people.\u201d But last year he seemed to have changed his mind, telling CBS Mornings it was \u201coff the table\u201d because of his duties as a parent of three daughters, who are now aged 22, seven and five. \u201cThe most important thing to me is being a daddy, number one, especially during this time, this critical time in my daughters\u2019 lives,\u201d he said. On Noah\u2019s podcast, Johnson said his job as a wrestler often took him away from his eldest daughter, Simone, \u201cand I don\u2019t want that for my little ones now\u201d. \u201cThat was one of my primary discussions with the parties, who were ultimately like, \u2018Yeah, but the other ones have done it like this\u2019,\u201d he added. Johnson didn\u2019t rule out running in the future, telling Noah: \u201cIf that\u2019s ultimately what the people would want, then of course I would consider it.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-11-28T20:30:48Z",
            "content": "The presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, three of the country\u2019s most prestigious universities, are set to testify before a congressional committee next week on claims that antisemitic protests have taken place on their campuses, marking the latest window into ongoing tensions sparked by the Israel-Hamas war. Next Tuesday, Harvard\u2019s Claudine Gay, Penn\u2019s Liz Magill and MIT\u2019s Sally Kornbluth will stand before the House education and workforce committee, a body chaired by Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina. \u201cOver the past several weeks, we\u2019ve seen countless examples of antisemitic demonstrations on college campuses. Meanwhile, college administrators have largely stood by, allowing horrific rhetoric to fester and grow,\u201d said Foxx in a statement introducing the hearing, which is titled Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism. Foxx said college and university presidents have a responsibility to foster and uphold a safe learning environment for both students and staff. \u201cNow is not a time for indecision or milquetoast statements,\u201d she added. \u201cBy holding this hearing, we are shining the spotlight on these campus leaders and demanding they take the appropriate action to stand strong against antisemitism.\u201d Earlier this month, the US Department of Education\u2019s office for civil rights opened investigations into possible ancestry or ethnic discrimination at several universities, including Cornell, Penn, Wellesley College, Cooper Union, Lafayette College, the University of Tampa and Columbia. Of those, at least five allege antisemitic harassment, and two allege anti-Muslim harassment. The office for civil rights said the investigations are part of \u201cefforts to take aggressive action to address the alarming nationwide rise in reports of antisemitism, anti-Muslim, anti-Arab and other forms of discrimination\u201d. But finding a line between legitimate protest and discrimination or hate speech has proven difficult for US university leaders, who are bidden to uphold academic and political speech freedoms in their charters. Harvard\u2019s statement of rights and responsibilities, for instance, maintains that \u201ca diverse and inclusive community depends upon freedom of expression; we are not truly inclusive if some perspectives can be voiced and heard while others cannot\u201d. But notably, a recent poll found that more than half of Jewish US college students said they felt unsafe. Muslim students at universities across the country have said the same. Harvard has come under attack from alumni, including Mitt Romney, the Utah senator, for not doing enough to keep Jewish students safe. Some donors have also said they will stop funding the university. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, a former student, has called university administrators to discipline protesters who violate rules because without disciplining they will take \u201cmore aggressive, disruptive and antisemitic actions\u201d. Earlier this month Gay, Harvard\u2019s president, wrote to alumni saying the institution rejects \u201call forms of hate, and we are committed to addressing them\u201d, adding that the school had \u201cstarted the process of examining how antisemitism manifests within our community\u201d. While the House hearing is focused on antisemitism, there are also numerous claims of Islamophobia. Earlier this month, John Strauss, a professor at the University of Southern California, was suspended after telling a group of students who had gathered to protest at the killing of more than 11,000 Palestinians in Gaza and to call for a ceasefire: \u201cHamas are murderers. That\u2019s all they are. Every one should be killed, and I hope they all are killed.\u201d He allegedly walked on a list of names meant to memorialize those killed, which he said was accidental. In a statement Hussam Ayloush, CAIR-LA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cAnti-Palestinian rhetoric has been at an all-time high these last few weeks \u2013 especially at schools and universities \u2013 and wrongly conflating Palestinians and those who are in solidarity with the innocent people of Gaza with Hamas is only adding fuel to the flames of hate.\u201d University officials, he added, \u201cmust also take action to provide protective measures and resources for Muslim, Palestinian and Arab students as well as any others who are targeted by hate and bigotry\u201d. Earlier this month, New York\u2019s Columbia University saw around 400 students gathered to criticize university leaders for suspending two pro-Palestinian student groups, Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), after forming a task force on antisemitism. The university said the groups had repeatedly violated policies related to holding campus events including one that \u201cincluded threatening rhetoric and intimidation\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 November 2023 to include a full quote from John Strauss for clarity."

            "date": "2023-11-01T16:19:52Z",
            "content": "Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, has dissolved parliament and called early parliamentary and municipal elections for 17 December, less than two years after his Serbian Progressive party (SNS) won the last ballot. \u201cWe live in times that are difficult for the whole world, in times of global challenges, wars and conflicts when it is necessary that we are all united in preserving vital national and state interests of Republic of Serbia,\u201d Vu\u010di\u0107 said on Wednesday. The Serbian president is widely seen as seeking to buy time to cement his authority as he tries to work out how to best normalise ties with independent, predominantly Albanian Kosovo, which Serbia still sees as its southern province. Several Serbian opposition parties officially asked for the vote in September after the coalition government failed to accept demands from mass protests that erupted after back-to-back shootings in May that killed 18 people, half of them children. The protest organisers accused the ruling party and government-friendly media outlets of fanning a culture of violence. The parliamentary election will coincide with local votes in 65 municipalities, including the capital, Belgrade. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said on a visit to Belgrade on Tuesday that Serbia and Kosovo must step up their efforts to normalise relations after the recent flare-up of violence if they want to join the EU. Belgrade will also need to back western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, root out corruption and organised crime, reform the economy and improve the judiciary, the business climate and its human rights record, the bloc has said. At the last elections in April 2022, the conservative SNS \u2013 which has been in power since 2012 \u2013 and its partners won 120 of the 250 seats in parliament. Vu\u010di\u0107, a former hardline nationalist, was elected for a second term as president. Serbia\u2019s main opposition parties boycotted the 2020 elections and decried the process as neither free nor fair. Analysts have said the president\u2019s move is also aimed at bolstering his own support and reforming the SNS, whose popularity has slipped after months of opposition protests after the two mass shootings in May. Polls suggest an SNS-led coalition would receive about 44% of votes and would have to seek allies for a majority. The centrist opposition bloc, Against the Violence, is on about 38%, and ultranationalist and pro-Russian parties could jointly win 11%. Vu\u010di\u0107 resigned as the head of SNS in May but still wields considerable influence in the party. Opponents have accused him and his allies of autocracy, stifling the media, election fraud, violence, corruption and links to organised crime. Kosovans believe Vu\u010di\u0107\u2019s decision to call elections partly explains why he did not agree to a US-EU solution for managing northern Kosovo after five hours of meetings in Brussels last week involving senior EU leaders. Although Kosovo agreed to all parts of the plan, which was put to the leaders in Serbia and Kosovo in separate meetings the previous Saturday, Vu\u010di\u0107 refused to sign it. Kosovo has long suspected Serbia would not sign any agreement for self-management of the northern municipalities, where the population is Serbian dominated, because it would be a step on the road to official recognition of Kosovo by Belgrade. Von der Leyen told Vu\u010di\u0107 and Kosovo\u2019s prime minister, Albin Kurti, on Tuesday that the EU expected Serbia and Kosovo to respect the agreements they made in Ohrid, North Macedonia, this year to normalise their relations. Von der Leyen met Vu\u010di\u0107 in Belgrade a day after she asked Serbia to \u201cdeliver on de facto recognition of Kosovo\u201d. After their meetings in Brussels, the senior EU leaders called on Kosovo\u2019s leadership to press ahead with the self-management plan, known as the association of Serb-majority municipalities, and for Serbia to deliver on recognition.

            "date": "2023-11-30T16:51:24Z",
            "content": "The Irish president, Michael D Higgins, has led Ireland\u2019s tributes to Shane MacGowan, describing the Pogues frontman as one of \u201cmusic\u2019s greatest lyricists\u201d. After the singer\u2019s death at the age of 65, Higgins compared MacGowan\u2019s songs with \u201cperfectly crafted poems\u201d that captured \u201cthe measure of our dreams\u201d. \u201cLike so many across the world, it was with the greatest sadness that I learned this morning of the death of Shane MacGowan,\u201d Higgins said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cShane will be remembered as one of music\u2019s greatest lyricists. So many of his songs would be perfectly crafted poems, if that would not have deprived us of the opportunity to hear him sing them. \u201cThe genius of Shane\u2019s contribution includes the fact that his songs capture within them, as Shane would put it, the measure of our dreams \u2013 of so many worlds, and particularly those of love, of the emigrant experience and of facing the challenges of that experience with authenticity and courage, and of living and seeing the sides of life that so many turn away from. \u201cHis words have connected Irish people all over the globe to their culture and history, encompassing so many human emotions in the most poetic of ways.\u201d Higgins said there was \u201cparticular poignancy\u201d that MacGowan\u2019s death had come so soon after that of Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor, the Irish singer who died in July. MacGowan, who was the lead singer and songwriter of the Pogues, died on Thursday after a long period of ill health. A family statement said MacGowan had died at 3.30am, describing him as \u201cour most beautiful, darling and dearly beloved\u201d. His wife, Victoria Mary Clarke, wrote in a statement on social media: \u201cShane will always be the light that I hold before me and the measure of my dreams and the love of my life \u2026 I am blessed beyond words to have met him and to have loved him and to have been so endlessly and unconditionally loved by him.\u201d In December 2022, MacGowan was hospitalised with viral encephalitis, and as a result spent several months of 2023 in intensive care. \u201cHe was an amazing musician and artist,\u201d the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, tweeted on Thursday. \u201cHis songs beautifully captured the Irish experience, especially the experience of being Irish abroad.\u201d Speaking in the D\u00e1il, the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin called MacGowan an iconic musician whose death was particularly moving at this time of year in the context of the Christmas song Fairytale of New York. The Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said Ireland had lost a beloved icon. \u201cNobody told the Irish story like Shane \u2013 stories of emigration, heartache, dislocation, redemption, love and joy,\u201d she said. Gerry Adams, the former Sinn F\u00e9in leader, called MacGowan a good friend and said he had been with him last week when he was released from hospital. \u201cShane was an extraordinary human being whose music and kindness lifted people\u2019s spirit,\u201d Adams said in a statement. \u201cT\u00e1 s\u00e9 anois ar shl\u00ed na f\u00edrinne\u201d \u2013 he said, which can be translated as \u201che has gone to his eternal reward\u201d. His bandmate Peter \u201cSpider\u201d Stacy posted an image of MacGowan performing on a stage. \u201cO Captain! My Captain! Our fearful trip is done ...\u201d he wrote."
