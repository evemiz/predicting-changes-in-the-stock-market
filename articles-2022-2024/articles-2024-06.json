            "title": "Nuclear issue looms over Iranian presidential election to succeed Raisi",
            "date": "2024-06-04T13:25:54Z",
            "content": "About 80 candidates have registered to stand in Iran\u2019s presidential election on 28 June, taking place against the backdrop of a growing confrontation with the west over Tehran\u2019s nuclear weapons programme and UN access to its nuclear sites. The winner will replace Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has urged all sides not to add \u201cnuclear weapons to the cauldron of the Middle East\u201d. Grossi\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to negotiate fuller access to the sites, including through a phone call on Friday with Iran\u2019s acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, suggest no progress on that will be made at least until after the presidential vote. European members on the IAEA board have tabled a censure motion against Iran, throwing a firecracker into Iranian politics. It is the first such motion for 18 months and Tehran has promised it will respond if it is passed. The presidential election, with its themes of stability versus change, is in part a proxy for whether Iran should again open its economy to the west, or instead back self-sufficiency and resistance, a policy that centres on rejection of the 2015 nuclear deal. The large number of candidates, some with slogans rather than a policy prospectus, is in part a product of Iran\u2019s rejection of a party system. The field will now be reduced by a 12-member \u201cguardian council\u201d, a panel of clerics and jurists overseen by the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, who will decide on a final candidate list by 12 June. To increase voter turnout, the council is being pressed to give Iranians a wider political choice than the last presidential elections in 2021, which recorded a record low turnout of 48.5%. Seven candidates were cleared to stand that year, with three of them then standing down as part of pre-election pacts. Many others announced their candidature only to step aside for Raisi, the eventual winner and Khamenei\u2019s clear favourite. Disqualification is not subject to appeal. One test of the council\u2019s relative openness this time will be whether the former speaker Ali Larijani, an experienced politician who moved to the centre and was banned from running in 2023, can join the race. It is said Larijani only announced his candidacy after he was given private assurances he would not be blocked. Ironically, many of the candidates are promoting themselves on western social media, which is often frowned on as a subversive western tool. Each candidate is allowed to make a brief speech after their candidacy is registered. One of the most critical was by Abbas Akhondi, who has been endorsed by some of the figures around the former president Hassan Rouhani. He urged Iran to open up, saying that \u201cconfinement has never been the fate and characteristic of the Iranian nation\u201d. But reformists have lost their allure in urban areas, where many Iranians do not believe the clerical regime backed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps will tolerate social change, pointing to the brutal suppression of dissent. In a sign of the continued repression, Narges Mohammadi, the imprisoned Nobel prizewinning dissident, faces a court hearing after she accused prison guards of sexually harassing female prisoners. Among the candidates closest to the current leadership is Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, the speaker of parliament and a former member of the Revolutionary Guards. In the 2005 race for president he came fourth; in 2013 a distant second to Hassan Rouhani; and in 2017 he withdrew in favour of Raisi. His closest conservative rival may be Saeed Jalili, one of the first to register who, like Qalibaf, opposes the 2015 nuclear deal. A presidential candidate three times before, Jalili says he has enlisted the support of many Raisi loyalists, some who are likely to withdraw in favour of Jalili. He is a strong supporter of the compulsory hijab. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the populist president from 2005-2013, has registered, but was banned from standing in 2021 and it is hard to see him getting on to the ballot paper this time. Hamideh Zarabadi, one of four women standing to run, has a PhD in engineering, and supports a free press, the return of military forces to their bases, and the release of all political prisoners. No rule prevents women from standing. On the relatively moderate end of the spectrum Eshaq Jahangiri, a campaign manager for previous reformist presidential candidates and a vice-president under Hassan Rouhani, is standing."

            "date": "2024-06-14T17:25:01Z",
            "content": "The death of Iran\u2019s president, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash last month was a shock. The 63\u2011year\u2011old hardliner was not only expected to run for a second term, but to be part of the looming transition: the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is 85 and has health problems. Some had even thought Raisi might succeed him. Yet the repercussions have been muted. The first round of the presidential election is scheduled for 28 June, but no one expects Raisi\u2019s replacement to bring significant political change. The regime\u2019s priorities are continuity and stability. It knows it may soon have to reckon with the hostility of a second Trump administration and it faces widespread discontent at home, following the suppression of the massive Woman, Life, Freedom protests. The evidence of recent years suggest that it is more worried about conservative consolidation at the top than legitimacy from below. In the last race, the Guardian Council \u2013 a Khamenei-appointed elite body which vets candidates \u2013 banned all reformists. This time, one has made the cut. Masoud Pezeshkian is a doctor, MP and former health minister whose father was Azeri and whose mother was Kurdish. Cynics assume he has been picked precisely because he is unlikely to win, seeing the parliamentary speaker, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, as the likeliest victor of the six men running. Saeed Jalili, a former national security adviser known for his hardline religious views, is an alternative contender. The last presidential election, in 2021, saw the lowest ever turnout, with only 48% of electors bothering to cast their vote. So the regime needs to look credible, and to re-engage at least parts of the public. Reformists had threatened an election boycott if none of their candidates were allowed to run. Some also think that the supreme leader may hope to curb the factionalism and infighting in conservative ranks. But the widespread assumption is that Mr Pezeshkian is permitted to take part because Iran\u2019s powerbrokers are confident that he will not win. Ali Larijani, a moderate conservative who was blocked, might have posed more of a threat as a heavyweight figure. In the past, Hassan Rouhani rode to the presidency on the back of former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani\u2019s support; Mr Pezeshkian does not have such a powerful patron. In the unlikely event of him winning, those at the top will still be confident he will not pose a problem. Mr Qalibaf, who has repeatedly faced corruption allegations and who helped oversee violent crackdowns on students as a general and as a police chief, is seen as the consensus candidate for Iran\u2019s two most powerful forces: the office of the supreme leader and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, with whom he served and retains close ties. Analysts suggest he might steer Iran to what they regard as perhaps its inevitable future: dominated increasingly by the military rather than the clerical establishment. He is also a former mayor of Tehran with a reputation as a technocrat, causing some to hope that he might effect some improvement in living conditions. A more competent conservative government than Raisi\u2019s might also improve relations with the west to some degree. But the chasm between the priorities of the Iranian regime and the aspirations of those it rules over, who want not only better economic prospects but social and political freedoms, has never been greater. This election is unlikely to see any real progress in bridging it."

            "date": "2024-06-17T20:00:03Z",
            "content": "Are the voters who could matter most in determining the November election souring on Donald Trump over his felony convictions? A newly released poll showed a drop off in support for the former president among independents, who may prove crucial in tipping a race that other polls indicate is currently too close to call. However, the same survey shows a sizable segment of voters wondering whether Trump\u2019s conviction was politically motivated, while a poll of red state Iowa indicates Trump has an 18-point lead, potentially a sign of low support for Biden elsewhere in the midwest. The big caveat with all these polls is that it\u2019s still early, and a lot could change between now and the 5 November vote. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Senate Democrats will on Tuesday attempt to pass a bill banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d, which allow semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly. Majority leader Chuck Schumer pleaded with Republicans not to block the legislation. The Biden campaign is spending big to remind voters of Trump\u2019s felony conviction ahead of next week\u2019s presidential debate. Tim Scott, the Republican senator and potential vice-presidential pick for Trump, said he stood behind his decision to certify Biden\u2019s 2020 election win. The Mountain Valley Pipeline is in operation, after overcoming years of protests and lawsuits by activists concerned about the natural gas conduit\u2019s effect on the climate and environment. Joe Biden may on Tuesday announce a new program to shield from deportation undocumented spouses of US citizens. Immigration advocates are cautiously optimistic Joe Biden will unveil a new program on Tuesday that would shield from deportation the undocumented spouses of US citizens in what some say will be the largest relief program since Daca. Biden is expected to make the announcement on Tuesday during an event marking the 12th anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, which shields from deportation nearly 530,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. On a call with reporters, advocates said they were still waiting for the formal announcement, but felt confident Biden would deliver the relief many have sought for so many years. Among those who will be listening closely on Tuesday is Ashley de Azevedo, the president of American Families United. She met her husband, Sergio, an immigrant from Brazil, on a train to New York City. When they married in 2012, she assumed he would be eligible for a green card. But under US law, he would have to return to Brazil for 10 years before he could apply for permanent residency because he had entered the US illegally. \u201cThe system doesn\u2019t work like it does in the movies,\u201d Azevedo told reporters. \u201cYou don\u2019t marry an American and automatically get a green card. There are laws in place that make it impossible for so many.\u201d The expected announcement will come after Biden moved forward with an aggressive asylum crackdown that infuriated immigration advocacy groups and some Latino leaders, who compared the action to Trump-era border policies. \u201cA positive, effective announcement like the one we expect tomorrow can be a game changer for many of the voters in our communities who need to see the bright line, clear contract between the parties on immigration,\u201d said Vanessa Cardenas, the executive director of the pro-immigration group, America\u2019s Voice. It could also help Biden win back support among Hispanic voters, as polling shows Trump making significant inroads with this key constituency. \u201cWe anticipate that immigrants and Latino voters will express their gratitude at the ballot box in November, rewarding the president,\u201d said Gustavo Torres, president of CASA in Action. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would attempt to pass legislation to ban \u201cbump stocks\u201d, the device that allows semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly which the supreme court last week allowed to remain available to the public. Schumer said Martin Heinrich, the Democratic senator of New Mexico, will propose the ban, and urged Republicans not to block it. \u201cThis week, the Senate will step in to try and fix the chaos the Maga court just unleashed,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAs soon as tomorrow, Democrats will seek passage of a federal ban on bump stocks, and I urge my Republican colleagues not to block Senator Heinrich when he comes to the floor.\u201d Schumer continued: Passing a bill banning bump stocks should be the work of five minutes. Most Americans support this step. Poll after poll show that a majority of people, including independents, support restrictions on AR-15 style rifles, which is what \u2018bump stocks\u2019 are designed to emulate. I understand that the issue of gun safety provokes intense disagreement in Congress, but shouldn\u2019t we all agree that preventing another tragedy like Las Vegas is just plain common sense and a good thing. Banning bump stocks will go a long way to making it harder for murderers to carry out large shootings. So I hope our Republican colleagues join us. At her briefing to reporters today, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration disagreed with the supreme court\u2019s ruling last week allowing \u201cbump stocks\u201d to remain available, and urged Congress to ban the modifications, as well as assault weapons. The devices allow semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly, and one was used in the 2017 shooting in Las Vegas that killed 60 people. \u201cWeapons of war have no place in our streets,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cUnfortunately, the court\u2019s ruling strikes down an important, common-sense regulation on devices that convert semiautomatic rifles into weapons that can fire hundreds of bullets per minute, also known as bump stocks.\u201d She reiterated that Joe Biden would sign legislation banning bump stocks and assault weapons if Congress passes it. Left unsaid was the fact that Republicans mostly oppose such efforts. \u201cWe want to see that happen. And so, this is a legislative priority for this president,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. Here\u2019s more from last week, on the ruling by the supreme court\u2019s conservative supermajority: Donald Trump and Joe Biden are right now scheduled to debate twice before the November election, with their first encounter scheduled for 27 June. Over the weekend, CNN, the host of the first debate, made public their rules for the parlay, the Guardian\u2019s Edward Helmore reports: The first US presidential debate between incumbent Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump on 27 June will include two commercial breaks, no props and muted microphones except when recognized to speak, CNN said on Saturday. The rules, agreed outside the Commission on Presidential Debates, are designed to reduce fractious interruptions and cross-talk that have often marred TV encounters in recent presidential election cycles. CNN, a division of Warner Bros Discovery, said debate moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash \u201cwill use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion\u201d during the 90-minute broadcast from Atlanta. Another Biden-Trump face-off will be hosted by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis in September. The traditional October debate will not take place as part of the agreement between the two campaigns and television networks that cut out the commission following years of complaints and perceived slights. A big change is coming to the way Oklahoma courts handle the sentencing for domestic violence survivors found guilty of crimes, the Guardian\u2019s Olivia Empson reports: Oklahoma\u2019s governor, Kevin Stitt, signed Senate Bill 1835 at the end of last month \u2013 marking a radical change for incarcerated domestic violence survivors in the state. Also known as Oklahoma\u2019s Survivors Act, the law will be signed into effect on 1 September and will grant hundreds of people who experienced abuse the opportunity to be resentenced with more leniency in what is one of the most extensive reforms to the state\u2019s justice system following years of advocacy. Incarcerated people in Oklahoma, like Shari McDonald and April Wilkens, whose crimes were motivated by domestic violence, can file for resentencing when the law is signed. Going forward, courts can impose lesser sentences under certain circumstances if abuse is substantiated, and survivors can be considered for a lesser prison range than they were initially eligible for. Crucially, the legislation will also ensure that future survivors are not judged so harshly by the justice system for acting in self-defense. Wilkins was 25 years old when she killed her fiance. She alleged he raped, threatened and abused her for years, and that behavior had been happening on the night of the murder. She claims that pulling the trigger had been an act of retaliatory self-defense and never imagined it would be repudiated by the police who arrested her. Over the years, Wilkens had three past protective orders against her fiance and had filed 14 police reports. \u201cWhat use is a piece of paper, though,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019re dead.\u201d Norcross attended the press conference announcing his own indictment, according to several outlets. Norcross sat front row as the New Jersey attorney general gave additional insight into the corruption charges Norcross and five other defendants face. A powerful Democratic broker from New Jersey has been charged with racketeering, the New Jersey attorney general announced on Monday. George E Norcross III, a former member of the Democratic National Committee, along with five defendants face several corruption charges, according to a 13-count indictment that was unsealed on Monday. Norcross and others allegedly obtained properties throughout the city of Camden, unlawfully collecting millions in tax credits and influencing New Jersey politicians to continue their scheme, NJ.com reported. New Jersey attorney general Matthew J Platkin alleged that Norcross and others had been \u201crunning [the] criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last 12 years,\u201d the New York Times reported. \u201cOn full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests,\u201d Platkin added. Read the full NJ.com article here. Read the full Times article here (paywall). Maryland governor Wes Moore signed an executive order Monday morning that pardons more than 175,000 people with marijuana-related convictions. The pardon by Moore is the largest state pardon to date. Moore told the Washington Post that he signed the pardon to coincide with the Juneteenth holiday, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. Historically, Black people are more than three times more likely than white people to be arrested on marijuana-related charges despite similar rates of drug use. \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic that we have a real opportunity with what I\u2019m signing to right a lot of historical wrongs,\u201d Moore said to the Post. \u201cIf you want to be able to create inclusive economic growth, it means you have to start removing these barriers that continue to disproportionately sit on communities of colour.\u201d The pardon will not release anyone from prison, the Post reported, but will forgive low-level marijuana possession charges for some 100,000 people. Are the voters who could matter most in determining the November election souring on Donald Trump over his felony convictions? A newly released poll showed a drop off in support for Trump among independents, who may prove crucial in tipping a race that other polls indicate is currently too close to call. However, the same survey shows a sizable segment of voters wondering whether Trump\u2019s conviction was politically motivated, while a poll of Iowa indicates the former president has an 18-point lead in the red state, which could be a sign of low support for Biden elsewhere in the midwest. The big caveat with all these polls is that it\u2019s still early, and lots could change between now and the 5 November election. Here\u2019s what else has happened so far today: The Biden campaign is spending big to remind voters of Trump\u2019s felony conviction ahead of next week\u2019s presidential debate. Tim Scott, the Republican senator and potential vice-presidential pick for Trump, said he stood behind his decision to certify Biden\u2019s 2020 election win. The Mountain Valley Pipeline is in operation, after overcoming years of protests and lawsuits by activists concerned about the natural gas conduit\u2019s effect on the climate and environment. Reuters reports that lawyers for the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, withdrew a motion requesting a new trial after he was convicted on federal gun charges last week. Biden is considering whether to appeal his conviction, and is also scheduled to face trial in September on federal tax charges. Here\u2019s more from last week, when a jury in Delaware returned guilty verdicts on the gun charges: Donald Trump has a big lead over Joe Biden in Iowa, according to a survey of the state conducted by authoritative pollster Ann Selzer for The Des Moines Register and Mediacom. Fifty percent of Iowa voters who responded to the survey say they will vote for Trump, against 32% who say they\u2019ll support Biden, the poll finds, which is not much of a surprise, since Iowa has become increasingly Republican in recent cycles. The former president\u2019s big lead could nonetheless be a bad sign for Biden\u2019s support in other midwestern states he must win in order to secure a second term. While Iowa is not considered a swing state, there has in the past been some correlation between Trump\u2019s lead there, and his support in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2013 all states that Biden is targeting to win. Trump\u2019s 18-point lead in Iowa could signal a significant loss in support for Biden elsewhere in the midwest, but there is a big caveat: we are still a ways away from the November election, and though Selzer is considered the best pollster in the Hawkeye state, there\u2019s plenty of time for voters\u2019 sentiments to change. Joe Biden spent the weekend fundraising with his former boss, Barack Obama, and the Hollywood stars who have increasingly lined up behind the Democratic president\u2019s re-election effort. Here\u2019s more, from the Associated Press: Some of Hollywood\u2019s brightest stars headlined a glitzy fundraiser for President Joe Biden, helping raise what his re-election campaign said was a record $30m-plus and hoping to energize would-be supporters for a November election that they argued was among the most important in the nation\u2019s history. George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those who took the stage at the 7,100-seat Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Saturday night. The late-night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Biden and former president Barack Obama, who both stressed the need to defeat former president Donald Trump in a race that is expected to be exceedingly close. During more than half an hour of discussion, Kimmel asked if the country was suffering from amnesia about the presumptive Republican nominee, to which Biden responded, \u201call we gotta do is remember what it was like\u201d when Trump was in the White House. Luminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden\u2019s campaign, and just how important the event was to his re-election bid could be seen in the Democratic president\u2019s decision to fly through the night across nine time zones, from the G7 summit in southern Italy to southern California, to attend. West Virginia\u2019s Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito announced that the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline has gone into service, defying years of efforts by activists who argued the conduit would threaten the environment: The pipeline transports fracked gas through West Virginia and into Virginia, and was supported by the former state\u2019s lawmakers as necessary to meet energy demand in the mid-Atlantic and southeast. Activists sued over the pipeline, sparking a legal battle that took years to resolve, and eventually drew in the nation\u2019s most powerful judges and the White House. Here\u2019s a look back on last year\u2019s supreme court that cleared the way for the pipeline to be built: Over the weekend, Donald Trump held a rally in Detroit to shore up his support with Black voters, and attack Joe Biden over his advanced age. But as the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington reports, the former president\u2019s attempt to paint Biden as too old to serve only drew attention to the fact that he himself is no spring chicken: Donald Trump has made a point in recent months of deriding his rival Joe Biden as being cognitively impaired, mocking the 81-year-old US president for his verbal stumbles and accusing him of falling both up and down stairs. But people in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones. On Saturday night Trump, who turned 78 on Friday, returned to the theme during a speech in Detroit, Michigan to the rightwing group, Turning Point Action. He sarcastically quipped that Biden \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know what the word \u2018inflation\u2019 means\u201d, and challenged his rival in the 2024 election to take a cognitive test just as he had done when he was in the White House. Trump told his audience that he had \u201caced\u201d the cognitive test following advice from the then presidential physician, a Republican member of Congress whom he named as Ronny Johnson. \u201cHas anyone heard of Ronny Johnson, congressman from Texas?\u201d he asked the crowd. \u201cHe was the White House doctor, and he said I was the healthiest president, he feels, in history. So I liked him very much.\u201d Among those said to be on Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential short list is Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator who briefly challenged him for the Republican presidential nomination this year. Four years ago, Scott voted to certify Joe Biden\u2019s election victory, despite Trump\u2019s campaign to encourage his Republican allies to block the Democrat\u2019s ascension to the White House. Today, Scott told ABC News that he has no regrets about doing that. \u201cI will stand by that decision and the next decision to certify the fact that Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States,\u201d said the senator, who has become a prominent Trump surrogate since withdrawing from the race. That puts him at odds with Trump, who continues to insist, without evidence, that Biden\u2019s election was illegitimate. We\u2019ll see if that matters to Trump as he ponders who to choose as his running mate. Besides proclaiming his innocence of the criminal charges against him, Donald Trump has lately spent a lot of time teasing his selection of running mate. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell and David Smith with a look at what we know about his search so far: Donald Trump is looking for a \u201cfighter\u201d as his running mate in this year\u2019s presidential election and regards factors such as their gender or race as irrelevant, according to sources close to the former US president. Conventional wisdom used to hold that Trump was likely to choose a woman or a person of color as his potential vice-president in an effort to broaden his appeal. But aides close to the presumptive Republican nominee currently say he will not take so-called identity politics into account. Instead, Trump, who is still trying to make up his mind, wants a candidate who is media-savvy and will fight for him on adversarial TV networks. \u201cIn short,\u201d a Trump ally said, \u201che wants someone who is everything Mike Pence wasn\u2019t.\u201d The former vice-president was a valuable asset during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns \u2013 the Christian conservative who shored up support among Republicans suspicious of the thrice-married reality TV star. But Pence\u2019s refusal to comply with Trump\u2019s demand to overturn the 2020 election led to a falling out and made Pence a target of the January 6 rioters. Trump is seeking a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d running mate this time: strong but loyal, in tune with Maga but not over-rehearsed, telegenic but not likely to outshine him. His choice will go up against Kamala Harris, the first Black woman to serve as vice-president. Donald Trump was convicted of 34 business fraud charges in New York City, and he faces three other criminal indictments elsewhere. Fortunately for him, those cases are all either bogged down in pre-trial motions and appeals, or on pause indefinitely, and unlikely to be resolved before the November election. Here\u2019s our primer on all the legal matters, criminal and civil, the former president is dealing with: Yesterday was Father\u2019s Day, which Donald Trump seized on as yet another opportunity to argue that the criminal cases against him are politically motivated. \u201cHAPPY FATHER\u2019S DAY TO ALL, INCLUDING THE RADICAL LEFT DEGENERATES THAT ARE RAPIDLY BRINGING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA INTO THIRD WORLD NATION STATUS WITH THEIR MANY ATTEMPTS AT TRYING TO INFLUENCE OUR SACRED COURT SYSTEM INTO BREAKING TO THEIR VERY SICK AND DANGEROUS WILL,\u201d the former president wrote on Truth Social. In 10 days, Donald Trump and Joe Biden will hold the first of two scheduled debates at CNN studios in Atlanta. Ahead of their 27 June encounter, the president\u2019s re-election campaign announced it will be spending $50m on television advertisements to remind voters that the former president is now a convicted felon. \u201cTrump approaches the first debate as a convicted felon who continues to prove that he will do anything and harm anyone if it means more power and vengeance for Donald Trump. That\u2019s why he was convicted, that\u2019s why he encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol on January 6, and it\u2019s why his entire campaign is an exercise in revenge and retribution; because that man is blind to the people a president should be serving and will do absolutely anything for his own personal gain and for his own power,\u201d said Michael Tyler, the Biden-Harris campaign\u2019s communications director. The ad is called \u201cCharacter Matters\u201d, and you can see it here: The campaign is also spending money this month on ads targeted at Black, Asian and Hispanic voters, which talk about subjects like the Affordable Care Act, and the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to fight inflation. If there is good news for Donald Trump in the Politico Magazine and Ipsos poll released this morning, it\u2019s that many voters have questions over the fairness of his felony conviction. Trump and his surrogates have insisted that his prosecution in New York City on 34 business fraud charges was a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d orchestrated by Democrats and, in particular, Joe Biden. In fact, the charges were brought by Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who is indeed a Democrat, but there is no evidence that he was doing the party\u2019s bidding, or that the White House, which does not have the power to direct local prosecutors, was involved. Nonetheless, the survey shows signs those arguments may have broken through with some voters. While a 46% plurality said they thought the verdict was \u201cfair and impartial\u201d, 32% disagreed, while 19% said they did not know \u2013 a group that Trump could perhaps sway. The perception that Biden was \u201cdirectly involved\u201d in bringing the case was also common among survey respondents, with 29% saying yes, and 25% saying they did not know. Both results indicate that there could be some upside potential for Trump, as he continues to proclaim his innocence of the charges. Good morning, US politics blog readers. From the Access Hollywood tape to January 6, Donald Trump has repeatedly been associated with the sorts of scandals that would have sunk other politicians\u2019 careers, but did not stop his rise to the White House, nor his once again becoming the GOP\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee this year. Yet the evidence continues to mount that the title \u201cconvicted felon\u201d, which he gained after a New York City jury found him guilty of 34 business fraud charges in May, may make a difference with the sorts of voters expected to decide his November election rematch against Joe Biden. Politico Magazine and Ipsos today released a survey showing that 21% of independents were less likely to vote for Trump because of his conviction, while a mere 5% said it made them more likely to support him. Recent polls of swing states have showed a neck-and-neck contest between the current and former president. While plenty can change between now and November, the poll\u2019s findings raise the possibility that the election could come down to how small groups of voters swing. Independents are one such group, and if they continue to be turned off by his criminal conviction, it could give Biden the edge. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Biden holds a White House meeting with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg at 3.30pm. Expect lots of talk about Ukraine and Russia. The first presidential debate is in 10 days, and the Biden campaign is targeting Trump with a $50m barrage of ads over his felony conviction, to be aired in the days leading up to their parlay. Trump continues to hype up his pick for vice-president, though he has yet to announce a decision. Ohio senator JD Vance, New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, South Carolina senator Tim Scott and North Dakota governor Doug Burgum are said to be in the mix, with an announcement likely closer to the Republican national convention next month."

            "content": "Moderators in the first presidential debate in 2024 took a completely hands-off approach to factchecking the candidates, letting lies and half-truths, most frequently from Donald Trump, remain unchallenged. The former president frequently ignored the questions posed by CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, instead talking about whatever he wanted. In a few instances, they reiterated the question and gave Trump a chance to answer it again. Joe Biden sometimes pushed back on Trump\u2019s claims, and vice versa, though not always with specificity beyond saying the other was lying. US elections 2024: a guide to the first presidential debate Biden v Trump: 90 miserable minutes Who won the meme wars? Biden\u2019s performance sends Democrats into panic Six who could replace Biden Trump and Biden\u2019s claims \u2013 factchecked The light moderation left lingering lies, though the network said before the debate that the moderators wouldn\u2019t intercede. \u201cObviously, if there is some egregious fact that needs to be checked or the record needs to be made clear, Jake and Dana can do that,\u201d David Chalian, CNN\u2019s political director, told the Associated Press before the debate. \u201cBut that\u2019s not their role. They are not here to participate in this debate. They are here to facilitate a debate between Trump and Biden.\u201d Here are the facts on some of the false claims offered during Thursday\u2019s debate. Abortion The claim: Trump says Democrats support abortion until birth and that \u201ceverybody\u201d wanted to overturn Roe v Wade. The facts: Later abortions are a common line of attack among Republicans \u2013 but it\u2019s based on a myth. Less than 1% of abortions in the US are performed at or past 21 weeks, largely because of fetal abnormalities or lack of access to care earlier in pregnancy. And Roe remained popular throughout the half-century it was in effect. Some anti-abortion activists have also argued that the federal government can use an existing law to implement a federal ban on abortion. The US supreme court has also dealt with two abortion cases so far this year \u2013 evidence that the issue is far from settled at the national level. The environment The claim: Trump had \u201cthe best environmental numbers ever\u201d. The facts: It\u2019s not clear what \u201cenvironmental numbers\u201d Trump is referring to, making it impossible to factcheck. But the Guardian has compiled 75 ways Trump made the country dirtier and the climate warmer. Prescription drug reform The claim: Biden oversold his prescription drug reforms. The facts: Biden said seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket costs were capped at $200, but it\u2019s $2,000. The cap on insulin costs out of pocket are $35 a month, more than the $15 Biden claimed. The border The claim: Trump\u2019s border was the most secure in history. The facts: Trump said that when he left the presidency, the US had the most secure border in history, and later said \u201chardly\u201d anyone was coming through. While migrant apprehensions have surged under Biden, the increases began in 2020, during Trump\u2019s presidency. The reasons people were seeking to migrate include economic stress caused by the pandemic and natural disasters, as well as long-running issues including violence and political instability. The economy The claim: Biden said the economy had \u201ccollapsed\u201d and there were no jobs when Trump left office. The facts: That\u2019s a bit misleading \u2013 employment rates began to tick up pretty quickly after an initial dip at the beginning of the pandemic, before Biden took office. January 6 The claim: Trump deflected a question about the January 6 insurrection, blaming Nancy Pelosi for turning down a chance to deploy the national guard. The facts: This is false. There is no evidence Pelosi got an offer to deploy national guard troops, and even if she did, she wouldn\u2019t have the power to turn it down. The president, defense secretary and army secretary have command of the Washington DC national guard. Tax cuts The claim: Trump claimed his tax cuts were the largest in history and that his administration had the greatest economy in history. The facts: His tax cut was the fourth-largest since 1940, according to PolitiFact. According to the non-profit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\u2019s recent report, Trump created about twice as much debt ($8.4tn) as Biden ($4.3tn). Before the pandemic hit, economic growth during his presidency averaged at about 2.7% \u2013 that\u2019s good but not as good as the 4% average growth during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. Unemployment before the pandemic was as low as 3.5% \u2013 again, not as low as during Clinton\u2019s presidency. \u2018Superpredators\u2019 The claim: Trump said that Biden called Black Americans \u201csuperpredators\u201d. The facts: The superpredator theory in the 1990s suggested that a growing number of unusually violent young people, especially Black boys, posed a threat to the country. The theory capitalized on racialized fear and was used to encourage policies that led to the disproportionate incarceration of Black youth. There is no evidence Biden used the phrase or ascribed to the theory behind it. However, Biden\u2019s endorsement of the 1994 crime bill has justifiably come under scrutiny. Biden has defended the bill, and said that aspects of it were wrongly implemented."

            "date": "2024-06-27T10:00:36Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden and Donald Trump will debate on Thursday for the first time this election cycle, and it holds the potential for some history-making moments. Debates can inform voters on both the issues and temperaments of the candidates, potentially swaying an undecided voter toward one candidate\u2019s direction. They can also make for good TV, creating soundbites that resonate for decades to come. From the candidates\u2019 physical appearances to gaffes to planned attacks to off-the-cuff retorts, here are some memorable moments from US presidential debate history. 1960: The first and possibly still the most famous televised American presidential debate pitted the telegenic Democrat John F Kennedy against Republican vice-president Richard Nixon, creating defining moments for both presidential debates and television itself. The clammy Nixon was recovering from illness and had a five o\u2019clock shadow but refused makeup. TV viewers are said to have judged Kennedy the winner, whereas radio listeners gave it to Nixon or called it a draw. Kennedy won a narrow election. He was assassinated three years later. 1976: Republican president Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon after the Watergate scandal, had been closing the gap on Democrat Jimmy Carter but then remarked: \u201cThere is no Soviet domination of eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.\u201d It was seen as a critical gaffe in the context of the cold war and Carter went on to win the election. 1980: Carter accused Republican Ronald Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for the elderly. Reagan, who had complained that Carter was misrepresenting his positions on numerous issues, said with a chuckle: \u201cThere you go again.\u201d The audience erupted. The duel attracted 80.6 million viewers, the most ever for a presidential debate at that time, according to Nielsen. 1984: Reagan, at 73 the oldest president in US history at the time, took the sting out of the issue of his age during the second debate with the Democratic candidate Walter Mondale, 56, with this line: \u201cI want you to know that, also, I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d Reagan was re-elected. 1988: Democrat Michael Dukakis, taking on the Republican vice-president George HW Bush, was asked whether he would support the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, Bernard,\u201d the Massachusetts governor replied. \u201cAnd I think you know that I\u2019ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life.\u201d He was criticised as cold and unemotional and lost the election. 1988: In the vice-presidential debate, Bush\u2019s running mate Dan Quayle compared himself with John F Kennedy. The Democratic senator Lloyd Bentsen shot back: \u201cSenator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy.\u201d It is probably the most famous line ever uttered in a vice-presidential debate and has been much parodied since. 1992: In a three-way contest with Democrat Bill Clinton and businessman Ross Perot, President George HW Bush made the fatal mistake of looking at his watch. It gave the impression of a haughty, aloof incumbent who did not want to be there and took too much for granted. Bush later admitted what had been on his mind: \u201cOnly 10 more minutes of this crap.\u201d He lost to Clinton. 2000: Democratic vice-president Al Gore went into the debate leading in the polls but sighed loudly when his rival, Republican George W Bush, spoke. In another incident, he was criticised for invading Bush\u2019s personal space when Bush strolled forward and Gore rose and moved towards his rival, as if looking for a fight. Bush dismissed him with a nod and won a close and bitterly disputed election. 2012: President Barack Obama was widely felt to have \u201cphoned in\u201d his first lackluster debate performance against Republican Mitt Romney, who performed above expectations. But in the second debate, Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had \u201cbinders full of women\u201d as candidates for cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media and Romney lost in November. US elections 2024: a guide to the first presidential debate What to know about the Biden-Trump debate Debate could open up the race for the White House An election rarity: two ex-presidents in an contest RFK Jr fails to qualify for the first debate and blames CNN 2016: With no incumbent in the mix, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton debated like an outsider and a seasoned public servant, respectively. In perhaps the most enduring soundbite, Clinton hit at Trump\u2019s failure to pay income taxes in the few tax returns that were public at the time. \u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d Trump retorted. He also called people coming into the US \u201cbad hombres\u201d, botching the pronunciation of the word. And in one eerie moment, Trump stood close behind Clinton as she answered an audience question, which Clinton later wrote made her skin crawl. Trump also refused to say whether he\u2019would accept the results of the election \u2013 which he would go on to win in 2016. 2020: Trump, now the incumbent, debated Joe Biden in his characteristically testy way, replete with interruptions. At one point, an exasperated Biden pleaded, \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d. That memorable line came as the debate schedule was affected by a new virus, Covid-19, spreading through the country. Trump tested positive for the virus, leading to the cancellation of the second debate. His former chief of staff claimed Trump tested positive before the first debate but didn\u2019t disclose it, a claim that Trump called \u201cfake news\u201d. Biden went on to win the election.

            "date": "2024-06-03T13:54:18Z",
            "content": "Kevin McCarthy, the former Republican US House speaker, has said that Americans should accept the results of November\u2019s presidential race \u2013 as rising political tensions in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign finance violation conviction in New York are set to inflame election integrity issues. The relatively moderate McCarthy, who was ousted as speaker last year in a Republican power struggle and has since resigned from Congress, said on Sunday that \u201cevery American should accept the results\u201d of the election that is expected to pit the Democratic incumbent Joe Biden against the former Republican president Trump. McCarthy\u2019s remarks on CNN\u2019s Inside Politics came after Marco Rubio, the senior Florida senator and potential Trump vice-presidential pick, refused to commit to standing by the outcome on Sunday. Like Rubio, McCarthy is an ally of Trump, and he even visited the former president after his supporters carried out the January 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021. But he is now contradicting a Republican narrative that has become a test of loyalty to Trump: questioning the integrity of the US electoral system, at least when conservative candidates lose at the ballot box. After the guilty verdict in the New York case against Trump came down on Thursday, the Maryland Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin said that if the former president wins the vote in November then he \u201cshould be impeached before he was even sworn in\u201d given his conviction. But other Democrats have adopted a more conciliatory position. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, said on Sunday that he would \u201ccertainly\u201d accept the results \u201cbecause in America the peaceful transfer of power is sacrosanct\u201d. Jeffries cast the blame on the extreme right wing of the Republican party, saying that \u201cmany Americans \u2013 Democrats, independents and traditional Republicans \u2013 have been troubled by the election denialism or the denial that we\u2019ve seen coming from the other side of the aisle\u201d. Trump has also said that he would accept November\u2019s vote \u2013 but only, he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in May, \u201cif everything\u2019s honest\u201d. On Sunday night, Trump posted on his social media site a call for the US supreme court to intervene in his conviction in New York state court ahead of his scheduled sentencing on 11 July. Legally an appeal can only be initiated after sentencing. McCarthy, who is free of political obligation to Trump, had previously signed a legal petition soon after the 2020 election that urged the supreme court to review a Texas lawsuit challenging the election results in several swing states. He also voted not to certify election results from Arizona and Pennsylvania during the vote certification process that came after police managed to halt the 2021 Capitol attack. But in his interview with CNN, McCarthy said that resistance to election results was not just a question for politicians but \u201cfor the whole American public\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get beyond it,\u201d McCarthy said."

            "title": "The hidden story behind India\u2019s remarkable election results: lethal heat | Amitava Kumar",
            "date": "2024-06-05T14:14:46Z",
            "content": "The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), led by India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has won more seats than the opposition alliance, and yet its victory tastes of defeat. Why? In the days leading to the election, the BJP\u2019s main slogan had been Abki baar, 400 Paar, a call to voters to send more than 400 of its candidates to the 543-member parliament. This slogan, voiced by Modi at his campaign rallies, set a high bar for the party. Most exit polls had predicted a massive victory for the BJP \u2013 and now the results, with that party having won only 240 seats, suggest that the electorate has sent a chastening message to the ruling party and trimmed its hubris. Let\u2019s take as an example what has happened in the Faizabad constituency. Faizabad, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, also includes the city of Ayodhya. Back in January, Modi inaugurated, with tremendous fanfare and pomp, a temple built on the site where a Hindu mob had demolished a 16th-century mosque. The opening of the temple had not only brought to fruition a three-decade-old promise of the BJP, it also cemented the notion of India as a Hindu majoritarian state. The inaugural ceremonies were led by Modi, and he stood inside the temple, in its sanctum sanctorum, with the head of the militantly ultranationalist Hindu group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Modi called that moment \u201cthe beginning of a new era\u201d, but to many it signified the end of the secular ideals behind the idea of India. And yet, one of the most significant outcomes in this election has been the defeat of the BJP candidate in Ayodhya. It was not the inauguration of the temple and the televised spectacle attended by celebrities that mattered in the end; instead, it was the more pressing issues of unemployment and price rise that the voters cared about. A survey spread across 19 of India\u2019s 28 states showed that while 22% of the people felt that the temple was the Modi government\u2019s \u201cmost liked\u201d action, only 8% said that it was their primary concern. In contrast, unemployment was the primary concern for 27% of those surveyed. You wouldn\u2019t know this if you heard the hype in India\u2019s television studios, where enthusiastic anchors mirrored Modi\u2019s aggressive statements, particularly his hostile and bigoted remarks about Muslims \u2013 but there was no Modi wave. There was only the heatwave. Just this week, in my hometown of Patna, in eastern India, I met a man named Ashutosh Pandey who told me that the level of heat had proved fatal for people in his own village: he wasn\u2019t going to risk voting, and neither was his mother. People in Patna voted on 1 June, the last day of the seven-phase polling schedule. In Patna, the temperature had hovered above 40C. Local newspapers carried government ads exhorting voters to exercise their franchise, as well as half-page ads from the health ministry offering advice about how to avoid heatstroke. In the days leading to the voting in Patna, there were reports of personnel at polling stations dying from the heat. In the nation\u2019s capital, Delhi, there were protests over water shortages. Last week, the temperature in Delhi hit 49.9C. One could say that the overbearing, unendurable heat was an obstacle to democracy because it was impossible for many \u2013 especially those who are poor, need to earn their livelihood or are without means of travel \u2013 to contemplate standing in a line to vote. The crucial point to be noted here is that the heat did not figure at all among the thundering sentiments delivered from the dais by the candidates. The prominent environmentalist Ashish Kothari told me that the \u201cfull dimensions of the climate crisis\u201d had escaped both the BJP\u2019s and Congress\u2019s manifestos. In the face of such silence, it fell on the Delhi High Court to warn of the effects of global warming this past week: The court warned that Delhi could soon turn into \u201ca barren desert.\u201d Perhaps the election results hold a small promise of change. The Indian electorate has resurrected a viable opposition in the parliament \u2013 a possibility that had seemed remote when the television channels were forecasting an inevitable and overwhelming BJP triumph. There might still be drama in store with shifting alliances in the coming days. But all of this will appear ordinary, maybe banal, and certainly irresponsible and deadly, when the effects of overheating and water shortage spread through India. The truth about climate change is that it exacerbates social inequities, and once multiple crises begin to unfold in the future, one of the first victims will be the faith in democracy that we are all experiencing in this heady moment. Amitava Kumar is an Indian journalist and author. His latest novel, My Beloved Life, is out now."

            "date": "2024-06-02T18:56:10Z",
            "content": "Final results from Wednesday\u2019s seismic South Africa elections have confirmed that the African National Congress (ANC) party has lost its majority for the first time in 30 years of full democracy, firing the starting gun on unprecedented coalition talks. The ANC, which led the fight to free South Africa from apartheid, won just 159 seats in the 400-member national assembly on a vote share of just over 40%. High unemployment, power cuts, violent crime and crumbling infrastructure have contributed to a haemorrhaging of support for the former liberation movement. The pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) won 87 seats, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) \u2013 a new party led by President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s bitter rival, the former president Jacob Zuma \u2013 took 58, and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a Marxist-Leninist party led by the ousted ANC youth leader Julius Malema, took 39. The ANC also lost its majority in three provinces: Northern Cape; Gauteng, which is home to the commercial centre Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria; and KwaZulu-Natal, where MK was the largest party. \u201cWhat this election has made plain is that the people of South Africa expect their leaders to work together to meet their needs,\u201d Ramaphosa told an audience of politicians, diplomats and civil society leaders after the official results announcement, as thunder rumbled outside. \u201cThey expect the parties for which they have voted to find common ground, to overcome their differences, to act and work together for the good of everyone.\u201d Ramaphosa also joked, to laughter from the crowd, that he wished it was true when the electoral commission chair accidentally said that he was announcing the 2029 election results. The president faces questions about his future, though, as the ANC turns to the task of coalition building. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Zuma\u2019s MK party said they had boycotted the election results event. Zuma had warned before the results announcement that it should not go ahead, saying \u201cpeople would be provoked\u201d, raising the spectre of the deadly riots that broke out when he was sent to prison in 2021. The position of Ramaphosa was not on the table during the coalition talks that will now take place, the general secretary of the ANC said before the final results were announced. ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula told a press conference at the election results centre: \u201cIf you come to us with a demand that Ramaphosa must step down as the president, that is not going to happen \u2026 It\u2019s a no-go area. You come to us with that demand, forget it.\u201d MK leaders have said they will not work with the ANC while it is led by Ramaphosa, who Zuma is hell-bent on exacting revenge against. Zuma was president from 2009 to 2018 and was forced to resign by the ANC amid corruption allegations, which he denies. \u201cPolitical parties have approached us and we will be talking to \u2026 everybody,\u201d Mbalula said. \u201cTalks about talks are in full swing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got many reservations about that party, but we will talk to them,\u201d he said of the MK. \u201cBut no political party will dictate terms like that to us as the ANC.\u201d The ANC is in its weakest position since it swept to power under Nelson Mandela in 1994. Nonetheless, it has options beyond Zuma\u2019s MK. A tie-up with the DA could be favoured by the more business-friendly wing of the ANC. However, such a coalition would face criticisms from the many black South Africans who see the white-led DA as favouring the interests of white people, which the DA denies. Some analysts have said that bringing in a third, black-led party could help the ANC head off those criticisms. DA leaders have said a coalition is an option, as well as a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d arrangement with an ANC minority government and staying in opposition. Another option for the ANC, and one that is likely to be preferred by the left wing of the party, is to link up with the EFF. That option would need another partner to clear the 50% needed, however. Often mentioned is the Inkatha Freedom party (IFP), which took 17 seats, and, like the MK, gets most of its support from Zulu people. The MK had demanded a recount, making unsubstantiated allegations of vote rigging. \u201cNobody must declare tomorrow. If that happens, people will be provoked, we know what we are talking about,\u201d Zuma, 82, told reporters at the results centre on Saturday. \u201cDon\u2019t start trouble when there is no trouble.\u201d The words of Zuma, who was the ANC\u2019s intelligence chief during apartheid, had raised fears of violence. More than 300 people were killed in riots in July 2021 riots after Zuma was sent to jail for contempt of court. The constitution stipulates that parliament must sit within 14 days of the final election results and elect a president at that first sitting."

            "date": "2024-06-10T14:23:54Z",
            "content": "Time for a recap: A Labour election victory will be a \u201cnet positive\u201d for financial markets, strategists at the US bank JP Morgan have said, in an analysis that underlines the appeal of Keir Starmer\u2019s \u201ccentrist platform\u201d to the City of London. A majority for Labour would benefit banks, builders and supermarkets, analysts led by JP Morgan\u2019s head of global equity strategy, Mislav Matejka, wrote in a note to clients published on Monday. The US investment bank said Labour\u2019s policies would be \u201cmodestly pro-growth, but crucially with a likely cautious fiscal approach\u201d. \u201cWe believe the market impact will be net positive,\u201d they wrote, saying banks and homebuilders were among the sectors that would benefit. The JP Morgan team explained: \u201cThe current Labour party is occupying a centrist platform, and the perception of policy paralysis is set to move behind us. \u201cLabour agenda is modestly pro-growth, but crucially with a likely cautious fiscal approach. Our economists believe that, given the lack of fiscal space, Labour will likely focus on supply-side reforms to help improve economic growth.\u201d More than half of the 268 respondents to a Bloomberg News poll published on Monday of readers and users of its financial markets terminal said a Labour win would be the best result for the pound. Analysts at MUFG, a Japanese investment bank, separately last week said that a landslide victory for Labour would be \u201cmost positive for the pound\u201d because it would end political instability, raise expectations of higher government spending, and potentially help usher in a more constructive relationship between the UK and EU after Brexit. Here\u2019s the full story: European financial markets have been rocked by yesteday\u2019s election results, and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s surprise decision to call snap parliamentary elections in France. The pound hit a 22-month high against the euro on Monday, reaching \u20ac1.1839, for the first time since August 2022. Macron\u2019s shock move also hit stocks in Paris, where the CAC 40 index fell over 2% at one stage. Germany\u2019s DAX was is 0.7% in afternoon trading, after German chancellor Olaf Scholz suffered losses in the EU elections. French bond prices also weakened, which widened the gap between Paris and Berlin\u2019s borrowing costs. France\u2019s 10-year bond yield (the interest rate on the bond) jumped to 3.22%, the highest since last November, up from 3.115% on Friday night. And in other news\u2026 ABN AMRO Global Insight say there are three potential scenarios how the French elections could play out. Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally party (RN) gains a majority at the parliament: This could lead to a so-called cohabitation for the remaining three years. This refers to a situation where the president\u2019s political party and the Prime Minister\u2019s party are different. In this scenario, the President would be forced to nominate a Prime Minister from the RN. This would clearly be the most risky scenario for the French debt market as it would negatively impact the country\u2019s fiscal outlook. However, for this to happen the RN would need to substantially increase its number of seats as it currently holds 89 seats in the parliament against 245 seats for the government in place. In our view, it will be difficult for the RN party to be able to close the gap to this extent. Furthermore, the risk of seeing the far-right party leading the government might push traditional parties like the PS (left-wing party) or the LR (right-wing) party to form a coalition to keep the RN party out of the government. Reunification of the left-wing NUPES coalition which was established during the past election composed of the Socialist (PS), the Greens (Les Verts), and far-left party (La France Insoumise). Last time, the NUPES coalition managed to obtain 131 seats (second biggest political force in the parliament after Macron\u2019s party). If this coalition were to gain a majority, then Macron would need to nominate a prime minister from this coalition instead. However, we deem this scenario unlikely given the recent political backlash between the socialist party (PS) and Melenchon\u2019s party (La France Insoumise), particularly following the controversial reactions to the Gaza conflict from the LFI party. Therefore, there is significant uncertainty on whether a coalition could be formed again. The parties are currently in discussion on the possibility to re-form this coalition. An update on this should follow in the upcoming days. Last, we think there is still a significant chance for Macron\u2019s party to retain its (relative) majority at the parliament. This scenario is in our view the most likely outcome at the moment, as despite the EU election results, this is usually not representative of the likely legislative election outcome. This would be the most market-friendly scenario as the current government would remain in place and continue with its economic and fiscal plan, which are more in line with the EU\u2019s fiscal rules. However, it is likely that Macron\u2019s party will lose seats compared to two years ago. Credit rating agency DBRS Morningstar has warned that the snap French legislative elections announced last night increase political uncertainty and present a risk to policy predictability. They point out that they could lead to a change of government just before Paris hosts the Olympics. There are also important fiscal events coming up, including 2024 new expenditure savings and 2025 budget preparation. Mehdi Fadli, senior vice president in the Global Sovereign Ratings Group, says: \u201cIn a strained geopolitical context, French snap elections bring heightened political uncertainty and the risk of less policy predictability to France. \u201cElections now coincide with a time of significant importance for France\u2019s fiscal trajectory.\u201d The State Bank of Pakistan has joined the growing roster of central banks cutting interest rates. Pakistan\u2019s central bank has cut rates for the first time in four years today, and by more than expected, as it lowered its benchmark rate by 150 basis points (1.5 percentage points) to 20.50%, from 22%. The State Bank eased policy after Pakistan\u2019s consumer inflation rate slowed to 11.8% in May, a 30-month low. It says: \u201cThe committee, on balance, viewed that it is now an appropriate time to reduce the policy rate.\u201d Fast-fashion pureplay PrettyLittleThing (PLT) is facing a customer backlash after becoming the latest retailer to introduce a returns fee for customers. PLT is now charging \u00a31.99 to return items in the UK, having previously offered free returns via couriers including Evri, Royal Mail and InPost. The BBC reports that some shoppers have posted screenshots on social media showing their PLT apps being deleted from their phones, with many saying they would return fewer items if the brand\u2019s sizing was more consistent. More here. PLT is hardly the first retailer to drop free returns, though. Two years ago its parent company, Boohoo, began charging shoppers to return unwanted items. Although next month\u2019s UK election could boost asset prices, it also creates economic uncertainty that could dent confidence. The 4 July poll is also likely to deter the Bank of England from lowering interest rates at its meeting later this month, explains Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK: The general election won\u2019t derail economic outlook, but there is a chance that the uncertainty means confidence takes a temporary hit. When you combine this with sticky service inflation, then it is very unlikely that we will get an interest cut before August. With markets pricing in just a 5% chance of a rate cut in June, the MPC has a good excuse to hold off until August, when we think the first cut will come. As economic headwinds continue to ease, the MPC will start to feel the heat this summer to make the first move Elsewhere today, the average shelf life of a UK mortgage has nearly halved in the space of a month. At the start of June, the typical mortgage was spending 15 days on the market before being pulled from sale, down from an average of 28 days at the start of May, according to data provider Moneyfacts. June\u2019s reading is the shortest average time period recorded since March, with offers being pulled as lenders reviewed their ranges, repricing some offers and withdrawing others. Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts, says: \u201cConsumers concerned about rising rates would be wise to seek advice from an independent broker to see if they can lock into a deal early, as some will let borrowers do this from three to six months in advance. However, there may well be some borrowers sitting on the fence, hoping the market gets a base rate cut this year, but they could still grab a lower rate deal than if they were to sit on their SVR without fixing, such as with a tracker deal. Those about to come off a five-year fixed mortgage will have to face the reality that rates are much higher now on an equivalent deal, 2.65% in fact, compared to June 2019, so consumers must ensure they can afford the higher repayments.\u201d The pound\u2019s rally to a 22-month high against the euro this morning will be a boost to UK holidaymakers visiting the continent this summer (once they\u2019ve got through the queues\u2026). At \u20ac1.1823 this morning, sterling is up 2.5% so far this year against the euro, meaning pound will go a little further at European gift shops, bars and restaurants. It\u2019s 6% stronger than in the aftermath of the 2022 mini-budget, when the pound fell and was only worth \u20ac1.11. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, says: \u201cThe prospect for an overwhelming Labour victory at the General Election next month is actually buoying Sterling, which has broken out of its year long range against the euro. Markets view a Labour majority as perhaps the most market-friendly outcome of the elections \u2013 a reflection of both the lingering damage done by Liz Truss\u2019s ill-fated budget, a shift towards the political centre under Keir Starmer and the likelihood of a less contentious relationship with the European Union. There are three tactical reasons why Emmanual Macron plumped for shock parliamentary elections after learning his centrist alliance had lagged far behind the far-right National Rally (RN) in the European parliamentary elections, says Philippe Ledent, senior economist at ING. On the one hand, the short campaign ahead will force the other parties to clarify their positions. Remember that in the current parliament, no political group has a majority (neither the president\u2019s party, the traditional parties, nor the RN). Until now, it has almost always been impossible to form stable coalitions on important reforms, forcing the government to go by force (using article 49.3 of the constitution, allowing it to pass laws without a vote in parliament unless parliament passes a no-confidence motion). The threat of a major RN parliamentary victory could move positions. The president probably also wants to show that the vote in the European elections was a protest vote, giving the image of a stronger RN than is actually the case. Let\u2019s not forget that, contrary to the European ones, the legislative elections are held in two rounds and abstention reached over 48.5% during yesterday\u2019s vote. No doubt President Macron is counting on voter mobilisation and alliances between the two rounds to overturn yesterday\u2019s results. Assuming, however, that the RN manages to win an absolute majority (which would require it to win over 200 seats compared with its current representation), President Macron would be forced to co-habit with a government drawn from the RN. If anything, history has shown that this works against the governing party. As for the RN, unaccustomed to power, perhaps the president wants to demonstrate that the RN is not the solution, though this remains a gamble. The European election results aren\u2019t the only factor weighing on markets today. Investors are also anxious that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, may not cut US interest rates as soon as hoped. Early rate cuts look extremely unlikely after America\u2019s economy added 272,000 new jobs last month, much more than expected. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index, explains: The DAX is falling but is holding up better than some of its European peers, such as the French CaC, as investors digest the results from European parliamentary elections. Eurosceptic far-right parties performed well, and Chancellor Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats fell to third place behind the far-right Alternative for Germany. Meanwhile, in France, President Emmanuel Macron surprised the markets by calling for snap elections after Marine Le Pen\u2019s hard-right National Rally party won more than 30% of the votes. French banks were bearing the brunt of the news, with BNP and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale among the largest decliners. Stocks suffered a double blow as election worries combined with concerns that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates anytime soon. The hotter the following stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday has seen the market rein in Federal Reserve rate cut expectations. Meanwhile, in Europe, the ECB cut interest rates last week but refused to commit to further rate cuts and upwardly revised its inflation forecasts. Over the weekend, ECB President Robert Holzman voiced caution on further rate cuts. The head of the Austrian central bank said the bank would be looking to avoid putting itself in a corner and did not want to comment on the future path for rate cuts. And here\u2019s why JP Morgan thinks housebuilders would benefit from a Labour government: Both parties look to focus on increasing the supply of affordable housing. Labour in particular have advocated for the reintroduction of the target to build 300,000 homes a year. They intend to cut red tape to expedite the approval process. for new-builds (including reform to \u201cNot in my backyard\u201d policy). This would be a positive for home builders, especially the ones geared towards the lower end of the housing market. Labour has also undertaken to extend the current mortgage guarantee scheme which helps homebuyers accessmortgages with low deposits. JP Morgan also suggest that an environment of greater political and policy stability after the election could help stabilize the outflows from UK assets. They point out that British shares have lagged global rivals since the Brexit vote, saying: UK equities currently trade at a 38% discount versus MSCI World, much larger than typical historically. On the eve of the Brexit referendum in June 2016 they traded at par with the World. And on the winners and losers of a Labour election victory, they explains: At sector level, we see a Labour win as a positive outcome for Banks, Homebuilders and Food Retail, while Energy and Transportation are likely to trade negatively as a result of Labour\u2019s policies. The Utility sector is likely to benefit from the increased spending in \u201cclean\u201d technologies as Labour works towards achieving its net-zero target; however, Water sector could be at risk of increased regulation. JP Morgan\u2019s research report shows that since 1970 the UK stock market has rallied by 1%, on average, in the month after a Conservative election win, but dipped by 2% in the month after Labour has triumphed. They say: Historically, short term market reaction to a Labour victory in UK elections has been somewhat weaker than for Conservatives. However, we think that this time a Labour win will likely be seen as a positive for the UK markets. The current Labour party has a much more centrist policy agenda. [interestingly, though, UK markets have fallen by 5% on average after six months of a Conservative government, but gained 8% after half a year of a Labour government]. After a couple of hours trading in Europe, here\u2019s a recap of the main moves. The Paris stock market has dropped deeply into the red, after Emmanual Macron stunned France by calling snap parliamentary elections last night. The CAC 40 is down 2% right now, a three-month low, with bank stocks falling over 4%. Macron called the snap poll after his centrist alliance was trounced by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right movement in the European parliamentary vote. Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, market analyst at xs.com, explains why investors are concerned: Macron\u2019s decision to call for early elections adds a new layer of uncertainty in France, a crucial country within the eurozone. If Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party wins a parliamentary majority, Macron\u2019s ability to govern and manage national affairs could be seriously constrained. This prospect is causing significant concern among investors, as prolonged instability in the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy could have considerable repercussions in financial markets. The euro has dropped to its lowest level since August 2022 against the pound, which rose to \u20ac1.1829 this morning. The euro also dropped to a one-month low against the US dollar. Charalampos Pissouros, senior investment analyst at XM, says: Although socialist, liberal and center parties are set to retain a majority in the European Parliament, the surge in Eurosceptic nationalists is likely to make it more difficult for lawmakers to agree and push through reforms and policies that give the Union more power. Combined with the prospect of a far-right victory in France, this could keep the euro pressured for a while longer. European stock markets have been roiled too, with Germany\u2019s DAX down 0.9% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB losing 0.95%. In the bond market, the \u2018spread\u2019 between the borrowing costs of Germany, and of France and Italy, has widened \u2013 a sign that investors are more nervous about the implications of Sunday\u2019s election results. Bill Blain, market strategist at Wind Shift Capital, said today: There is nothing like the prospect of increasing European political instability, rising distrust of the EU and its agencies (including the ECB), and internal dissent to rile bond markets thinking about European Sovereign Bond markets. The concept of a united monetary and fiscal union in Europe moves further away. The UK election is also on the City\u2019s mind, with JP Morgan saying a Labour win would be good for markets\u2026.and a Bloomberg poll finding it would support the pound. Here\u2019s Moody\u2019s Ratings analyst Ruosha Li on the impact of the European elections: \u201cA thinner margin for defections from the centrist coalition could make it harder to get a new commission confirmed and some legislation across the line over the next five years. But parliament is unlikely to impede progress on key priorities like security and competitiveness, including a capital markets union.\u201d The selloff in French government bond selloff is continuing, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on France\u2019s 10-year bonds. Political shock following Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to call snap parliamentary elections has pushed up 10-year French government bond yields to around 3.2%, from 3.115% on Friday night. That\u2019s the highest since last November. Lizzy Galbraith, political economist at abrdn, says: \u201cFollowing poor European parliamentary elections, in which his Renaissance party secured 15.2% of the vote, well behind Marine le Pen\u2019s Rassemblement National (RN) which won 31.5%, French President Macron has announced snap parliamentary elections on 30 June and 7 July. Palriamentary elections will not affect Macron\u2019s position as president, but leave him vulnerable to having to govern with opposition parties in control of parliament, further entrenching the difficulties he has had in passing legislation under his current term. Macron will hope to use any concerns among French voters about the strength of RN to unify opposition votes and strengthen his voter base, but with his personal popularity low, he faces an uphill battle. Unlike the proportional system used in the European parliamentary elections, French parliamentary elections use first past the post, so while RN appears on course for major gains, they may not be as substantial as this weekend\u2019s result suggests.\u201d Analysts at JP Morgan say a Labour win in the UK general election would be a positive development for the financial markets. In an Equity Strategy note published this morning, they explain that Labour is \u201coccupying a centrist platform\u201d, saying: Labour agenda is modestly pro-growth, but crucially with a likely cautious fiscal approach. Our economists believe that, given the lack of fiscal space, Labour will likely focus on supply-side reforms to help improve economic growth. Labour have also sought to reassure businesses by ruling out corporation tax increases. In terms of key policies, Labour\u2019s Green Prosperity Plan will focus on the country\u2019s climate transition, while both parties are focused on affordable housing. Broadly, they favour the domestically focused FTSE 250 share index, of medium-sized companies listed in London, over the blue-chip FTSE 100 which has more of an international focus. JP Morgan predict that the banking sector, housebuilders and food retailers would benefit. They explain: Banks: political and policy stability from a Labour party win would be supportive for the sector, particularly absent any risks around Corporation tax/Banking surcharge, as was the case during the 2019 elections; Homebuilders: housing will likely be core to the upcoming elections, with the focus on affordable housing, unlocking land for development and reforming the planning system; and Food Retail: Labour party support for policies like incentivizing private sector investment and continued focus on cost of living crisis. But, JP Morgan adds that a Labour party win would be less positive for Transportation, as \u201cnationalisation of the railways would weigh on the sector\u201d; Energy, as Labour plan to increase and extend the Energy Profits Levy. The big issue for investors to think about today are the consequences and implications of the far right\u2019s gains across Europe at the EU elections, says Bill Blain, market strategist at Wind Shift Capital. There is nothing like the prospect of increasing European political instability, rising distrust of the EU and its agencies (including the ECB), and internal dissent to rile bond markets thinking about European Sovereign Bond markets. The concept of a united monetary and fiscal union in Europe moves further away. Over three-quarters of UK stocks are in the red this morning. The FTSE 100 share index has dipped by 27 points, or 0.33%, to its lowest level since the end of May. About 78 of the blue-chip companies on the index are lower, led by gambling firm Entain (-2.2%), packaging group DS Smith (-1.9%) and banks NatWest (-1.8%) and Lloyds (-1.8%). AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says: \u201cPolitical turmoil in Europe saw the FTSE 100 start the week on the back foot with only a handful of names on the index trading in positive territory. \u201cAn unexpectedly strong showing for far-right parties in European elections in France prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap parliamentary election to be held within the next 30 days. This injects a big dose of the uncertainty which markets hate \u2013 with the euro dropping sharply in response to the developments. \u201cFinancial stocks were among the worst performers in London as investors digested the news. Also affecting sentiment were Friday\u2019s better-than-expected US jobs numbers which push back against the narrative that rate cuts are imminent. The euro continues to bob around a one-month low this morning, at $1.0763 against the US dollar: French banks are being hit by the political uncertainty created by Emmanuel Macron\u2019s snap election. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale shares have slumped by 5.4%, while BNP Paribas has lost 4.4% and Credit Agricole is down 4.1%. That\u2019s helped to knock the French CAC 40 share index to its lowest since late February this morning. The snap election called in France has added to the \u201cuncertain tides swirling around financial markets, says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, adding: Investors are assessing Macron\u2019s gamble in attempting to reassert his authority after voters shifted en masse to the Far-right during the EU elections, in both France and Germany. The euro has dropped sharply against the dollar, to $1.074, the lowest in a month amid the surprise turn of events. Analysts at Deutsche Bank say Sunday\u2019s EU elections will \u2018shift the direction of travel\u2019 for European policy over the next five years\u201d Here\u2019s their take: The two main take-aways of the election results are (1) the centrist majority in the European parliament is holding as the far-right did not outperform and (2) the biggest impact could be at the national level with Macron calling a legislative election. As implied by opinion polls, centrist parties managed to secure a majority in the European parliament. While the far-right saw gains, fears of a populist shock at the EU level seem to have been premature. This is all the more the case, as right-wing parties are not a coherent bloc. Nevertheless, while the elections did not bring a seismic shock to EU-level politics, they are still likely to shift the direction of travel for policy over the next five years. The biggest impact of the election result could be at a national level with President Macron announcing the dissolution of the French parliament after the defeat of his Renaissance party. Snap elections are called for June 30. Domestic government stability in other major eurozone economies is unlikely to be affected by the elections (despite the electoral defeat of Scholz\u2019s SPD). The gap between Germany\u2019s borrowing costs and other eurozone members is widening this morning, a sign that Sunday\u2019s EU election results have rattled investors. The difference between the yield (or interest rate) on German and French government bonds has widened, after Emmanuel Macron called new parliamentary elections last night. That\u2019s because the price of French government debt has weakened, pushing up the yield on 10-year OATs to 3.18%, an increase of 6 basis points, from 3.12% on Friday night. German bunds, which are a classic safe-haven asset, are little changed; their yield is only up 2 basis points to 2.64%. The spread between Italian and German yields has widened 7 bps to 138 bps. Reuters points out that the gains made by Eurosceptic nationalists in the European Parliamentary elections may complicate EU policymaking and attempts to deepen integration over the next five years. German\u2019s DAX share index has also opened in the red, falling about 0.7%. Ouch. Paris\u2019s stock market has dropped sharply in early trading, after Emmanual Macron stunned France by calling a snap election. The CAC 40 index, of the largest stocks in Paris, has fallen by over 2% to a three-month low. That would be its biggest one-day drop since last November. The euro\u2019s weakness today has sent it to its lowest level against sterling since August 2022. The pound traded as high as \u20ac1.1829 this morning, up half a euro cent, a level last seen shortly before Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget sent sterling reeling: The euro has weakened in recent months as it became clear that interest rates would be cut faster in the eurozone than in other advanced economies. Last week the ECB lowered interest rates for the first time in five years, while the Bank of England is not expected to cut rates until November. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, agrees that a Labour majority would be the most \u201cmarket friendly\u201d outcome for the UK election. Ryan explained: \u201cIndeed, the pound continues to comfortably outperform the euro in the past month, as markets view a Labour majority as perhaps the most market-friendly outcome of the pending general election \u2013 a reflection of both the lingering damage done by Liz Truss\u2019s ill-fated budget, and a shift towards the political centre under Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership. The latest polling continues to give Labour a solid lead: With less than a month to the UK general election, City investors are weighing up the implications of a new government. And a poll conducted by Bloomberg has found that a Labour victory in next month\u2019s UK election would be the best outcome for the pound, while a hung Parliament was seen as the worst result. That\u2019s a verdict that will cheer Labour, as it tries to persuade voters that it is a safe choice on 4 July. As Derek Halpenny, head of research for Europe, Africa and the Middle East at MUFG, put it: \u201cA large stable majority for the Labour Party, which is less divided than the Tories, will signal better stability ahead.\u201d Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has put a lot of effort into reassuring the City they can trust her party, arguing that Labour is the \u201cnatural party of British business\u201d, and ruling out raising income tax, national insurance and VAT. Less encouragingly, about 60% of those polled \u2013 which included portfolio managers, economists and retail investors \u2013 reckon it will take the pound more than five years to return to the $1.50 level it traded at before the EU referendum of 2016. More here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The euro is under pressure today as traders digest last night\u2019s EU election results, and a shock parliamentary election being called in France. Political uncertainty has knocked the single currency to a one-month low; it\u2019s down half a cent this morning to $1.0753. Against the pound, the euro has dropped to a near two-year low. European stock markets are set to open in the red, too. The euro lost ground after France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, announced he will dissolve parliament and call snap legislative elections after his allies suffered a crushing defeat to Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) in Sunday\u2019s European parliament elections. It was also a bad election for German chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose Social Democrats scored their worst result ever while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured second place. Macron took his shock move after his centrist list, headed by MEP Val\u00e9rie Hayer, scored just 15% in the European poll, less than half the 31.5% tally booked by RN, whose lead candidate was the party\u2019s president, Jordan Bardella. Analysts say it\u2019s unprededented in modern French politics for a president to call an early parliamentary election from a position of weakness. Macron, who still has three years of his presidential term to serve, may want to put RN under more scrutiny, and present French voters with a clear choice \u2013 either a pro-European, pro-Ukraine, centrist position, or the far right alternative. Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, explains: Only just over half of French voters turned out on Sunday, compared to 70% in national elections. No party which has \u201cwon\u201d a European election in France has gone on to win the following national. election. All attempts by Macron\u2019s camp to make the campaign a referendum on the Ukraine war or the. survival of the European Union or on the competence and extremist background of Le Pen and her chief allies, fell on deaf ears. The campaign was from the beginning a referendum on Macron\u2019s seven years in power\u2014and turned especially on \u201cfar right\u201d themes such as immigration and violence. Although right-wing parties made significant gains across Europe, Commission president Ursula von der Leyen was able to declare that \u201cthe centre is holding\u201d, with candidates from her centre-right European People\u2019s party securing the most seats. But mainstream parties did lose seats overall, which will complicate von der Leyen\u2019s bid for a a second five-year term at the helm of the EU commission."

            "content": "The UK, US and Canada have accused Russia of a plot to interfere in Moldova\u2019s presidential election and referendum on EU membership later this year. In a pointed joint statement issued on the first day of the G7 summit in Italy, the three governments accused Russian actors of \u201cspreading lies\u201d and \u201cseeking to undermine Moldovan democratic institutions\u201d in a campaign of political interference stretching back years. The three countries said Moscow was attempting to undermine Moldova\u2019s pro-western president, Maia Sandu, before the next presidential election and referendum on EU membership. Both votes are due on 20 October. The former Soviet country, which borders Ukraine, has long feared Russian intervention in its domestic affairs, notably in the Kremlin-allied breakaway republic of Transnistria and the southern autonomous region of Gagauzia. Sandu\u2019s government has been a strong supporter of Ukraine in its war against Moscow. The UK, US and Canadian governments said Russian actors were seeking to \u201cfoment negative public perceptions\u201d of Sandu, western governments and the prospect of Moldovan membership of the EU. Sandu has been president since 2020, when she was elected with 57.7% of the vote in the final runoff. They accused Russia of \u201cactively using disinformation and propaganda online, on the air, and on their streets to further their objectives\u201d of \u201cdegrading public confidence in Moldova\u2019s ability to secure itself and maintain rule of law\u201d. The statement singled out the Russian state broadcaster RT, which it said had been \u201cinvolved in providing direct support\u201d to Ilan Shor, a fugitive pro-Russian businessman who has been sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison in connection with the disappearance of $1bn from Moldovan banks in 2014. The three countries said that if Sandu were re-elected, \u201cthere is reason to believe Moscow will work to incite protests\u201d. They said they were working closely with the Moldovan government and had already sanctioned actors involved, with further sanctions being considered. \u201cWe will continue to support Moldova and the Moldovan people as they manage Kremlin interference and the impacts of Russia\u2019s brutal war against Ukraine,\u201d the statement from the UK, US and Canada said. \u201cWe strongly support Moldova\u2019s democratic, economic, security, and anticorruption reforms and deepening European integration. \u201cBy revealing the Kremlin\u2019s plot, we are making it clear to Moscow that we stand for free and fair elections and will not tolerate its attempts to meddle and undermine democratic processes.

            "date": "2024-06-23T11:36:56Z",
            "content": "A small but very noisy section of the British news media seems to have come close to losing its collective sanity. The election campaign is maybe not quite what the people concerned would have wanted: the Tories are locked into an ever-deepening crisis, now crystallised by a gambling scandal, Labour is capably holding itself together, and the limited fireworks let off by Reform UK do not threaten the election\u2019s seemingly inevitable result. So, for want of any other excitement, they have turned to another source of fun: opinion polls. Has there ever been a campaign so dominated by them? For seven or eight years now, the most powerful polling companies have been developing so-called \u2013 and yes, I had to look this up \u2013 multilevel regression with poststratification (or MRP) surveys, which contact tens of thousands of voters, calculate results based on a range of granular demographic details, and result in findings that can be sifted constituency by constituency. The fact that YouGov used this method to unexpectedly predict 2017\u2019s hung parliament has given it an air of quasi-scientific magic; now, the publication of one such poll after another is greeted in some quarters with a huge level of expectation. The result is postmodern news that a certain kind of 20th-century social theorist would have loved. The Conservatives, the Telegraph screamed last week, are on track to \u201cslump to just 53 seats\u201d. The Labour party, it said, was predicted to win a mind-boggling 516. Here, it seemed, was full-blown Starmergeddon, and the advent of a one-party state. But no one had voted and nothing had actually happened. Nor, by definition, could anyone be certain that the predictions were in any way accurate. \u201c\u2018We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning,\u201d said Jean Baudrillard in his 1981 masterpiece Simulacra and Simulation. In this election, that distinction hardly seems to matter. Clearly, the whole ritual \u2013 new poll shock coming at 5pm! \u2013 suits the dopamine-driven world of social media. And entirely predictably, along with the bog-standard polling that echoes most MRP predictions of a Labour landslide, all this is now feeding into the contest itself. Predictions of a red \u201csupermajority\u201d offer the Tories one last hope of shoring up their vote, which explains why the rightwing papers have gone MRP bonkers. Meanwhile, there are two dangers for Labour. One is centred on people who want a change of government assuming it is written in the stars and so staying at home. The other lies in an election discourse that might view anything other than an imagined megavictory as an anticlimax \u2013 or, even more absurdly, a failure. I have recently read predictions of a Commons majority for Keir Starmer\u2019s party of 256, 162 and 382. Somewhere in these wildly diverging figures, there is probably a sign of what is going to happen in 10 days\u2019 time. But constituency-level predictions cannot possibly predict the results of scores of local contests that look too close to call. The reduction of people\u2019s thoughts and choices to such crude numbers, moreover, says precious little about their view of politics and politicians, how they decide who to back, and their expectations of a winning party. Indeed, in a political world brimming with volatility, ambivalence, cynicism, tactical voting and specific local factors, polling does not even scratch the surface. So, what is actually going on? Predicting election results, in case anyone had forgotten, is not really the job of political journalists. But there are aspects of the current public mood that seem very clear, and they are still overlooked. Over the past three weeks, I have spent time in 10 constituencies, from Surrey to North Staffordshire, via the West Midlands, outer London, and more. The fact that the Tories\u2019 support is in freefall seems self-evident, and partly reflects the fact that younger people are more dismissive of Conservatism than ever before. In the once-Tory town of Woking, in Surrey, I interviewed a women\u2019s football team made up of twentysomethings, whose views reflected what I had heard from plenty of other people and places. \u201cThere needs to be a vision,\u201d one of its players told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through austerity and Brexit, but it\u2019s like, what\u2019s the actual future? What\u2019s the UK going to stand for?\u201d Another said that all that mattered for now was getting rid of the Tories, \u201cbut that shouldn\u2019t be the case. We should have something to believe in.\u201d By contrast, a trainee nurse in Birmingham \u2013 who was queueing at a food bank \u2013 said he would vote Labour because \u201cthings were better when they were in power\u201d. But even that level of certainty was hard to find: after so many crises and turnabouts, this still feels like a country full of unease and doubt, no matter which parties it chooses. There is, it seems to me, a distinct possibility of a very cognitively dissonant big Labour win, which will have extremely complicated consequences. In that context, my mistrust of polling is only partly to do with its accuracy. The Guardian\u2019s election reporting is based on the crucial idea that it should cover \u201cnot just the odds, but the stakes\u201d. And for the moment at least, going out into the electoral fields and talking to voters and candidates remains a staple of journalism, in news outlets of every political stripe. There are caveats to that: particularly in the broadcast media, 10-second vox pops and quick sprints around marginals reduce public opinion to meaninglessness. But you can still view and read plentiful examples of on-the-ground reporting. It is part of how we understand not just how politics works, but each other. The problem is that the deafening din generated by poll after poll threatens to drown that stuff out \u2013 and thereby debase the democratic process. Elections ought to represent potential moments of reckoning, when we all talk about the state of the country and its future, the struggles and travails people go through, and the different visions of the future they have. If the people meant to lead that conversation are hyperventilating about uniform swings, representative samples and which polling company is going to be proved right, those things get lost. There is also an even bigger risk. As the uneasy public mood proves, this is an age of profound political alienation, when nasty populists can too easily accuse the mainstream media and Westminster politicians of being part of a remote elite whose members are all the same. Because it robs politics of meaningful substance, polling hysteria gives that kind of talk the ring of truth. So does the banal framing of the election as a wholly foregone conclusion. Other countries ban polling during election campaigns, which is one way of dealing with the problem \u2013 though that seems a very clunky response to an issue that may have a more stereotypically British solution. We should treat all those polls with deep scepticism; the best thing, in fact, may be to marvel at their arcane machinations, occasionally recognise their prescience, and laugh. The election, just to remind everyone, happens on 4 July. The rest is noise. John Harris is a Guardian columnist Guardian Newsroom: Election results special.

            "date": "2024-06-29T04:00:42Z",
            "content": "An estimated 2 million people are expected to vote in the presidential election in Mauritania in what could be the desert nation\u2019s first civilian-to-civilian transition. After independence from France in 1960, the west African state experienced multiple coups in the following years. The fledging democracy has been somewhat stable since 2019, when Mohamed Ould Ghazouani was elected president. Ghazouani, a 67-year-old former army chief and key figure in the 2008 overthrow of Sidi Abdallahi, the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, is seeking a second and final five-year term in the election on Saturday. The Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) cleared six candidates to contest the election alongside Ghazouani. If no candidate receives an absolute majority on Saturday, a second round will be held in two weeks between the pair with the highest votes. The main challenger is the opposition leader and lawmaker Biram Dah Abeid, who made his name as a racial equality advocate in a country that became the last in the world to officially abolish slavery in 1981. Abeid has blamed the current administration for poor economic conditions in the country, where half of the population are multidimensionally poor, according to the United Nations. \u201cThe Mauritanian regime has always lived on the pillage of wealth, the repression of populations and the use of forgery,\u201d the 59-year-old told journalists recently in Nouakchott, the capital. But the incumbent is widely expected to again defeat Abeid, who was runner-up in 2019. Gilles Yabi, the founder of the Dakar-based West Africa Citizen thinktank, said: \u201cGhazouani will win because of the usual advantages of incumbency and has the typical profile of presidents of Mauritania, being a former general, head of the army and minister of defence. It is extremely difficult to think that there will be a surprise in who wins these elections.\u201d As it goes to the ballot box, the country of 4.7 million people will also be under the international spotlight given its putschist past in a region with six successful coups in less than four years. Two of those happened in Mali, its eastern neighbour, which continues to grapple with a decade-long jihadist violence. That crisis has triggered another: thousands of displaced people continue to flee into Mauritania, triggering conflict between local and settler fishers over shrinking lakes as the impact of climate change deepens in the the Sahel region. To its south-west is Senegal, which has been hailed by the international community as an example to follow, in regard to the conduct of its 24 March election after the chaos caused by the government\u2019s initial delay. More than two dozen observers from 16 African countries will be part of the African Union\u2019s mission to the election. On the list are Senegal, Guinea and Nigeria, which are part of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) that has hit states where coups have happened with a range of sanctions that have led to fissures within the group. Mauritania, which has a standing partnership for economic and security cooperation with Ecowas, was a founding member of the regional bloc in 1975 but exited in 2000 to join the more autocratic Arab Maghreb Union. Still, it is seen as a reliable ally in the Sahel for counterinsurgency operations within west Africa; no attacks have happened on Mauritanian soil since the December 2011 abduction of a soldier by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Ghazouani, who currently holds the one-year rotational presidency of the African Union, is brandishing that stability as part of his leadership credentials, pledging to continue to keep the peace if re-elected. \u201cOur army is fully capable of ensuring your security and safeguarding our national territory,\u201d he said during final rallies this week."

            "content": "The far-right National Rally (RN) has strengthened in final polls, including one suggesting it could be on course for a historic parliamentary majority, as candidates fought for votes on the last day of campaigning before the first-round ballot in France\u2019s most momentous election for decades. Two days before Sunday\u2019s ballot, two polls on Friday showed Marine Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigration, France-first party pulling steadily further ahead in a race it has led since President Emmanuel Macron called the shock ballot almost three weeks ago after the defeat of his centrists in the European parliamentary election. Official campaigning for the first round vote ends at midnight on Friday, with no political activity allowed on Saturday. Campaigning resumes on Monday for a final five days before a decisive second round ballot on 7 July in which the party could take control of France\u2019s government for the first time. One poll, for Les Echos newspaper, showed RN could win 37% of the national vote, two points more than a week ago, while another, for BFM TV, estimated the far-right party was on course for 260-295 seats \u2013 potentially giving it an outright majority. RN, which has pledged to boost spending power, slash immigration and restore law and order, \u201ccannot only envisage a relative majority, but we cannot exclude \u2013 far from it \u2013 an absolute majority\u201d of 289 deputies, Brice Teinturier, the deputy director of a third polling agency, Ipsos, told Agence France-Presse. The New Popular Front (NFP), a broad but fractious leftwing alliance dominated by the Unbowed France (LFI) of the veteran radical left firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, was on 28%, and Macron\u2019s centrist bloc, known as Together, on 20%. Accurate seat forecasts are difficult because the outcome depends on second-round results in France\u2019s 577 constituencies, many of which could be three-way races and affected by tactical alliances and withdrawals aimed at blocking the far right. \u201cOf course I want to avoid the extremes, especially the far right, being able to win,\u201d the prime minister, Gabriel Attal, said on Friday. Macron, who has called both the left and far right extreme, also suggested at an EU summit on Thursday that prospective Together MPs would back moderate left candidates against far-right ones. The president also criticised far-right \u201carrogance\u201d, saying it had \u201calready allocated all the government jobs\u201d and questioned his constitutional role as military commander-in-chief. \u201cWho are they to explain what the constitution should say?\u201d he asked. A hung parliament, with Macron\u2019s forces squeezed between two hostile bigger blocs, would lead to near-certain deadlock, while an RN majority would deliver a fraught cohabitation with a party radically opposed to the president on almost everything. Le Pen hinted at the kind of rows that could arise on Friday, saying it was \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s prerogative, not the president\u2019s\u201d to name France\u2019s next European commissioner \u2013 currently the internal markets commissioner, Thierry Breton. RN\u2019s youthful president, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, has said he will not take up the post of prime minister unless his party, which has toned down some of its anti-EU positions and pledged fiscal responsibility, wins an absolute majority. But the party remains vague about the cost of its promises, which include cutting VAT on all energy and, longer term, abolishing Macron\u2019s pension reform to return the state pension age to between 60 and 62 and exempting all under-30s from income tax. RN also aims to abolish the right of babies born in France to be French, which would almost certainly be declared unconstitutional by France\u2019s constitutional council, and to create a \u201cnational preference\u201d for some welfare payments in breach of EU rules. Analysts say the far-right party has benefited from public anger at Macron, whose pro-business reforms have spurred the economy but who is seen by many voters as having ignored their concerns about the cost of living and worsening public services. His popularity has sunk so low allies suggested he take a backseat in the campaign. In a televised debate on Thursday evening, Bardella sought to reassure voters about RN\u2019s foreign policy, saying he would \u201cnot let Russian imperialism absorb an allied state like Ukraine\u201d, although he was opposed to sending long-range missiles to Kyiv. The RN president dismissed as \u201cutterly false\u201d reports in French media that as many as 100 RN candidates standing in the election had been found to have made \u201cracist, antisemitic and homophobic comments\u201d in the past. Separately on Thursday, France\u2019s media watchdog, Arcom, warned one of the country\u2019s leading radio stations, Europe 1, over a two-hour elections talkshow presented every morning during the campaign by the controversial host Cyril Hanouna. Hanouna, whose evening TV show has been fined a total of \u20ac7.5m (\u00a36.36m) by Arcom for breaching rules on political balance, recently told listeners the leftist NFP alliance sought \u201cthe destruction of the republic, of the country and of our civilisation\u201d. The regulator said Hanouna\u2019s show was systematically favouring RN and treating leftwing parties \u201cin a systematically critical and virulent manner, in terms that were often derogatory and outrageous\u201d, reflecting \u201ca lack of measure and honesty\u201d."

I have spent most of my adult life in constituencies where, in retrospect, voting for the government I wanted would have been best served by voting locally for another party. I do not need help in deciding which issues are important to me or which government is more likely to deliver the outcomes I want, but I do need help in deciding where my vote would best be placed to secure the national outcome I favour. Well-structured polls are a help with this. To give an example, it is clear from an overview of the six MRP polls I have examined that the party I\u2019m inclined to favour has little chance of winning in my constituency. But if I want to rid myself of the worst government in my lifetime, armed with MRP data, the logical thing for me to do is to vote not for my favoured party but for a third party that has a chance of beating the Conservatives in this seat. I shall know on 5 July whether I have made the right choice, but my chance of doing so is much enhanced by the existence of constituency-level polls.

            "date": "2024-06-15T16:02:29Z",
            "content": "Eight Israeli soldiers have been killed in a blast that engulfed their armoured vehicle in southern Gaza, in the biggest loss of life for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in a single incident since January. The deaths came amid continuing fighting around Rafah in which at least 19 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes. According to the IDF, the squad of combat engineers were in a convoy of half a dozen armoured vehicles returning from a mission at about 5am on Saturday morning in the Tal al-Sultan area of the southern Gaza city when their vehicle was destroyed. Earlier, the armed wing of Hamas said fighters had ambushed an armoured personnel carrier, killing and wounding a number of Israeli soldiers, in the area in the west of Rafah, where Israeli forces have been advancing for weeks. According to reports in the Israeli media, the IDF was investigating whether the vehicle exploded after being targeted or following the accidental detonation of explosives which the soldiers had been transporting in their vehicle. The explosives had been stored on the vehicle\u2019s exterior, a tactic reportedly used to avoid harm to the occupants in the event of detonation. The blast occurred after several other vehicles had already passed the same location, and killed all those inside immediately. The latest deaths will probably fuel mounting calls for a ceasefire and heighten Israeli public anger over ultra-Orthodox exemptions from the military. Although IDF fatalities from the Gaza operation and immediate surroundings, which now stand at 307, have been hugely outnumbered by Palestinian deaths \u2013 which have seen more than 37,000 killed, according to Gaza health officials, the majority of them civilians \u2013 the growing toll of death and injuries to Israel\u2019s armed forces has taken greater prominence as the war has dragged on. In January, 21 Israeli troops were killed in a single attack. On Sunday the Israeli cabinet is expected to discuss increasing the age limit for reserve duty for soldiers by a year. It follows the recent decision to raise the cap on the number of reservists who can be called up by 50,000, amid evidence that the IDF is being stretched fighting on two fronts and with no end to the conflict in sight. In May, the parents of more than 900 Israeli soldiers deployed in Gaza signed a letter urging the military to call off its ongoing offensive in Rafah, calling it a \u201cdeadly trap\u201d for their children. \u201cIt is evident to anyone with common sense that after months of warnings and announcements regarding an incursion into Rafah, there are forces on the other side actively preparing to strike our troops,\u201d said the letter, sent on 2 May. \u201cOur sons are physically and mentally exhausted,\u201d adds the letter, addressed to the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and the IDF chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi. \u201cAnd now, you intend to send them into this perilous situation? \u2026 This appears to be nothing short of recklessness.\u201d The increasing combat toll also comes against the background of a heated debate around the issue of who serves in the army. Last month, Israel\u2019s supreme court ordered an end to government subsidies for many ultra-Orthodox men who don\u2019t serve in the army. However, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government \u2013 which relies heavily on ultra-Orthodox parties \u2013 last week voted in favour of a new law extending exemptions for religious men. Although the first vote was only procedural, it caused an uproar by being approved during a war in which hundreds of soldiers have died and many others remain inside Gaza or on the frontlines against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. That prompted a second open letter last week from families of combat soldiers addressed to Gallant and Halevi. In the letter the families said they were asking their \u201cfighting children\u201d to \u201cstop the fighting right now, put down their weapons and return home immediately,\u201d adding: \u201cWe will not sacrifice our children on the altar of public corruption.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-16T10:00:48Z",
            "content": "When Daoud, a veteran queer activist, recently walked past rainbow flags hung for Pride month in the old port city of Jaffa, a historic centre of Palestinian culture, he was overcome by a wave of revulsion. The most famous symbol of LGBTQ+ liberation has been so co-opted by the Israeli state that to a gay Palestinian like him it now serves only as a reminder of the horror unfolding just 60 miles south. Last November, Israel\u2019s government posted two images from Gaza on its social media account. One shows Israeli soldier Yoav Atzmoni, in battle fatigues, in front of buildings reduced to rubble by Israeli airstrikes. He holds a rainbow flag with a hand-scrawled message: \u201cIn the name of love\u201d. In the second he poses beside a tank, grinning as he displays an Israeli flag with rainbow borders. \u201cThe first ever Pride flag raised in Gaza,\u201d the caption for both images reads. At the time, Israeli attacks had killed more than 10,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including more than 4,000 children, according to Gazan health ministry figures. The toll has now risen to over 37,000, and more than a million people are on the brink of famine. \u201cI saw the disgusting use of Pride flags in Gaza,\u201d said Daoud, a Palestinian citizen of Israel whose name has been changed. He asked for anonymity because Palestinians have faced arrest and persecution for expressing solidarity with civilians in Gaza and criticising the war. \u201cNow, in this period when terrible death looms over all of us, I can\u2019t see the Pride flag any other way. It really turned my stomach seeing them; it was revolting,\u201d he added. Daoud\u2019s reaction is shared by many queer people around the world, said Phillip Ayoub, professor of international relations at University College London, who researches the intersection of politics and LGBTQ+ rights. \u201cThat cognitive disconnect of seeing what else is in the image \u2013 rubble that was people\u2019s homes \u2013 then seeing the flag being displayed in a celebratory way. It is a massive violation to people who have fought for their rights under this flag.\u201d Those images from Gaza are part of a long-running international campaign that critics call \u201cpinkwashing\u201dbecause they say it aims to bolster the Israeli state by linking it with queerness, presenting it as an explicit counterpart to a Palestinian identity depicted as exclusively and violently homophobic. It exploits global support for LGBTQ+ rights to further an Israeli ultranationalist political agenda and legitimise the oppression of Palestinians, said Sa\u2019ed Atshan, chair of the department of peace and conflict studies at Swarthmore College and author of Queer Palestine and the Empire of Critique. This messaging was driven not by genuine enthusiasm for LGBTQ+ rights from a government that includes a self-proclaimed \u201cfascist homophobe\u201d as finance minister, he said, but was deployed strategically for political ends. \u201cThe Israeli state has different audiences,\u201d Atshan said. \u201cIf it is addressing LGBTQ-friendly domestic audiences in Israel or globally, then it whips out this pink-washing discourse trying to portray Israel as a gay haven.\u201d For homophobic audiences, including at home and Christian Zionists abroad, \u201cit presents a homophobic discourse about religious conservatism and adherence to \u2018family values\u2019 and revulsion towards queerness\u201d. When Rauda Morcos, a Palestinian citizen of Israel who is a human rights lawyer and award-winning activist, heard that Tel Aviv planned to mark Pride this year, she was stunned. \u201cIs there no sense of humanity to realise that there are people being bombed every day in Gaza by your own country [Israel]? And you\u2019re calling for Pride and equal rights for queer people? Who cares at the moment if you have equal rights [as queers]? I honestly don\u2019t care, because if we don\u2019t have equal rights as humans, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Morcos says she was taken back nearly two decades to 2006. That year there was an Israeli attack on Gaza, and as head of a Palestinian queer activist group she campaigned for a boycott of the WorldPride parade hosted by Jerusalem Open House. \u201cWhat wrong timing, what bad timing. Not only then but now,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s always the wrong time and it\u2019s always the wrong topic, because \u2018there is no pride in occupation\u2019, whether it is 2006 or now.\u201d The scale of death and destruction in Gaza has made the struggle for queer rights less urgent for many LGBTQ+ Palestinians. \u201cFor me now, the Palestinian flag should be raised, not the Pride flag,\u201d Daoud said. Israel\u2019s track record on LGBTQ+ rights includes barring discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, recognising foreign same-sex marriage (although it has not been legalised there) and allowing same-sex couples to adopt. Israel ranks better than most neighbours on the Equaldex LGBT Equality index, in 50th place globally. Palestine is ranked 146th, with consensual same-sex sexual acts legal in the West Bank but not in Gaza. But the idea that Israel serves as a regional haven for the queer community feels particularly cruel and hypocritical, activists and academics said, at a time when the LGBTQ+ population of Gaza has no more refuge from Israeli bombs than any other Palestinians. \u201cThere is no \u2018pink door\u2019 in the wall for queer Palestinians to leave Gaza and make a life in Israel,\u201d said Ayoub from UCL. \u201cThe Israeli rhetoric just makes it even harder for LGBTQ Palestinians, because it reinforces the idea that queerness exists nowhere else \u2026 It erases the fact that there are Palestinian activists, queer Palestinians.\u201d Even for the Jewish majority in the LGBTQ+ community, Israel\u2019s track record on equal rights is outpaced by its official propaganda. \u201cPalestine is a patriarchal society, and homophobic, but so is Israel. There are more queer rights in Israel than other Middle Eastern countries, but they\u2019re still limited and it\u2019s not a major success story,\u201d Ayoub said. There is a long, well-documented record of the Israeli security services exploiting the sexuality of LGBTQ+ Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, with devastating and sometimes fatal results. \u201cDuring my training course in preparation for my service in this assigned role, we actually learned to memorise and filter different words for \u2018gay\u2019 in Arabic,\u201d a member of Israel\u2019s intelligence corps testified a decade ago. \u201cIf you\u2019re homosexual and know someone who knows a wanted person, and we need to know about it, Israel will make your life miserable.\u201d Last year, a Palestinian from Nablus was publicly executed. He had confessed collaboration with Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet, saying they used a video of him having sex with another man to blackmail him into informing. LGBTQ+ Palestinians suffer widespread discrimination and abuse both in public and in family settings in occupied territories, human rights groups say. But those who smuggle themselves across the separation wall into Israel from the occupied territories in search of a more queer-friendly environment often find instead racist hostility, bureaucratic red tape and a state of long-term vulnerability. Queer Palestinians seeking asylum in Israel are regularly barred from healthcare and denied residence permits. They struggle to access shelter and therefore face abuse and exploitation, a \u201clife of hell\u201d documented in a +972 Magazine report. Long before the current war, Daoud realisedhe had little in common with most queer Israeli Jews. He recalls bringing transgender Palestinians from the occupied West Bank to the beach. Most had spent their lives barely an hour\u2019s drive away from the Mediterranean but were barred from travelling to its shores by Israeli restrictions. Some, seeing the sea for the first time, were in tears. \u201cI thought: \u2018What do I have in common with gays whose entire struggle is to be able to have their partners from Germany or Spain come to live with them here when I am not even allowed to bring my relative for a visit [from the occupied territories]?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the same universe.\u201d The war in Gaza has only sharpened for him an understanding that even if queer Palestinians did not face such radically different problems, there is little room for a joint struggle with Israeli Jews because most value their privilege in a Jewish state over their \u201cshared\u201d queerness. Many Jewish counterparts in Israel have anchored their claim for equality in their willingness to serve the state and die in its military campaigns, largely directed against Palestinians, he added. In effect they are saying: \u201cWe\u2019re willing to partake in the oppression of Palestinians so [the state] won\u2019t oppress us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got their rights on the backs of Palestinians.\u201d Yahli, a transgender Jewish woman who, on the day of Tel Aviv Pride, joined an anti-war demonstration under the rallying cry \u201cNo blood-washing in our name\u201d, shares this critique of Israel\u2019s mainstream LGBTQ+ community. \u201cMany people in the queer community are drawn to the idea of gaining acceptance by being nationally useful and submissive to the state,\u201d Yahli said. \u201cNot because we are human beings but because we are of service.\u201d That vision of queer national identity was prominent at Tel Aviv\u2019s Pride this month. The usual parade was cancelled for a muted seafront concert that included calls for the release of hostages and celebration of queer Israelis serving in the military, but there was no mention of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza. Stories shared at the event included a transgender woman\u2019s decision not to change her official gender identity so she could still serve in the reserves and fight in Gaza. Morcos is baffled by Israelis who describe their country as a democratic haven for the LGBTQ+ community in a hostile region, particularly when real tolerance rarely extends beyond the limits of Tel Aviv, saying: \u201cHow can you boast of your democracy for queers that then oppresses millions of Palestinians?\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-21T16:25:52Z",
            "content": "In an era of pop full of openly hostile beefs or barely-subliminal sniping that can go on for years between warring parties, this week has brought something rare and significant: an armistice. On her club-facing, radically vulnerable new album Brat, Charli XCX shares her insecurities, nihilistic feelings, arrogance and humanity. In particular, the song Girl, So Confusing addressed her differences with a fellow pop star: \u201cPeople say we\u2019re alike / They say we\u2019ve got the same hair,\u201d Charli sings over a scuzzy bone-shaking bass. \u201cCan\u2019t tell if you wanna see me / Falling over and failing.\u201d On one level it felt similar to the feuds that have recently dominated popular music, such as those between Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter, or Kendrick Lamar and Drake \u2013 it was gossipy, with Charli refusing to confirm who it was about in a podcast interview, fuelling speculation all the more. But it also felt different: instead of lashing out and painting her subject as a villain, Charli was being transparent about her feelings of competition and rivalry. Now there\u2019s an unexpected twist that deepens the drama into something genuinely artful. The \u201chair\u201d line and others had internet sleuths assuming it was about Lorde, and now Charli has released a remix confirming that as fact, featuring the very object of Charli\u2019s anxieties. On what is titled The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde, the two singers trade verses with heart-wrenching candour, Lorde delivering a lengthy verse in which she shares her surprise at Charli\u2019s feelings and provides her own fragile admissions. \u201cI\u2019ve been at war with my body / I tried to starve myself thinner,\u201d she sings, before adding: \u201cI was trapped in the hatred / And your life seemed so awesome.\u201d This open dialogue feels so different to previous battles, such as the notorious one between Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Comparisons were inevitable between the two former Disney stars, both beautiful, blond and with bared midriffs \u2013 writing in this paper in 1999, Ed Vulliamy noted that \u201cChristina has a \u2018naughtier\u2019 image than Britney\u2019s corn-fed, midwest, wholesome look\u201d. The tabloids crafted elaborate stories about an alleged feud, with Spears and Aguilera fanning the flames: after their infamous kisses with Madonna at the 2003 VMAs, Spears complained that Aguilera was rude and fake, while Aguilera told Us Weekly in 2004 that Spears acts like trailer trash. Pop fans were either Team Spears or Team Aguilera and, like a spectator sport, fans compared their chart stats, performances, vocal ability, dance routines, fashion choices and career moves. This game of pop music Top Trumps became part of the fun. Of course, Aguilera and Spears weren\u2019t the first or last \u2013 think of Janet Jackson v Madonna (\u201cWe both make dance music,\u201d Jackson once said, \u201cbut what I do has class\u201d), Mariah Carey v Jennifer Lopez (Carey\u2019s dismissive \u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d is now the stuff of legend), Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj (\u201cMiley, what\u2019s good?\u201d) and Taylor Swift\u2019s feud with Katy Perry. Such celebrity gossip still fuels much of popular culture, and artists know it, too. Carey\u2019s off-the-cuff comment about Lopez has now become something she leans into with camp abandon; Swift weaves in her sometimes-fractious relationships with her contemporaries into her songs and videos (like the recent thanK you aIMee, aimed at old foe Kim Kardashian). Fans then chew over these titbits and spit them out over social media, turning them into memes or fodder for disputes. The same goes for resolutions: when Swift invited Perry to appear in the music video for You Need to Calm Down, squashing their years-long dispute, it felt like just another performance in a story shaped by two of the world\u2019s biggest pop stars. But for all the fun of the gladiatorial sparring between stars for supremacy, there\u2019s also something diminishing about it, even ugly at times. And in a pop landscape where the industry has historically not allowed much room for a broad range of female stars, the sniping has felt like the result of that narrowing, as stars jostle for position. Couple that with the other pressures put on these women \u2013 such as the weight loss Lorde describes \u2013 and these feuds feel like an inevitable part of a world that women have to put on armour to face. \u201cIt\u2019s you and me on the coin / The industry loves to spend\u201d, runs a trenchant line on the Charli-Lorde remix. The reason why their reconciliation feels so powerful is that rarely do these rivalries transcend the tabloids and become folded into the art like this. Listening to their unfiltered confessions, delivered without pop\u2019s numbing penchant for therapy-speak or performative brand management, is like trespassing on something very real and private, as if you\u2019ve stumbled upon two friends brutally but beautifully hashing out their differences. And crucially, by making it into a song they have written and sung, they wield so much agency \u2013 it can\u2019t be as easily weaponised and deliberately misinterpreted by the media as older feuds have been. They still know it\u2019s great gossip \u2013 \u201cAnd when we put this to bed / the internet will go crazy\u201d runs one line \u2013 but it also contains so much emotional truth. With horribly real conflict dominating the news, this conflict resolution, however small, is gracious and moving. For years Charli XCX has been, musically speaking, the vanguard for pop. Now, it feels as if she\u2019s creating a new model of how to be a pop star, too."

            "date": "2024-06-07T06:19:18Z",
            "content": "Twenty-two British D-day veterans, the youngest nearly 100, crossed the Channel on Tuesday to mark this week\u2019s 80th anniversary of the landings in Normandy, representing a thinning thread to the heroics of two or three generations ago when about 150,000 allied soldiers began a seaborne invasion of western Europe that helped end the second world war. Ron Hayward, a tank trooper who lost his legs fighting in France three weeks after D-day, told crowds assembled in Portsmouth on Wednesday why he and other soldiers were there: \u201cI represent the men and women who put their lives on hold to go and fight for democracy and this country. I am here to honour their memory and their legacy, and to ensure that their story is never forgotten.\u201d There will not be many more opportunities to commemorate with survivors, while this time the presence of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in France on 6 June will be a reminder that a part of Europe is in the grip of the largest war since 1945. A deadly war also rages in Gaza, while the living memory of the second world war fades into historical record. That D-day was a risky task is an understatement: 4,441 British, American, Canadian and other allied soldiers are estimated to have been killed on 6 June 1944, and at least a similar number of Germans. One BBC documentary, D-day: the Unheard Tapes, relying on recordings of veterans\u2019 experiences, demonstrates how terrifying the experience was \u2013 and how nobody ought to go through it again. \u201cI just cried my eyes out. I just stood there and cried, I did,\u201d James Kelly, a Royal Marines commando from Liverpool, recalled of finding himself isolated, alone in the French countryside, a few hours after he had managed to fight his way off Sword beach. A buddy had been killed in front of him as they had got to the sand, blood pumping out of his neck, but Kelly had been ordered to press on. While leaders present at Thursday\u2019s commemorations in Normandy \u2013 King Charles, Rishi Sunak, Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz \u2013 will strike appropriate notes, many of those representing forces of division will not be present, not least Vladimir Putin, the architect of the invasion on Ukraine. On Friday, Biden is due to speak at Pointe du Hoc, where 80 years ago 225 US Rangers scaled 35-metre sheer cliffs using rope ladders shot over the top to capture a strategically situated artillery bunker. It was perhaps the most dangerous single mission on D-day, and casualties were severe. Only 90 were still able to fight when a count was taken a couple of days later. There is almost certainly another reason for the location of Biden\u2019s address, given the US president has an election to fight. Forty years ago a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, spoke on the cliffs at the same battle site, and in front of an audience of military veterans he justified the struggle of the day in terms not obviously recognisable in Donald Trump\u2019s Republican worldview. \u201cWe in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars: it is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost,\u201d Reagan declared \u2013 very different to Trump\u2019s comments that he would refuse to defend Nato members who do not spend enough on defence, never mind previous threats to quit the alliance altogether. Two years of headline news about Ukraine \u2013 but also the conflict in Gaza, so deadly for civilians, and elsewhere in the Middle East \u2013 is a reminder that there are those who appear to prefer conflict to stability. Quietly, many people are a little anxious: one recent poll, from YouGov, reports that 55% of Britons believe it is somewhat or very likely that the UK will be involved in a war in the next five years. Since the end of the cold war at least, and perhaps since 1945, it has been easier to take stability and security in Europe for granted, helped partly by the military pact of Nato and the economic alliance of the EU, but also by the grim memory of all-out conflict. But a rise of nationalist, country-first rhetoric suggests there is also a growing carelessness. If it metastasises, as the stories of D-day survivors demonstrate, ordinary people end up bearing the brunt."

            "date": "2024-06-05T10:00:21Z",
            "content": "Three allies of Donald Trump were charged in Wisconsin Tuesday for their roles in advancing the fake electors plan, but the 10 fake electors themselves have not yet been criminally charged. That might be because the Wisconsin fake electors, like other fake electors across the US, have said in media interviews they were misled to believe their documents could only be used if court challenges went for the former president. Others have said they were following lawyers\u2019 advice when they signed on. Wisconsin attorney general Josh Kaul\u2019s office has said it is still investigating and hasn\u2019t ruled out charges against the individual electors, who have faced a civil suit they settled by agreeing not to serve as electors for Trump again. In April, 18 people were charged in Arizona in that state\u2019s inquiry into the fake elector scheme. Defense attorneys representing some of those charged in Arizona have used similar justifications, saying they were following lawyers\u2019 advice when they signed on. One told the Arizona Republic that his client, Jim Lamon, was relying on \u201clawyers from back east\u201d who said the slates would only be used if the state\u2019s results changed. Another told the paper that there wouldn\u2019t be any evidence of their client\u2019s intent to commit fraud or forgery because they got legal advice from Trump\u2019s lawyers that led them to believe they weren\u2019t doing anything wrong. These claims pop up frequently by fake electors and those involved in the scheme to overthrow the 2020 election results, as do other defenses relying on historical precedent and changing election law. Defenders of the fake electors cite a 1960 election in Hawaii and changes to congressional procedure to count electoral votes among their justifications.. Some of the defenses have shown up in legal motions in Georgia, which is further along in its case against some fake electors there. But the justifications are largely happening online as the cases move more slowly than the internet, with rightwing influencers saying the scheme had a historical precedent and wasn\u2019t illegal. Edward Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University, has started to see the false electors in two tiers: those who were clearly in \u201ccahoots with Trump\u201d and intended to subvert the election\u2019s outcome, and others who were duped. Andy Craig, director of election policy at the Joseph H Rainey Center, has come around to this idea as well, saying it depends heavily on the facts in each fake elector\u2019s case, but some of them did seem misled. \u201cI do think, to my mind, it\u2019s fair to say that some of these fake electors are the victims of Trump\u2019s fraud and [Rudy] Giuliani\u2019s fraud,\u201d Foley said. \u201cThey were relatively low-level political operatives who were trying to do something for the team and were doing it because the leader of their team was asking them to. That doesn\u2019t justify what they did, but I\u2019m not sure I would think criminal punishment would be appropriate for them because again, I think they\u2019re the victims of the crime, not the perpetrators.\u201d In Georgia, prosecutors granted many of the fake electors, nearly all of them little-known party loyalists, immunity from prosecution. Only three of the 16 have been charged criminally, all of whom appear to have a more hands-on role in the scheme. And in Pennsylvania and New Mexico, for example, the fake electoral certificates contained a caveat that they would only be considered valid if courts eventually ruled in Trump\u2019s favor and deemed him the legitimate winner. Fake electors in those states have not faced prosecution in large part because of that language. As a reminder, the US doesn\u2019t elect presidents via a popular vote. Instead, voters in each state turn out at the polls, which dictates a slate of electoral votes that get sent to Congress, called the electoral college. Whichever candidate wins the electoral vote wins the presidency, and this is sometimes different from who wins the popular vote. At issue in the fake electors scheme is that Trump supporters signed falsely that Trump had won their states\u2019 votes, when in reality Biden had won. Other defenses Legal experts say the fake electors\u2019 other defenses hold less water \u2013 the 2020 scheme is much different than the 1960 Hawaii election, and any changes in the Electoral Count Reform Act don\u2019t affect the illegality of what the false electors did. The 1960 Hawaii election, which involved two slates of electors, is a long-running justification on the right for the fake electors. In 1960, Nixon narrowly led Kennedy initially in Hawaii, though the margin was so small it kicked off a recount. Before the recount could be completed, the state had to send its electoral votes to Congress for counting, so electors for both Kennedy and Nixon signed separate documents saying they were the state\u2019s electors and sent them off. After the recount, the results showed Kennedy actually won the state, and so Kennedy\u2019s electors met again to sign that he won. Nixon, who was presiding over the electoral count in Congress as vice-president, accepted this final submission. No one got in trouble for the previous slates, though it was also possibly illegal for the Democrats to have met and signed as though Kennedy won before the recount concluded. Hawaii\u2019s votes didn\u2019t affect who won the presidency, as Kennedy had already clinched the win. \u201cHawaii is a very odd situation because it ultimately ended with then vice-president Nixon, who was one of the candidates, being willing to accept the Kennedy slate, which didn\u2019t matter one way or the other, wasn\u2019t going to affect the outcome of the electoral college majority\u201d Foley said. \u201cIt was sort of like a politician trying to be magnanimous.\u201d Influencers like Charlie Kirk, the leader of rightwing youth organization Turning Point USA, brought up Hawaii after the Arizona charges. In a post on X, Kirk cited the \u201cprecedent created by Democrats\u201d in Hawaii in 1960. \u201cThe Arizona Trump electors were doing what they thought was a legally necessary step as part of a wider political and electoral dispute,\u201d Kirk wrote. \u201cThey acted in the belief that Donald Trump was the true winner of Arizona in the 2020 election.\u201d The major difference: there was a legitimate, ongoing, good faith debate over who won in Hawaii, and a razor-thin margin of less than 200 votes that led to a full recount. By contrast, the margins in the seven states involved in the 2020 plan were much higher, and legal avenues to overturn results had largely run out. \u201cAll of these states were won by bigger margins, far beyond what any kind of recount or litigation was ever realistically going to overturn,\u201d Craig said. \u201cAnd so there was no good basis to believe that the results would legitimately flip in these states.\u201d Another line of defense, used less frequently, revolves around changes to the electoral count process after the fake electors scheme in 2020. Rightwing commentator Mike Cernovich said after the Arizona changes that \u201cmultiple electors were LEGAL until the law was recently amended\u201d, presumably a reference to the changes to the Electoral Count Act. The original Electoral Count Act stemmed from the contentious mess of the 1876 election, where there were multiple competing slates of electors and no consensus over who had won the election. It spelled out the process and deadlines for how states would send electoral votes and how Congress would count them. \u201cWhat the Electoral Count Act did and still continues to do is to furnish Congress with a procedure to evaluate competing claims by competing slates of electors,\u201d said Jim Gardner, an election law expert at the University at Buffalo School of Law. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all it does. So it is a piece of congressional self-regulation. It does not in any way regulate the behavior of other parties outside Congress.\u201d The 2022 reform act makes clear that the vice-president, when presiding over the count, can\u2019t use their role to get involved in disputes over electors \u2013 stemming from the effort to pressure then vice-president Mike Pence to throw out the Biden electors in key states. It also says that governors must certify the electors and send them to Congress. None of the Trump fake electors were certified by their states\u2019 governments, a required part of the process for Congress to accept a slate. These changes, though, aren\u2019t evidence that fake electors were allowed under the act before it was amended, legal experts say. Additionally, the charges these electors face in some states are violations of state-level laws against forging documents or committing fraud \u2013 not violations of a federal law to count electoral votes. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s correct to say that somehow it\u2019s an acknowledgement that any fake submission before this was not criminal,\u201d Foley said.

            "date": "2024-06-19T06:00:28Z",
            "content": "Apple\u2019s latest Beats-branded earbuds offer the sound, fit and Android-loving features of its popular Studio Buds but in a smaller, much cheaper and longer-lasting package. The Solo Buds follow in the footsteps of last year\u2019s Buds+, offering full integration with Apple\u2019s various devices and Google\u2019s Android, making the best of both platforms. But Beats has cut a few features here and there to reduce the price to \u00a380 (\u20ac90/$80/A$130), which is half the cost of the brand\u2019s other true wireless buds. They look remarkably similar to the Studio Buds and Buds+, keeping the compact pill shape but with a little refinement in the shape that touches fewer parts of my ear for even greater comfort. They feel light and fit very well, with a range of four sizes of earbud tips included. A hidden button just above the \u201cb\u201d logo handles playback controls and access to your phone\u2019s voice assistant, or adjusts volume. They do not pause the music when you take them out of your ears, as happens with AirPods, however. Unlike most earbuds, the Solo Buds do not have a battery in their case from which they charge when not in use. Instead, each earbud contains a beefy battery that lasts for a good 18 hours of playback between charges. The case still recharges the earbuds when connected to a USB-C cable, but without an onboard battery it is 40% smaller and 55% lighter \u2013 making it much more pocketable. The earbuds play a chime when charging or put into pairing mode in lieu of an indicator light on the case. Specifications Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, SBC, AAC Battery life: 18 hours Water resistance: none Drivers: 8.2mm Earbud weight: 5.7g each Earbud dimensions: 16.7 x 18.5 x 18.9mm Case weight: 22g Case dimensions: 34.7 x 66.1 x 23.7mm Charging: USB-C Great for Android or iPhone As with the recent Studio Buds+ and Solo 4, the big advantage of Beats is their extensive cross-compatibility with Android and iOS. They have greater integration with an iPhone than their competitors, access to controls through quick settings, and instant pairing that only needs to be done once to use them across your iPhones, iPads, Macs and other Apple products. You also get the option of audio sharing to use two sets of headphones with one device. For Android or Google devices, they support many of the same features, including instant pairing, syncing and switching between Google devices, plus spatial audio with compatible Pixel devices. The Beats Android app offers controls, battery widgets, settings and other features. The earbuds also integrate into Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s Find My systems, so you can locate them if you misplace them, regardless of platform. Good sound but no noise cancelling One of the big things that has been cut to reach a cheaper price is noise cancelling, so the Solo Buds rely entirely on the silicone earbud tip to block out the outside world. With music playing, they do a reasonable job, but they cannot cut out the rumble of the commute quite like the Buds+. They do, however, have the same drivers as Beats\u2019 more expensive earbuds and therefore sound very good for the money. They produce a great, easy-listening sound with decent bass that is balanced well with the treble and high notes. The buds sound good across a range of genres and never sound shrill or tinny. They have solid separation of tones but lack a bit of detail here and there, so won\u2019t trouble the very best in the business. No equaliser or other adjustments are available, and they also lack the spatial audio tech from the company\u2019s higher-priced buds, which makes movies and TV shows less immersive watched on Apple devices. The Solo Buds are compatible with Google\u2019s spatial audio system on Pixel devices, however. Call quality was very good in quiet or noisy street environments, successfully blocking background noise from getting on to the call, although my voice sounded slightly compressed. Sustainability Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries, but they should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of their original capacity. Apple will offer an out-of-warranty \u201cbattery service\u201d, but does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The Beats Solo Buds cost \u00a379.99 (\u20ac89.95/$79.99/A$129.95). For comparison, the Beats Studio Buds cost \u00a3160 and Studio Buds+ cost \u00a3180, the Apple AirPods 3 cost \u00a3169, the Fairphone Fairbuds cost \u00a3129, and the Nothing Ear (a) cost \u00a389. Verdict The Solo Buds are a set of great budget earbuds that tread the line between Android and Apple platforms better than competitors. They get far more than just the basics right for only \u00a380, with good sound, very long battery life, a tiny case and a very comfortable fit. Full integration into an iPhone is only something an Apple-made product can manage, and they offer very similar on Android using the Beats app. There are a few things missing compared to the brand\u2019s more expensive buds and some competitors, with a lack of noise cancelling being the biggest, which may be a deal-breaker for some. They also have no hands-free Siri support and no water resistance rating or Apple spatial audio. But these are things you might be able to overlook for the price. The battery is not replaceable and the earbuds are not repairable, ultimately making them disposable and losing them a star. Pros: good sound, cross-platform compatibility with enhanced features for iPhone and Android, great battery life, tiny case, small and comfortable for extended periods, solid button controls, lower cost. Cons: no noise cancelling, no Apple spatial audio, do not pause music on removal, not repairable."

            "date": "2024-06-18T06:36:25Z",
            "content": "The New South Wales government has unveiled a bold plan to ease costs for GP clinics in order to nudge doctors into bulk billing more patients, as part of a suite of budget measures it hopes will deliver cost-of-living relief to citizens. However, in announcing a $3.6bn deficit, the Minns government\u2019s budget of \u201cmust-haves not nice-to-haves\u201d leaves a raft of key societal issues without new funding or a clear path to improvement. Here\u2019s Guardian Australia\u2019s breakdown of who wins and who loses from the 2024-25 NSW budget. Winners Bulk-billing GPs One of the budget\u2019s flagship policies is to spend $189m over four years on healthcare to reduce the cost of running a GP clinic in an effort to allow them to bulk bill more patients, delivered through changes to how payroll tax works. In Tuesday\u2019s budget, the NSW government announced it will waive all historical payroll tax liabilities for GP clinics, at a cost of $104m. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Additionally, the government will provide an ongoing payroll tax rebate for wages paid to contracted doctors to clinics in Sydney who bulk bill more than 80% of patients, providing an incentive to clinics offer bulk billing to more people. The threshold will be lower for clinics in the rest of NSW, at 70%. Of course, actual bulk-billing rebates for patients are determined and paid by the federal government, but this NSW policy has been welcomed by medical groups including the Australian Medical Association, who have said it will help struggling practices stay open. Housing for vulnerable people, low income earners and key workers The Minns government has announced a large spending agenda to boost social housing stock, improve the quality of existing homes for the state\u2019s vulnerable, and help the private sector ramp up building and push local councils into achieve housing targets. In terms of public housing, the government has announced $5.1bn to build 8,400 new homes, which will be owned by the state body Homes NSW. At least half of the homes will be prioritised for victims of family violence. The state will also spend $1bn to repair 33,500 existing homes across the state\u2019s public and social housing mix. About $200m of this $1bn spend will be for stock managed by the Aboriginal Housing Office. Housing for essential workers will also be boosted, with $650m allocated for build-to-rent programs and rural and regional accommodation for key workers. The new initiatives come on top of announcements to audit publicly owned under-utilised land to identify additional plots, including in already built-up suburbs, that can be devoted to building 21,000 new homes. Spending to make the planning approvals process more efficient, as well as the controversial transport oriented development policy to increase zoning for higher density around rail stations, have also previously been announced, as the state\u2019s completion rate of home building reaches near-record lows. Coal powered energy producers The budget has revealed the cost of a policy designed to respond to the energy price rise resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine that capped the price of black coal at $125 a tonne, while allowing producers to sell for whatever price they could on the market. In the 18 months to the end of June, this has cost the NSW and federal governments $884m. In the 2023-24 financial year alone, this cost the two governments $588m. Origin Energy, which had limited long-term coal contracts compared with some rivals, stands to be a major beneficiary of the policy, on top of the already announced news that the life of its Eraring coal fired power plant would be extended and underwritten by the state. Hospitals In addition to the relief the GP bulk billing policy is designed to deliver \u2013 NSW Health estimates that a 1% decrease in bulk billing equates to about 3,000 additional emergency room presentations \u2013 the government has announced $481m in spending to help hospital emergency departments under pressure, including through more staff. Frontline public sector staff If you\u2019re lucky enough to survive a cut to public sector staff headcount as well as a reduction to consultant and contractor use, the government is set to increase wages for more than 400,000 public sector workers by an average of 10.5% over the next three years. Losers Average income renters Given advertised rents rising more than 24% in the last two years \u2013 a challenge prominently identified in the budget papers \u2013 there\u2019s little in this budget for the average income renter who doesn\u2019t qualify for rent-assistance schemes and whose prospects of home ownership are distant. All of the government\u2019s housing policies are either targeted to society\u2019s most vulnerable, or will deliver homes to the market\u2019s housing stock that are years away. The NSW government is yet to follow through on its election commitment to ban no-fault evictions in the state, an issue long identified by tenants\u2019 advocates as adding to a power dynamic that unfairly advantages landlords in a market where rental vacancies are at historical lows of about 1%. Highly paid public sector employees To deliver the abovementioned pay rises for frontline workers employed by the state, the government will seek to limit wage rises for top-level managers and those on the most exorbitant salaries. Land owners of multiple properties Changes to land tax indexation and settings will see owners ultimately pay more tax for second and multiple properties in the long run. Foreigners who own investment properties Also losing out from this budget are those who pay the foreign owner land tax surcharge, which will increase from 4% to 5% from the 2025 land tax year onwards. The foreign purchaser duty surcharge will also increase from 8% to 9% from 1 January 2025. These measures will milk out an extra $187.5m from foreign property investors over the next four years. The environment Despite labelling sustainability as a key measure in its wellbeing index to measure progress, there are scant announcements in this budget that address long-running environmental concerns in the state. The $2.4bn spend on environment and heritage initiatives is the same as the previous year, representing a slight cut when considering inflation. Within the environment spend there are some new measures, including $43m allocated for waste and recycling projects as the state runs out of landfill by the next decade, along with $75m for national park maintenance and various other grants. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 June 2024. A previous version incorrectly reported the total cost of the coal price cap as $884m, with the federal government matching the contribution. The NSW government later clarified that sum covered both state and federal costs."

            "date": "2024-06-11T04:38:46Z",
            "content": "The Queensland government\u2019s pre-election budget is aimed squarely at the hip pocket. This year\u2019s budget is built around a series of cost-of-living handouts for the \u201cordinary\u201d Queenslander, including cheaper public transport and power. Here is a breakdown of the winners and losers in Queensland\u2019s 2024 state budget. Winners Households, commuters and first home buyers The premier, Steven Miles, and the treasurer, Cameron Dick, will hand $11.2bn in concessions to Queenslanders in this year\u2019s budget. This is 31% greater than last year. That includes a series of headline-grabbing plans, such as a six-month \u201ctrial\u201d of 50c public transport fares, across the state\u2019s system. It also means 20% discounts for car registration \u2013 and $1,000 back on power bills, and a freeze on all other fees and charges. But much of the sugar hit expires early next year \u2013 just after election day. On budget day, both Dick and Miles denied the spend had anything at all to do with this year\u2019s election. The government is also increasing the threshold for first home buyer stamp duty concessions by $200,000 to properties valued under $700,000. Police and prisons Amid concern about crime in Queensland, the government is spending more than $1.2bn on community safety initiatives. Some of the money will go toward initiatives to prevent young people from offending or reoffending. Most of that money goes to police and prisons. Money has been allocated to build a new youth remand centre at Wacol and a new youth detention centre at Woodford. There is more than $480m over four years to fund 900 new police officers, money for new police helicopters, and support for victims of crime. The environment The government is investing $26b in a brand new green power system for the state. It includes billions for new power lines \u2013 including $1.06bn for CopperString 2032, which will connect Mt Isa to the grid \u2013 and state-owned projects such as a 2.3GW portfolio of renewable energy in central Queensland. It also includes $7bn towards state-owned pumped hydro, including $6bn for the Borumba scheme over the construction period and $1bn for the Pioneer-Burdekin scheme. The budget doesn\u2019t include a final cost estimate for the enormous Pioneer-Burdekin hydro project in north Queensland, billed as the world\u2019s biggest battery. It is still estimated to cost just $12bn, substantially less than the smaller Borumba project, which will cost more than $14bn. Builders The government is expected to spend $107.3bn on infrastructure over the next four years. Its gigantic \u201cBig Build\u201d capital plan includes transport infrastructure such as Cross River Rail, housing supply, new health facilities and venues for the Olympics. Either way, it means plenty of work for tradies. The annual capital program is expected to peak in 2025\u201326 at $29.4bn before spending declines 19% the following year. Losers Public servants The state government is looking to claw back $3bn from public servants over four years to 2027-28. Though the treasurer has vowed \u201cnot one public servant will lose their job\u201d, they may lose perks including business travel and external consultants \u2013 or be forced to work from home. \u201cI think we need to look afresh at all sorts of working arrangements for public servants \u2026 but it also might be not working in the Brisbane CBD,\u201d Dick said on Tuesday. The government will also not contract for new advertising after August, other than for public safety or job ads. Budget bottom line Queensland\u2019s state government was once flush with coal revenue \u2013 even as others went deep into the red during the pandemic. In 2023-23, the state ran a $13.9bn surplus. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But with minerals prices declining \u201csharply\u201d in recent weeks, government revenue is anticipated to shrink over the next 12 months, and level out the year after that. Debt is expected to hit a peak of $103.2bn in 2026\u201327, which is $6.5bn higher than in the 2023\u201324 budget update. Dick said the state will still be in a much better position than peers Victoria and New South Wales, with 57% net debt in Queensland compared to 97% and 171%. Potential migrants More than 134,700 people have moved to Queensland in the last four years, and the state is feeling growing pains. The treasurer said forecasters were taken entirely by surprise by the \u201cunanticipated\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d explosion, comparing the growth to adding a second city the size of Mackay. Much of the increase came from overseas, particularly in 2023. But a reduction in the migration intake at the commonwealth level \u2013 lobbied for by Miles \u2013 is set to change all this. The budget assumes the heat will come out of population growth in the future, with population easing from 2.5% in 2023-24 to 1.5% for the next two years. The government is hoping this will help the state manage its housing market back from crisis into health. To be determined The LNP The opposition is well ahead in the polls. But the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has so far aimed to keep a low profile, avoiding any large commitments. The government\u2019s budget heaps additional pressure on the opposition to come up with their own plan. The treasurer all but dared Crisafulli to vote against part of the budget this morning, as they did in opposition \u2013 aiming to flush him out on its revenue measures. In an unusual move, Miles used a Queensland day speech last week to attack the Liberal National party leader as \u201ceffectively trying to say to Queenslanders, you can have a Labor government just without the Labor party. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to fall for that\u201d. On Thursday, he will give a highly anticipated hour-long budget reply address. The alternative premier will have to chart out an alternative course for Queensland. It\u2019s yet to be seen if the can bear the pressure as election day looms."

            "date": "2024-06-14T15:00:57Z",
            "content": "Anyone who has rented a home in southern Australia knows just how bloody cold our houses can be in winter. Once referred to as \u201cglorified tents\u201d by QUT professor of public health Adrian Barnett, Australians subject themselves to some of the most inhospitable indoor winter temperatures in the first world. The World Health Organization recommends that indoor temperatures don\u2019t dip below 18C. But research conducted by the Australian Centre for Housing Research found that 80% didn\u2019t meet those guidelines. For comparison, in the UK, which is notable for having the coldest homes in Europe, the mean indoor winter temperature in the dead of their winter was 18.5C. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads This unpleasantness is thanks in no small part to the delusional approach taken to insulation in Australia, and with landlords having little incentive to upgrade their homes\u2019 energy efficiency, renters often bear the brunt of this ongoing oversight. \u201cFor the last 80 years it didn\u2019t really matter what we built, because energy was so cheap,\u201d Emma Baker, director of the Australian Centre for Housing Research says. \u201cYou could just build a tent, put in some inefficient devices and heat the bejesus out [of it], it didn\u2019t matter that it was leaking through the edges of the windows.\u201d There is a mountain of advice available to homeowners, but if you are part of the 30% of Australians who are renting, finding ways to lower your energy bills and usage without forgoing comfortable and healthy internal climes in your home is more scant. Here are some cheap and easy ways renters can stay cosy while helping reduce their carbon footprint \u2013 from interior decorating to landlord-friendly DIYs that can make all the difference. Seal air leaks Chris Barnes, the household product category manager at Choice says that sealing around windows and doors is really important. Air leaks are extremely common in Australian homes and one way to test is to light a stick of incense and wave it around the frames. \u201cWhere the smoke flutters there\u2019s a leak,\u201d he says. Barnes says window seal tapes that renters can pick up from hardware stores or online are cheap and fairly effective. And since they\u2019re quite easy to remove without any trace you don\u2019t need your landlord\u2019s approval. Foam sealing tape, he says, can be especially effective for gappy sash windows. The classic, dusty old door snake is an often unsightly and less effective way to minimise drafts under doors, but Barnes suggests upping the ante and considering a semi permanent solution. Self adhesive brush draft stoppers, especially on exterior doors, won\u2019t just keep out cold air they also stop bugs, dust and even bushfire embers from sneaking in. Snuggle up Electric blankets and their sexier cousin the heated throw are also worth considering according to Barnes. \u201cYou could run one over winter for between $10 and $60 for the whole season. An electric space heater by comparison \u201ccould easily get into the hundreds [of dollars] for the same sort of running time\u201d. Dress your windows wisely Another renter friendly insulation hack is picking the right window coverings. A deep dive into exactly which type offers the best protection from the cold by New Zealand website Consumer found that \u201choneycomb\u201d blinds are the most effective. Barnes says the cellular properties of the pleats \u201ccreate a thermal barrier across the window\u201d. And compared to heavy curtains or venetians, they are relatively cheap: you can cover a standard window for about the same price you would pay for a couple of pints. Cover cold floors Baker says that one of the most overlooked but influential factors is what is beneath our feet. \u201cOne of best predictors [of a home\u2019s average temperature] is floor coverings \u2013 a lot of your heat loss, especially in your lovely floorboard terraces, is actually going through the floor. It\u2019s just massive.\u201d Area rugs and even cheaper foam mats can work wonders warming up living and sleeping spaces. Make heaters work smarter not harder If you happen to have ceiling fans in your home, Barnes says putting them in reverse mode will push hot air down to where you can enjoy it. \u201cCeiling fans don\u2019t cost much to run. You\u2019re looking at peanuts over winter compared to running a portable electric heater.\u201d He adds that even if you have both on at the same time, running the fan in reverse will reduce energy use because \u201cthe heater just doesn\u2019t have to work as hard\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to break the bank to make most of these changes.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-07T16:44:09Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has apologised publicly to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for the months of delay in American military assistance that allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield, and announced a further $225m (\u00a3177m) in military aid to Ukraine. Meeting Zelenskiy in Paris on Friday, the US president told him: \u201cYou haven\u2019t bowed down, you haven\u2019t yielded at all, you continue to fight in a way that is \u2026 just remarkable. We are not going to walk away from you.\u201d Biden said: \u201cI apologise for those weeks of not knowing\u201d, referring to the uncertainty while Congress waited six months before sending a $61bn military aid package for Ukraine in April. \u201cSome of our very conservative members [of Congress] were holding it up. But we got it done, finally,\u201d he added. Biden said the American people were standing by Ukraine for the long haul. \u201cWe\u2019re still in. Completely. Thoroughly.\u201d Zelenskiy said in English: \u201cIt\u2019s very important that \u2026 all American people stay with Ukraine, like it was during the second world war. United States helped to save human lives, to save Europe.\u201d Biden and Zelenskiy had attended the 80th anniversary D-day events in Normandy, in northern France, along with European leaders who have supported Kyiv\u2019s efforts in the war. In Normandy, Biden drew a link between the fight to liberate Europe from Nazi domination to today\u2019s fight against Russian aggression, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as a tyrant. The US is by far Kyiv\u2019s biggest supplier of wartime support and Ukraine is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. The push is focused on the Ukrainian border regions of Kharkiv and Donetsk but Ukrainian officials say it could spread as Russia\u2019s bigger army seeks to expand its advantage. The offensive is seeking to exploit Kyiv\u2019s shortages of ammunition and troops along the roughly 1,000km (620-mile) frontline. The latest package of US military aid includes munitions for the high mobility artillery rocket system, or Himars, as well as mortar systems and an array of artillery rounds, officials said. Some Nato allies, including the US, said last week they would allow Ukraine to use weapons they deliver to Kyiv to carry out limited attacks inside Russia, easing their stance amid Russia\u2019s most recent onslaught and with Ukraine\u2019s army reeling. That step brought a furious response from the Kremlin, which warned that Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since the second world war could spin out of control. The White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Friday, that with the help of newly delivered US military aid, Ukrainian forces \u201chave been able to thwart Russian advances, particularly around Kharkiv.\u201d \u201cThe Russians really have stalled out. Basically their advance on Kharkiv is all but over,\u201d Kirby said, although he warned that nothing on the battlefield could be taken for granted. Zelenskiy told the Guardian in an exclusive interview last week that Biden\u2019s delay in sanctioning the use of western weapons against targets in Russia had left the Kremlin\u2019s forces laughing at Ukraine and able to \u201chunt\u201d its people. \u201cI think it is absolutely illogical to have [western] weapons and see the murderers, terrorists, who are killing us from the Russian side. I think sometimes they are just laughing at this situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going hunting for them. Hunting for people. They understand that we can see them, but we cannot reach them.\u201d In a speech to the French lower house of parliament on Friday, Zelenskiy drew a parallel with the sacrifices made during the second world war and Ukraine\u2019s current fight. \u201cThis battle is a crossroads,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cA moment where we can now write history the way we need it. Or we can become victims of history as it suits \u2026 our enemy.\u201d Zelenskiy, who spoke in Ukrainian, was applauded and cheered by lawmakers. He prompted a standing ovation when he said in French: \u201cDear France, I thank you for standing by our side as we defend life.\u201d He said he hoped a summit hosted by Switzerland later this month on bringing peace to Ukraine could hasten a fair end to the conflict. Zelenskiy said: \u201cThe inaugural peace summit could become a format that would bring closer a just end to this war. I am grateful for all you are already doing and it is a lot. But for a fair peace, more must be done.\u201d He warned that 80 years after the D-day landings, Europe was \u201cunfortunately no longer a continent of peace\u201d after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. \u201cCan Putin win this battle?\u201d Zelenskiy asked parliament. \u201cNo. Because you and I have no right to lose.\u201d Zelenskiy dismissed the possibility of peace in Ukraine based on current frontlines, and with Russia sometimes deep inside Ukrainian territory. \u201cCan this war end on the lines that exist now? No. Because there are no lines for evil: not 80 years ago, not now. And if someone tries to draw temporary lines, it will only give a pause before a new war.\u201d President Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview late on Thursday that Paris would transfer Mirage 2000 fighter jets to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots as part of a new military cooperation. Macron offered to train pilots starting from this summer. Western allies would consider a request from Ukraine to send military instructors to train its forces on its soil to meet the growing challenge of building up troop numbers, Macron said. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Macron\u2019s comments indicated he was ready for France to take a \u201cdirect\u201d role in the Ukraine conflict."

Meeting the Ukrainian president in Paris, Biden told him: \u201cYou haven\u2019t bowed down, you haven\u2019t yielded at all, you continue to fight in a way that is \u2026 just remarkable. We are not going to walk away from you.\u201d The US president also said the American people were standing by Ukraine for the long haul. \u201cWe\u2019re still in \u2013 completely, thoroughly.\u201d Ukrainian strikes on parts of the Russian-held Luhansk and Kherson regions killed 26 people and injured dozens more on Friday, Russian-installed authorities said. A shop in the village of Sadove in the southern Kherson region \u201cwith a large number of visitors and employees was destroyed\u201d, Vladimir Saldo, head of Russian occupation authorities in Kherson, wrote on Telegram. A Himars missile struck shortly afterwards as residents from neighbouring houses rushed to help the victims, Saldo told Russian media, putting the overall toll at 22 dead and 15 injured. The claims could not be independently verified. A Ukrainian missile strike on an apartment block in the eastern region\u2019s main city of the same name killed four and wounded more than 40, Russian-appointed officials in Luhansk reported earlier on Friday. Luhansk city came under a \u201cmassive\u201d missile attack on Friday morning, according to regional head Leonid Pasechnik. A section of an apartment block collapsed and the bodies of four people were removed from the rubble, the Moscow-backed region\u2019s government said on Telegram. A total of 46 people had received medical treatment, regional health minister Nataliya Pashchenko said. Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron have marked the 80th anniversary of D-day with a rallying cry for support for Ukraine as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was embraced by western leaders in Normandy, France. The US president used his address at the American commemorative event to send a message to Moscow that the US and its allies \u201cwill not bow down\u201d and will \u201cstand for freedom\u201d. \u201cTo surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators, is simply unthinkable,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf we were to do that, it means we\u2019d be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\u201d Macron praised Ukraine\u2019s president during his tribute to those who fought, prompting a standing ovation, including by the other 25 heads of state and government. Macron lashed out at what he called a \u201ccamp of pacifists\u201d and the \u201cspirit of defeat\u201d over Ukraine\u2019s fight against the Russian invasion, vowing Ukrainian resistance would not end with capitulation. \u201cWe know this camp of pacifists. It is the one of capitulators. It\u2019s the spirit of defeat. We are not like this,\u201d the French president told reporters on Friday in Paris alongside Zelensky, in an apparent jab at critics including France\u2019s far-right opposition. Macron also said he wanted to \u201cfinalise\u201d the creation of a coalition of military instructors for Ukraine in the coming days. Ukraine\u2019s government has ordered all ministries and regional authorities to stop using air conditioning and switch off external lighting as Russian bombardments forced long blackouts across the country. Reducing power consumption and saving as much electricity as possible was vital following Russian strikes on the Ukrainian power system, which now had a \u201csignificant deficit\u201d, said the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Ukraine temperatures are hovering around 25C (77F) and could rise up to 35C (95F) in July and August. Vladimir Putin said Russia had no need to use nuclear weapons to secure victory in Ukraine \u2013 the Kremlin\u2019s strongest signal to date that the conflict will not escalate into a nuclear war. Asked at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum if Moscow should hold a \u201cnuclear pistol to the temple\u201d of the west over Ukraine, the Russian president said on Friday that he did not see the conditions for using such weapons. \u201cThe use is possible in an exceptional case \u2013 in the event of a threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. I don\u2019t think that such a case has come. There is no such need.\u201d Zelenskiy said his legitimacy was recognised and determined by the Ukrainian people, while criticising that of Putin. \u201cPresident Zelenskiy\u2019s legitimacy is recognised by the people of Ukraine \u2026 Our people are free. Putin\u2019s legitimacy is recognised only by comrade Putin,\u201d Zelenskiy said in Paris. Putin has claimed several times that Zelenskiy is illegitimate after his five-year term ended this May. Presidential elections in Ukraine were supposed to take place in the spring but martial law introduced after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion bans any wartime election. A court in Moscow has ordered a French citizen accused of collecting information on military issues in Russia be held in jail pending investigation and trial. Laurent Vinatier was arrested in the Russian capital on Thursday as tensions have flared between Moscow and Paris after Macron\u2019s statements about the possibility of deploying French troops in Ukraine."

            "title": "Eight Israeli soldiers killed in southern Gaza, military says",
            "date": "2024-06-15T16:02:29Z",
            "content": "Eight Israeli soldiers have been killed in a blast that engulfed their armoured vehicle in southern Gaza, in the biggest loss of life for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in a single incident since January. The deaths came amid continuing fighting around Rafah in which at least 19 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes. According to the IDF, the squad of combat engineers were in a convoy of half a dozen armoured vehicles returning from a mission at about 5am on Saturday morning in the Tal al-Sultan area of the southern Gaza city when their vehicle was destroyed. Earlier, the armed wing of Hamas said fighters had ambushed an armoured personnel carrier, killing and wounding a number of Israeli soldiers, in the area in the west of Rafah, where Israeli forces have been advancing for weeks. According to reports in the Israeli media, the IDF was investigating whether the vehicle exploded after being targeted or following the accidental detonation of explosives which the soldiers had been transporting in their vehicle. The explosives had been stored on the vehicle\u2019s exterior, a tactic reportedly used to avoid harm to the occupants in the event of detonation. The blast occurred after several other vehicles had already passed the same location, and killed all those inside immediately. The latest deaths will probably fuel mounting calls for a ceasefire and heighten Israeli public anger over ultra-Orthodox exemptions from the military. Although IDF fatalities from the Gaza operation and immediate surroundings, which now stand at 307, have been hugely outnumbered by Palestinian deaths \u2013 which have seen more than 37,000 killed, according to Gaza health officials, the majority of them civilians \u2013 the growing toll of death and injuries to Israel\u2019s armed forces has taken greater prominence as the war has dragged on. In January, 21 Israeli troops were killed in a single attack. On Sunday the Israeli cabinet is expected to discuss increasing the age limit for reserve duty for soldiers by a year. It follows the recent decision to raise the cap on the number of reservists who can be called up by 50,000, amid evidence that the IDF is being stretched fighting on two fronts and with no end to the conflict in sight. In May, the parents of more than 900 Israeli soldiers deployed in Gaza signed a letter urging the military to call off its ongoing offensive in Rafah, calling it a \u201cdeadly trap\u201d for their children. \u201cIt is evident to anyone with common sense that after months of warnings and announcements regarding an incursion into Rafah, there are forces on the other side actively preparing to strike our troops,\u201d said the letter, sent on 2 May. \u201cOur sons are physically and mentally exhausted,\u201d adds the letter, addressed to the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and the IDF chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi. \u201cAnd now, you intend to send them into this perilous situation? \u2026 This appears to be nothing short of recklessness.\u201d The increasing combat toll also comes against the background of a heated debate around the issue of who serves in the army. Last month, Israel\u2019s supreme court ordered an end to government subsidies for many ultra-Orthodox men who don\u2019t serve in the army. However, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government \u2013 which relies heavily on ultra-Orthodox parties \u2013 last week voted in favour of a new law extending exemptions for religious men. Although the first vote was only procedural, it caused an uproar by being approved during a war in which hundreds of soldiers have died and many others remain inside Gaza or on the frontlines against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. That prompted a second open letter last week from families of combat soldiers addressed to Gallant and Halevi. In the letter the families said they were asking their \u201cfighting children\u201d to \u201cstop the fighting right now, put down their weapons and return home immediately,\u201d adding: \u201cWe will not sacrifice our children on the altar of public corruption.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-03T19:33:06Z",
            "content": "More than 30 years on, the horrific killing of Stephen Lawrence still haunts one of Keir Starmer\u2019s new candidates with former military experience. Calvin Bailey was 15 years old at the time of Lawrence\u2019s murder. Bailey had developed a close friendship with Stephen\u2019s brother, Stuart, after his family moved from Zambia to south London when he was a young child. One would expect Bailey\u2019s own experiences of racism to have dominated his politics, but it is clear from the candidate\u2019s sadness that it is his struggle in processing grief over Stephen\u2019s murder that continues to weigh heaviest on his shoulders. \u201cWhen people look at me they often say, \u2018Where is his background? Why haven\u2019t you been campaigning for years?\u2019 I\u2019ve been in the military for 24 years, but that\u2019s not all the story,\u201d he says. Bailey is on course to win the safe Labour seat of Leyton and Wanstead, in east London, which was formerly held by the chair of Labour\u2019s parliamentary party, John Cryer. In the aftermath of Lawrence\u2019s murder, Bailey took to the streets and joined a number of anti-fascist marches as a means of expressing his frustration with injustice and racism. \u201cI wasn\u2019t emotionally intelligent enough to deal with it,\u201d he says of Lawrence\u2019s murder. \u201cI went to a lot of the anti-fascist marches at the time \u2026 and they confused me every time, as everything was coming out with anger. I didn\u2019t know what that meant. \u201cThey were identifying the cause between the five or six murders that happened at the time to young black men \u2026 and it\u2019s making me quite sad, actually. I think part of it was \u2026 I just didn\u2019t know what to do with any of it. I knew I didn\u2019t like it and that pushed me away from politics.\u201d Looking back, Bailey believes he was able to \u201cvent a whole load of anger\u201d while protesting, but \u201cunfortunately, those marches didn\u2019t change anything\u201d. \u201cThe approach taken [during the marches] wasn\u2019t allowing us to address the issues,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to detract from the story, but fundamentally, it was about racist police force \u2026 and those things you have to get through. But we had to get through the raw emotions.\u201d While Bailey, a graduate of Labour\u2019s young leaders programme, praises the work Starmer has done for Labour, he says he owes his \u201cpolitical reawakening\u201d to the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting. Bailey recalls listening to a radio interview centred on Streeting\u2019s life and thinking, \u201cwow that\u2019s really like mine\u201d, before he had the opportunity to meet the MP, then a backbencher. \u201cI thought, why am I not doing stuff with you?\u201d The candidate accepts the differing opinions that pervade Labour, but he believes Starmer doesn\u2019t make different political opinions a problem. \u201cHe knows a couple of people have had different views about things, but his language is that \u2018I\u2019m in charge. This is what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019 It\u2019s really compelling, especially from [the perspective of] a military person.\u201d Bailey says Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership and the party at the time resembled \u201cstudent politics\u201d, with Labour \u201creally good at talking to itself, and it was never talking to the electorate\u201d. He adds: \u201cMy dad used to say it\u2019s pointless having morals, standing on the margins and watching. If you believe in something, and unfortunately I\u2019m compelled by service, then you\u2019ve got to go and put yourself forward.\u201d Reflecting on his military honours, Bailey says he is most proud of his MBE, which he got for supporting humanitarian efforts in Haiti and the Philippines, and his US airforce medal for resupplying a team that had been hit by an IED in Afghanistan. While Lawrence shaped his politics, it was Bailey\u2019s mum that shaped his character. \u201cWhen I was a kid walking with mum from Plumstead to Woolwich, anyone we walked past who had any colour in their skin became my auntie, and their kids, cousins. \u201cAnd it was this kind of approach to people, the fundamental humanity she saw in them, is what I\u2019ve learned from her.\u201d He vows to fight for people from working-class roots, as \u201cpoor people\u2019s problems remain poor people\u2019s problems\u201d."

            "date": "2024-06-25T09:29:23Z",
            "content": "Israel\u2019s supreme court has ruled that ultra-Orthodox Jewish men must be drafted into military service, a politically explosive decision that threatens the stability of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government. The unanimous ruling on Tuesday, from an expanded panel of nine judges, upheld an interim decision last month that the state had no authority to offer the current exemption for ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, men. It found that yeshivas \u2013 Orthodox seminaries for Torah study \u2013 should be ineligible for state subsidies unless students enlisted in the military. The court ruled the state was carrying out \u201cinvalid selective enforcement, which represents a serious violation of the rule of law, and the principle according to which all individuals are equal before the law \u2026 In the midst of a gruelling war, the burden of inequality is harsher than ever and demands a solution.\u201d Ostensibly, the court decision ends a decades-old cultural and societal row over the importance of Torah study in modern Israeli life, and who should bear the burden of conscription. But the timing, in the midst of the war in Gaza and as Netanyahu struggles to hold together a rightwing coalition that includes two ultra-Orthodox parties, is more likely to inflame existing tensions between secular and religious elements of society. The powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism (UTJ) parties, key Netanyahu allies, have often threatened to quit his coalition and force new elections if draft exemptions for their communities were ended. Netanyahu, facing corruption charges he denies, is believed to view remaining in office as his best chance of avoiding prosecution. As such, he is seen as hostage to the demands of his coalition partners. Mandatory army service for Jewish citizens is a large part of the Israeli national ethos, but longstanding legal compromises have to date exempted Haredi men, who instead continue full-time study of religious texts funded by government stipends. Whether Haredi women serve is viewed as less controversial, as women are much less likely to be drafted into combat units. As the ultra-Orthodox population has grown \u2013 the community now makes up 13% of Israel and is projected to become 21% of the population by 2042 \u2013 military officers and reservists have become increasingly angry at the status quo, which they say ensures the Haredi community is unfit to contribute to the military or to the workforce. During hearings, government lawyers told the court that forcing ultra-Orthodox men to enlist would \u201ctear Israeli society apart\u201d. On Tuesday, Yitzhak Goldknopf, a UTJ minister, called the decision \u201cunfortunate and disappointing\u201d. He told Kan Radio: \u201cThe state of Israel was created to be a home for the Jewish people, and the Torah is the cornerstone of its existence. The holy Torah will win.\u201d The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a pro-democracy pressure group and the principal petitioner in the case, welcomed the court\u2019s decision. \u201cThe high court\u2019s decision is a historic triumph for the rule of law and the principle of equal military service burden,\u201d it said. Benny Gantz, a centrist opposition politician and Netanyahu rival who quit the war cabinet earlier this month citing disagreements with the prime minister over issues including a hostage deal and ultra-Orthodox conscription, blamed the impasse on the coalition. He wrote on X: \u201cMy Haredi brothers, it isn\u2019t you and it isn\u2019t the court. It\u2019s the prime minister and the ministers in his government that haven\u2019t sought out solutions for the draft and serving the nation. Rather, [they have sought out] solutions to help bolster the coalition. It is not too late to reach an agreement.\u201d The court did not set quotas for ultra-Orthodox enlistment, leaving that to the government and army. Tens of thousands of Israeli troops have been called up since the war began on 7 October, many for months on end, and 600 have been killed in the fighting. Last week, citing troop shortages, the government backed a draft bill that would raise the exemption age for reservists and expand the length of service, causing widespread anger. In an effort not to alienate Haredi parties and voters, successive Israeli governments have stalled on the issue of ultra-Orthodox conscription, despite a 2017 supreme court ruling that the exemptions are unconstitutional. The prime minister has been promoting a compromise bill tabled by a previous government in 2022, but it is now unclear whether he will be able to postpone the issue again."

            "title": "Guterres warns humanity on \u2018knife\u2019s edge\u2019 as AI raises nuclear war threat",
            "date": "2024-06-07T14:00:18Z",
            "content": "The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has warned that the spread of artificial intelligence technology multiplies the threat of nuclear war, and that humanity is now \u201con a knife\u2019s edge\u201d as dangers to its existence coalesce. Guterres\u2019s warning is due to be shown on a recorded video to be played on Friday morning at the annual meeting of the US Arms Control Association (ACA) in Washington. In the video, the secretary general makes his most impassioned plea to date for the nuclear weapons states to take their non-proliferation obligations seriously, and in particular, agree on a mutual pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. \u201cThe regime designed to prevent the use, testing and proliferation of nuclear weapons is weakening,\u201d Guterres says in the recorded message, in a warning that comes with some 600 days to go before the expiry of the 2010 New Start accord between the US and Russia, the last remaining agreement limiting the strategic arsenals of the two nuclear superpowers. Moscow has taken to making frequent threats of nuclear use, and China\u2019s stockpile, while small compared with those of the US and Russia, is growing steadily. More than 30 years since the end of the cold war, the US and Russia keep many of their intercontinental ballistic missiles on a hair-trigger alert, ready to launch at a few minutes\u2019 warning. There are fears that in the drive to bolster each nation\u2019s deterrent, launch procedures are being streamlined potentially with the help of AI. \u201cHumanity is on a knife\u2019s edge; the risk of a nuclear weapon being used has reached heights not seen since the cold war,\u201d Guterres says in his ACA address. \u201cStates are engaged in a qualitative arms race. Technologies like artificial intelligence are multiplying the danger.\u201d \u201cAll countries must agree that any decision on nuclear use is made by humans, not machines or algorithms,\u201d Guterres insisted. Two years ago, the US, UK and France issued a joint statement on the need to \u201cmaintain human control\u201d of nuclear launches. Russia and China have yet to issue any comparable declaration. According to estimates by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), the number of nuclear weapons has declined dramatically since the cold war from a 1986 peak of about 70,300 weapons in 1986 to an estimated 12,100 this year. The total inventory continues to fall gradually as retired weapons are dismantled, but the total military stockpile of warheads available for use has begun to increase again, after the long post-cold war decline, the FAS warned. Guterres said it was the responsibility of nuclear weapons states to lead a return to disarmament. \u201cThey must resume dialogue and commit to preventing any use of a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cI also urge the United States and the Russian Federation to get back to the negotiating table, fully implement the New Start treaty and agree on its successor.\u201d At last year\u2019s ACA meeting, the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, offered to engage in talks \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d on a new agreement to replace New Start, but the Kremlin has rejected the offer. Guterres also repeated his previous appeals for the nuclear powers to reaffirm a moratorium on nuclear testing, and to \u201cagree that none will be the first to launch\u201d a nuclear warhead. Earlier this year, China suggested a \u201cno first use\u201d treaty. The US responded by saying it was ready to engage in a discussion on the subject. Mallory Stewart, an assistant secretary of state, told the ACA in April she \u201cwould love to ask\u201d Chinese officials about the idea in the context of a broader conversation about strategic risks. But US officials say there has not so far been a \u201csubstantive response\u201d to the US suggestion of a dialogue, and has not so far agreed to arrange a sequel to a bilateral arms control meeting held last November."

            "date": "2024-06-25T19:36:04Z",
            "content": "A two-page letter written by Albert Einstein warning Franklin D Roosevelt \u2013 then the president of the US \u2013 that Nazi Germany might harness nuclear research to invent an atomic bomb is going up for sale at Christie\u2019s auctioneers in September with an estimate value of $4m. Einstein\u2019s letter \u2013 one of two the theoretical physicist drafted in a cabin on the north shore of New York\u2019s Long Island with a fellow scientist, Leo Szilard \u2013 warned that the German government was actively supporting nuclear research and could make \u201cextremely powerful bombs\u201d like the kind that were eventually deployed by the US at the end of the second world war. He urged the US government to do the same. And Roosevelt responded by forming a committee that was a forerunner to the J Robert Oppenheimer-headed Manhattan Project which built the bombs that were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, ending the second world war and ushering in the nuclear age. The letter that the father of the theory of general relativity about space and time sent to the president is at the Roosevelt library and museum in Hyde Park, New York. But the second version \u2013 signed and slightly shorter \u2013 is being sold off by the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Allen, a kind of magpie collector who amassed a collection of art that was recently sold off at Christie\u2019s for $1.6bn as well as almost anything pertaining to Jimi Hendrix, purchased the letter from publisher and third-party presidential candidate Malcolm Forbes in 2002 for $2.1m. The Wall Street Journal said that was the first 20th-century historical document to top $1m. Forbes had previously acquired it from the estate of Szilard. Christie\u2019s has a history with Einstein memorabilia. It previously sold the physicist\u2019s so-called God Letter \u2013 in which he wrote that \u201cthe word God is for me nothing but the expression and product of human weakness\u201d \u2013 for almost $3m in 2018. But the letter is unlikely to break the $13m record set in 2021 for one of the few surviving records detailing his theory of general relativity. With the market for visual art under stress, the auction house anticipates that the market for historical artefacts could attract bidders, especially one as prescient to current concerns about a new, three-way nuclear arms race between the US, Russia and China, alongside the success of last year\u2019s Oscar-winning Oppenheimer biopic. Marc Porter, chairman of Christie\u2019s Americas, told the Journal that Allen \u201cundoubtedly knew it was one of the most important documents in the history of the 20th century, and that\u2019s not the kind of thing you just hang in your office\u201d. Allen, he said, had stored the letter carefully and away from sunlight. The letter, dated 2 August 1939, less than a month before Germany invaded Poland, begins, \u201cSir: Recent work in nuclear physics made it probable that uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy.\u201d In the letter that was sent to Roosevelt, Einstein wrote: \u201cIt may be possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium \u2026 and this new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs.\u201d Nuclear reaction is currently on the mind of Allen\u2019s Microsoft partner Bill Gates, who recently announced he was prepared to invest billions into a next-generation nuclear power plant project in Wyoming. Gates told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that his startup TerraPower expected to complete the new reactor that uses liquid sodium instead of water as a coolant in 2030. \u201cI put in over a billion, and I\u2019ll put in billions more,\u201d Gates said. That comes as companies like Microsoft and Google have expressed interest in a new generation of nuclear power plants to meet escalating demands for power to run data-storage centers that is expected to dramatically increase. The International Energy Agency has estimated that global electricity demand from AI, data centers and crypto will at minimum rise to 800TWh, or terawatt hours, in 2026, a nearly 75% increase from 460TWh in 2022."

Solar and wind farms will need to rise six-fold by 2050 to reach 58GW and 69GW, respectively. Rooftop solar should roughly quadruple to 72GW by then, the report said. The 25-year plan did not model nuclear energy because the technology isn\u2019t policy for any federal or state government and is banned. Aemo said nuclear was \u201cone of the most expensive ways to generate electricity\u201d, citing a CSIRO report. \u201c[The] time it would take to design and build nuclear generation would be too slow to replace retiring coal-fired generation,\u201d Aemo noted in an accompanying factsheet. The ISP, released every two years, will likely stoke the intense political debate over Australia\u2019s energy future. The federal opposition last week announced plans to build nuclear generation on the sites of seven existing or closed coal plants without detailing their size, cost or impact on existing or future renewable investments. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, said Aemo\u2019s findings were in \u201cstark contrast\u201d to the Coalition\u2019s nuclear plan. Bowen claimed the Coalition policy would \u201csee Australians pay hundreds of billions for the reactors alone\u201d, which he said could provide \u201cat best\u201d 4% of Australia\u2019s energy needs by 2050. It might add $1,000 a year to people\u2019s energy bills, he said. Aemo\u2019s report also included an estimated benefit for each tonne of carbon dioxide avoided. As reported by Guardian Australia in April, market rules set the price at $70 a tonne, rising to $420 tonne by 2050 when Australia aims to reach net zero emissions. That change boosted the net benefits of the 10,000km of new transmission lines by $3.3bn to $22bn compared with the draft ISP. Renewable energy supplied almost 40% of electricity across the national electricity market (Nem) in 2023, and briefly topped 72% last October. The government is aiming for 82% of the Nem to be supplied by clean energy by 2030. \u201cAlready this decade, 12.5GW of new utility-scale generation and 1.3GW/1.8GWh of storage has entered the Nem and 490km of transmission has been built,\u201d it said. \u201cA further 20GW of generation and storage, and 2,090km of transmission, are progressing from planning to delivery.\u201d The market will also need 15GW of gas-fired generation by 2050, up from 11.5GW now, even if rarely used. Those plants may be fuelled by fossil gas, biomethane or even hydrogen. \u201cThis gas generation is a strategic reserve for power system reliability and security, so is not forecast to run frequently,\u201d Aemo said. \u201cA typical gas generator may generate just 5% of its annual potential, but will be critical when it runs\u201d particularly in winter. Nem regions will need more than 60,000 people to build and maintain energy infrastructure over the next 20 years. \u201cThe transition will have undeniable benefits,\u201d Aemo said. \u201cLower cost, lower emission renewables will offer homes and businesses the electricity they need, with greater insulation from international price shocks that can put unwelcome pressure on the cost of living.\u201d Anna Malos, Australia lead at Climateworks Centre, said the centre\u2019s modelling \u2013 which helped inform Aemo\u2019s report \u2013 found nuclear energy would \u201cbe much more expensive than renewables\u201d for the grid to reach zero emissions. It was also presumed to be unavailable before 2040, meaning carbon budgets would be blown as more coal and gas would be burned for power generation. \u201cThe grid is very largely decarbonised by the time nuclear becomes available,\u201d Malos said."

She spoke of seeing the initial explosion that killed every one of her classmates. She recounted regaining consciousness with a mouth full of dirt, running home to a mother who could not recognise her own badly burnt daughter, and smelling the lingering stench of burning flesh as bodies were cremated. To this day, she struggles to sleep as new sores break out on her skin, and cannot see a grilled tomato without remembering the ghastly sight of skin peeling off the dying who staggered through her neighbourhood like zombies. Through the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the UK is committed to the goal of a nuclear-weapons-free world. Starmer should formulate policy based on our legal and moral obligations, not a calculating attempt to win votes by looking tougher than the Tories. Prof Nick Megoran School of geography, politics and sociology, Newcastle University \u2022 I agree with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opinions of Keir Starmer\u2019s spending priorities and his conclusions, but I take issue with his view of the actions of Russia (Stockpiling nuclear weapons? That will do nothing for national security, Keir Starmer, 5 June). In 2014, Vladimir Putin made it clear that Russia needs neutral buffer states such as Ukraine. Russia lost about 27 million citizens last time it was invaded. It does not have the luxury of oceans on two sides and friendly neighbours on the other two. It would have been simple for Nato and Putin to negotiate neutrality guarantees, but instead Nato pursued a policy intended to plant missiles on the Russian border. The US knew such a policy would force Putin to act, thereby donating the \u201cmoral high ground\u201d to the west. The responsibility for this war in Ukraine lies not with Russia but the US. It is not Russia that poses a threat to world peace, but US militarism. Andrew Aikman Forres, Moray \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is right \u2013 our political leaders are sticking their heads deeply in the sand. He could have added that if it\u2019s possible for something to go wrong then you can be certain that one day it will. We may escape nuclear war, but accidental nuclear attack will, one day, happen. We\u2019ve been extremely lucky to have escaped this so far, but eventually our luck will run out, unless we put a stop to this madness. Norman Rimmell Darley Dale, Derbyshire \u2022 \u201cThere are several examples that show the threat of nuclear retaliation has failed to deter an invasion,\u201d says Jeremy Corbyn. This misrepresents the significance of nuclear weapons. The key point is: no nuclear-armed country has ever been invaded. This is the deterrent power of these awful weapons, and history shows them to have been highly effective in their role as defensive weapons. Alex Hamilton Killarney Heights, Sydney, Australia \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn writes: \u201cSecurity is not the ability to threaten and destroy your neighbour. Security is getting on with your neighbour.\u201d This may be true in the comfortable world of Islington, but how does Mr Corbyn propose that the people of Ukraine, the Baltic states or Poland \u2013 and ultimately the UK \u2013 \u201cget on\u201d with Vladimir Putin and his forces?

            "date": "2024-06-18T22:44:43Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, widely tipped to play a leading role in a second Trump presidency, has advocated the resumption of nuclear testing, and the possible renewed production of plutonium and weapons-grade uranium. Arms control experts said O\u2019Brien\u2019s proposals would accelerate the global nuclear arms race and backfire in terms of US security, handing greater advantages to Russia and China. O\u2019Brien spelled out what he thought a Trump national security policy would look like in an article for the journal Foreign Affairs, entitled The Return of Peace Through Strength. In the article, O\u2019Brien argued that Trump\u2019s hawkish stance had kept US adversaries in check, and that Biden\u2019s relative weakness had emboldened them. The piece does not mention the progress Iran made in its nuclear programme after Trump pulled out of a 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran, or the growth in Chinese and North Korean arsenals during the Trump years. As part of a policy of signalling strength, O\u2019Brien argued, the US should abandon the moratorium on nuclear testing it has observed since 1992, maintaining it despite the Senate\u2019s refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. \u201cWashington must test new nuclear weapons for reliability and safety in the real world for the first time since 1992 \u2013 not just by using computer models,\u201d said O\u2019Brien, who served as national security adviser from 2019 to 2021. He added: \u201cIf China and Russia continue to refuse to engage in good-faith arms-control talks, the United States should also resume production of uranium-235 and plutonium-239, the primary fissile isotopes of nuclear weapons.\u201d According to the Federation of American Scientists, the US currently has a total inventory of 5,044 warheads, while Russia has 5,580 and China 500. O\u2019Brien argued that the US should maintain \u201ctechnical and numerical superiority to the combined Chinese and Russian nuclear stockpiles\u201d, suggesting a significant expansion of the current American arsenal. Such a policy would be in sharp contrast with that of the Biden administration. The current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told the Arms Control Association (ACA) last year: \u201cThe United States does not need to increase our nuclear forces to outnumber the combined total of our competitors in order to successfully deter them. We\u2019ve been there. We\u2019ve learned that lesson.\u201d Earlier this month, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, told the ACA that the nuclear weapons powers \u201cmust reaffirm [the] moratorium on nuclear testing, and they must accelerate the implementation of the disarmament commitments made under the Nonproliferation Treaty\u201d. He warned that humanity was \u201con a knife edge\u201d in the face of a potential resumption of a nuclear arms race and advances in artificial intelligence. Daryl Kimball, the head of the ACA, described O\u2019Brien\u2019s article as \u201cdangerous, counterproductive, Dr Strangelove thinking\u201d. \u201cNo one wins a nuclear arms race, folks,\u201d Kimball said on the X social media platform. Jeffrey Lewis, a professor and nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, said a resumption of testing around the world would throw away US advantages that were locked in when the moratorium began more than three decades ago. \u201cWhen the test ban happened, the US had done more than 1,000 explosions and had the most advanced computing capabilities in the world, so we had the best data and the best computers, and we were in a position of enormous advantage relative to the Russians, and certainly relative to the Chinese,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe Russians had conducted a smaller number of nuclear explosions, and I think that they were not as well-instrumented as ours were \u2026 and then the Chinese were way behind,\u201d he added. \u201cChina now has supercomputers comparable to the ones in the US, and so the Chinese laboratories would learn vast amounts about miniaturising nuclear weapons, [and about] making nuclear weapons more reliable, that we already know in the US. Whereas, comparatively, we would learn very, very little.\u201d Lewis said making more fissile material would be pointless. The US is estimated to have a stockpile of 87.6 tonnes of plutonium and 483 tonnes of highly enriched uranium, enough for tens of thousands more warheads without the need to make any more. Lewis said the main point of the O\u2019Brien article was to appeal to \u201can audience of one\u201d \u2013 Trump \u2013 by putting forward radical ideas that spur outrage from liberals and the arms-control community. He likened it to the punk rock movement: \u201cPutting a safety pin through your ear is not because you think it looks good or it feels good, but because it outrages the normies.\u201d"

            "content": "As I headed back to New York City from my parents\u2019 new home in New Jersey earlier this year, I had a feeling Papa was going to die. It wasn\u2019t just that he had been bedridden for weeks, but something in the way he desperately wanted me to leave made me suspicious. It\u2019s as if he didn\u2019t want me to witness what was about to happen. My parents moved from Texas to New Jersey in December to be closer to me, their eldest daughter. After my father had a devastating stroke two years before, I\u2019d helped care for him while trying to keep my journalism career afloat \u2013 but something had to give. Papa, who despised the frigid winters and high taxes of the east coast, finally made the agonizing decision to leave his beloved San Antonio home on the golf course so I could go back to work, to my friends, to a life not completely bound to sickness. On move-in day, Christmas Eve, the Salams called the Garden state \u201chome\u201d. That period of bliss was short-lived. My suspicions were confirmed on 6 February, the day before he died. The doctors had been trying to figure out why my father was in severe pain for a week. Was it blood or some other fluid in his lungs? Was his heart failure getting worse? In the end, the reason didn\u2019t matter; his organs were rapidly shutting down, and I was told to decide on a time to remove his breathing device and inform the rest of my family. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Just a few days earlier, we were laughing about how ugly this hospital was compared with previous ones he had stayed in. In retrospect, I don\u2019t know why I thought he would survive \u2013 this man had already endured a second heart attack in this ancient and inefficient regional hospital in Trenton, and doctors had told us to prepare for the worst: another, probably final, cardiac event. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Two years ago, at Methodist hospital in San Antonio\u2019s medical center, my sister led the way to the neurointensive care unit. Papa was in the last room on the left. I parted the curtain encircling his hospital bed. He was fast asleep, looking as he always did when he passed out on the couch while watching TV at home. I gently nudged him. He slowly opened his eyes and looked confused, probably at the sight of me, here in Texas. Then, his face broke out into a huge smile that I could now see was extremely crooked, a legacy of his stroke. He kissed my hand. \u201cYou look great, just like Sylvester Stallone,\u201d I reassured him, leaning over to hug him. It was then that I realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to reply. His voice was gone \u2013 a common symptom immediately following a major stroke. When a blood vessel in someone\u2019s brain is compromised, the life they lived just before that moment ceases; today would mark the beginning of the rest of our lives. My father\u2019s stroke instantly aged him, and me. My biggest concern prior to this moment was deciding whether to ghost the guy I was going out with, or let him down over text. No longer was I a twentysomething with an unremarkable life. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Khursheed Salam was not unlike most fathers, particularly south Asian fathers. He valued hard work and education above all else. If you didn\u2019t bring home an A \u2013 or at least a B in my case \u2013 you might as well make sandwiches at the nearest 7-Eleven. He emigrated from a small, boring town in West Yorkshire in the United Kingdom to New Jersey to marry my mom, Kausam, in the 1980s. They settled in Houston. For most of my childhood, Papa worked in finance for Metro, the city\u2019s transportation authority. He went to work downtown every weekday morning and came home just before dinner, in time to evaluate our homework and yell at us when it was wrong or showed lack of effort. A punctual person who cherished routine and structure, he was risk-averse and a fastidious saver, to the point where he often didn\u2019t allow himself as much fun as he could have. But behind the facade of the reliable breadwinning head of household, Papa was a simmering pot of stress, always worrying he wasn\u2019t doing enough for his family. In retrospect, I see that behind every outburst was severe anxiety: a fear that his kids would become lazy high school drop-outs and drug addicts that would lead to him losing his hard-earned savings, putting his family out on the street. His health problems, I now recognize, were exacerbated by stress. He suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure and, eventually, congestive heart failure. It probably didn\u2019t help that he smoked half a pack of Marlboro cigarettes every day on the patio behind our house \u2013 one of the ways he dealt with his anxiety. But I didn\u2019t know the extent of his chronic ailments until he was lying flat and semiconscious in a hospital bed. The nurses told me to come back at 8.00 the next morning for rounds, when the entire medical team gathered to discuss the patient\u2019s prognosis and update family members. \u2022\u2022\u2022 The big breath of relief we took when we learned my father would survive his traumatic brain injury was quickly followed by a series of logistical and emotional obstacles. The recovery process after a stroke is arduous. In some severe cases, it never ends, and is made worse by having to navigate the US healthcare system. But such is the state of post-stroke care in the US: we have the greatest number of top rehabilitation hospitals in the world, but accessing those facilities is a bewildering and competitive process. Whether stroke patients have insurance \u2013 and what kind \u2013 can determine the trajectory of their recovery and future quality of life. It can mean the difference between walking and using a wheelchair for the rest of their lives. It can also make the difference between living and dying. Strokes predominantly affect people over 65, most of whom have federal Medicare coverage if they are US citizens or eligible legal residents. But government health insurance has substantial shortcomings, and for those with less coverage \u2013 or, even worse, those without insurance \u2013 their story is sadder. Every year, more than 795,000 people in the US have a stroke. It\u2019s a cause of serious long-term disability in the US, reducing mobility in more than half of survivors ages 65 and older. There are two types of stroke: ischemic, when a blood vessel is blocked, and hemorrhagic, when it bursts. On 22 March 2022, my dad had an ischemic stroke, or, as one doctor colorfully put it, \u201ca massive, massive, massive stroke\u201d. Treatment is limited: medicine, possibly surgery, and a hail Mary (or an \u201cInshallah\u201d, as my mother would say.) Treatment begins the moment emergency medical technicians make contact. The hope is that they rush a patient to the primary stroke hospital in their town or city \u2013 if one exists. An inventory of stroke centers in the US found that among 5,533 emergency departments, only 2,446 (44%) are stroke centers, according to data provided by healthcare non-profit the Joint Commission. In the ER, staff immediately administer a medicine called a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which helps break up any blood clot. Those who receive tPA are more likely to recover fully or have less disability than patients who do not receive the drug, according to the CDC. But here\u2019s the kicker: tPA can only be given within three hours of a stroke. In rare instances, if it can\u2019t be given in time or if the drug was unsuccessful, the blood clot must be surgically removed in a procedure called a thrombectomy. Papa became one of these rarities: at the San Antonio Methodist hospital emergency room, the tPA did not work but, by some miracle, he qualified for the surgery. He didn\u2019t look like it, but he was lucky. Many hospitals, even those deemed primary stroke hospitals, don\u2019t offer thrombectomies. According to researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, only 19.8% of the population can access a stroke center capable of performing one within a 15-minute ambulance ride. Even if a hospital has the capacity to perform the surgery, that\u2019s not a guarantee that a stroke victim can get it. It has to be performed within six hours of the onset of symptoms. And patients with private insurance in particular \u2013 like my dad, who was covered by Aetna through his employer \u2013 were more likely to undergo a thrombectomy, according to a 2021 study, while those uninsured or under-insured had more limited access. In short, your insurance \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 helps determine the type of care you receive. \u201cWhen someone experiences a stroke, you\u2019ve lost a very big part of what you\u2019re able to do that keeps you independent,\u201d said Dr Ganesh Asaithambi, a vascular neurologist and the lead author of a study on thrombectomies in acute ischemic strokes. \u201cThe best chance of recovery is not only the rehabilitation, but getting to the hospital as fast as possible,\u201d he explained. If a patient survives, a months-long hospital stay begins that involves sleepless nights, hysterical crying, delusional laughter, and numbness \u2013 for both the patient and their caregivers. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Rounds made me feel like I was a disgraced politician surrounded by a press gaggle, except I was being hounded by medical professionals, not journalists. After the neurologist, pulmonologist, cardiologist and chief nurse read aloud their notes about Papa, the attending physician for the neurocritical care unit, Christopher Burdick, asked if I had any questions. Although I had been taking notes on my phone, I didn\u2019t know what to ask. I was completely lost. I could only muster the confidence to ask: \u201cWill he survive?\u201d Although I hated it at the time, Burdick\u2019s candor was grounding. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I hope so and you should, too. Have faith.\u201d Every day after that, I came to rounds better prepared. Memorizing the medical lingo slung at me by various professionals, I compiled a long list of questions. \u201cHow much of the brain was affected? Which parts of the brain? What is the likelihood the functions performed by these parts will return? How can we achieve maximum recovery?\u201c Dr Burdick explained that large chunks of Papa\u2019s brain were compromised, particularly on the left side. These areas told him how to walk, talk, eat and even see. But amid all the bad news, Dr Burdick offered a morsel of good news, which proved an effective technique to placate distressed, sleep-deprived caregivers like me and my mother. He explained that although the parts of the brain that lost blood flow during a stroke can never recover, the brain has an incredible capacity to find alternative \u201cpathways\u201d that allow people to perform some of the functions they lost. Even though he was calling me on his drive to work just a week prior, now Papa could not stand, speak or swallow, and had trouble seeing \u2013 but there was a small hope he could do these things again one day as his brain rewired itself. Throughout his stay, therapists tried to help Papa stand and swallow. Every day, a speech pathologist would perform a swallow test. And every day, I hoped he would be able to eat applesauce without any of it lingering in the wrong passageway. From rattling off important historical dates and mathematical equations at the drop of a hat to trying to consume food typically reserved for a baby, Papa had fallen far. If he continued to flunk the swallow tests, he would be at risk of pneumonia and would need a feeding tube. I could not accept my dad being fed through a device in his stomach, living without the foods he loved so much. I willed him to swallow. And after he failed test after test, the speech pathologist told me \u201che swallowed like a champ\u201d on his last day, just before being discharged. Next challenge: Papa was in no condition to come home yet, but he was too \u201cstable\u201d to remain in the hospital. Typically, after a stroke, doctors recommend that patients move from the traditional hospital to a rehabilitation hospital to receive more intense physical, occupational and speech therapy several times per week \u2013 if their insurance covers it. But even those lucky enough to have coverage may be physically unable to handle the demands of a robust program. Papa had premium private insurance through his job, but he was visibly weak and didn\u2019t appear cognizant of his surroundings. I realized this observing a game he played with his speech therapist which involved picking up the object she named. She placed an apple and a plastic spoon on the table in front of Papa. \u201cPick up the spoon,\u201d the therapist said. She repeated the instruction several times. Finally, Papa picked up the apple. The hospital caseworker had told me and my mother that Papa would be best suited to a \u201cskilled nursing facility\u201d, since he probably could not handle the work a rehabilitation hospital required. She implied he wasn\u2019t good enough for an exclusive, elite rehab hospital because he couldn\u2019t perform in therapy multiple times a day, every weekday. I was enraged. \u201cIf you\u2019re telling me my dad is going to a nursing home, you are sorely mistaken,\u201d I remember saying. \u201cWe are not leaving until he is admitted to not just any rehab hospital, but the best in the country. And don\u2019t worry, we can wait.\u201d I called the best stroke rehabilitation hospitals in the country: NYU Rusk, Kessler in New Jersey, and TIRR Memorial Hermann in the Texas medical center in Houston. Patient and empathetic therapists there confirmed I was doing the right thing by pushing for Papa to go to a rehab hospital. Flying would be dangerous and incredibly expensive, since he would have to be boarded on a stretcher. So I set my sights on Houston and prayed for a bed to open. The caseworker finally came bearing good news: TIRR had a vacancy. I rejoiced as if I\u2019d just been admitted to a prestigious university or won a car in a shopping mall raffle. It was a light in a dark, weeks-long tunnel of despair. We were grateful my dad still had private insurance. Papa had the first two weeks of his stay covered by insurance, and he would be reassessed every week after that. In total, he eventually received two full months of inpatient rehabilitation at a world-class hospital \u2013 the equivalent, for someone with a new brain injury, of winning the lottery. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Being a patient advocate is a full-time job. In fact, it\u2019s an actual paid position at many hospitals. These people help families navigate the hospital\u2019s processes, such as communicating with doctors, making sure insurance companies approve necessary procedures, or even acting on behalf of the family in a complaint against the hospital. But many people, like me at the time, don\u2019t know these people exist or how to utilize them if they do. So I took on the role myself. I met frequently with the new hospital caseworker assigned to us to make sure his insurance would continue to cover his rehab stay, and stayed alert just in case I had to correct a nurse about my dad\u2019s medical history. When a physical therapist said my dad looked too tired for therapy, I argued he was fine, knowing that pushing him was what he would want me to do. Once I yelled at someone who assumed my father couldn\u2019t speak English, probably because he was a brown man, and explained that he had aphasia. Then I had to explain what aphasia is to said person, despite their medical background. In retrospect, I probably wouldn\u2019t have even let anyone else advocate for my dad\u2019s health. I fought for my dad the way I knew he would for me if our roles were reversed, so this often resulted in verbal spats with hospital administration and expletives I probably could have kept to myself. On two occasions following disagreements on treatment, I was asked to leave and cool down. I am my father\u2019s daughter, after all. I often forgot to eat, so I spent spare moments cobbling a meal together from the hospital vending machines or ordering the same grilled cheese and apple from the cafeteria where I became a regular. During these \u201cbreaks\u201d, I\u2019d obsessively consume articles from medical journals about how to maximize recovery after a stroke or call a friend and sob over the phone. Once or twice, I slept overnight in the very uncomfortable chair in my dad\u2019s room when I knew he was particularly anxious or distressed. My new schedule didn\u2019t leave room for my responsibilities at my actual job, but thanks to my generous employer, I took a long leave of absence to stay with my dad in the hospital. I told my mother to finish teaching her classes for the semester since academia is a far less forgiving industry, and I became my father\u2019s designated primary caregiver and had medical power of attorney. But not every stroke survivor has a family member able to go to bat for them. And even if a doctor does plead for more therapy for a patient, it\u2019s far from guaranteed an insurer will cover it. Nneka Ifejika, a physician, professor, and researcher of physical medicine and rehabilitation and neurology, chairs the American Stroke Association advisory committee\u2019s rehab and recovery subcommittee. Accessing inpatient acute rehabilitation after a stroke \u201cchanges everything\u201d, she told me. \u201cIf I don\u2019t advocate diligently, persistently, and insistently for my patients\u2019 access to appropriate post-stroke care, it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Ifejika said. \u201cI know for a fact that if I intervene earlier, I have the potential to change the trajectory of their recovery.\u201d This spells bad news, since the World Health Organization found the likelihood of having a stroke has increased 50% worldwide since 2005. There are several reasons for this increase. In addition to a growing population of the older people most at risk, UCLA Health also blames the rise in obesity and the decrease in food quality. Even with good insurance, we hit expensive barriers. Before Papa could be formally discharged from the Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, we had to have him transported to his new rehab hospital. But with all the tubes and wires Papa was connected to, we couldn\u2019t just put him in the backseat of the car and drop him off. He needed to travel by a private ambulance, the cost of which I was able to negotiate down to the bargain price of $1,000 by guilt-tripping our hospital caseworker and the partner ambulance company. My mom began packing a suitcase for my dad\u2019s indefinite stay in Houston. \u2022\u2022\u2022 On a Saturday morning in the great room of Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College, people hang around a table offering pastries and coffee. Everyone looks like old friends, talking and laughing. Bernadine Rae Gagnon, assistant director of Columbia\u2019s Clinic for Communication Disorders and Placement, started a therapy program in 2005 to provide free support for both survivors and their caregivers \u2013 whom this group calls \u201cco-survivors\u201d. She invited me to observe. A woman in a bright yellow shirt sits down with a plate of fruit and a Danish. Barbara Salahuddin-Grant is here because her son, Robin, suffered a stroke in 2009. She doesn\u2019t look it, but she\u2019s 88. Unsurprisingly, she calls caregiving \u201ctiresome\u201d. Her son was teaching at a school in Killeen, Texas, when he called his mother in the middle of the day to say he felt dizzy. As Robin lost the ability to form words, a mother\u2019s instinct kicked in. \u201cCall 911,\u201d she instructed Robin\u2019s colleague. \u201cHe\u2019s having a stroke.\u201d A long journey through various hospitals in Texas and eventually a stay at a post-acute rehabilitation center outside Austin followed. Years later, Robin\u2019s stroke symptoms persist, Salahuddin says. At 68, he no longer works. Like my dad did, he suffers from aphasia, a communication disorder that causes loss of the ability to either understand or express speech, depending on the type. There\u2019s no cure for it, but improvements are possible with extensive speech therapy. Often, insurance coverage ends long before a stroke survivor has recovered, or even made substantial progress. This especially hits home for those living with aphasia because speech will always be a struggle, but the amount of speech therapy insurance programs cover is finite. \u201cMedicare and Medicaid only cover a specific number of days in inpatient services and continued care for outpatients. The rules and regulations are so onerous that many can\u2019t understand how to access these services,\u201d Gagnon explained to me. \u201cInsurance companies vary. Survivors need to be on the phone with these insurance companies too. This is very difficult when you already have a communication deficit.\u201d The other co-survivors sit around and swap stories of recent difficulties and achievements. Lala is here to support her mother, a soft-spoken woman in a hijab. She animatedly narrates a story about how \u201cMommy\u201d is taking additional therapy online. Mommy, a former professor, used to speak six languages. Now, Lala just hopes she can converse with her at all. Barbara has an older son in his 70s who suffered a stroke several years ago. Because he was left completely paralyzed, Barbara could not care for him, forcing her to place him to live in an assisted living facility in the Bronx. She plans on paying for it with the proceeds from selling his old apartment. In spite of Barbara\u2019s tribulations, she keeps the faith. She is a deacon, after all, at Grace Baptist church in Mount Vernon, New York, just north of the Bronx. When I asked her how she keeps going, her response was simple: \u201cBy the grace of God.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The Texas medical center in Houston was beautiful: fountains and flowers everywhere you looked. Inside the brown-brick building, a long hallway led to the main rehabilitation gym. As I wheeled Papa down the hallway, I noticed framed pictures of alumni with traumatic brain injuries. Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman shot in the head by a gunman, was a patient. For some reason, that made me feel better. Papa had a simple room shared with a twentysomething kid who had sustained brain damage from a four-wheeling accident. Papa\u2019s first meal arrived in the evening. Because of his special diet due to his dysphagia, or inability to swallow, all of his food was the texture of mashed potatoes. Papa and I both stared at the tray in confusion. Corn was ground into a paste and then molded to resemble corn on the cob, like a cruel joke. Meat was also a paste, though it was hard to tell if it was chicken or beef. Dessert was a sugar-free pudding. I spent every day observing Papa\u2019s sessions with a physical therapist, Justin Hoang, a guy maybe a few years older than me. We became fast friends, which was nice since I didn\u2019t have a social life any more. I was there when Papa was spontaneously able to kick his right leg back and forth, to Justin\u2019s delight. I even joined in his music therapy with Chynah and Danielle, speech therapists who told me singing has been proven effective for aphasia patients because the unaffected side of his brain could analyze melody, allowing Papa to carry a tune. I told them he loved the Beatles and Pink Floyd so we spent an hour each weekday singing Here Comes the Sun and Another Brick in the Wall at his bedside. The therapists were right: Papa\u2019s speech improved slowly over his eight-week stay. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Next, my dad moved to a post-acute rehabilitation and skilled nursing facility down the street from his house. Insurance would cover five days of therapy a week here. Family members weren\u2019t allowed to stay overnight or be present during his therapy \u2013 which should have been the first red flag. Papa was alone in a new and unfamiliar environment. I noticed the next red flag at dinner the next day, where about 20 patients each sat at their own small table. My sister Mariam and I brought food my mom made and put through a food processor. He was still on a moist diet. But at his table, I noticed a plastic plate of macaroni and cheese and what looked like breaded chicken, something any speech pathologist would forbid for risk of choking. I couldn\u2019t take the plate away fast enough and demanded of the nurse on call to know why he was given food he couldn\u2019t swallow. \u201cOh, we\u2019ll fix that,\u201d she assured me. They never did. Papa was ever the observant Muslim, with the exception of smoking like a chimney and rarely praying. But he had never eaten pork a day in his life, and when Mariam returned the next day, he was unknowingly about to eat pork chops. We took Papa home that same day. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Crippling anxiety set in when I contemplated Papa\u2019s return home. We would now be on our own. By the time Papa came home, he could swallow a little better and was on a \u201cminced\u201d diet, though still unable to eat normally. He was able to stutter through a few short sentences and could stand on his feet with assistance from an object or another person. He was nowhere near being able to walk. My parents\u2019 San Antonio home was not wheelchair accessible. I began by ordering a portable wheelchair ramp on Amazon for $155 \u2013 a fraction of what my family ultimately spent to make their two-story house a livable place for a wheelchair user with a lingering severe brain injury. We hastily hired Benny, a general contractor, to knock down a shower stall and build a bigger one fitted with handrails and a detachable shower head. I also bought a shower chair. In between trips to Home Depot and arguing with his wife over the phone about working late nights, Benny got the job done. The total cost of Extreme Makeover: Wheelchair Edition: $1,250. But that\u2019s a steal considering what most people spend to retrofit homes for newly disabled loved ones. A checklist created by the National Association of Home Builders details every part of an ideal wheelchair-accessible home compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), including the floor plan, exterior, entries and thresholds. The average amount spent on home renovations for people with disabilities is $4,403. I couldn\u2019t access or even locate all my dad\u2019s bank accounts, and my mother didn\u2019t have the slightest clue either \u2013 a fact she was now regretting. She was a relatively present parent, always educating us beyond the school curriculum and making sure we were fed and clothed. But my dad had always made every single financial decision in our home, down to which grocery store we shopped at. (I made a mental note to never enter into a hyper-traditional relationship like my parents.) But the intense stress I felt during that period had less to do with finances than with the change I was finally coming to terms with: my father was no longer my provider, my rock. I was in charge. \u2022\u2022\u2022 The life change for stroke survivors is well documented; less talked about is the impact and burden on caregivers like me, my mom and my sister. By the time my father came back home in his new condition, it was summer \u2013 my mom, an English professor, was finally on a break from work. But now she was suddenly a nurse\u2019s aide, helping Papa transfer from the wheelchair to the shower and guiding him on how to brush his teeth with his left hand. She was cooking more than ever, following diet guidelines in pamphlets provided by hospital doctors. Mariam, 21, was organizing pills like she worked in a pharmacy. Her puzzled look as she sat at the kitchen table confronting an array of orange pill bottles gave me pause, but I had no choice but to trust that she had it handled. I had far too much else on my plate. When he arrived home, Papa had to take at least 20 pills. Atorvastatin, 80mg. Carvedilol, 3.125mg. Clopidogrel, 75mg. Isosorbide Mononitrate, 30mg. Jardiance, 25mg. And the list went on. I was on the phone with Aetna, his mortgage holder and several law firms that help families quickly apply for social security disability benefits. I was investigating where exactly Papa kept all his money, so I could pay the mounting bills. There was a 401(k), a 401(a) and a few other types of accounts I had never heard of. I compiled a comprehensive color-coded spreadsheet titled \u201cPapa\u2019s info\u201d in Google Sheets with tabs for bills, accounts, his medication list and a daily log for blood pressure and blood sugar readings. However ridiculous, it gave me a sense of control over an uncontrollable situation. \u201cThe high level of emotional distress among caregivers of stroke patients suggests that many caregivers have unmet needs,\u201d a 2010 study on the impact and burden of caregiving for long-term stroke survivors concluded. \u201cCommunity services need to focus attention on the neuropsychological aspects of stroke patients and the social functioning of caregivers who support them.\u201d We didn\u2019t need a team of researchers to tell us that. Mommy\u2019s health was deteriorating. She complained of shooting pains in her hands and arms, probably from loading the heavy wheelchair into and out of the car. She became sleep deprived, forcing herself to stay awake in case my dad\u2019s blood sugar dropped or if he needed help in the bathroom. I convinced her to seek help for her mental health. We found a nearby therapist with good reviews online, who had a kind face. I told her how hard it had been for my mom since my dad became disabled overnight and explained in great detail the panic and anxiety that set in once the realization hit that he would probably need help until the day he died, which seemed a lot sooner now. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need someone to talk to?\u201d she asked me half-jokingly. She was right: I also began therapy for the first time a few weeks later. Moments, however fleeting, of sobbing and shortness of breath aren\u2019t normal, she assured me. I was having panic attacks and I needed something stronger than an edible to put me at ease. Months later, I started taking an antidepressant and haven\u2019t stopped. \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u201cThis is a huge event in this patient and in their family\u2019s life,\u201d said Ifejika, of the Stroke Association. \u201cThere\u2019s never a conversation about the provision of caregiver training, support \u2013 all of those things that are done in the inpatient rehab facility arena.\u201d In the US, healthcare outcomes are often dependent on policy and paperwork required by insurance companies \u2013 not physicians. But Ifejika is pushing for change. Access to inpatient rehab used to involve a level of documentation that required three steps, \u201cbut one of the steps got taken out during the pandemic\u201d, she said of the cumbersome paperwork insurance companies require from doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing for outpatient therapies. There have been numerous times where I\u2019ve wanted to extend a patient\u2019s outpatient therapies, particularly patients with aphasia, because you need more time to recover your speech.\u201d But insurance companies, and Medicare and Medicaid, cap the number of therapy sessions available to someone who just had a stroke, and often, their doctors and therapists say it\u2019s not nearly enough. \u201cThere\u2019s no set path of recovery. That\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how the brain works,\u201d Ifejika said. Which type of Medicare a patient has also affects coverage. Traditional Medicare offers better access to post-stroke rehab. \u201cAs long as they meet the admission criteria, they can go to rehabilitation soon as they are available,\u201d Ifejika explained. But about half of beneficiaries now choose a Medicare Advantage plan, \u201cwhich I call Medicare Disadvantaged populations\u201d, she said. \u201cThere are significant limitations on access to care.\u201d For example, Medicare Advantage has up to 72 hours to decide whether the patient should go to inpatient rehab. But with \u201cthree more days in the hospital, you have a higher likelihood of lying in bed, developing complications from immobility, and a high likelihood of getting infections\u201d, she said. \u201cDepression, anxiety \u2013 all those things start to build up more because you\u2019re literally waiting for an insurance company to give you access to the care that the medical team agrees that you need.\u201d Private insurers also follow that policy. One of my dad\u2019s therapists, Joy, worked for Rehab Without Walls, a company that provides therapy at a patient\u2019s home. It\u2019s an ideal and convenient solution, but not everyone is eligible. Rehab Without Walls does not, for example, accept Medicare. I know this because when assessing my dad at our dining room table for the first time, Joy exclaimed: \u201cThank God you don\u2019t have Medicare!\u201d I remember feeling grateful my dad hadn\u2019t yet turned 65. \u2022\u2022\u2022 More than a year after leaving the hospital, Papa worked tirelessly to make himself better again. I don\u2019t know a more stubborn person. But he continued to lose weight, looking so fragile as he completed therapy each day as if it were his job. I missed the conversations we had had about world politics, his advice for my career (it was always \u201cjust go to law school\u201d). His speech did eventually improve, but we never could get back to the same long conversations. Papa never lived to see 65, but he did survive two years past his catastrophic stroke. I still got what I consider bonus time with my father while friends of mine had lost parents without any warning. I resented it at first \u2013 leaving New York to go back to Texas, the place I had tried so hard to leave \u2013 to figure out the logistics of our new situation. Only for him to die just after moving across the country. The stress was an overwhelming hell at the time that broke me, but I wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently. I bonded with my father in a way most people don\u2019t get to in adulthood. I held him while he was in pain, fed him when he couldn\u2019t eat by himself, and we laughed together when he had what would ordinarily be an embarrassing accident in the bathroom. I watched more English Premier League games and episodes of The Big Bang Theory than I ever expected to in my life. And while his random brain injury-induced rage tired us all, he still managed to crack so many jokes about his tragic situation \u2013 like laughing at other people who had to park further away while he had a handicapped sign on the car, or pretending to hit us with the cane he practiced walking with. His death has quieted my usually loud personality. I often have to remind myself I will never see or talk to him again and then feel the weight of a freight train hit my chest upon the realization. I am struggling to find purpose beyond the scope of work now, and look on at friends whose dads are still alive with envy. My father will never see me get married, or meet his grandchildren. He won\u2019t get to spend all the money he saved for retirement or benefit from the social security he paid into for years. I\u2019ll soon turn 29 without getting a \u201chappy birthday\u201d phone call or text from my dad. \u2022\u2022\u2022 A few weeks after the funeral, I shot up out of a deep slumber at around 4am. I had what I can only describe as a dream, but it felt so real. We were back in the hospital room where he died, but this time the walls weren\u2019t the shade of depression-gray. They were teal \u2013 one of his favorite colors. It was as if we were presented with an opportunity to say a proper goodbye, versus the rushed, confused chaos that actually was his death. This time, he wasn\u2019t intubated so he could speak. He was himself again. We rejoiced tearfully, as if we both knew we had been given this chance and it wouldn\u2019t last long. I hugged him and could feel him. Sobbing, I told him I loved him so much. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m OK,\u201d he told me, placing his hand on his chest. As he sat upward in a hospital bed, surrounded by family, laughing, he announced it was time for him to leave and casually waved goodbye as if we would all meet again soon."

            "date": "2024-06-24T20:59:35Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden and Kamala Harris marked the second anniversary of the US supreme court ruling that overturned Roe v Wade with forceful campaign statements that laid the blame squarely on Donald Trump for ending the national right to abortion. In a video released on Monday, Biden pledged to restore the right to an abortion and \u201cprotect American freedom\u201d if he is re-elected. The video, along with a campaign event headlined by the vice-president, came two years to the day since the court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization reversed nearly half a century of guaranteed federal abortion rights, and reflect the centrality of abortion in Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. In College Park, Maryland, Harris took the stage to chants of \u201cfour more years\u201d. In her remarks, Harris laid out what she said were the stakes for abortion access if Trump is re-elected. \u201cUnderstand as much harm as he has already caused, a second Trump term would be even worse,\u201d she said. \u201cHis friends in the United States Congress are trying to pass a national ban that would outlaw abortion in every single state \u2013 in states like New York and California, and even right here in Maryland.\u201d Nodding to her background as a prosecutor, Harris called Trump\u2019s attack on women\u2019s reproductive rights \u201cpremeditated\u201d and said he has \u201cnot denied, much less shown remorse, for his actions\u201d. \u201cIn the case of the stealing of reproductive freedom from the women of America, Donald Trump is guilty,\u201d she said. Harris called Republicans who have passed state-level bans Trump\u2019s \u201caccomplices\u201d and warned that he would go even further by curtailing access to contraception and IVF. Pointing to the statistic that one in three American women live in a state with abortion restrictions, she said: \u201cToday our daughters know fewer rights than their grandmothers. This is a healthcare crisis, and we all know who to blame: Donald Trump.\u201d Kate Cox, the Texas woman who was denied an abortion under the state\u2019s near-total ban last year despite a fatal fetal anomaly, introduced Harris in Maryland. \u201cMy state chose to drive me out of my home, my community, away from my children and my doctors, rather than to let me access care,\u201d she said. \u201cI will never again miss an opportunity to vote. I will cast my ballot in every election like my life depends on it.\u201d Cox ultimately left Texas to receive care. Growing emotional from the stage on Monday, she shared that she is pregnant again, expecting a child in January. The crowd erupted in applause. \u201cI hope that by then, when we welcome our baby into the world, we will have a world led by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a hero of this movement,\u201d Harris told Cox. In Biden\u2019s video, the president, too, placed the responsibility for reversing abortion rights on Trump, quoting him boasting about the decision and taking credit for putting three conservative justices on the court. \u201cHere\u2019s what Donald Trump says about your freedom: \u2018After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v Wade,\u2019\u201d Biden says, quoting a Trump statement last year. \u201cTwo years ago, the supreme court justices that Trump handpicked helped overturn Roe v Wade,\u201d Biden continues. \u201cDecades of progress shattered just because the last guy got four years in the White House.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re up against extremism. Send me back to the White House and I\u2019ll fight like hell to restore Roe v Wade and protect American freedom.\u201d The offensive comes amid polling evidence that with consistently weak approval ratings for Biden, concerns over reproductive rights represent Democrats\u2019 best hope of retaining the White House in November. Since Roe v Wade was overthrown in 2022, ballot measures in several states \u2013 including ones that tend to vote Republican \u2013 have upheld or enshrined abortion rights locally, signalling that the issue has popular resonance particularly among female voters. On Friday, a group of Montana abortion rights supporters became the latest to announce that they had secured enough signatures to hold a November ballot measure asking voters to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution. Although that measure has not yet been confirmed by state officials, voters in roughly a dozen states are expected to weigh in directly on abortion rights this year, including in battleground states such as Nevada and Arizona. Democrats are hoping that these measures will boost turnout in their favor. Several groups \u2013 including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Reproductive Rights and Reproductive Freedom for All \u2013 announced on Monday a $100m Abortion Access Now campaign across several states. Since Roe fell, Biden has frequently promised to \u201ccodify\u201d Roe\u2019s protections into law. Although his administration has issued executive orders aimed at boosting access to reproductive healthcare, including contraception, as well as defended abortion access in two supreme court cases this year, Biden cannot re-establish a federal right to abortion without congressional support. Congress has repeatedly failed to pass the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, a bill that blocks states from totally banning abortion before fetal viability, or the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb. In a call with reporters on Monday, White House officials declined to reveal any plans for future abortion-related executive actions. Jennifer Klein, assistant to the president and director of the Gender Policy Council, also acknowledged that, if the supreme court rules against the Biden administration in a highly anticipated case over emergency abortions, \u201cour options on emergency medical care are likely to be limited\u201d. Trump has sought to backpedal on his stance in recent months, telling congressional Republicans in a meeting on Capitol Hill this month that the matter should be left to the states and warning them against pursuing a national ban."

            "title": "Wider use of physician associates will increase inequality, say UK doctors",
            "date": "2024-06-30T07:00:16Z",
            "content": "Doctors are warning the UK medical regulator that wider use of physician associates in the NHS may risk patient safety and lead to greater inequalities in care in deprived areas that struggle to recruit GPs. The government\u2019s plan to recruit 10,000 physician associates \u2013 healthcare professionals supervised by doctors \u2013 has angered many clinicians who consider the roles ill-defined and a potential threat to patient safety. The General Medical Council (GMC) is to regulate physician and anaesthesia associates, who also work under doctors\u2019 supervision, from December. The doctors\u2019 union, the British Medical Association, last week announced it was seeking a judicial review of the GMC over the \u201cdangerous blurring of lines\u201d between doctors and medical associate professions. It argues physician and anaesthesia associates need regulating, but not by the GMC. Other professional membership organisations want clarification of associates\u2019 roles. The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) told the GMC that regulation is a \u201csignificant step forward\u201d, but the scope of practice needs to be urgently developed. In a submission to a GMC consultation on regulation, the RCGP stated: \u201cThere is concern that the deployment of [physician associates] in deprived areas, which often struggle to hire or retain GPs, could lead to inequalities in patient care and outcomes.\u201d A RCGP survey found eight out of 10 respondents considered negative effects on patient safety to be one challenge of using physician associates in general practice. Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the RCGP, said physician associates should not be GP substitutes. She said: \u201cWe need to see more being done to boost numbers of GPs across the country, but especially in areas of higher deprivation.\u201d The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association told the GMC lack of clarity over associates\u2019 roles \u201cwill risk patient safety\u201d. It said: \u201cThe current title of the roles, lack of clarity on scope and ambiguity on supervision make it very easy for [associate professions] to be mistaken for doctors and misunderstandings to arise around the level of skill and experience.\u201d Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford University, said physician associates lacked the training to be deployed on the frontline for patients with undiagnosed conditions. It was \u201cthe worst governance problem I have ever seen in healthcare in the UK\u201d. Physician associates, who can work in general practice and hospitals, have been working in the NHS since 2002 and anaesthesia associates since 2004. They cannot prescribe medicine, but can carry out physical examinations and perform diagnostic procedures. They are trained on a two-year postgraduate programme. There are more than 3,300 physician or anaesthesia associates in the NHS in England. The NHS long-term workforce plan published last year set a goal of 10,000 physician and 2,000 anaesthesia associates by 2036-37. Research from the UK and elsewhere has suggested that physician associates can deliver safe, cost-effective care, but the roles have created an acrimonious debate in the medical world. Sarah Clarke resigned as president of the Royal College of Physicians this month after members said the leadership was failing to act on evidence that physician associates were \u201csystematically replacing doctors\u201d and had not properly responded to patient safety concerns. The potential confusion over physician associate roles was recently highlighted by a poster on the website of Bradford District and Craven Health and Care Partnership, which pictured a physician associate and said \u201cthe physician will see you now\u201d. It is an offence under the Medical Act 1983 to use the title physician for a person who is not a registered medical doctor. The partnership said \u201cgenuine errors\u201d were made for its promotional material and it was undertaking an internal review to understand how they happened. Stephen Nash, a physician associate and chief executive of United Medical Associate Professionals (UMAPs), said: \u201cThese roles provide greater access to patients who would otherwise not be able to see a doctor. When we see patients with red flag symptoms, we can work with colleagues to stabilise the patient and refer to people they need to see. We absolutely do have the training to be the frontline.\u201d Nash denied physician associates were a risk to safety. In areas struggling to recruit GPs, they could provide improved access to care. UMAPs said many physician and anaesthesia associates were experienced former nurses, radiographers and other health professionals. A mandatory register was a \u201cwelcome step\u201d. Lord Bethell, a former health minister, said: \u201cModern medicine depends on teamwork with a combination of people with different skills. There is clearly a role for physician associates to meet the booming demand for healthcare services.\u201d NHS England said: \u201cThe NHS has always been clear that physician associates are not a substitute for doctors. The NHS has also recently issued guidance on the appropriate deployment of these roles, which makes it clear that physician associates should provide support and perform tasks under the supervision of doctors to help them do their jobs.\u201d The Royal College of Physicians said it had adopted recommendations from a working group to call on NHS England to \u201climit the pace and scale\u201d of the rollout of physician associates. The college recognised significant patient safety concerns. It said it would work with other national bodies to contribute to an evidence database on the work of physician associates. A GMC spokesperson said regulation of physician and anaesthesia associates would assure patients and colleagues that they are safe to practice and can be held to account if serious concerns are raised. The spokesperson said these associates were not doctors and cannot replace them, but played important roles in multidisciplinary teams. They added: \u201cWe will establish clear standards on the clinical knowledge and skills that [physician and anaesthesia associates] must have before they can register with us. Like many other professional healthcare regulators we don\u2019t set a scope of practice that determines how individual professionals develop their knowledge and skills over the course of their careers. We believe that guidance around extension of practice beyond qualification is an area where Royal Colleges and Faculties are best placed to advise and we know that this working is ongoing at present.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 July 2024 to add a comment from the GMC."

            "content": "Dentists agree that brushing twice a day is the best way to look after your teeth. But depending on what month it is, dental hygiene can be a dramatically more expensive habit to maintain. New research has shown that the cost of a tube of toothpaste at some times of the year can be double its price at other times. The price of other popular health products such as Gillette razors can also double depending when they are bought. The consumer group Which? looked at like-for-like products from the three top-selling brands that were available for at least 42 weeks of the year between March 2023 and February 2024. With toothpaste, at one end of the price scale, Colgate\u2019s Max White Ultimate Radiance (75ml) cost from \u00a311 up to \u00a325.20 in Waitrose. Asda and Boots commonly priced the product at \u00a312. A standard product, Colgate\u2019s Max White Expert Whitening Toothpaste, ranged between \u00a32.50 and \u00a35 in a year. Ele Clark, the retail editor at Which?, said: \u201cRetailers constantly change products\u2019 prices based on demand, seasonality, agreements with manufacturers, and what their competitors are doing. \u201cKeep an eye on the prices of products you buy regularly and stock up when the price is low \u2013 or ask yourself if it\u2019s really essential to have your preferred brand and consider switching to a cheaper product that can do just as good a job.\u201d Researchers also discovered a variation in the cost of mouthwash across shops. An example was Colgate\u2019s Max White Expert Whitening (500ml) which regularly sold at \u00a32.50 and \u00a35 at all big supermarkets during the year. Meanwhile, another mouthwash, Listerine Advanced Defence Gum Crisp Mint (500ml) cost between \u00a33 and \u00a36 at Boots. Which? took a snapshot price for each product at the same time each week over the year, excluding multi-buy offers and loyalty pricing. Consumers often had to pay more for razors, particularly some Gillette products. The Gillette Labs Razor with Exfoliating Bar cost \u00a322.49 at Morrisons when it was full price but was frequently reduced to half that amount: \u00a311.25. Allergy tablets emerged as another popular health product with significant price variations. A packet of 30 Piriteze Hayfever and Allergy Relief Tablets at Waitrose was reduced from \u00a311.50 to \u00a38 between May and July 2023 and then it cost \u00a311.55. At Boots, the same product was \u00a310.55 from March to July 2023, then rising to \u00a311.55. The Which? investigation showed Asda was the cheapest supermarket overall for health products, based on a comparison of 107 like-for-like health and personal care goods that were available at Asda, Boots, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury\u2019s, Superdrug, Tesco, and Waitrose throughout the year. Aldi and Lidl stock fewer brands so were not included. Which? approached all of the retailers for comment. Boots, Superdrug and Waitrose said that they aimed to offer the best value to customers through a range of deals. The other supermarkets did not comment."

            "content": "Jenn Coffey was sick, on several medications, and in and out of the hospital around 2016 when she made a decision that she has come to regret. Having fought off breast cancer, the former emergency medical technician faced numerous complications, and was diagnosed with two rare diseases: complex regional pain syndrome and small fiber neuropathy. \u201cI was terrified,\u201d she said. \u201cI went into the hospital as a fully functional EMT and came out in a wheelchair, to go on disability income, and I lost everything. I lost my house, I lost everything.\u201d Coffey, 52, had been selling her belongings and raising money on GoFundMe to cover her medical care. To make things cheaper, she shifted her disability plan from traditional Medicare \u2013 a government-run health insurance program for older and disabled people \u2013 to Medicare Advantage, a program under which private health insurers contract with the Medicare program to provide health benefits. With monthly premiums of $18.50 per month on average, Medicare Advantage often looks like a frugal alternative. However, private insurers keep premiums low by limiting providers and using byzantine cost containment tools such as prior authorization. For Coffey, switching proved more expensive, as her Medicare Advantage provider, UnitedHealthcare, denied requests to cover treatments, medications and infusions she required. Coffey used to be a Republican state representative in New Hampshire. \u201cI changed a lot over these years,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to think we could fix healthcare.\u201d Her experience with Medicare Advantage is not unusual. Private insurers now cover roughly half of the nation\u2019s 68 million Medicare beneficiaries. Their dominance of this space has grown rapidly over the past two decades \u2013 at the expense of patient care, according to healthcare activists and patients, as corporations often deny medical care directed by doctors. \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u201cI was stunned,\u201d said Gloria Bent, of the first time her husband, Gary, was denied coverage for his brain surgery. It was only the start of their issues with Medicare Advantage. Gary \u2013 a retired physicist professor in Connecticut \u2013 fought two types of cancer over six years, before passing away in March 2023. He had been put on a Medicare Advantage plan as part of his retirement health coverage, through the University of Connecticut. Gloria, and Gary\u2019s daughter, Megan, spent the final months and years of his life battling with NaviHealth \u2013 his Medicare Advantage plan\u2019s software, through UnitedHealthcare \u2013 which constantly denied covering Gary\u2019s medical care and treatment, contrary to doctor recommendations. Each denial forced them to either cover the costs themselves \u2013 such as a wheelchair, for $2,000 \u2013 or consistently file appeal after appeal. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about your loved one who is in a medical crisis, you are trying to get there to support them every day, and you\u2019re having to fight these online battles with the health insurance company to try to keep them there,\u201d said Gloria. \u201cIt\u2019s just a horrendous additional stress.\u201d She was informed by both her husband\u2019s doctors, and other experts she contacted for assistance, that the modus operandi of Medicare Advantage private insurers was to deny medical care coverage. \u201cIt just felt so cruel,\u201d added Megan. \u201cLike they weren\u2019t thinking of my dad as a person, they were just thinking about him in terms of profit or dollars and cents.\u201d Gary \u201cwas really upset at the way he was being treated\u201d, she recalled, \u201cand \u201cstressed about money\u201d. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Concern about the prevalence of such cases is growing. Older adults with Medicare Advantage are significantly more likely to struggle with medical bills or debt than those under traditional Medicare plans, according to a 2023 report by the Commonwealth Fund. On 3 June, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is hosting a webinar on the barriers faced by patients with Medicare Advantage plans. The late healthcare activist Ady Barkan became concerned about Medicare Advantage in 2022, according to Carmen Rhodes, policy director for Be a Hero, the advocacy organization he founded. The private program\u2019s surge in enrollment \u201cis not going to be good for the American people\u201d, said Rhodes, \u201cbecause it will be a system that consistently delays and denies people care for profit, and continues to give away billions of dollars to corporations that are actually not best positioned to decide on our healthcare\u201d. But the expansion of Medicare Advantage has been immensely profitable for private health insurers tied to the program, who enjoy high-gross margins compared with other plans. Over the next 10 years, Medicare Advantage insurers are expected to receive more than $7tn in payments from the federal government. Private insurers have spent millions of dollars on advertising, marketing and hiring insurance brokers to sell Medicare Advantage plans to beneficiaries. In 2023, brokers received $601 per new enrollee for most Medicare Advantage plans, significantly higher than commissions for traditional Medicare plans. \u201cI don\u2019t think when it comes down to it that most people realize the extent to which private equity and privatization is moving into Medicare and Medicare Advantage,\u201d said Rose Roach, executive director of the Minnesota Nurses Association. \u201cThey are buying up pieces of the entire healthcare system in this country.\u201d Project 2025, a conservative set of policy proposals to reshape the federal government if former president Donald Trump wins November\u2019s presidential election, includes a call to make Medicare Advantage \u201cthe default enrollment option\u201d for Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans were initially added to Medicare based on claims that they would provide savings for the federal government. However, in a March 2022 report to Congress, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission noted that \u201cthe many iterations of full-risk contracting with private plans have never yielded aggregate savings for the Medicare program. Throughout the history of Medicare managed care, the program has paid more \u2013 sometimes much more \u2013 than it would have paid for beneficiaries\u201d otherwise. Healthcare activists, patients and their families have claimed that the quality of Medicare Advantage plans were poor when they needed them most. \u201cThey\u2019re taking in more money and providing less care. That\u2019s the formula. That\u2019s how you make profit,\u201d said Megan Essaheb, director of federal affairs at People\u2019s Action, a progressive advocacy group. \u201cAs Medicare Advantage takes over the market and traps people in it, then they\u2019re able to worsen their care.\u201d Some beneficiaries say they were enticed to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan due to cheap premiums. Carly Morton of Beaver, Pennsylvania, switched through UnitedHealthcare for the additional benefits and cheap premiums. She was not able to work due to a disability. \u201cIt was a disaster that took a really huge toll on me,\u201d said Morton, who launched a public campaign for UnitedHealthcare to cover a lifesaving surgery to treat her rare vascular condition, neurogenic median arcuate ligament syndrome. \u201cNot getting the surgery would mean either dying or being very, very sick for the rest of my life,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI got really depressed for a while because I thought that was what was going to happen to me.\u201d Employers have increasingly been enrolling retirees into Medicare Advantage plans to save themselves money, too, with the federal government paying more. More than half of big employers offering retiree health benefits were estimated to do so for at least some patients through Medicare Advantage in 2023, up from 26% in 2017. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Coffey, the former emergency medical technician, does not expect to switch from Medicare Advantage for at least another decade \u2013 until she turns 65, and can requalify for traditional Medicare based on age, rather than disability. In 2022, she decided to start rationing her treatment infusions because insurance still wasn\u2019t covering them, along with several medications. \u201cThe infusions make the difference for me being able to walk around, cook myself a meal, to have a semblance of dignity in life,\u201d Coffey explained. \u201cSpreading them out takes away that dignity. It makes it difficult to walk to the bathroom. It causes a progressive decline. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die. If I can\u2019t access my medications and treatments, if I can\u2019t stay on top of everything, I decline and I\u2019m not ready for that.\u201d In 2023, Coffey said UnitedHealthcare \u2013 her Medicare Advantage provider \u2013 reached out to her after she went public with her story. But she has still found herself pushing for insurance to cover her treatments, seeking prior authorization for care and going through appeals over denials. According to Coffey, she has had prior authorizations accepted by UnitedHealthcare only for the insurer to not follow through with paying for the care, forcing her to regularly spend hours on the phone speaking with customer service representatives, or on hold, trying to resolve the issues. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous and disgusting that an insurance company has the power to tell my doctor: \u2018No, you can\u2019t give that patient that, no, you can\u2019t have that drug that might help you live,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that we allow it, and insurance companies do nothing to increase positive outcomes in healthcare. Nothing. All they are is a middleman who gets to make a shit ton of money off of us.\u201d Medicare Advantage \u201cworks well until it doesn\u2019t\u201d, reflected Gloria Bent, whose husband, Gary, died last March. \u201cAnd when it begins to not work well is when you most need it, when you are in a medical crisis and need advanced care. \u201cThese companies, as I understand it, are given a certain amount of money for every client they cover who is on Medicare. What they don\u2019t spend of that is their profit.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 June 2024. Due to an editing error, an earlier version incorrectly said that most Americans will pay $679 a month just for hospital and medical coverage. This has been removed."

Fauci, who was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases during the height of attempts to halt the spread of the virus, told a hearing on Capitol Hill that the threats had continued until the present day, even though he retired in 2022. He told a subcommittee of the House of Representatives\u2019 oversight and accountability committee that they also included his wife and three daughters and meant he needed round-the-clock security protection. \u201cThere have been everything from harassments by emails, texts, letters to myself, my wife, my three daughters. There have been credible death threats, leading to the arrests of two individuals,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cCredible death threats means someone who clearly was on their way to kill me, and it\u2019s required my having protective services essentially all the time. It is very troublesome to me. It is much more troublesome because they\u2019ve involved my wife and my three daughters at these moments.\u201d Asked by the Democratic congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan how he felt, Fauci, 83, seemed to visibly tremble with emotion before answering: \u201cTerrible.\u201d When Dingell asked if he was still receiving threats, he replied: \u201cYes, I do every time someone gets up and says, I\u2019m responsible for the death of people throughout the world, the threats go up.\u201d Fauci was defended by Robert Garcia, a Democratic congressman from California, after he came under attack from Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand far-right Georgia Republican, who refused to acknowledge his professional status as a doctor and assailed the pandemic measures he had advocated, such as masking and social distancing. \u201cDo the American people deserve to be abused like that, Mr Fauci, because you\u2019re not a doctor, you\u2019re Mr Fauci,\u201d Taylor Greene said, before being interrupted on a point of order and told she had to refer to Fauci as a doctor. Garcia apologised to Fauci about the questioning from Taylor Greene and other Republicans, saying: \u201cI am so sorry you just had to sit through that. That was completely irresponsible. This might be the most insane hearing I\u2019ve actually attended.\u201d Garcia described Fauci \u2013 who said in his opening statement that he wanted to address information and disinformation during the pandemic \u2013 as \u201can American hero\u201d. \u201cYour team has done more to save lives than all 435 members of this body on both sides of the aisle,\u201d he said. Posting on Twitter/X, Garcia, who told the hearing that both his parents had died in the pandemic, called Taylor Greene \u201ca national embarrassment\u201d."

            "date": "2024-06-11T23:01:09Z",
            "content": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s Euro 2024 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 24 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June. Prospects Slovakia fans are sceptical by nature and have a habit of being vociferous when the team is doing well but going missing when results are poor. In recent years supporters have not had much to celebrate after especially bad results in the Nations League (they finished third in their group having lost at home to Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and drawn with Belarus). However, when it comes to the Euros they have qualified for their third straight tournament, kicking into gear following the dismissal of the heavily criticised Stefan Tarkovic after some frustrating and lethargic performances in the summer of 2022. The Slovakian FA decided to appoint a foreign coach. Not only that, it went for someone who had never worked as a head coach before. However, Francesco Calzona could not have been more highly recommended with national team legend Marek Hamsik \u2013 who played a record 138 times for his country \u2013 throwing his weight behind the Italian, having worked with him at Napoli for many years. Calzona was Maurizio Sarri\u2019s assistant at the Serie A club but, naturally, the decision raised eyebrows, especially among former Slovakia internationals. However, the 55-year-old has turned Slovakia\u2019s fortunes around. The first thing he did was give the players some much-needed confidence, especially when it came to the system they were playing. Slovakia started to pick up wins \u2013 and draws \u2013 again and ended qualifying with only two narrow defeats against standout group winners Portugal. Calzona prefers a kind of 4-3-3 formation \u2013 although it can also be seen as a 4-1-4-1 \u2013 with a high press from two No 8s (normally Juraj Kucka and Ondrej Duda). He has tried to implement a high-tempo pressing game instead of a park-the-bus attitude seen at previous major tournaments. The full-backs are encouraged to attack. There is still work to be done, however, to try to win over a never-satisfied public. Regardless of how the Euros go there is a consensus Slovakia need to renew after the tournament. The average age of the starting XI during the qualifying campaign was drifting towards 30, which made them the oldest team of all. The coach Francesco Calzona was a long-time collaborator and assistant of Sarri, and has tried to implement \u201cSarrismo\u201d with Slovakia. That has been his main advantage. Previously profiled as a \u201cdefensive expert\u201d, Calzona has introduced some new and interesting attacking patterns and reaching the Euros was a perfect response to all the criticism. \u201cFor a so-called assistant, he\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Stanislav Lobotka, Slovakia\u2019s defensive midfielder, said jokingly. In the spring, after the latest upheavals at Napoli, the Slovakian FA agreed that Calzona could take over as interim head coach at the Serie A club at the same time as preparing for the Euros. The icon Stanislav Lobotka is another person who had a hard job winning over Slovakia fans (there is a theme here). Three years ago his mere inclusion in the Euros squad was criticised as he was not in his form but now the Napoli midfielder is one of the best players in his position in Serie A. In 2022-23 he played a huge part in Napoli winning only their third Scudetto ever and he is as good at winning possession as creating chances, helping Slovakia break opposition lines. So good has his form been that he has been linked with a move to Barcelona or Real Madrid with his playing style similar to that of Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be compared to him but it has led to a lot of expectations and increased the pressure on me,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I\u2019m a different type of player.\u201d One to watch At the moment, the 26-year-old defender David Hancko is the team\u2019s most interesting player to watch. He is among the best centre-backs in the Eredivisie, where he helped Arne Slot\u2019s Feyenoord win the league in 2023. Interestingly, for the national team, he is normally used as a left wing-back where he has been very influential when it comes to chance creation. His versatility and ability in defence and attack has led to interest from Premier League clubs. In the past there has been talk of a move to West Ham or Aston Villa, but right now following Slot to Liverpool seems a natural fit. The maverick Tomas Suslov has been criticised by Calzona in the past. Suslov is well known for his confidence but it looks like he has taken the feedback on board and could be in contention for a starting place in Germany, especially after Robert Mak - another maverick - was left out of the squad. Suslov has had a good year at Verona after a turbulent exit from Groningen and his technical ability and unpredictability with the ball makes him an interesting choice for Slovakia\u2019s attack. Suslov has even started to track back. He is more consistent now and could become a player who has the capacity to shine on the big stage. The match against Ukraine will be special for him, as he has family there on his father\u2019s side. The spine Newcastle\u2019s Martin Dubravka is the undisputed No 1 goalkeeper, putting in reliable performances for the national team even if he has not been a regular at club level. Milan Skriniar leads the defence as a centre-back with the captain\u2019s armband, Kucka fills in the No 8 role alongside Lobotka and is a perfect \u201cbox-to-box midfielder\u201d with incredible fitness levels even at the age of 37. Duda bears most of the playmaking responsibilities and is a natural successor to Hamsik, but centre-forward is a problem position. Robert Bozenik seems to be the most likely choice. Probable starting XI Celebrity fan The Slovak rapper, Pil C, is expected to watch his country\u2019s games closely as he is a friend of Duda, and also rapped about Robert Vittek\u2019s famous four goals at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Slovakia\u2019s first appearance at a major tournament. \u201cI\u2019m in form like Robo Vittek at the World Cup,\u201d he rapped in the song One Shot. Slovakia\u2019s successful alpine ski racer, Petra Vlhova, is also a fan. Culinary delight When fans come to the stadium to watch a football game, their usual choice is a klobasa (sausage) with ketchup or mustard and a couple of slices of bread, as well as a pint of beer. It\u2019s also the most frequent post-game meal for players in the lower tiers of the Slovakian league. Slovakia team guide written by Lukas Vrablik for the Guardian Experts\u2019 Network"

            "content": "Families bereaved by the Grenfell Tower fire, the infected blood scandal and Covid-19 have called on the next prime minister to guarantee that potentially life-saving ideas that emerge from public inquiries and emergency planning exercises are acted upon. They want a new mechanism to increase public confidence that reports that cost hundreds of millions of pounds to produce won\u2019t gather dust and will instead be followed up. They will issue their joint demand together beneath the ruin of Grenfell Tower after joining hundreds of members of the west London community in a silent march on Friday evening to mark the seventh anniversary of the blaze that killed 72 people, including 18 children. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) and the charity Disability Rights UK have also said the government\u2019s failure to implement evacuation plans for vulnerable residents, one of the main recommendations from the 2019 first phase report of the Grenfell Tower inquiry, will mean \u201cdisabled people will continue to face unnecessary and avoidable danger and or death\u201d. With British public life hit by a wave of scandals \u2013 from the Post Office to Covid procurement \u2013 they are among groups concerned that more needs to be done to formalise how lessons are learned. Writing in the Guardian, Natasha Elcock, who escaped from the 13th floor and is chair of the families group Grenfell United, said: \u201cThe past seven years have shown us nothing but failure by those who should protect us. And these failures are not restricted to North Kensington. We have seen the same indifference to human life in the infected blood campaign, at Hillsborough and most recently during Covid.\u201d Last month detectives from the Metropolitan police told Grenfell survivors they must wait until at least 2027 \u2013 a decade after the blaze \u2013 before those suspected of being responsible for the disaster could face criminal trials. The demand for a new mechanism to safeguard change comes as: Fifty-eight people and 19 companies and organisations suspected by police of crimes related to Grenfell brace for the publication of the final public inquiry report into the disaster on 4 September. The Fire Brigades Union warned Keir Starmer that a Labour government must end the deregulation of building standards, which was a key cause of the Grenfell disaster, to ensure 1.5m new homes it has pledged over the next parliament are safe. The London Eye will be illuminated in green lights on Friday night in commemoration. Representatives for thousands of high-rise leaseholders said the pace of making existing homes affected by Grenfell-style fire defects remains \u201cshockingly slow \u2013 and at this rate, it could take decades\u201d. Architects and landscape designers have started putting together competing pitches for a permanent memorial on the site of the west London tower block that is expected to be partially or completely demolished. Details of a national oversight mechanism to monitor compliance with recommendations from inquests, public inquiries and official investigations have been drawn up by Inquest, a charity that provides expertise on state-related deaths and their investigation. Speaking before the Grenfell anniversary march, Jason Evans, the director of Factor 8, the infected blood scandal campaign, said public inquiries serve little point if we don\u2019t act on what they find and introducing a formal body to oversee inquiry recommendations would help instil public confidence. \u201cSir Brian Langstaff, who chairs the infected blood inquiry, has such little faith in government that he has refused to close the inquiry until the government responds to his recommendations,\u201d said Evans. \u201cThat alone shows you why proper oversight is needed.\u201d Lobby Akinnola, the spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said: \u201cI lost my father, Femi, to Covid in April 2020 as the country was caught unaware and unprepared for the pandemic but this needn\u2019t have been the case. \u201cThe government had carried out Exercise Cygnus and knew that the country\u2019s health system would collapse under the weight of an influenza-like pandemic. Yet the key learnings went unaddressed and over 200,000 lost their lives. Had something like the national oversight mechanism existed, ensuring the government implemented recommendations, my father may still be with me and, what is more, our NHS wouldn\u2019t be in the state it\u2019s in. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that this independent body is created so that the safety of the public is not left to political whims of those who happen to be in charge.\u201d"

We are grateful for this article, as we struggle to maintain a fading hope that the desperately needed support and treatment for long Covid patients is on its way. Rose Brown London \u2022 Sam Wollaston\u2019s first article in his Life with long Covid series brought me to tears. Being two years into long Covid I recognised so many of the experiences described but what moved me was Sam\u2019s brutally honest evocation of the scale of Lucy Keighley\u2019s loss. My tears were for her, for me and for the millions of sufferers worldwide. I want to thank Sam, Lucy and all of the other 950 contributors who informed this article. Together they have articulated the devastation that this chronic condition causes. Phil Turner Stroud, Gloucestershire \u2022 I just had to write and thank you for the article about long Covid. I am three years in to it, and relate to every word. It is such a relief to read someone who believes it exists. Linda Mills Rochdale, Greater Manchester \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "date": "2024-06-19T12:14:58Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak should not have their convictions removed for breaking Covid rules, Keir Starmer has said, amid calls from Conservative former cabinet ministers to nullify criminal convictions for Covid rule-breakers. Starmer said they should not have their convictions removed, though ex-ministers have made the case that 28,000 people who were given the convictions should have their slates wiped clean. The Labour leader said it was wrong for that to apply to the then prime minister and chancellor, who were fined amid the Partygate investigation when they attended a birthday gathering for Johnson. Starmer said: \u201cSeriously, they want Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak\u2019s convictions to be removed? Some great amnesty? Come on. \u201cMany, many people paid a very high price in that pandemic. They don\u2019t understand how deep that goes. The now prime minister and his predecessor but one are convicted of breaking the rules that they put in place and if they don\u2019t understand how deep that goes it just reinforces how out of touch they are.\u201d Robert Buckland, who was justice secretary during the pandemic, said it was unfair the convictions could bar people from jobs such as teaching, social work or police roles, especially given how young many offenders were. Guardian research last year found there had been more than 28,000 convictions for Covid-related offences, such as attendance at gatherings during lockdowns or arriving at airports without the proper evidence of a coronavirus test. Almost 16,000 of the convictions \u2013 or 55% \u2013 involved people under 30. Buckland told the Telegraph it was \u201cnot proportionate or necessary at a time when we want to encourage and support as many people back to work as possible\u201d, adding: \u201cI would wipe the slate clean.\u201d David Davis, another former cabinet minister, told the newspaper he believed also there should be an amnesty. \u201cMuch of the Covid regulation was heavy-handed, unnecessary and penalised people wrongly. For this to turn into a lifetime penalty is a shameful disgrace and we should correct it as soon as possible.\u201d The average fine issued in magistrates courts in 2022 was \u00a36,000, although some people have been fined as much as \u00a310,000. Nearly 125,000 fixed-penalty notices were issued in England and Wales during the pandemic, ranging from \u00a350, such as that received by Johnson for attending a party with 30 people while he was prime minister, to fines of \u00a310,000 given to others for similar offences. Those that were paid went no further."

            "date": "2024-06-02T07:00:25Z",
            "content": "When Ocado entered the FTSE 100 six years ago, it was seen as a flag-bearer for changing consumer tastes, as traditional retailer Marks &amp; Spencer narrowly avoided relegation from the top tier on the same day. This week, those roles look set to be reversed, with M&amp;S riding high and Ocado now expected to drop out of the index of the UK\u2019s top companies in the quarterly reshuffle, after its valuation plunged to about \u00a33bn from a high of \u00a322bn during the pandemic. What\u2019s more, its joint venture partner M&amp;S is part of the reason for the weakness in its share price. The pair are wrangling over a final payment for their UK-based grocery delivery tie-up, Ocado Retail, which was hoped to be worth more than \u00a3190m. M&amp;S says it should pay nothing because performance has been so poor. Ocado\u2019s feisty boss, Tim Steiner, has threatened legal action in response. The final call on Ocado\u2019s FTSE position will be made using market data on 4 June, but based on Friday\u2019s figures its share price would have to take a last-minute leap to avoid relegation. That seems unlikely amid uncertain sentiment that has led to a drop of about 50% so far this year, to 373p. Ocado is described by Dan Coatsworth at stockbroker AJ Bell as \u201cone of the most Marmite names on the UK stock market\u201d. When high streets were shut down as way to control Covid, Ocado enjoyed a boost from the shift to home deliveries \u2013 and convinced many that the change would be permanent. In the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, it emerged that people had quite missed visiting a shop for their groceries, with the UK\u2019s online orders shifting back to about 11% of the market, from a peak of 14% in 2021. Specialists in ultra-fast grocery delivery which enjoyed a private-equity-backed boom during lockdown, such as Getir and Gorillas, have rapidly folded in the UK, leaving the field largely to takeaway meal specialists such as Deliveroo and Just Eat \u2013 none of which appear to be making much profit. The trajectory of such groups does not fuel confidence in the future for Ocado\u2019s own fast-track service, Zoom, one of its hoped-for growth areas. Ocado made a pre-tax loss of \u00a3394m for the year to 3 December 2023; the previous year\u2019s loss had been \u00a3500m. In April, a fifth of shareholders lodged a protest vote against the group\u2019s plans for a \u00a314.8m pay package for Steiner. Meanwhile, Ocado\u2019s focus on robot-led warehouse technology has proved to be rather inflexible, such that the company was unable to fully capitalise on booming demand during the pandemic, or row back later without major financial pain. Big supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose have shut down at least some of their home-delivery warehouses, focusing instead on more cost-effective and flexible deliveries from stores. On the plus side, this year Ocado\u2019s retail venture with M&amp;S has stepped up sales growth. However, M&amp;S boss Stuart Machin has recently pointed out that Ocado\u2019s much-trumpeted Smart Platform technology upgrades \u2013 such as new software and robot picking arms to make deliveries more efficient \u2013 had been \u201cmuch delayed\u201d, possibly further cooling hopes for the group\u2019s efforts to sell its technology around the world. During the pandemic, Ocado\u2019s share price also took off as investors saw it as the UK\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley technology firms rather than simply an online grocer. It has undoubtedly won some major customers for its gadgetry, including Kroger in the US, Groupe Casino in France, Lotte in South Korea and Aeon in Japan, but investors had hoped for more. Critics, such as Shore Capital\u2019s Clive Black, note the millions spent on research and development in return for quite modest sales, while delays to key projects, such as a delivery centre for Coles in Australia, have hit confidence. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cDeals are not being signed as fast as investors were hoping for its future growth engine, Solutions. It charges third-party retailers to use Ocado\u2019s robotic systems. There\u2019s still big potential here, but timeframes of growth look more questionable and that\u2019s knocked the valuation.\u201d Ocado\u2019s expected exit from the FTSE 100 has only fuelled speculation that Ocado will look to list in the US instead of the UK. Steiner may encounter fewer complaints about multimillion-pound pay deals across the Atlantic but whether that will help find new fans of the group\u2019s robots remains in doubt."

            "date": "2024-06-13T15:00:26Z",
            "content": "Immunisation rates are lagging in Australia\u2019s most vulnerable populations \u2013 the very young and old \u2013 with experts blaming practical barriers as well as the misinformation and vaccine hesitancy that took off during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020 Australia achieved a record high rate of 95.09% five-year-olds fully immunised against infectious diseases, even surpassing the government\u2019s target of 95%, which provides \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Between the ages of two months and five years, Australian children are supposed to receive vaccines against viruses including hepatitis B, diphtheria, whooping cough, meningococcal, polio, mumps, measles and rubella. However, the latest government data shows Australian children have fallen below that target, with only 93.93% of five-year-olds who have had all vaccines recommended for their age, 91.24% of two-year-olds and 93.16% of one-year-olds. The government\u2019s data breaking down rates by primary health network also shows certain areas have consistently lower rates. New South Wales\u2019s north coast, Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast and country Western Australia\u2019s rates are all below 90% for one- and two-year-olds. Vaccination rates for five-year-olds in the Gold Coast and country WA were above 90%, but not among children of that age in NSW\u2019s north coast. For the coastal Richmond Valley area within the North Coast Primary Health Network, immunisation rates are below 80% in the youngest age groups. A new study of more than 3,000 Australian parents published in the Medical Journal of Australia found misinformation and vaccine hesitancy increased during the pandemic compared with the views of research participants in 2017. But it also noted that practical barriers, such as disruption to routine vaccination services, was also a factor in decreasing childhood vaccination rates. Vaccination rates are also lagging in older populations not up to date on Covid and flu boosters during a winter wave of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The most recent federal government data released in May shows only 40% of those over 75 are up to date in receiving their booster shot in the past six months, while only 25% of those aged 65-74 and only 4% of adults under 65 have received a booster shot in the past six months. Only 74% of aged care residents have received a booster dose since the beginning of last year. The government\u2019s advisory group for immunisation updated its guidelines in May recommending a booster dose every 12 months for Australians aged between 18 and 74, who are also eligible for a booster every six months, while those over 75 are recommended to receive a booster every six months. Prof Adrian Esterman, the chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, said Covid-19 has encouraged vaccine hesitancy. \u201cI think the general thrust of what we\u2019re seeing is that Covid has put a spanner in the works,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically made a lot of people scared of getting vaccinated \u2013 not only adults but of getting their kids vaccinated \u2013 because of all the hype about how dangerous vaccines are. \u201cThe actual number of severe adverse events is minuscule compared to the millions and millions of doses given out.\u201d Prof Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician, said the overall drop in vaccination rates among children was \u201cnot a lot but it\u2019s important\u201d. \u201cWe need to re-establish the strong trust we\u2019ve always had for a long time with the Australian public about the safety and effectiveness of vaccination in children and adults,\u201d he said. Prof Peter McIntyre, the head of women\u2019s and children\u2019s health at the University of Otago\u2019s school of medicine, and a former director of Australia\u2019s National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said he believed vaccine hesitancy due to the pandemic was part of the picture but should not be overstated. \u201cThe number of people who are not vaccinated because they are actively avoiding vaccine is still a small percentage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably only about 3% \u2013 maybe it\u2019s kicked up a little bit post-Covid.\u201d McIntyre said the most common reason people were not vaccinated and had not immunised their children was due to service barriers. He said there needed to be greater opportunities for accessing vaccination outside of appointments with GPs, who could often be difficult to get an appointment with, such as accessing vaccines through pharmacists or offering home-visit services. McIntyre said Australia should consider requiring children to be vaccinated to attend school or childcare, as occurs in the US. There were recommendations for schoolchildren in Australia to be vaccinated but it was not enforced, he said. Prof Julie Leask, a vaccine expert at the University of Sydney, said lagging vaccination rates were the result of issues including access to services and vaccine acceptance. Leask said the disparity in rates between areas often demonstrated inequity in access to services where there is more poverty and social exclusion. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big focus on vaccine refusal and misinformation as if there\u2019s this direct and linear impact,\u201d Leask said. \u201cPeople can reject vaccination because of negative experiences with healthcare and due to certain beliefs and values.\u201d"

            "title": "Bird flu pandemic risk rises as cow cases appear and officials warn of humans\u2019 role",
            "date": "2024-06-19T11:00:31Z",
            "content": "Bird flu cases among animals continue to rise as US officials warn about the role of humans in spreading the virus. There are now 102 herds in the US with H5N1 cases, though given the prevalence of inactivated virus in commercially available pasteurized milk, experts believe the true number may be even higher. Poultry operations have reported cases likely linked to dairy farms, indicating the virus may be spilling back from cows into birds. Nearly 97m domesticated birds in the US have been affected by the highly pathogenic influenza since 2022. Although officials believe this outbreak was originally sparked by a single introduction from migratory birds into cows \u2013 for instance, via feed contaminated by bird feces \u2013 late last year, genomic analyses now suggest it is being spread between animals and farms by human activity, according a report released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday. The report, which focused on cases in Michigan, found that transmission is likely happening when workers, cows, vehicles and equipment go to multiple farms. Among employees at dairies with outbreaks, one in five employees work at other dairies and 7% work on poultry operations as well. That\u2019s in addition to the veterinarians, nutritionists and haulers who regularly visit multiple farms. Three in five Michigan dairies with outbreaks use shared vehicles to transport cows, but only 12% clean the vehicles first. All but one of the affected dairies belong to the same milk co-ops. The results are in line with a second report also released by the USDA on Thursday, showing that about one-third of employees at US dairies with outbreaks also work on other farms with livestock \u2013 usually dairy farms, but sometimes swine and poultry. More than half of affected dairy farms across the US share trucks and trailers to transport cows, and more than half of those who share vehicles don\u2019t clean them first, the report said. \u201cBiosecurity is the key to prevention,\u201d Kammy Johnson, a veterinary epidemiologist with the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters on Thursday. That means decontaminating everything that goes from farm to farm \u2013 transportation, clothing, equipment \u2013 and reducing the chances of infected animals, or people, passing the virus onward. It\u2019s not clear if the outbreak is continuing to gain force, officials said, but they expect to find more cases in cows. And, as the virus evolves, it could become more of a threat to people, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Officials expect to see more bird flu cases among humans as the outbreak continues, the report said. \u201cThe more infections there are among cows, the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans,\u201d Dr Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s in 20% of our milk supply should be disturbing to everyone because that means it\u2019s gone around already,\u201d Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said last week. \u201cIf it starts to jump, that\u2019s when we really have to worry.\u201d Yet testing has lagged, in a situation reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic. The only authorized test for H5N1 among humans comes from the CDC, and it is only available to people who have symptoms and a history of close contact with infected animals or other people. So far, there have only been 45 tests performed this year. Yet there have been reports of workers with positive flu A tests that are not sequenced for H5N1, as well as potential missed cases, like the farm workers and a local maternity worker who reported flu-like symptoms near the first confirmed human case this year in Texas. Providers may now be reluctant to test for influenza even if a patient has respiratory symptoms, since the flu season has ended and thus insurance companies may not pay for the tests. The USDA requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state borders. The federal government does not have the authority to require testing of animals or people on a wide scale, which means these efforts largely fall to state and local entities. In Wisconsin, for instance, which has not yet announced any infections in cows, farmers are now required to test cows before taking them to fairs and exhibits. Cows have died in at least five states \u2013 South Dakota, Michigan, Colorado, Ohio and Texas \u2013 because they didn\u2019t recover or developed secondary infections after testing positive for H5N1. The majority of infected cows recover, but these deaths indicate the potential financial burden of an uncontrolled outbreak. Barn cats and mice have also tested positive for H5N1, raising concerns the animals could spread the virus in communities beyond the farms. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 June 2024. Barn cats and mice tested positive for H5N1, not H1N1 as an earlier version said."

            "title": "Prof Arturo Casadevall: \u2018It is hubris to think a fungal pandemic can\u2019t happen to us\u2019",
            "date": "2024-06-15T16:00:25Z",
            "content": "Arturo Casadevall is a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He has spent four decades investigating how fungi can both improve and devastate life as we know it. His new book, What If Fungi Win?, charts how we might overcome the rising threat. What first fascinated you about fungi? When I was in training as an infectious disease fellow [in the 1980s], Aids was the biggest problem we had. Patients were not dying of HIV infections [which attack the immune system, leaving it vulnerable to other diseases], they were dying of opportunistic infections \u2013 and these were often fungal. This was the first large-scale human fungal crisis in history. Once I began working on the medical side of fungi, I discovered the wonders of this kingdom. The award-winning series The Last of Us charts a world where a fungus triggers the apocalypse. Could that happen? Improbable, but not impossible. Right now, we don\u2019t know of any fungus that can turn a human into a zombie. But there\u2019s no question in my mind that we\u2019re likely to see dangerous new fungal pathogens emerge in time. In fact, we are already seeing it happen. So who knows? In your book, you describe the climate crisis as a major risk for fungi developing beyond our control. Why is that? Everything in our environment is being affected as temperatures rise; there\u2019s no reason to believe fungi will be an exception. As modern medicine paradoxically creates more people who are vulnerable to new fungal infections, there\u2019s increasing evidence that certain fungi have the potential to unleash new diseases that will harm many more humans in unprecedented ways. What would happen if fungi could adapt to higher temperatures? They would jump over our defences. Are we then going to see many more fungal diseases? That is the fear. Has this happened already? Candida auris was unknown to medicine until 2007 when it was recovered from the ear of an individual in Japan. And then a few years later, in 2010, 2011, 2012, it emerges independently on three continents [South America, Africa and the Indian subcontinent]. So we have a medical mystery. We have an organism that medicine didn\u2019t know anything about. One of the things that we have proposed is that this may have been the first fungus to breach our thermal barriers [most fungi cannot survive at 37C degrees, the body\u2019s internal temperature] after adapting to higher temperatures. It is likely the first example of a new fungal disease emerging from climate change. Can fungi be harnessed for good? Fungi are critical elements for life on Earth. They benefit us in foodstuffs \u2013 you can\u2019t have wine without fungi, you can\u2019t have fermentation without fungi. They are the source of groundbreaking medicines, such as penicillin and statins. Innovators are using fungi to make vegan leather car seats and construction materials. Others are using them to degrade the plastics that fill our landfills. Going forward, they may be sources of new materials, things that could make our everyday life better. Could they be used for more sinister ends? You always worry about engineering organisms for evil. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s being done by anybody. But certainly [for] a kingdom that is so large and so diverse and has so many powerful species, that has to be on the radar \u2013 that bad actors could use it in some way. They make powerful toxins, so they have been considered as agents for biological warfare. There are nefarious uses with fungi but, generally, the good and the potential good that they do far, far outweighs the negatives. How could they be used for biological warfare? Many of the fungi make spores, and the spores are designed to be carried in the wind. Generally when people make biological warfare, they have to change the organism so it can be dispersed by air. Well, the fungi come ready-made to be dispersed by air. Could they cause a pandemic? Humanity does not have experience with a fungal pandemic, but other species do. The amphibians are being decimated by a fungus that has spread to all the continents. So if a fungus can do that to amphibians that have been around for millions of years and which have good immune systems like we do, then I think it is hubris to think that something can\u2019t happen to us. We have a huge blind spot when it comes to the diseases and toxins fungi can wield. What are the biggest challenges in fighting back against fungi? Because fungi are our closest relatives, it\u2019s hard to find drugs that kill them and don\u2019t hurt us. Then there is the economic explanation. Many fungal diseases are not as common [as others], and if you\u2019re a pharmaceutical company and you\u2019re thinking about where to put your money, you often [make the decision] based on market size. Progress is being made, but we have a long way to go. In terms of your own research, what are you most excited about? It turns out that fungi, most of them, make melanin, the same melanin that we have in our skin. This melanin has a lot of properties that can be harnessed. For example, melanin is a natural shield for radiation. [It] is almost like science fiction, but we are working with Nasa collaborators on the idea that melanin from fungi can be used for shielding for spacecraft. I\u2019m also excited about some of the progress that we are making in understanding how fungi cause disease. If you understand the mechanisms, you may be able to interfere with them \u2013 and if you can interfere with them, you can help people. You\u2019ve spoken out about the rise of counterfeit research being driven by \u201cfraudulent data and sloppy science\u201d. How widespread is the problem? I\u2019ve been very worried for a long time that science is not working as well as it should. We have done studies showing that there was an epidemic of retractions. Why is that? Well, we found out that there was a significant amount of misconduct. That\u2019s totally intolerable. I look at this almost like an existential problem. If science doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s not going to give humanity the tools it needs. And if people lose confidence in us [scientists], they\u2019re going to cut the funding, and then it\u2019s all going to be a downward spiral. Less funding, less science, less solutions. The name of the book is What If Fungi Win?. What if they do win? I think they already won. And I think that if they win, we win.

            "date": "2024-06-18T14:07:27Z",
            "content": "World leaders are \u201cgambling with their children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s health and wellbeing\u201d by failing to prepare for a future pandemic, a new report warns. Amid surging cases of H5N1 bird flu in mammals, and an mpox outbreak in central Africa, two senior stateswomen have said the lack of preparation had left the world vulnerable to \u201cdevastation\u201d. Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia, were co-chairs of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, which was set up by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020. At a World Health Assembly in May 2021, the panel set out a series of recommendations to change how the world tackled pandemic threats and avoid mistakes made during the Covid-19 response. Today, they said that at the current rate of preparation, the world would probably be overwhelmed by any new pandemic threat. \u201cThis is not the time to gamble. Inaction is a dangerous political choice,\u201d they wrote in a new report, accusing leaders of shifting focus \u201cto more politically pressing issues\u201d. The three years since their first recommendations are \u201ca dangerously long time to leave gaping holes in the national, regional and international systems meant to protect 8 billion people\u201d, they said The H5N1 bird flu outbreak, which is affecting rising numbers of mammals including dairy cattle in the US, \u201cportends an influenza pandemic the world is nowhere near ready to manage\u201d, the report warned. Meanwhile, a new deadlier form of mpox has led to children dying in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there is little access to testing and no access to vaccines. \u201cThe worst could be around the corner \u2013 these should be seen as canaries in the mine,\u201d said Clark. \u201cWe need to be prepared for something that could happen at any time and re-energise leaders around getting the right arrangements in place globally and nationally.\u201d The report warns of a lack of efficient systems that low and middle-income countries can rely on for access to drugs and vaccines in the event of a new pandemic. Surveillance systems lack rigour, and there is \u201ca dangerous gap in trust between countries, within countries, and within communities\u201d. International finance is insufficient, and countries struggling with debt and high interest rates are not investing enough domestically. There has been some progress, the report notes, such as agreement earlier this month to amend International Health Regulations to improve the speed at which information is shared, and to formalise the definition of a pandemic emergency. However, Clark said those changes would need to be fully implemented, and called for more transparency on countries\u2019 levels of preparation, an independent monitoring body, and a formal group of world leaders working on pandemic prevention. Changes to the structure of the WHO might be needed, she suggested. She said: \u201cThe funds now available pale in comparison to the needs, and high-income countries are holding on too tightly to traditional charity-based approaches to equity. \u201cThe pandemic agreement is vital and must succeed but has yet to be agreed. In short, if there were a pandemic threat today \u2013 such as if H5N1 began to spread from person to person \u2013 the world would probably again be overwhelmed.\u201d \u201cThere were lessons to be learned from Ebola in West Africa,\u201d said Johnson Sirleaf. \u201cJust five years later, having not applied those lessons, there were lessons to be learned again from Covid. There is no need to keep learning. Instead of gambling, leaders can make practical decisions and apply those lessons.\u201d"

            "content": "In July 2021, Joe Biden rightly inveighed against social media companies failing to tackle vaccine disinformation: \u201cThey\u2019re killing people,\u201d the US president said. Despite their pledges to take action, lies and sensationalised accounts were still spreading on platforms. Most of those dying in the US were unvaccinated. An additional source of frustration for the US was the fact that Russia and China were encouraging mistrust of western vaccines, questioning their efficacy, exaggerating side-effects and sensationalising the deaths of people who had been inoculated. How, then, would the US describe the effects of its own disinformation at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic? A shocking new report has revealed that its military ran a secret campaign to discredit China\u2019s Sinovac vaccine with Filipinos \u2013 when nothing else was available to the Philippines. The Reuters investigation found that this spread to audiences in central Asia and the Middle East, with fake social media accounts not only questioning Sinovac\u2019s efficacy and safety but also claiming it used pork gelatine, to discourage Muslims from receiving it. In the case of the Philippines, the poor take-up of vaccines contributed to one of the highest death rates in the region. Undermining confidence in a specific vaccine can also contribute to broader vaccine hesitancy. The campaign, conducted via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (now X) and other platforms, was launched under the Trump administration despite the objections of multiple state department officials. The Biden administration ended it after the national security council was alerted to the issue in spring 2021. The drive seems to have been retaliation for Chinese claims \u2013 without any evidence \u2013 that Covid had been brought to Wuhan by a US soldier. It was also driven by military concerns that the Philippines was growing closer to Beijing. It is all the more disturbing because the US has seen what happens when it plays strategic games with vaccination. In 2011, in preparation for the assassination of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the CIA tried to confirm that it had located him by gathering the DNA of relatives through a staged hepatitis B vaccination campaign. The backlash was entirely predictable, especially in an area that had already seen claims that the west was using polio vaccines to sterilise Pakistani Muslim girls. NGOs were vilified and polio vaccinators were murdered. Polio resurged in Pakistan; Islamist militants in Nigeria killed vaccinators subsequently. The report said that the Pentagon has now rescinded parts of the 2019 order that allowed the military to sidestep the state department when running psychological operations. But while the prospect of a second Trump administration resuming such tactics is alarming, the attitude that bred them goes deeper. Reuters pointed to a strategy document from last year in which generals noted that the US could weaponise information, adding: \u201cDisinformation spread across social media, false narratives disguised as news, and similar subversive activities weaken societal trust by undermining the foundations of government.\u201d The US is right to challenge the Kremlin\u2019s troll farms, Beijing\u2019s propaganda and the irresponsibility of social media companies. But it\u2019s hard to take the moral high ground when you\u2019ve been pumping out lies. The repercussions in this case were particularly predictable, clear and horrifying. It was indefensible to pursue a project with such obvious potential to cause unnecessary deaths. It must not be repeated."

            "date": "2024-06-04T01:14:24Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s first personalised mRNA cancer vaccine for melanoma halves the risk of patients dying or the disease returning, according to trial results that doctors described as \u201cextremely impressive\u201d. Melanoma affects more than 150,000 people a year globally, according to 2020 figures from World Cancer Research Fund International. Patients who received the vaccine after having a stage 3 or 4 melanoma removed had a 49% lower risk of dying or the disease recurring after three years, data presented at the world\u2019s largest cancer conference showed. The NHS in the UK is among the organisations testing the jab. A primary investigator on the study, oncologist Prof Georgina Long, said the average risk of recurrence after surgery for the cohort of advanced cancer patients was 50%. \u201cAlthough we do need to look at the five and 10-year numbers, most of the risk of recurrence in this group occurs in that first two years,\u201d the 2024 Australian of the Year said. The 157 patients in the phase 2b trial had high-risk melanomas and either had the jab, developed by Moderna and Merck, alongside the immunotherapy Keytruda or were given only Keytruda. The vaccine and the Keytruda brought the risk of recurrence down to 25%, Long said. However, she cautioned the results were a \u201csignal\u201d with a larger trial needed to evaluate the true impact better. The 2.5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the jab in combination with Keytruda was 74.8%, compared with 55.6% for Keytruda alone, delegates at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago heard. \u201cWe are encouraged by the latest results,\u201d said Kyle Holen, Moderna\u2019s head of development, therapeutics and oncology. \u201cThese findings reinforce our commitment to advancing this innovative treatment.\u201d Iain Foulkes, the executive director of research and innovation at Cancer Research UK, said the results marked another milestone in \u201cthe exciting, developing landscape of cancer vaccine research\u201d. \u201cAfter three years of follow up, the data suggests that levels of cancer relapse did not increase in people with high-risk, advanced stage melanoma,\u201d he said. \u201cThe findings highlight the great promise of therapeutic cancer vaccines used in combination with powerful immunotherapies.\u201d Known as mRNA-4157 (V940), the jab is custom-built for each patient and tells their body to kill any remaining cancer cells and prevent the disease ever coming back. A sample of tumour is removed during the patient\u2019s surgery, followed by DNA sequencing and the use of artificial intelligence. The result is a custom-built anti-cancer jab specific to the patient\u2019s tumour. A second trial presented at ASCO, led by the University of Vienna, found cancer jabs can significantly improve survival for breast cancer patients after surgery. The study involved 400 patients with early stage breast cancer. Half were given a vaccine to stimulate their immune system before surgery. After seven years, 81% of patients who had the vaccine were still alive and free of breast cancer, compared with 65% of those who had received standard care. The lead author, Dr Christian Singer, said: \u201cThis is the first significant and profound long-term survival benefit of an anti-cancer vaccine in breast cancer patients reported to date.\u201d Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK\u2019s chief clinician, said the melanoma trial results were \u201cextremely impressive\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly exciting,\u201d Swanton said. \u201cThe new vaccine approach is another piece of the puzzle that will allow more patients to be cured, hopefully, or fewer patients to suffer disease relapse. Ultimately it will contribute to survival rates improving continually over the next decades and more.\u201d Thousands of patients in England are being fast-tracked into groundbreaking trials of personalised cancer vaccines in a revolutionary world-first NHS \u201cmatchmaking\u201d scheme to save lives."

            "content": "A combined flu and coronavirus vaccine brings about a higher immune response to both diseases than when the vaccines are administered separately, a clinical trial has shown. Moderna, the biotech firm behind the Spikevax vaccine used in NHS booster programmes, is trialling a two-in-one jab that can also protect from the flu. Initial results have shown it may be better at protecting against them than what is now being used. The results showed that the antibody response in the participants brought about higher immune responses against flu and Covid-19 than when the vaccines were administered separately. The company said they hoped the vaccine would be made widely available as early as next year. The results came from a randomised controlled phase 3 trial of 8,000 people split into two groups. The first group were aged 65 and over, and were testing the new jab in comparison with the flu vaccine and the Spikevax jab, while the second group were adults aged 50 to 64. St\u00e9phane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, said: \u201cCombination vaccines have the potential to reduce the burden of respiratory viruses on health systems and pharmacies, as well as offer people more convenient vaccination options that could improve compliance and provide stronger protection from seasonal illnesses. He added: \u201cModerna is the only company with a positive phase 3 flu and Covid combination vaccine. Building on the momentum of positive phase 3 data across our respiratory portfolio, we continue to address significant unmet medical needs and advance public health.\u201d Earlier this year, Boots said the retailer would offer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to healthy customers in England aged 12 and over from next week, at a cost of \u00a398.95 a jab."

            "date": "2024-06-06T13:15:52Z",
            "content": "Three more babies have died from whooping cough this year as cases continue to rise across the country, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Since January, there have been 4,793 confirmed cases of whooping cough, with 181 babies under the age of three months diagnosed with the illness. A total of eight babies have now died from whooping cough this year. Pregnant women have been urged to get the whooping cough vaccine in order for their babies to be protected before they are old enough to receive the vaccine themselves. Babies can first be vaccinated against the disease when eight weeks old, while pregnant women are advised to get the vaccine at 16 and 32 weeks. Experts have said the true number of cases is likely to be higher, as mild cases can be misdiagnosed with other respiratory illnesses in the early stages when the infection can be tested for. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: \u201cOur thoughts and condolences are with those families who have so tragically lost their baby. \u201cWith whooping cough case numbers across the country continuing to rise and sadly the further infant deaths in April, we are again reminded how severe the illness can be for very young babies. \u201cPregnant women should have a whooping cough vaccine in every pregnancy, normally around the time of their mid-pregnancy scan (usually 20 weeks). This passes protection to their baby in the womb so that they are protected from birth in the first months of their life when they are most vulnerable and before they can receive their own vaccines. \u201cThe vaccine is crucial for pregnant women, to protect their babies from what can be a devastating illness.\u201d Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is caused by a bacterium that is transmitted by coughing, sneezing or sharing the same breathing space as an infected person. Early indications include mild, cold-like symptoms, a low fever and occasional coughing. These usually last for one to two weeks, after which the coughing fits begin. It has been described as a \u201ccyclical\u201d disease, meaning the number of cases peak every few years. Experts have also said there is reduced immunity against the disease in the general public due to the coronavirus pandemic. Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, said: \u201cWith cases of whooping cough continuing to rise sharply across the country, and today\u2019s figures from UKHSA sadly showing further infant deaths, it is vital that families come forward to get the protection they need. \u201cNHS teams are working hard to ensure local vaccination services are easily accessible for all through GP practices and some maternity services, and we urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated to help protect their babies in the first few weeks of their life \u2013 parents should also ensure that their children get protected in the first few months after birth as part of the routine NHS vaccine offer.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-13T15:00:26Z",
            "content": "Immunisation rates are lagging in Australia\u2019s most vulnerable populations \u2013 the very young and old \u2013 with experts blaming practical barriers as well as the misinformation and vaccine hesitancy that took off during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020 Australia achieved a record high rate of 95.09% five-year-olds fully immunised against infectious diseases, even surpassing the government\u2019s target of 95%, which provides \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Between the ages of two months and five years, Australian children are supposed to receive vaccines against viruses including hepatitis B, diphtheria, whooping cough, meningococcal, polio, mumps, measles and rubella. However, the latest government data shows Australian children have fallen below that target, with only 93.93% of five-year-olds who have had all vaccines recommended for their age, 91.24% of two-year-olds and 93.16% of one-year-olds. The government\u2019s data breaking down rates by primary health network also shows certain areas have consistently lower rates. New South Wales\u2019s north coast, Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast and country Western Australia\u2019s rates are all below 90% for one- and two-year-olds. Vaccination rates for five-year-olds in the Gold Coast and country WA were above 90%, but not among children of that age in NSW\u2019s north coast. For the coastal Richmond Valley area within the North Coast Primary Health Network, immunisation rates are below 80% in the youngest age groups. A new study of more than 3,000 Australian parents published in the Medical Journal of Australia found misinformation and vaccine hesitancy increased during the pandemic compared with the views of research participants in 2017. But it also noted that practical barriers, such as disruption to routine vaccination services, was also a factor in decreasing childhood vaccination rates. Vaccination rates are also lagging in older populations not up to date on Covid and flu boosters during a winter wave of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The most recent federal government data released in May shows only 40% of those over 75 are up to date in receiving their booster shot in the past six months, while only 25% of those aged 65-74 and only 4% of adults under 65 have received a booster shot in the past six months. Only 74% of aged care residents have received a booster dose since the beginning of last year. The government\u2019s advisory group for immunisation updated its guidelines in May recommending a booster dose every 12 months for Australians aged between 18 and 74, who are also eligible for a booster every six months, while those over 75 are recommended to receive a booster every six months. Prof Adrian Esterman, the chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, said Covid-19 has encouraged vaccine hesitancy. \u201cI think the general thrust of what we\u2019re seeing is that Covid has put a spanner in the works,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically made a lot of people scared of getting vaccinated \u2013 not only adults but of getting their kids vaccinated \u2013 because of all the hype about how dangerous vaccines are. \u201cThe actual number of severe adverse events is minuscule compared to the millions and millions of doses given out.\u201d Prof Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician, said the overall drop in vaccination rates among children was \u201cnot a lot but it\u2019s important\u201d. \u201cWe need to re-establish the strong trust we\u2019ve always had for a long time with the Australian public about the safety and effectiveness of vaccination in children and adults,\u201d he said. Prof Peter McIntyre, the head of women\u2019s and children\u2019s health at the University of Otago\u2019s school of medicine, and a former director of Australia\u2019s National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said he believed vaccine hesitancy due to the pandemic was part of the picture but should not be overstated. \u201cThe number of people who are not vaccinated because they are actively avoiding vaccine is still a small percentage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably only about 3% \u2013 maybe it\u2019s kicked up a little bit post-Covid.\u201d McIntyre said the most common reason people were not vaccinated and had not immunised their children was due to service barriers. He said there needed to be greater opportunities for accessing vaccination outside of appointments with GPs, who could often be difficult to get an appointment with, such as accessing vaccines through pharmacists or offering home-visit services. McIntyre said Australia should consider requiring children to be vaccinated to attend school or childcare, as occurs in the US. There were recommendations for schoolchildren in Australia to be vaccinated but it was not enforced, he said. Prof Julie Leask, a vaccine expert at the University of Sydney, said lagging vaccination rates were the result of issues including access to services and vaccine acceptance. Leask said the disparity in rates between areas often demonstrated inequity in access to services where there is more poverty and social exclusion. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big focus on vaccine refusal and misinformation as if there\u2019s this direct and linear impact,\u201d Leask said. \u201cPeople can reject vaccination because of negative experiences with healthcare and due to certain beliefs and values.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-14T13:21:12Z",
            "content": "Children\u2019s mental health and anxiety are the biggest drivers behind the sustained rise in school absences since the Covid pandemic, according to headteachers who said the government\u2019s plan to raise fines for parents in England would make no difference. Nearly nine out of 10 secondary school leaders \u2013 including attendance officers tasked with tackling absences \u2013 said there had been a marked increase in pupils missing school over the past two years because of mental health issues. Lorraine Yates, an assistant principal at the Astrea Academy Trust chain of schools in Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire, said children in years 9 and 10 faced the biggest challenges, \u201cas they are the cohort of young people that was most disrupted by Covid and that were impacted by Sure Start centres and children\u2019s centres being closed\u201d. \u201cThroughout their childhood up to the end of their statutory school age, they\u2019ve missed out on quite a bit. From what we\u2019re seeing in our academies, it has had an impact,\u201d she said. Elaine Harper, of the Leigh Academies Trust, which manages 31 schools in Kent, said: \u201cThere are far more absences related to mental health than anything else, like term-time holidays and the other typical causes of absences. \u201cOf course, over the last 18 months we have seen that the economic situation has compounded the absence problem.\u201d Last year, the Department for Education (DfE) classed 150,000 children at state schools in England as severely absent \u2013 missing more than half their sessions \u2013 150% higher than the 60,000 who were severely absent in 2018-19, before the pandemic. The findings in research shown to the Guardian by Bromcom, a management information system provider for schools, shows that schools are adapting to the surge in mental health concerns, with some rebranding the traditional medical or sickroom as an \u201cattendance support room\u201d, to help pupils back into lessons rather than sending them home. Using data from attendance software, some schools are monitoring which lessons and subjects cause particular pupils to feel uneasy, so staff can anticipate and encourage them back to class. The feedback from 500 schools found that parents had become \u201cunduly cautious\u201d in keeping their children off school, with some away for entire weeks instead of one or two days. \u201cSchools recognise that there will be genuine cases of pupils with anxiety, but they are not qualified to tell if it\u2019s genuine,\u201d the report noted. \u201cA parent asking for a GP appointment may get a telephone discussion if they are lucky; overstretched GPs themselves may then find it more expedient to offer a diagnosis of anxiety. Where parents struggle to get an appointment, they often simply keep their child off school.\u201d Janice Bowling, of the Greenshaw Learning Trust, a multi-academy trust with 30 schools in southern England, said there had also been an increase in parents willing to take term-time holidays: \u201cFollowing Covid, the strong partnership between home and school has deteriorated significantly. \u201c[Parents] will quite happily add four days on to a bank holiday and know that they\u2019re not going to get fined \u2026 Parents are honest now and many will openly admit they are willing to take the fight or put up with fines.\u201d However, more than three-quarters of school leaders said the DfE\u2019s plan to raise fines on parents for taking their child out of school \u2013 by \u00a320 to \u00a380 \u2013 was unlikely to have any impact. \u201cCoupled with the financial hardships families are facing, the fine is trivial in comparison to potential savings during lesspopular holiday time,\u201d the report said."

            "date": "2024-06-01T16:00:07Z",
            "content": "The number of patients stuck in NHS mental health units in England despite being clinically ready to leave has reached its highest level in at least eight years. \u201cDelayed discharges\u201d of patients from hospitals in NHS mental health trusts reached 49,677 days in March, according to an analysis \u2013 a higher figure than in any month since at least January 2016, when NHS Digital started publishing the data. Delayed discharges stood at 39,098 in April 2023, having risen from a pandemic low of under 17,000 in July 2020. Before the pandemic they ranged between 20,000 and 30,000 days a month. \u201cDelayed discharges\u201d are recorded when a patient is ready to leave hospital but is unable to for non-clinical reasons, leaving them in effect stranded. This can reduce the availability of beds for incoming patients. The figures show the number of days in which patients who were clinically ready to leave hospital were not discharged. If five patients each had their discharge delayed by 10 days, this would count as 50 days in the monthly figures. More than one in five delayed discharges in March were caused by patients having to wait for a care home place to become available, with a similar proportion caused by delays in finding supported housing. Other common factors include delays in providing non-hospital-based NHS care or social care in patients\u2019 own homes. The highest number of delayed discharges were recorded at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS trust, in London, and East London NHS foundation trust. Dr Lade Smith, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \u201cDelays to discharge are very often caused by a lack of social care and local authority provision in the community. Many patients with severe mental illness have unmet housing needs or financial worries that pre-date their admission to hospital, meaning additional support is needed before they can return home. \u201cMental health social care providers help reduce people\u2019s length of stay in hospital. They provide vital advice, community support and crisis services which also prevent people from needing to be admitted in the first place. The withdrawal of funding from social care and local authorities following the pandemic resulted in a sharp increase in the number of delayed discharges. \u201cAn additional \u00a3100m investment will be necessary to adequately address this issue.\u201d Mark Winstanley, chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: \u201cIt\u2019s deeply concerning that these figures show an increase in delayed discharge. Keeping people in hospital longer than necessary prevents them from rebuilding their lives and continuing their recovery. \u201cThe data reveals how a lack of resource in other parts of the system have a domino effect, with access to NHS community care, social care and supported housing among the key factors causing delays. \u201cPeople severely affected by mental illness often need continued support when they leave hospital, and this data suggests this support is patchy and in short supply. At a time when there is high demand for inpatient care for people in crisis and a shortage of available beds, this issue is placing huge pressure on inpatient services. The next government must fix our mental health system and ensure that the wider support people need is resourced to meet demand.\u201d Coroners have written to the Department of Health and Social Care warning of the impact of mental health bed shortages. In March, a coroner warned that 20 patients in Suffolk were stuck on a waiting list for an informal inpatient mental health bed, with none available elsewhere in the country, at the end of an inquest into a suicide that was directly attributed to a lack of mental health beds. An NHS England spokesperson said: \u201cWhile services are being expanded and transformed thanks to \u00a32.3bn NHS Long Term Plan funding, there is no doubt mental health services are under significant pressure. \u201cWe work closely with colleagues in social care and local government to tackle factors affecting delays, such as housing and care home placements.\u201d"

            "content": "New South Wales police have been urged to improve mandatory mental health training for officers and \u201cexplore\u201d becoming the second responders to these types of emergencies after a string of fatalities involving vulnerable people. A parliamentary inquiry into mental health care across NSW made the recommendations after finding police involvement in mental health crises could cause further distress and had been harmful in a \u201csignificant number of cases\u201d. Published on Tuesday, the committee\u2019s report noted that \u201crecent tragedies\u201d involving police responses had led to \u201cfear and reluctance\u201d for some people experiencing psychological distress to seek emergency care. Overall, the report said, mental health care in NSW had become \u201creactive and crisis-driven\u201d because it was \u201cchronically and severely\u201d underfunded and was failing carers, people seeking help and those working in the sector. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The report recommended the NSW government \u201cexplore innovative revenue streams\u201d to fund mental health services, however did not go as far as recommending the state implement a levy like Queensland and Victoria to help fund the system. The NSW government on Tuesday announced an extra $112m for community mental health supports and early intervention programs would be included in the state budget, which will be delivered later this month. Dr Evelyne Tadros, the Mental Health Coordinating Council\u2019s chief executive officer, said the government should make a \u201csignificant separate investment\u201d to respond to the inquiry. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t go anywhere near far enough to address any of the recommendations,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like business as usual.\u201d In response to criticism from the sector that the funding was not enough, the premier, Chris Minns, said he understood the concerns but the government was \u201cdoing everything we can\u201d. The inquiry held hearings across the state at a time when the police\u2019s handling of mental health emergencies was under scrutiny after officers fatally wounded or shot four people experiencing mental health crises between May and September last year. NSW police have attended 94,946 mental health incidents since 2019 and the number has increased every year. Guardian Australia previously revealed that 52 people experiencing mental distress died in interactions with NSW police from 2019 to 2023. Despite this, police cadets undergo just 18 hours of mental health training, with nothing further required after they become sworn officers. The premier on Tuesday refused to commit extra funds for training police in mental health even though he said it was unavoidable that officers sometimes had to respond to people in psychological distress. \u201cIn the middle of the night, the only things that are still operating [are] NSW police and emergency departments and major public hospitals,\u201d Minns said. \u201cAs a result, oftentimes people that are in a desperate situation either interact with NSW police or one of our emergency departments.\u201d Five of the inquiry\u2019s 39 recommendations were focused on improving police responses, including that the government \u201ccontinue to explore\u201d a health-led response to mental health emergencies. A potential new model should be informed by the \u201csuccessful\u201d South Australian mental health co-responder program, the Western Sydney mental health acute assessment team and NSW\u2019s existing \u201cPacer\u201d system. The Greens MP Amanda Cohn, who chaired the inquiry, said the Labor MPs that dominated the committee had \u201cwatered down\u201d several of the recommendations so that the government only had to \u201cexplore\u201d changes rather than implement them. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty gutless move from the government,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cThis committee has just done the work of exploring and considering \u2026 we now need the government to actually get on with the job and actually implement and fund these changes.\u201d The government has three months to respond to the report. The inquiry also recommended the police publicly release their report from research they carried out last year into the United Kingdom\u2019s model as part of a review of the way NSW officers responded to mental health emergencies. Police said last year that two senior officers had been sent to London to study the \u201cRight Person, Right Care\u201d model, which has health workers rather than police attend mental health call-outs if there is no crime being committed and no risk to life. However, health experts in the UK have expressed concerns that mental health calls have gone unanswered under the new model, which has put lives at risk because health social care services have not been given the resources to plug the gap. The police minister, Yasmin Catley, said in February she had received NSW police\u2019s review and that it would be made public. Last month, she said it would be released \u201cshortly\u201d. Catley has been contacted for comment. Guardian Australia understands the report still needs to be considered by the NSW cabinet and the government is yet to decide on a timeframe in which to do so. Last year, the NSW mental health minister, Rose Jackson, promised to build on the findings of the internal police review to overhaul the system in 2024.

            "date": "2024-06-18T04:31:52Z",
            "content": "Consumer advocates are calling on the privacy regulator to investigate the \u201cUber of therapy\u201d platform BetterHelp as it expands in Australia, after a US ruling that the company shared customers\u2019 sensitive data to third parties. BetterHelp \u2013 known to many because it is the second-largest advertiser on podcasts in Australia \u2013 claims to offer affordable and flexible online therapy. But experts have warned the commercialisation of healthcare in Australia could compromise patient data and reduce the quality of care that therapists provide when acting as \u201cgig workers\u201d. The US Federal Trade Commission in 2023 required BetterHelp to pay US$7.8m to customers to settle charges it had shared customers\u2019 email addresses, IP addresses and answers to personal health questions with platforms including Facebook and Snapchat \u2013 despite promising to keep the data private. In a report published on Tuesday, the consumer advocacy group Choice said Australia lacked the regulations needed to cover online mental health platforms such as BetterHelp. The platform\u2019s growth coincides with increasing demand for mental health services. Choice found that BetterHelp had increased its advertising on social media and podcasts, including offering Australians a free session if they sign up in June. The platform has also done deals with Australian influencers and posted job ads on LinkedIn to recruit local counsellors, psychologists and social workers. Choice\u2019s consumer data advocate Kate Bower and the former privacy commissioner Malcolm Crompton said overseas wrongdoing by BetterHelp meant the Australian information commissioner should investigate whether the company had breached local privacy laws. \u201cAustralian consumers deserve to know what BetterHelp has been doing with their data here and we\u2019re urging the privacy commissioner to investigate any potential misuses,\u201d Bower said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup BetterHelp has changed how it tells users about its data-sharing practices after the FTC action. The company acknowledges in its lengthy privacy policy that it shares an encrypted version of a client\u2019s email address with advertising partners. That means if a BetterHelp customer uses the same email address when setting up a social media account, the latter knows whether the user has accessed the mental health service, Bower said. This helps BetterHelp target its advertising spend on social media because the social media platforms can advise what other users may have similar characteristics and therefore be more likely to purchase BetterHelp. Crompton told Choice he believed the data gathered and shared by BetterHelp with Facebook would be classified as \u201chealth information\u201d under Australian law and be considered \u201csensitive information\u201d under the Privacy Act. Dr Piers Gooding, a La Trobe University researcher on disability and health issues, said BetterHelp\u2019s model was the \u201cUber of therapy\u201d \u2013 it connected patients to therapists on demand. But, referring to the FTC\u2019s findings, Gooding said: \u201cWhen a company is seeking to expand its market reach at the cost of deceiving customers as an acceptable cost, then alarm bells should be going off.\u201d Gooding warned the platform could reduce pay to counsellors and reduce the quality of service over time to maximise profits \u2013 much like Uber put downward pressure on driver pay. BetterHelp charges a monthly upfront fee of A$90 to $120 a week allowing users to access one 30- or 45-minute live session with a therapist per week and messaging with their therapist. There is also a journal feature on the app, webinars on mental health topics and worksheets assigned by their therapist. Frances Carlton, a clinical counsellor in New South Wales, said she was paid US$145.22 ($219.91) for seven 45-minute sessions with clients on BetterHelp\u2019s platform. For therapists who work five hours or more in one week, BetterHelp pays US$35 an hour. The rate is US$40 an hour for those who work more than 10 hours, US$45 for over 15 hours and up to US$70 for 40 hours a week. Carlton said all seven of her sessions ran over 45 minutes but because the platform does not pay therapists overtime and deducts pay if a client logs online late, her weekly total came in under five hours so she was paid a US$30 hourly rate for her week\u2019s work. Carlton, who in her private practice charges $150 an hour for patients she usually sees on a fortnightly basis, said: \u201cFor four clients I got paid less than I would have done for seeing one client in my office.\u201d Carlton said therapists would need to see 48 clients in a week to work 40 hours. \u201cAs a clinician, there\u2019s no way you can give good service and good attention to clients with that volume of work.\u201d A 2021 survey by the Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia found most counselling and psychotherapy fees were between $100 and $160 an hour, while the Australian Association of Psychologists\u2019 recommended fee for a psychologist is $315 for a standard 40- to 60-minute consultation. Carly Dober, a psychologist and director of the association, said the recommended fee reflected the true cost of the psychologist providing the service, while BetterHelp\u2019s fees \u201cputs tremendous pressure on the person to put in long hours to earn a reasonable living\u201d. \u201cThis is what the gig economy looks like,\u201d Dober said. Carlton claimed that \u201cthe only clinicians who would sign up to BetterHelp and stay with them are newly graduated clinicians who can\u2019t get a job but need to get experience with clients\u201d. She argued they weren\u2019t necessarily best suited \u201cbecause they need to have regular supervision and run ideas past people\u201d. A spokesperson for BetterHelp said: \u201cWe value our therapists and understand the importance of fair compensation.\u201d The spokesperson said therapists were offered competitive compensation of up to A$137,410 a year based on 52 working weeks \u2013 but actual earnings varied due to conversion rates, caseload and client engagement on the platform. \u201cWe are confident in the quality and safety of our offerings.\u201d BetterHelp also said: \u201cPrivate information like members\u2019 names or clinical data from therapy sessions that BetterHelp members share with their therapists over text, phone or video call is never shared with a third party and never has been. \u201cFollowing the FTC settlement, we have implemented additional measures to enhance data privacy and provide clear information to our users about how their data is used,\u201d the spokesperson said. Its data-sharing practices complied with Australian legal standards and prioritised consumer privacy with an opt-out function, BetterHelp said. Dr Elizabeth Deveny, the chief executive of the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, said: \u201cThis push by an overseas mental health supplier I think provides us with another example of how the Australian healthcare system is continuing to be commercialised by private organisations. \u201cWe are really concerned by cases of illegal patient data sharing we have seen overseas. Patient data is sacred in Australia and must remain so,\u201d Deveny said. Guardian Australia has previously run ads from BetterHelp on its podcasts. Do you know more?

            "title": "London NHS hospitals revert to paper records after cyber-attack",
            "date": "2024-06-05T19:39:51Z",
            "content": "A cyber-attack thought to have been carried out by a Russian group has forced London NHS hospitals to resurrect long-discarded paper records systems in which porters hand-deliver blood test results because IT networks are disrupted. Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 trust (GSTT) has gone back to using paper, rather than computers, to receive the outcome of patients\u2019 blood tests. Synnovis, which analyses blood tests for GSTT, is still undertaking the work, despite being hit on Monday by a large-scale ransomware attack that has caused serious problems for the NHS. A GSTT clinical staff member said: \u201cSince the attack, Synnovis have had to print out the blood test results when they get them from their laboratories, which are on site at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas. \u201cPorters collect them and take them up to the ward where that patient is staying or [to the] relevant department which is in charge of their care. The doctors and nurses involved in their care then analyse them and decide on that person\u2019s treatment, depending on what the blood test shows. \u201cThis is happening because Synnovis\u2019s IT can\u2019t communicate with ours due to the cyber-attack. Usually blood test results are sent electronically, but that\u2019s not an option just now.\u201d The disclosure came as more details emerged about the impact of the latest hacking incident to hit the NHS, which Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, said had been perpetrated by Russian cybercriminals. The attack, thought to be by the Qilin gang, has forced seven London hospitals run by GSTT and King\u2019s College trust to cancel undisclosed numbers of operations, blood tests and blood transfusions and declare a \u201ccritical incident\u201d. Between them the trusts provide acute and various forms of specialist care for 2 million people across six boroughs in south-east London. The Guardian can reveal that \u2013 despite previous denials \u2013 the hack has also affected the South London and the Maudsley (Slam) trust, England\u2019s largest provider of mental health services. Prof Ian Abbs, GSTT\u2019s chief executive, said in a letter to trust staff on Tuesday evening that the \u201cvery significant incident\u201d was having \u201ca major impact on the delivery of services at our trust, King\u2019s [trust] and primary care services within south-east London\u201d. Dozens of GP surgeries across the region have also had their ability to request blood tests and receive the results affected, sources said. Abbs said that a wider range of services hasbeen affected beyond those which the NHS had acknowledged. \u201cIt is also affecting other hospital, community and mental health services across the region,\u201d he added, making a reference to the Slam trust. Martin said the attack on Synnovis had led to a \u201csevere reduction in capacity\u201d and was a \u201cvery, very serious incident\u201d. Russian-based cyber hackers have \u201cdone automotive companies, they\u2019ve attacked the Big Issue here in the UK, they\u2019ve attacked Australian courts. They\u2019re simply looking for money\u201d, he added. Meanwhile, a leading expert in IT security warned that the attack could mean blood test results which the NHS is using to guide patients\u2019 care have been \u201cmanipulated\u201d. John Clark, a professor of computer and information security at the University of Sheffield, said: \u201cPatient safety is of paramount concern and the accuracy of results is essential, so it is important to stress that unless it is known what has happened to the system, the accuracy of any stored data cannot be ensured. \u201cDetermining whether stored data has been manipulated may simply not be possible and tests may have to be rerun and results re-recorded.\u201d Hackers could also cause mayhem for NHS trusts by targeting their appointments booking systems, he warned. The outsourcing to companies of more and more functions previously undertaken by government departments and agencies has increased the latter\u2019s vulnerability to cyber-hacking, he said. \u201cMany services are outsourced by government agencies, including the NHS,\u201d Clark said. \u201cConnectivity with such external systems radically increases the number of entry points for attack on services provision and the systems that combine to provide them.\u201d A separate source confirmed to the Guardian that the Qilin group was the assailant. It is understood there is no indication of the attack having spread, despite Synnovis having contracts with other NHS trusts around the country. Martin said that the attack appeared to have been made as disruptive as possible in an attempt to secure a ransom. \u201cIt does look like a targeted operation, designed to hurt so they would have to pay up,\u201d he said. The tech company behind Synnovis, Munich-based Synlab, was hit by a ransomware attack in April from a different group \u2013 known as BlackBasta \u2013 and does not appear to have paid a ransom. Typically, ransomware gangs extract data from the victim\u2019s IT system and demand a payment for its return. Data from the hack of Synlab\u2019s Italian branch was published online in full last month, indicating that no ransom payment had been made. It is not illegal in the UK to pay ransomware gangs, although it is against the law to pay ransoms if the affected entity knows or suspects the proceeds will be used to fund terrorism. Martin said most ransomware gangs operate within Russia, albeit without direct influence from the Russian state. \u201cMost of these groups are Russian-hosted and tolerated, but not directed by the state. Russia is a giant safe haven for cybercrime,\u201d he said. Qilin is known as a ransomware-as-a-service group, meaning it hires out malware to fellow criminals in exchange for a cut of the proceeds and also vets who is targeted. Last year victims of ransomware attacks paid out a record $1.1bn to assailants, according to the cryptocurrency research firm Chainalysis, double the 2022 total. Ransomware gangs typically demand payment in cryptocurrency, which they find easier to move across international boundaries and can be less traceable if certain exchanges are used. The average ransomware payment over the past year has risen 500% to $2m (\u00a31.6m) according to Sophos, a British cybersecurity company."

            "date": "2024-06-19T04:00:26Z",
            "content": "Labour has challenged the Conservatives to match its commitment to strengthen the economic watchdog within the first 100 days of government. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has pledged to introduce legislation giving the Office for Budget Responsibility greater powers in Labour\u2019s first king\u2019s speech. Labour\u2019s planned law would empower the OBR to independently publish a forecast of any major fiscal event making significant tax and spending changes. The changes are intended to prevent a repeat of Liz Truss\u2019s catastrophic mini-budget, which was delivered without an OBR forecast, by preventing ministers from \u201cgagging\u201d the watchdog in future. Truss\u2019s mini-budget included \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts and caused a meltdown in the financial markets, including a collapse in the value of the pound. Reeves challenged Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, to match her commitment after the Guardian published a leaked recording where he said Truss\u2019s economic plans were a \u201cgood thing to aim for\u201d. Reeves told the Guardian: \u201cBritain is still paying the price of Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget that crashed the economy, put pensions in peril and sent mortgage bills soaring. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from Jeremy Hunt\u2019s comments that he has learnt absolutely nothing from that period and is instead pandering to the reckless voices in his party.\u201d Speaking ahead of this week\u2019s inflation figures and the Bank of England\u2019s decision on interest rates, Reeves promised: \u201cNever again can a prime minister or chancellor repeat the chaos we witnessed under Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng.\u201d She challenged Hunt to \u201cshow some courage\u201d and back Labour\u2019s plans, and warned that if he did not then he was \u201cconfirming that the biggest threat to the economy is five more years of the Conservatives\u201d. In leaked remarks to the Oxford University Conservatives on 9 May, Hunt can be heard saying, to some laughter, that Truss \u201cappointed me as chancellor \u2026 you know, I want to be respectful of that fact. But I think the issue with most of the policies wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t a good thing to aim for.\u201d He said Truss \u201cdidn\u2019t explain in that mini-budget how she was to fund [her tax cuts]. And so markets thought that we were just basically going to fund all these tax cuts by massively increasing borrowing. And they took fright.\u201d The chancellor said he hoped to \u201cbasically achieve some of the same things that she wanted to achieve. But I\u2019m doing it more gradually because I\u2019m demonstrating at every stage that this is consistent with keeping borrowing under control. So, it\u2019s taking longer to get there, but I think it\u2019s obviously in a way we can actually deliver it.\u201d Labour said Hunt\u2019s remarks showed that the Conservatives had an \u201caddiction to dangerous Trussonomics\u201d. A Conservative party spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ll take no lectures from the Labour party, given it was a Conservative government that created the OBR to stop Labour governments fiddling the figures and losing control of the public finances. The Labour party need to stop distracting the public from their \u00a32,094 tax bombshell on working people.\u201d The Conservatives have been criticised for claiming Labour\u2019s policies would result in a \u00a32,000 tax hike as the figure is based on assumptions by Tory special advisers. It came as political donation reports showed Hunt has received over \u00a314,000 for his constituency campaign from the hedge fund manager Andrew Law, who reportedly hosted Kwarteng, the chancellor under Truss, for a champagne reception on the day of the mini-budget. The Times reported in 2022 that Law is likely to have profited from shorting the pound in the run-up to the mini-budget, and that he hosted a reception with other financiers and Kwarteng at his west London home on the evening after it was delivered. Records released by the Electoral Commission this month state that Law, a Tory donor and financier who is worth \u00a3750m, has donated \u00a314,286 to Hunt\u2019s campaign in Godalming and Ash. He gave Hunt\u2019s local party donations of \u00a37,143 in October and again in January. Law previously donated to Hunt\u2019s old constituency South West Surrey. A Liberal Democrat source said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are on the up in Godalming and Ash. There\u2019s no doubt that Jeremy Hunt needs all the help he can get, but the chancellor should know better than to accept money potentially made by betting against our country.\u201d Law\u2019s hedge fund, Caxton Associates, was contacted for comment."

In a boost to the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, the 16 UK and internationally based economists said change was \u201cdesperately needed\u201d after the policy mistakes and failures of the past 14 years since the Conservatives took power. Reeves and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, have been accused by the Conservatives of having no plan for the economy but, in a letter to the Guardian, the economists say Labour offers a \u201ccredible alternative\u201d. The letter\u2019s signatories include the Nobel prize winners Joe Stiglitz, Sir Christopher Pissarides and Sir Angus Deaton, as well as Sir Charles Bean, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England. The economy has featured heavily in the election campaign, with Rishi Sunak saying the latest fall in the annual inflation rate to its 2% target showed that the UK had \u201cturned a corner\u201d. Labour has said \u201cTory chaos\u201d has been responsible for weak growth and higher taxes \u2013 a view that is shared by the group of economists. \u201cBritain has suffered a long period of economic stagnation over the last 14 years, with low growth in productivity, real wages and living standards,\u201d the letter says. \u201cNot only is this record poor by historical standards, but the UK has also underperformed compared to its international peers. We invest too little and too inefficiently \u2013 especially in skills, infrastructure and innovation.\u201d While Starmer and Reeves have been criticised by some on the left for a cautious approach that has seen them largely mirror Conservative tax, spending and borrowing plans, the letter identifies four areas where it says Labour would make a difference. A key problem, it says, has been the number of policy mistakes, U-turns and changes of leadership, which have helped create \u201chuge investment-sapping uncertainty\u201d. Since 2010, Britain has had five prime ministers and seven chancellors. The economists say structural reforms are needed to improve the UK\u2019s public infrastructure and housing, especially around the planning system, which Labour has pledged to speed up. They also support the party\u2019s commitment to improving the post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU and say fresh urgency is needed to speed up the transition to net zero and sustainable growth. Labour is committed to decarbonising the electricity supply by 2030 \u2013 which is considered to be an ambitious target by energy experts. \u201cChange is desperately needed\u201d, the letter says. \u201cContrary to what the government has been saying, we believe that Labour provides a credible economic alternative across all these dimensions, and that Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves offer a combination of stability and an ambitious set of reforms to help grow the economy.\u201d Among the other signatories to the letter are Richard Layard, the labour market expert and Labour peer; Prof Mariana Mazzucato, the founding director of the Institute for Innovation and Public Policy at University College London; and Prof David Blanchflower, a former interest-rate setter on the Bank of England\u2019s \u2019s monetary policy committee. Blanchflower told the Guardian it was welcome that Labour had the endorsement of economists and doubted whether the Conservatives could put together a similar list backing their economic strategy. \u201cThey would struggle to find anybody with any clout\u201d, he said. \u201cHow many Nobel prize winners support the Conservatives?\u201d Blanchflower also said it was important Reeves and Starmer had a firm plan if they win the election on 4 July. \u201cThey are going to be elected, so what are they going to do then?

            "date": "2024-06-12T06:00:18Z",
            "content": "A failure to invest in the UK\u2019s main regional cities has held back economic growth and meant standards of living lag behind the US, France and Germany, according to a report before the 50th G7 summit in southern Italy this week. The Centre for Cities thinktank said the major difference between the UK and its main rivals was the low level of productivity in cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Sheffield and Nottingham. It said the higher level of productivity \u2013 measured by the output of each worker per hour \u2013 could be seen in cities outside Paris and Berlin of a similar size to their UK counterparts. The study found that investment was also spread more evenly across a wide range of US cities, which have performed well after benefiting from local financial support and, more recently, the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act, which offer more than \u00a3800bn worth of subsidies over 10 years. Lyon and Frankfurt were ranked more highly than Birmingham and Manchester and made the difference between the UK being the top-ranked G7 economy behind the US and remaining a middle-ranking country. Canada, Italy and Japan were ranked lower than the UK, according to a measure of output per hour. In a report titled Climbing the Summit: Big Cities in the UK and G7, the thinktank said London was flagging as a consistent provider of income and wealth to the rest of the nation, leaving other cities even more exposed. It urged the next government to focus on a broader investment programme to help consolidate digital industries in regional cities. Andrew Carter, the thinktank\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe message for policymakers is to take note of why the US, France and Germany perform so much better than the UK. While not the exclusive reason, a major part of this is the success of their big cities. \u201cThe size of cities like Manchester and Birmingham means they should have an advantage in attracting cutting-edge businesses. This is exactly what cities like Chicago, Munich and Lyon do, offering access to skilled workers, high-quality office space and \u2018spillover\u2019 benefits from neighbouring firms.\u201d Carter said ministers should give cities the power to physically expand, allowing them to build attractive suburbs near public transport links. These areas could attract businesses and especially firms with high levels of pay that export their services, such as finance, graphic design, marketing, software and publishing. The report said \u201curban areas where more clustering of knowledge happens tend to be more productive\u201d. In 2022, a measure of G7 productivity as a proportion of annual national income ranked the UK as fourth behind the US, Germany and France. UK productivity was about 16% below the US and Germany. \u201cThere are 112 cities in the G7 the size of Nottingham or larger, but of the bottom twenty for productivity, seven are British. They are in effect the sick men of the G7, with the recent stuttering of London adding to the UK\u2019s woes,\u201d the report said. A ranking of cities with service industries that rely on staff with digital skills found the UK was the lowest of the G7. The G7 summit takes place in the city of Fasano from Thursday to Saturday. Last year Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, scrapped the northern leg of the HS2 high-speed rail project between Birmingham and Manchester in a move seen as a setback to efforts to level up the economic imbalance between the south-east of England and other parts of the UK. In a submission to parliament, the thinktank said: \u201cIf the goal is to improve the economic performance of the North then it will only be successful if HS2 is treated as a small part of a broader package of investment. \u201cThe focus should be on investment in the skills of local populations via FE [further education] colleges and spending on transport within cities.\u201d"

            "content": "Jeremy Hunt said Liz Truss\u2019s economic ambitions were a \u201cgood thing to aim for\u201d and her disastrous mini-budget hadn\u2019t left an impact on the economy, according to two leaked recordings obtained by the Guardian. The chancellor was recorded at a meeting of students when he said he was \u201ctrying to basically achieve some of the same things\u201d as the former prime minister, but that he was doing it \u201cmore gradually\u201d. In a sign of desperation the chancellor, who is fighting to hold on to his Surrey seat, separately told a local hustings event: \u201cI speak tonight as Jeremy Hunt\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not always going to take the government line.\u201d Hunt praised Truss for \u201caccepting the mistakes she\u2019d made with good grace\u201d and repeatedly refused to accept her plans had left a long-term impact on the economy. When pressed on whether he thought the country was currently battling negative effects, he said: \u201cNo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s had an effect. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the main cause.\u201d Labour said the remarks showed that the Conservatives had an \u201caddiction to dangerous Trussonomics\u201d. Hunt took over as chancellor after Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng in an attempt to save her premiership following the mini-budget, which proposed a \u00a345bn package of tax cuts, including the abolition of the top (45p) rate of income tax. He reversed a number of the key measures in the budget in order to stabilise the markets, leading to him being described as the country\u2019s de facto prime minister, and Truss was forced out 10 days later on 20 October 2022. His refusal to acknowledge the impact Truss\u2019s mini-budget made is in stark contrast to comments from Rishi Sunak. The prime minister has said that \u201ctwo years ago I wasn\u2019t afraid to repeatedly warn about what her economic policies would lead to\u201d. The Conservative manifesto offers another 2p off national insurance contributions (NICs), a gradual phasing out of self-employed NICs, a cut to stamp duty, higher thresholds for child benefit and a tax break for pensioners. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cThe Tories can pretend otherwise but this is who they are. When the door is closed and the cameras are off it all comes out \u2013 the same addiction to dangerous Trussonomics. \u201cLiz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget and unfunded tax cuts unleashed misery on millions by sending mortgage rates soaring. Now the chancellor admits he is trying to implement these policies by stealth, without the British public realising.\u201d Speaking at a meeting of the Oxford University Conservatives on 9 May, Hunt was asked about his own pledges on low tax made in his leadership campaign and Truss\u2019s claims to have been blocked by the civil service and other economic institutions, and whether he faced \u201cthe same kind of opposition\u201d. In a recording of the exchange, Hunt can be heard to say, to some laughter, that Truss \u201cappointed me as chancellor \u2026 you know, I want to be respectful of that fact. But I think the issue with most of the policies wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t a good thing to aim for\u201d. He said Truss \u201cdidn\u2019t explain in that mini-budget how she was to fund [her tax cuts]. And so markets thought that we were just basically going to fund all these tax cuts by massively increasing borrowing. And they took fright.\u201d The chancellor said he hoped to \u201cbasically achieve some of the same things that she wanted to achieve. But I\u2019m doing it more gradually because I\u2019m demonstrating at every stage that this is consistent with keeping borrowing under control. So, it\u2019s taking longer to get there, but I think it\u2019s obviously in a way we can actually deliver it.\u201d The recordings emerged as the chancellor came under fire for comments in a newsletter to constituents in which he wrote that tax cuts in the Conservative manifesto would be funded by savings from \u201can enormous back-to-work programme (which I announced in the autumn statement last year)\u201d. Labour said it showed the Conservatives were double-counting welfare cuts in order to fund tax cuts. The party intends to use this week\u2019s campaigning to put the spotlight on the Conservatives\u2019 economic record. During a visit to Southampton on Monday, Keir Starmer accused Hunt of making \u201ccompletely unfunded\u201d promises. He said: \u201cWhat has emerged this morning is truly extraordinary because what you\u2019ve got is no less than the chancellor admitting that the money that they were pretending was available in their manifesto for their desperate policies is in fact money that\u2019s already been accounted for. \u201cSo that means you\u2019ve got a manifesto from the Tories which isn\u2019t worth the paper on which it is written because it is completely unfunded. It is extraordinary \u2013 the fact that it has come from the chancellor I think makes it even more extraordinary. The money isn\u2019t there, that\u2019s the major problem.\u201d The Conservatives said the savings they intended to use to fund tax cuts would come from new policies. \u201cThe measures to achieve \u00a312bn in welfare savings had not been announced at the time of the last OBR forecast so the entire premise of his [Starmer\u2019s] latest press conference is redundant,\u201d a spokesperson said. Hunt, whose Godalming and Ash constituency is a target seat for the Liberal Democrats, also seemed to suggest at the hustings that HS2 shouldn\u2019t have been cancelled. Responding to a local Tory member who said scrapping HS2 \u201csends out the wrong signal\u201d, Hunt said: \u201cI think when parliament has decided democratically we\u2019re going to do these things and we pass an act of parliament we need to find a way of making them happen.\u201d A Conservative spokesperson said: \u201cThis is nonsense and takes the Chancellor\u2019s words out of context entirely. \u201cWe want to lower the tax burden and boost growth, and that\u2019s exactly what we have done with our fully-funded tax cuts and inflation returning to normal levels\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 June 2024. An earlier version said that, among the sweeping tax cuts proposed in Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s September 2022 budget was a \u201ccut to the top rate of income tax\u201d; in fact, the plan was to abolish the top (45p) rate. This has been corrected."

            "content": "France\u2019s stock market is heading for its biggest weekly fall in more than two years, amid fears that the country\u2019s far-right party could win the upcoming parliamentary elections. French bonds were also hammered this week, as analysts warned of the risk of a Liz Truss-style market panic following Emmanuel Macron\u2019s shock decision last Sunday to call snap national assembly elections. The CAC 40 index of the largest 40 stocks listed in Paris has had its worst week since March 2022. It fell by 2.7% on Friday, taking its losses for the week to over 6%. Friday\u2019s selloff came after France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned that the country could risk a financial crisis if either the far right or left won the coming parliamentary election, because of their heavy spending pledges. \u201cWhen I look at the far right, I see a programme that is made of lies,\u201d Le Maire told franceinfo radio. The far-right National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, has previously called for protectionist economic policies and proposed higher public spending, as well as lower VAT on fuel, electricity and gas. Le Maire also claimed that a new alliance of left-wing parties would cause \u201ceconomic collapse\u201d if it won power. France is aiming to bring down its budget deficit to 3% by 2027, to meet the maximum borrowing allowed under eurozone rules. Increased government spending, or tax cuts, could undermine that push. Asked whether the current political instability could lead to a financial crisis, Le Maire said \u201cyes\u201d. \u201cThis is because of the political programmes that are on the table with regard to the question if we will be able, yes or no, to keep financing this debt,\u201d he added. The gap between France and Germany\u2019s borrowing costs has widened to a seven-year high this week, as investors sold French bonds \u2013 pushing down prices, which lifted the yield, or interest rate, on the debt. This spread measures the premium that investors demand for lending to Paris, rather than the traditional safe haven of Berlin. The last time this gap was wider was in 2017, shortly before Macron defeated Le Pen in the presidential elections that year. A poll this week showed that National Rally was on track to win the snap election and claim a third of the vote, ahead of France\u2019s leftwing bloc, which is forecast to take 22%, and Macron\u2019s centrists with 19% of the vote. Heavy losses for centrist candidates would almost certainly spell the end of Macron\u2019s pro-growth reforms, warned Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. A hung parliament could lead to gridlock, he said. \u201cHowever, if Le Pen calls the shots in parliament and pursues major parts of her expensive fiscal and protectionist \u2018France first\u2019 agenda, the result could be a Liz Truss-style financial crisis. At the moment, we rate this as a serious risk, not as a forecast,\u201d Schmieding added. If National Rally won power in the French National Assembly, France would be in a \u201ccohabitation\u201d scenario; Macron would remain president and Jordan Bardella of National Rally would probably become prime minister."

            "title": "France now \u2018most unloved\u2019 European stock market; Le Pen victory would push up French debt, warns Goldman Sachs \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-06-18T14:26:27Z",
            "content": "Time to recap\u2026 France\u2019s stock market has become the least favourite in Europe, according to a poll of fund managers by Bank of America. Goldman Sachs has warned that a victory for Marine Le Pen\u2019s party in France\u2019s elections would trigger a surge in the national debt. HSBC\u2019s Swiss private bank failed to conduct proper checks on $300m worth of funds sent between Lebanon and Switzerland during a period of 13 years, Switzerland\u2019s banking regulator has said. The board of Hargreaves Lansdown is willing to back a takeover offer from a private equity consortium that would value the UK\u2019s largest investment site at \u00a35.4bn. US retail sales barely rose in May, suggesting that economic activity remained lackluster. HSBC has said the money laundering breaches raised by Swiss regulator FINMA today (see here) were \u201chistoric\u201d. The bank added: \u201cHSBC takes its anti-money laundering obligations very seriously including complying with all laws and regulations in every market we operate in.\u201d HSBC is planning to appeal the decision and so would not be commenting further. Investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown has received a new takeover proposal from a group of private equity buyers, worth \u00a35.4bn. This revised proposal follows three previous approaches in recent months from a consortium of CVC Advisers Limited, Nordic Capital and Platinum Ivy of Abu Dhabi. They are now proposing to pay 1,140p per Hargreaves Lansdown share in cash, up from the 985p/share offer which was rejected in April. Hargreaves Lansdown board says it is willing to recommend this new proposal unanimously to shareholders, if a firm offer is made, and will provide the consortium with access to carry out due diligence work. Shares in Hargreaves Lansdown have jumped 5%, to \u00a311.27. Goldman Sachs\u2019 warning that a far-right government could drive up France\u2019s national debt (see here) comes at a politically sensitive time. Tomorrow, the European Commission is expected to name and shame EU members who have failed to keep to its budget rules, to aim for annual deficits of 3% and debt at 60% of GDP. France (which ran a deficit of 5.5% of GDP last year, and a debt of 110.6%) could easily fall foul of the excessive deficit procedure, which could potentially lead to a fine. France has long got away with breaching the eurozone\u2019s budget rules, granted a laxity that southern European members could only dream of. But with Marine Le Pen\u2019s party riding high in the polls, the European establishment may take a tougher line. As Politico puts it: After all, it\u2019s one thing to let off a pro-EU, statesmanlike leader for the type of reckless spending that endangers the economic stability of the eurozone. It\u2019s quite another if it\u2019s carried out brazenly by a nationalist firebrand who doesn\u2019t think the rules are worth the paper they\u2019re written on in the first place. \u201cIf an irresponsible [French spending] plan was put on the table, and the Commission said \u2018no problem,\u2019 then the whole fiscal framework is lost,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Brussels\u2019 influential think tank Bruegel, referring to the way the EU\u2019s executive arm gets to run the rule over governments\u2019 budgets. \u201cOther populist parties would forever disregard the rules.\u201d Wall Street isn\u2019t spooked by the weaker-than-expected US retail sales figures. Stock futures have moved a little higher, while the yield (or interest rate) on US government debt has fallen (showing that prices have risen). Poor economic news could be good for the markets, if it prompts the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates soon\u2026. Just in: US retail sales rose more slowly than forecast last month. Retail and food services sales across the US rose by 0.1% in May, following a downwardly revised 0.2% fall in April. On an annual basis, retail sales were 2.3% higher than in May 2023, a slowdown on the 2.7% rise recorded in April. This may indicate that demand across the US weakened last month, with consumers weighed down by high interest rates. Michael Brown, analyst at Pepperstone, says the report is a further sign that the \u2018US exceptionalism\u2019 narrative has likely run its course. \u201cThe May US retail sales report points to further signs of fatigue for the US consumer, with headline sales rising by a meagre 0.1% MoM, up from a downwardly revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\u201d France\u2019s national debt could surge higher if Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) party wins an absolute majority in the national assembly elections, Goldman Sachs has warned. Goldman predicts that, if in power, the far-right would deliver a sizeable fiscal expansion, sending France\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio up to 120% by 2027. That highlights why France has turned into the most unloved European equity market (see earlier post). In contrast, under\u201d \u201ca status quo electoral outcome\u201d, debt would stabilise at 113% of GDP in 2027, Goldman estimates. And if France is left with a hung parliament that does not allow any political group to pass meaningful tax or spending measures, debt could rise to 116% of GDP. Goldman points out that political groups have started to outline their economic policy platforms: On labour market reforms, both the left coalition and the far-right oppose the 2023 pension reform, which raised the retirement age. More recently, however, far-right leader Jordan Bardella stated that revisiting the pension system would not be a \u201cnear-term priority\u201d and rather would come at a \u201clater stage.\u201d On taxes, both the left coalition and the far-right support cutting VAT on energy and food, as well as re-introducing a wealth tax. At the same time, the current government and the centre-right have pledged not to increase taxes on corporates and households. France has made some progress in lowering its public debt in recent years; in 2023 it was 110.6% of GDP, according to statistics body INSEE, down from 114.9% in 2020. Goldman also warns that the current \u201congoing episode of political uncertainty\u201d could hurt the French fiscal outlook, if it leads to higher borrowing costs for Paris. French supermarket giant Carrefour is not sharing in today\u2019s stock market recovery. Shares in Carrefour have tumbled by over 7%, following reports that France\u2019s finance ministry has asked a court to fine the retailer over contracts with franchisee stores that it says were unbalanced in its favour. Carrefour contested the ministry\u2019s \u201cgrievances\u201d, saying it was intervening in a dispute that began several months ago without providing new information on the merits, and that it had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in its ability to demonstrate the validity of its contracts, Reuters reports. Despite falling in investors\u2019 affections, the French stock market is a little sttonger today. The CAC 40 index is 0.33% higher today, gaining 25 points to 7,596 points. Germany\u2019s DAX has gained 0.15% while the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 1%. Lee Hardman, senior FX strategist at MUFG, says: \u201cMarkets have been settling down after last week\u2019s moves in French government bonds and we have had some comments from [Marine] Le Pen saying she was respectful of institutions. Today\u2019s UK insolvency statistics also show there was surge in retail failures this spring. Wholesale and retail trade insolvencies increased by 27% month-on-month in April to 355, up from 280 in March, and were 30% higher than in April 2023. We learned a month ago that overall insolvencies rose by 17% in April, but today we have more details (as well as the top-line data for May). Gordon Thomson, restructuring partner at leading audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, says: \u201cThe tough trading environment for the retail sector continues to drag on, resulting in an increase in insolvencies in April. As retailers grapple with high costs, lacklustre consumer demand and too many April showers, they were also hit with an increase in national minimum wage which may have been the final straw for some. \u201cHowever, with inflation easing, real wages growing, and interest rates set to come down, this bodes well for consumer confidence and sets the stage for an increase in consumer spending in the second half of the year. For those retailers that have managed to weather the storm thus far, there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. Just in: HSBC\u2019s private bank has been blocked from taking on any politically exposed people as clients in Switzerland, after violating Swiss money laundering regulations. Swiss financial regulator FINMA has announced that HSBC \u201cseriously violated financial market law\u201d in its handling of high-risk business relationships with two politically exposed people. HSBC failed to carry out an adequate check of either the origins, purpose or background of the assets involved, FINMA says. The regulator explains: The transactions in question were carried out between 2002 and 2015 and amounted to a total of more than $300m. The funds, which originated from a government institution, were transferred from Lebanon to Switzerland and \u2013 generally after a short time \u2013 primarily flowed back to other accounts in Lebanon. FINMA says HSBC closed these business relationships in 2016, but did not file a report with the Money Laundering Reporting Office until 2020. FINMA has ordered HSBC to review its anti-money laundering aspects, adding: The bank may not enter into any new business relationships with politically exposed persons until such time as completion of the reviews has been confirmed by the audit agent. A strike at Dounreay nuclear power station has been postponed at the last minute, after workers were offered an improved pay deal. Around 600 workers, employed by Nuclear Restoration Services Limited (NRS), had been due to strike on Wednesday, in a pay dispute. The Unite union says the action has been suspended \u201cas a sign of good faith\u201d to allow workers to be balloted on a new pay offer. Staff had previously rejected a pay increase of 4.5% plus a one-off \u00a3500 payment, the union says. Unite adds that an overtime ban and an end to working voluntary appointments will continue during the ballot process. If the new offer is rejected by the membership, fresh strike action will be announced. Bank of America\u2019s survey was carried out between June 7 to June 13, which covered much of last week\u2019s stock market tumble in France. As Bloomberg reminds us: \u2026[last week] France\u2019s CAC 40 Index fell the most since in over two years and wiped out $258bn in market capitalization. Investors are anxious about the French national assembly elections because there is a high probability that no party will win an overall majority. Campaigning for the election began yesterday, when a poll of voting intentions showed that Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party currently has 33% support in the first round of the French legislative election, while an alliance of left-wing parties would get 28%. Analysts at UBS suggests there are four possible scenarios for how the elections could play out: Scenario 1: Rassemblement National (RN) with Absolute Majority. This would allow RN to appoint a prime minister and comfortably pass laws, though internal government dissension could pose challenges. The RN\u2019s policies focus on new spending for pensioners and household purchasing power, funded by controlling social spending linked to immigration. Scenario 2: RN with Relative Majority. RN could become the largest party but with less than 289 seats, leading to a complex cohabitation. With the president appointing a prime minister from RN. This scenario would likely result in political deadlock and limited policy changes. Scenario 3: Front Populaire with Relative Majority. The left-wing coalition could win a relative majority, leading to a similar cohabitation scenario with potential deadlock. Their manifesto includes undoing recent pension and unemployment reforms and increasing spending on pensions and purchasing power. Scenario 4: Renaissance 2.0. Macron\u2019s party could maintain a relative majority, continuing to face challenges in passing laws without forming alliances. Macron\u2019s policies would focus on household purchasing power and competitiveness, partially funded by labor reforms and localauthority savings. Bank of America\u2019s Fund Manager Survey also found that global investors remained bullish in June, although inflation remains a top worry. France has turned into the most unloved European equity market, as political uncertainty spooks investors, according to a regular poll from Bank of America. BofA\u2019s European Fund Manager Survey found that investors have grown gloomier about Europe\u2019s growth prospects, partly due to the looming French elections. A net 43% of respondents expect stronger European growth over the coming twelve months, down from 61% last month, which was the highest since July 2021. Enthusiasm has probably been tempered by \u201crising French political and economic policy uncertainty\u201d, BofA says, along with rising predictions that the US economy will slow and China\u2019s growth will soften. This gloominess has prompted a rotation into defensive stocks, and out of those which benefit from a cyclical upturn. BofA adds: France has turned into investors\u2019 most unloved European equity market, having been the most preferred last month, while Spain is the biggest favourite. Data from Bloomberg yesterday showed that London had regained its crown as Europe\u2019s biggest stock market from Paris. Overnight, US electric car maker Fisker filed for bankruptcy protection, and hopes to sell its assets, after struggling to challenge Tesla in the EV market. Fisker has filed for Chapter 11 protection in the District of Delaware, after failing to find a rescue, three months after suspending all manufacture of its electric vehicles. Fisker suffered a rapid cash burn as it tried to roll out its Ocean SUV cars in the US and Europe. A Fisker spokesperson says: \u201cFisker has made incredible progress since our founding, bringing the Ocean SUV to market twice as fast as expected in the auto industry and making good on our promises to deliver the most sustainable vehicle in the world. \u201cWe are proud of our achievements, and we have put thousands of Fisker Ocean SUVs in customers\u2019 hands in both North American and Europe. But like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently. After evaluating all options for our business, we determined that proceeding with a sale of our assets under Chapter 11 is the most viable path forward for the company.\u201d Fisker had tried to keep its costs down by using Austrian contract manufacturer, Magna Steyr, to build its car in Graz. The company was founded by Danish automotive designer Henrik Fisker, who had previously designed luxury cars for BMW, Ford, and Aston Martin, such as BMW\u2019s Z8 roadster and the Aston Martin DB9 and Vantage cars. Just in: We have confirmation that inflation across the eurozone accelerated last month. The euro area annual inflation rate was 2.6% in May 2024, up from 2.4% in April, statistics body Eurostat reports \u2013 confirming its flash estimate at the end of May. That takes inflation away from the 2% target set by the European Central Bank, which cut interest rates two weeks ago. Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, rose to 2.9% from 2.7% (which also matches the initial estimate). Investors are now pondering how soon the ECB might cut interest rates for a second time this year. Governing council member Boris Vujcic warned yesterday that an interest rate cut in September would require an improvement in the ECB\u2019s inflation outlook. Vujcic explained: \u201cIn order to do more, we need to see more. Any prolongation of the inflation conversion toward the medium-term target weakens the case for an interest-rate cut, and vice versa.\u201d David Hudson, restructuring advisory partner at FRP, warns that many firms are still in a \u201cperilous state of limbo\u201d, despite the slowdown in insolvencies last month: \u201cInsolvency levels appear to be stabilising, however many businesses still find themselves in a perilous state of limbo. Economic growth has stagnated after a positive couple of months while many investment decisions remain on pause as we await predicted interest rate cuts and the outcome of the general election \u2013 a particular risk in sectors like construction where purdah can stall planning decisions. In this environment, more will continue to falter, and we\u2019re anticipating seeing the profile of those exposed shifting to larger companies \u2013 the impact of which will be felt keenly across supply chains. The future of many will be dependent on a stronger second half to the year, with greater economic and political certainty stimulating demand as well as falling input costs.\u201d The number of UK individuals and businesses falling into insolvency has slowed, as pressures from rising costs ease. Official data shows that 9,266 individuals entered insolvency across England &amp; Wales in May, a 4% drop compared with April (but also 3% more than a year ago). The Insolvency Service reports there were 604 bankruptcies, 3,716 debt relief orders (DROs) and 4,946 individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs). DROs are available to those on low incomes, and will freeze, then wipe out, existing debts up to \u00a330,000 on, for example, council tax, rent and energy bills. Their popularity has risen since a \u00a390 fee was scrapped. Company insolvencies fell by 6% in May, month-on-month, in England and Wales to 2,006, which is 21% lower than in May 2023. Benjamin Wiles, managing director at Kroll, says the pace of insolvencies seems to be easing: \u201cCompared to this time last year, we are seeing a pickup in business activity with key indicators showing improving consumer and business confidence. While I think it\u2019s fair to say that we aren\u2019t quite out of the woods, compared to twelve months ago when businesses were managing unpredictable cost inflation and energy bills, it does feel there\u2019s now a lot more certainty for companies to plan. Interestingly, businesses we speak to are also coming to terms with higher borrowing costs \u2013 though there is evidence that some lenders are extending finance rather than restructuring debt. \u201cCompany administrations that we track are up year-on-year, but it does seem the pace of insolvencies are easing. There are some sectors including manufacturing and media and tech, which are continuing to see big increases, but overall it\u2019s now a smaller trickle than a tidal wave.\u201d Iceland\u2019s chairman, Richard Walker, says Kantar are correct that the cost of living squeeze isn\u2019t over \u2013 before squeezing in a plug for his supermarket: Back in January, Walker (a former Conservative supporter) announced he was backing Labour, saying Keir Starmer understood how the cost of living crisis has put an \u201cunbearable strain\u201d on families. The chair of Toyota has been re-elected despite opposition from two prominent shareholder advisors amid a scandal over vehicle testing and falsified emissions data. Akio Toyoda, grandson of the Japanese carmaker\u2019s founder, is expected to have won a reduced share of votes at the annual shareholder meeting after ISS and Glass Lewis, two companies that recommend how investors should vote, advised a vote against him. The full results of the vote will not be known until Wednesday. The advisors\u2019 governance concerns centre on Toyota\u2019s Daihatsu subsidiary, which acknowledged problems with its crash safety testing last year. The company also admitted in 2022 that truckmaking subsidiary Hino falsified emissions data. The backing for Toyoda came after the company made strong profits. It has benefited from strong demand for hybrid electric cars, which combine a petrol engine with a battery. Some analysts are concerned that the company has been slower than rivals in Europe and particularly in China to adopt pure electric vehicle technology, but in the short term the hybrid strategy appears to have paid off in profits. The vote has also been closely watched by analysts who believe that Japan is starting a new era of more assertive shareholder activism, rather than a compliant investor base which was perceived as rarely challenging business leaders in the past. Guy Lawson-Johns, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, an investment platform, said: Most of the opposition to Toyoda is expected to have come from overseas investors, part of a broader wave of shareholder capitalism hitting Japan. Whitbread (who we covered in the introduction) are the top rise on the FTSE 100 share index in early trading. Whitbread\u2019s shares have jumped by 4.5%, as investors welcome the news that UK trading strengthened over the last quarter. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says: Well, grocery price inflation is not what it used to be, but it\u2019s still a surprise to see Kantar report that the supermarket sector saw only 1.0% sales growth in the latest 4 week period\u2026 Within the sector, Ocado was the fastest growing grocer for the fourth month in a row, increasing sales by 10.7% over the 12 weeks to 9 June. Tesco\u2019s sales were up 4.6% over the last 12 weeks, taking its market share to 27.7% \u2013 the highest market share since February 2022, while Sainsbury\u2019s market share rose to 15.2%. Discount retailer Lidl grew its market share to 8.1%, while rival Aldi has 10% of the market. Morrisons sales rose by 1.1%. giving a share of 8.7%, while Iceland\u2019s sales rose 4.4%, giving it 2.4% of the market. Kantar reports that take-home grocery sales rose by just 1.0% over the four weeks to 9 June 2024, which is the the slowest increase since June 2022. That\u2019s partly due to the slowdown in inflation (as prices rose at a slower rate), but also the poor weather in May and June. Kantar says the sixth wettest spring on record has hurt the grocery sector too, with much less demand for summer items such as suncream. Instead, we\u2019ve been buying more soup! Kantar\u2019s Fraser McKevitt explains: We\u2019re not yet reaching for those typical summertime products and are making some purchases you wouldn\u2019t expect in June. Consumers bought nearly 25% fewer suncare items this month compared with last year, while prepared salads dipped by 11%. On the other hand, warming fresh soup sales jumped by almost 24%. Kantar\u2019s grocery inflation data will tee up tomorrow\u2019s official UK inflation measure \u2013 due at 7am on Wednesday. City economists predict the UK consumer prices index could slow to 2%. That would mean inflation would, finally, be back to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, for the first time since July 2021. Newsflash: UK grocery inflation has fallen for the 16th month in a row. Data firm Kantar reports that supermarket prices are 2.1% higher than a year ago this month, a slowdown on the 2.4% annual rise recorded in early May. Kantar reports that prices are now falling in nearly one third of the grocery categories it tracks, such as toilet tissues, butter and milk. This slowdown in price rises should bring some relief to households, who were hit by grocery inflation of 17% in March 2023. But Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, warns that the squeeze on budgets isn\u2019t over. \u201cThe cost-of-living crisis isn\u2019t over \u2013 far from it. 22% of households say they\u2019re struggling, meaning that they aren\u2019t able to cover their expenses or are just making ends meet. \u201cHowever, there are positive signs that many of us no longer feel the need to restrict our spending quite so much, with lower inflation helping to ease the pressure on people\u2019s pockets.\u201d The Unite union has also supplied a report from an unnamed Whitbread worker, who says staff are worried about its plans for 1,500 job cuts. The anonymous Whitbread worker says: We are still only being drip fed information with little to no time to process or evaluate options. \u201cThe collective consultation process seems to have mostly dismissed any ideas put forward by our reps making everything look like it is just a tick box exercise to try and cover Whitbread against any legal backlash. \u201cI feel I can speak for quite a few people when I say we\u2019re all scared of what is coming. There are people out there not only losing their jobs but their homes too and there is little to no support from head office. We are now sat counting down the weeks wondering what will happen.\u201d Whitbread also owns several restaurant chains, including Beefeater, Brewers Fayre and Bar + Block. It reports today that its total food and beverage sales (which fell 1% year-on-year) were boosted by strong breakfast sales driven by high occupancy at its hotels. However, that was offset by softer trading in \u201ca number of our branded restaurants\u201d, Whitbread says (a sign that cash-strapped customers are cutting back on eating out, perhaps?). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The hotel sector can be a good gauge of economic confidence, tracking whether people are splashing out for trips away and if firms are stumping up for business trips. And this morning, Premier Inn owner Whitbread has reported that recent trading in the UK has been \u201cmore encouraging\u201d, as it prepares to face union anger over plans to cut 1,500 jobs. The company says it remains \u201cconfident in the full year outlook\u201d, after growing total sales by 1% to \u00a3739m, \u201cdriven by improved UK trading and continued progress in Germany\u201d. In its latest financial results, Whitbread reports that sales growth was flat (0%) in the UK for the 13 weeks to 30 May 2024, although it did grow by 15% in Germany (where trading had been weaker). That 0% figure, though, hides a pick-up after a weak start to the first quarter of Whitbread\u2019s financial year. The company told shareholders: Having been 1% behind last year in the first seven weeks, our trading performance strengthened during the remainder of the quarter and accommodation sales recovered to be in line with last year and up 55% versus FY20. But, on a like-for-like basis, accommodation sales shrank by 2%, along with a 1% drop in food &amp; beverage sales. Whitbread reports that midweek business demand and peak leisure demand both remain \u201crobust\u201d, however last-minute demand for weekend stays has been \u201cslightly softer\u201d, particularly in London. Perhaps the post-pandemic surge in trips away has faded? Back in April, Whitbread reported strong results for the last financial year, including a 13% rise in sales in the year to 29 February. Whitbread also says net inflation is now expected to be at the lower end of its guidance as a result of \u201cincreased cost efficiencies\u201d. The company, and its shareholders, will feel the wrath of the Unite union later today when they gather for its annual general meeting at its offices in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. Unite are planning a protest over Whitbread\u2019s plans, announced in April, to cut 1,500 jobs. The union says Whitbread have refused to consult with them, or answer basic questions on the redundancy process. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \u201cRarely is a company so shameless as to celebrate leaping profits and dividends by announcing mass job cuts. \u201cBut generating runaway profits while trampling workers is business as usual for Whitbread. This is a firm that refuses to pay the real living wage and does not even provide company sick pay for its underpaid and overworked staff. \u201cUnite will be holding the company to account for its disgraceful race to the bottom behaviour and offering full support to our members impacted by these cruel and unnecessary redundancy plans.\u201d The agenda 8am BST: Kantar\u2019s grocery price inflation 10am BST: Eurozone inflation rate for May (final estimate) 10am BST: ZEW index of German economic sentiment 1pm BST: Unite protest ahead of Whitbread\u2019s AGM 1.30pm BST: US retail sales for May 2.30pm BST: Whitbread\u2019s AGM begins"

            "date": "2024-06-18T20:25:49Z",
            "content": "Nvidia became the world\u2019s most valuable company on Tuesday, overtaking tech heavyweight Microsoft, as its chips continue to play a central role in a race to dominate the market for artificial intelligence. Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.5% to $135.58, lifting its market capitalization to $3.34tn, just days after overtaking the iPhone maker Apple to become the second most valuable company. Nvidia\u2019s rise has taken it from a company best known for producing video game chips into a global powerhouse. Its profits have surged amid the tech industry\u2019s immense shift towards artificial intelligence, which has left major companies seeking out Nvidia\u2019s products to serve as a backbone of the technology. The company\u2019s growth has outpaced other household names in the tech industry including Google and Apple, and has fueled a wave of investment and market speculation. Nvidia\u2019s latest climb boosted Wall Street to a fresh record high. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3% to finish Tuesday at 5,487.03. The stock has surged about 180% so far this year, compared with a rise of about 19% in Microsoft shares, with demand for its top-of-the-line processors outpacing supply. Tech giants Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Google-owner Alphabet are racing to build out their AI-computing capabilities and dominate the emerging technology. The surge in shares pushed the stock to a record high, adding more than $103bn to Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization on Tuesday. Increasing the appeal for its highly valued stock among individual investors, Nvidia recently split its stock 10-for-one, effective 7 June. \u201cA stock split can reduce the price per share, making it more affordable for individual investors to buy. With Nvidia doing a 10-to-one stock split, retail investors are the real winners here,\u201d said Sam North, market analyst at investment platform eToro. Nvidia\u2019s chips power many of the AI industry\u2019s marquee tools, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT chatbot. The company\u2019s rising stock price and increased prominence within the industry have made its earnings reports and announcements into destination events for Silicon Valley investors. Increased demand for its chips has also made the price per unit rise to about $30,000 and seen the company\u2019s revenue surge. As Nvidia\u2019s power within tech has grown, it has also vaulted the 61-year-old CEO, Jensen Huang, into the same rarified position as other industry titans and made him one of the world\u2019s richest men. Over the past year-and-a-half, his net worth has increased a staggering $93bn, making him worth more than $100bn in total. The company\u2019s market value expanded from $1tn to $2tn in just nine months in February, while taking just over three months to hit $3tn in June. Reuters contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-06-07T20:10:58Z",
            "content": "\u201cCan y\u2019all hear me right now?\u201d Keith Gill began his broadcast. \u201cI kinda forget how to do this.\u201d Back in 2021, the influencer better known as Roaring Kitty led a crusade by retail traders which triggered the extraordinary surge in GameStop, an embattled video games chain \u2013 and left Wall Street scrambling. Gill became an internet star, and even testified to Congress about his bullish stance on the stock. Then he disappeared from view. For years after the turbulent stock market frenzy, Gill was silent online. Even as the story of his battle against the financial establishment was transformed into a Hollywood movie, he kept mum. A string of cryptic social media posts signaled last month that Roaring Kitty had awoken from his three-year nap, reigniting a volatile rally of GameStop shares. But they raised more questions than answers. When Gill resurfaced on YouTube on Friday, hundreds of thousands of viewers were waiting. Yet those who tuned in looking for clarity were in for a disappointing 50 minutes. Back in 2021, when shares in GameStop first soared, it was a loss-making enterprise, struggling to find its place in gaming\u2019s modern era. Three years later, it remained unprofitable in the first quarter, struggling to find its place in gaming\u2019s modern era. Its latest earnings, released shortly before Roaring Kitty went live, outlined a sharp drop in sales since the start of the year. GameStop also confirmed plans to sell up to 75m more shares, capitalizing on its stock\u2019s latest jump. \u201cThe Company will not be holding a conference call today,\u201d GameStop said in a brief press release, offering no explanation for its weak results. Its shares tanked by as much as a quarter, and trading was repeatedly halted. The retailer was unprepared to address the market, but one diehard believer was happy to oblige. Gill reappeared with his arm in a sling, a bandage on his head, plasters on his face and sunglasses. A life support machine could be heard in the background, before he pretended to die. \u201cOh shit, that was a close call,\u201d he laughed, thanking viewers for bringing him back to life. GameStop\u2019s share price, however \u2013 shown live in the background \u2013 was looking anything but healthy. Gill was keen to dispel the rumors. \u201cThis is me, by the way,\u201d he said, stressing that he was, indeed, in control of his trading and social media accounts, and not working with anyone else. So why the comeback? There\u2019s \u201cno real gameplan\u201d, clarified Gill, despite speculation he might provide new information to explain his confidence in a declining retailer. Instead, he rambled about movie memes, played with a Magic 8 Ball and thanked followers for their well-wishes ahead of his birthday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few years now. I hope you all are good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good to be back, y\u2019know?\u201d Far from revelation, Gill delivered a reiteration of his longstanding belief that GameStop\u2019s management would, one day, somehow, revitalize the chain. This is \u201cnot a guarantee\u201d, he added hastily, but the man leading the company, the billionaire entrepreneur Ryan Cohen, \u201cseems to be doing the right things\u201d. \u201cIn this case the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence,\u201d he insisted of GameStop\u2019s turnaround. As it became evident any significant news would be absent from his live stream, though, shares in the firm continued to sink. \u201cI\u2019m not saying any of the right things,\u201d he continued, as the stock drifted lower. \u201cI\u2019m saying the wrong things right now. Where\u2019s the eject button?\u201d After a while, he found it. \u201cCheers to y\u2019all for now,\u201d said Gill, chugging a beer before signing off. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens from here.\u201d Shares in GameStop closed down 39% on Friday. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2024 to clarify that a reference to Gamestop remaining unprofitable since 2021 was in relation to its first quarter performance."

            "date": "2024-06-18T13:40:57Z",
            "content": "Political ripples from the supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn a Trump White House-era ban on sales of \u201cbump stocks\u201d \u2013 a spring-loaded stock that uses recoil to in effect turn a semi-automatic firearm into a machine gun \u2013 continued to radiate on Monday when Jacky Rosen took exception to comments on the issue made by his Republican colleague JD Vance. Vance, the Ohio senator and potential vice-presidential pick as Trump seeks a second presidency in November had dismissed efforts by senior Democrats, including Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, to pass legislation banning the devices as \u201ca huge distraction\u201d. Vance went further. \u201cWhat is the real gun violence problem in this country, and are we legislating in a way that solves fake problems? Or solves real problems?\u201d Vance said, before adding: \u201cMy very strong suspicion is that the Schumer legislation is aimed at a PR problem, not something that\u2019s going to meaningfully reduce gun violence in this country.\u201d Rosen, the Democratic senator, hit back, facing re-election this year in politically purple Nevada, the site of the 2017 Las Vegas concert shooting that killed 58 and prompted Trump to ban the rapid-fire device. \u201cThis is not a fake problem,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cLet him come to Las Vegas. Let him see the memorial for those people who died. Let him talk to those families. It\u2019s not a fake problem. Those families are dead.\u201d Rosen said Las Vegas, the gambling mecca and major source of Nevada\u2019s revenue, had been \u201cchanged forever because of what the shooter did, and the bump stocks helped him\u201d. She invited Vance to visit memorials to the victims as well as to talk to first responders. \u201cShame on him,\u201d Rosen added, visibly enraged. \u201cShame on him for disrespecting the dead.\u201d In its ruling last week, the conservative majority on the supreme court ruled that the executive branch of government did not have the power to use existing firearms laws to prohibit bump stocks. But the justices allowed legislators to pass new laws banning the accessory. Schumer and other senior Democrats have since said they would quickly move to do so. Outcry from Democrats mounted after Vance reasoned that a bill to ban bump stocks would \u201cend up just inhibiting the rights of law-abiding Americans\u201d and mused about how many people would still have been killed if the heavily armed video poker player Stephen Paddock had not outfitted his armory with the contested devices. \u201cHow many people would have been shot alternatively? And you have to ask yourself the question: will anyone actually not choose a bump stock because Chuck Schumer passes a piece of legislation?\u201d Vance said. After Vance made his comments, Schumer retorted: \u201cTalk to the people in Las Vegas who lost loved ones.\u201d The supreme court ruling gives both sides of the gun issue red meat for the election campaign, though it is complicated by the initial ban coming from the Trump White House. Lindsey Graham, the Republican South Carolina senator, told NBC News he will block the Democrats\u2019 measure. And Vance questioned Democrats\u2019 legislative priorities. Chris Murphy, the Democratic Connecticut senator who has championed tougher gun laws after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012, said Republicans in his chamber should have no problem voting for the measure banning bump stocks. \u201cIs it good politics to make it easier for potential mass killers to get their hands on machine guns? Probably not,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe idea is to try to make this attractive to Republicans. And we would be a lot better off if psychopaths couldn\u2019t get their hands on machine guns.\u201d Between Friday \u2013 when the supreme court\u2019s ruling on bump stocks returned gun control to the top of the national discourse \u2013 and Monday, there were 17 mass shootings reported across the US, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Among those was a shooting Saturday in Rochester Hills, Michigan, in which nine people \u2013 including two children \u2013 were wounded at a city-run splash pad that families frequent to cool off in the summer. Police said the attack was carried out at random by a gunman who later died by suicide. Another shooting on Saturday in Round Rock, Texas, saw 14 people wounded and two killed. There, the shooting erupted after an altercation between two groups of people \u2013 the victims were uninvolved bystanders, police said. The non-partisan Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are wounded or killed. There have been at least 230 such shootings reported in the US so far this year, a high rate which has fueled public calls for more substantial gun control but which Congress for the most part has not heeded.

            "content": "Spending in shops and online bounced back strongly last month as better weather, falling inflation and rising consumer confidence boosted spending. The monthly update from the Office for National Statistics showed the volume of retail sales rose by 2.9% in May, after a weather-affected drop of 1.8% in April. The ONS said most retailers had a better month in May, with marked increases in the clothing and footwear and household goods sectors. Clothing sales rose by 5.4% as retailers managed to shift summer stock. Kathleen Brooks, a research director at XTB, said the strength of clothing sales might have been influenced by one-off events. \u201cCould this be the Taylor Swift effect, with people \u2013 including myself \u2013 splurging on new outfits ahead of her Eras tour, the UK leg of which is set to add \u00a31bn to the UK economy?\u201d The official data followed the release of the latest snapshot of consumer confidence from GfK showing sentiment standing at its highest level in two and a half years. Over the three months to May \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend in spending \u2013 retail sales rose by 1%. Even so, they remained 0.5% below the level immediately before the start of the Covid pandemic in February 2020. Retail sales account for less than half of total consumer spending and exclude categories such as car sales, eating out and hotel stays. The broader monthly health check on the economy by S&amp;P found the pace of growth eased in June after Rishi Sunak called a snap election. The S&amp;P purchasing managers\u2019 index showed activity was growing at its slowest pace in seven months, with the weakness concentrated in the service sector. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cFlash PMI survey data for June signal a slowing in the pace of economic growth, indicating that GDP is now growing at a sluggish quarterly rate of just over 0.1%. \u201cThe slowdown in part reflects uncertainty around the business environment in the lead-up to the general election, with many firms seeing a hiatus in decision-making pending clarity on various policies.\u201d The PMI composite output index fell from 53.0 in May to 51.7 in June. A reading above 50 indicates the economy is expanding rather than contracting. Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macro, said the fall in the PMI was an election-related blip. \u201cRetail sales rebounded strongly from April\u2019s rain-sodden disaster and will keep gaining ground as consumers\u2019 real wage growth drives higher spending. \u201cThe incessant rainfall didn\u2019t stop in May but precipitation was \u2018only\u2019 20% above average, compared to 68% above in April. May was also the warmest since at least 1884.\u201d Andrew Wishart, a senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the fact that online sales were up by 5.9% month on month suggested there was more to the May increase than simply better weather attracting shoppers back to high streets. \u201cOverall, the retail sales data for May showed tentative signs that strengthening real income growth now inflation is back at target is feeding through to stronger spending,\u201d Wishart said. Separate ONS figures highlighted the size of the fiscal challenge facing the next government, with the gap between public spending and tax receipts standing at \u00a315bn last month \u2013 \u00a3800m higher than a year earlier and the third highest for a May since modern records began in 1993. Spending last month was \u00a32.3bn higher than in May 2023, while a \u00a31.5bn increase in tax receipts was partly offset by weaker national insurance contributions after the cuts in the autumn statement and the budget. May\u2019s \u00a315bn borrowing figure was slightly lower than the \u00a315.7bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s spending watchdog. April\u2019s borrowing was revised down by \u00a32.1bn to \u00a318.4bn."

A number of fixed-rate savings bonds currently pay 5%-plus \u2013 on these accounts your return is guaranteed and you will be earning more than twice the current rate of inflation. However, with most analysts expecting the first Bank of England base rate cut in August or September, followed by several more over the next year or two, the rates available right now may not hang around for long, some commenters claim. Mark Hicks, a savings expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThis is a window of opportunity for savers, so now is the time to clamber in and grab a decent rate before it closes.\u201d Lucinda O\u2019Brien, of the comparison website money.co.uk, has a similar message: \u201cNow is the time to act, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Earlier this month it was announced that inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) fell to 2% in May. It\u2019s a far cry from the period in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was running at 10% to 11%, eating into the value of millions of people\u2019s nest-eggs. Many of the highest-paying savings accounts offering a rate of 5%-plus are fixed-rate deals where you have to tie your money up for 12 months. At the time of writing, a number of players were offering one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying 5.2% or more. These include the My Community Bank credit union and Union Bank of India (UK), both paying 5.22%; Vanquis Bank, offering 5.21%; and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.2%.

However, Sarah Coles, the head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that while you can earn the most interest with a one-year fixed-rate account, \u201cyou would need to track down another fix when it matured [and] there\u2019s a decent chance the rates on offer by then will be significantly lower\u201d. This is why two-year fixed savings bonds are looking attractive, she says. \u201cYou could consider tying up any cash you don\u2019t need for two years, and making the most of the great rates while they\u2019re around.\u201d On Thursday, the highest-paying two-year fixed-rate savings bonds were those offered by Vanquis Bank and Close Brothers Savings, paying 5.06% on minimum balances of \u00a31,000 and \u00a310,000 respectively. Other providers offering two-year fixed savings accounts boasting best-buy rates included Hodge Bank (4.97%), Market Harborough building society (4.95%), and Atom Bank (4.9%). The minimum deposits for these are \u00a31,000, \u00a310,000 and \u00a350 respectively. \u201cThis is a really sensible time to consider locking in a fixed rate,\u201d says Coles. She believes the Bank of England is not going to be in a hurry to cut rates, but they are likely to get progressively lower. \u201cBy the middle of next year [rates] are forecast to be 4.5%, and by the middle of 2026 they are expected to hit 4%.\u201d It is a good idea to review your savings rates anyway, if you have not done so during the past six to 12 months, says Rachel Springall, of the financial data provider Moneyfacts. Loyalty \u201cdoes not always pay\u201d, and the average easy-access account interest rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is 0.05% less than it was six months ago, based on a snapshot of rates on 19 June."

            "content": "Australia\u2019s monthly inflation rate increased to its highest level in 2024 in the latest indication that the Reserve Bank won\u2019t be cutting interest rates soon and might yet hike again. Consumer prices rose 4% last month from a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That compared with the 3.6% pace recorded for April, and the 3.8% rate expected for May by economists. The jump in May\u2019s inflation was propelled in part by automotive fuel prices, which were up 9.3% from a year earlier even as they retreated 5.1% during the month itself. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Electricity prices were also up 6.5% from a year ago, quickening from April\u2019s 4.2% pace. Without the federal and state rebates, power prices would have been 14.5% higher. Food presented a mixed price picture. Overall prices were up 3.3% from May 2023, a slowdown from April\u2019s 3.8% pace. Fruit and vegetable prices, though, climbed 4.4% compared with May 2023, continuing a recent rebound after prices posted a 1.2% drop in March. Housing costs were 5.2% higher than in May 2023, with rents up 7.4%, reflecting the low vacancy rates in many cities. Of particular concern will be the acceleration of the trimmed mean measure of inflation, which is what the RBA looks at more closely than the \u201cheadline\u201d CPI figure. That jumped to 4.4% from 4.1% in April and 4% in March. The monthly inflation figures are less complete than the quarterly ones, which won\u2019t land until 31 July. The RBA expects the quarterly inflation pace will accelerate to 3.8% in the April-June period from 3.6% in the March quarter. The monthly consumer price index peaked in December 2022 at 8.4%, a three-decade high, as post-Covid government stimulus combined with higher global energy prices in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Urkaine. The RBA has said it won\u2019t hesitate to raise its key interest rate \u2013 for a 14th time in this cycle \u2013 if it loses confidence that inflation can fall back within its 2%-3% target by the end of next year. The federal budget, released earlier this month, forecast price increases could slow to 3% or less by the end of 2024. It is banking on energy rebates and other measures to \u201cmechanically\u201d lower the CPI even as the stage-three cuts inject more than $20bn into the economy this coming financial year. The Australian dollar jumped about US0.2 cents to almost US66.7 in the wake of the inflation figures as investors shifted their bets about interest rates. Stocks also shed about 0.3 percentage points, before paring the losses to be down about 0.75% for the day. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said inflation was \u201chigher than we would like\u201d, and much lower than 6.1% when Labor took office in May 2022. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen around the world that inflation can zig and zag on its way down, it doesn\u2019t always moderate in a straight line and the last mile can be a bit harder,\u201d Chalmers said. His shadow counterpart Angus Taylor said the inflation outcome was \u201cshocking but not surprising\u201d. \u201cThis is what happens when you have a big spending Labor government that\u2019s completely out of touch with the economic reality,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now had four months in a row of accelerating core inflation. This will no doubt be of concern to the independent Reserve Bank.\u201d However, Steve Mickenbecker, an executive with Canstar, said the monthly inflation pop was \u201cstaggering\u201d, confirming that inflation was not on the downward trajectory sought by the RBA. The RBA will \u201csurely lift rates\u201d when its board meets in on 5-6 August because \u201cthe risk of baked-in inflationary expectations is too high\u201d, Mickenbecker said. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying news for borrowers with an increase of 0.25 [percentage point] adding $100 to the monthly repayment on a $600,000 loan over 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cEven without a rate increase, a three-month extension before a rate cut adds $288 in extra repayments to the same loan.\u201d David Bassanese, chief economist with Betashares, said the monthly CPI was a \u201cshocker\u201d that placed \u201chuge pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates in August\u201d. \u201cFor the RBA, the concern remains that the longer inflation stays high, the greater the risk of it becoming embedded into inflation expectations and ongoing wage and price setting behaviour \u2013 particularly given the economy, despite weak growth, is still operating at a high level of capacity,\u201d Bassanese said. Prior to today\u2019s figures all of the big four commercial banks \u2013 save ANZ \u2013 were forecasting the RBA would cut its cash rate in November. ANZ earlier this month broke ranks to predict the first rate cut wouldn\u2019t happen until February 2025."

Now we wait to see if unemployment also starts to falter and tips us over that edge. No, we are not in a recession, but cripes, the March quarter national accounts show an economy performing as badly as it can without actually being in recession. The 0.1% growth in the March quarter is essentially a rounding error away from going backwards. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup And things are no better if we look at annual growth. If we take out the pandemic period \u2013 when economic data really made no sense \u2013 the 1.1% annual growth of GDP is the slowest we have seen in Australia since March 1992. Take out population growth and we have now had five consecutive quarters of the economy going backwards. It\u2019s the first time that has happened since we started recording per capita growth back in 1973. That is not a record you want to be setting. In the past year the economy shrank 1.3% when you exclude population growth. The pandemic years aside, that is the worst growth since December 1991, when we were in the deepest of deep recessions: If the graph does not display click here So no, not good. Why are things so slow? Well, just take a peek at how much average interest repayments have gone up in the past two years: If the graph does not display click here The RBA has essentially done in two years what it took five years to do during the mining boom, when household incomes and wages were rising strongly. It has done this because the RBA believes that there is \u201cexcess demand\u201d in the economy. Clearly they have a different view of excess than the rest of us. The only reason really to even care about GDP as a measure is that there is a generally solid link between it and unemployment. As a rule we need the economy to grow about 2.75% a year to keep unemployment stable. If GDP grows by less than that, unemployment usually starts rising: If the graph does not display click here If there was no link between GDP growth and unemployment, then to be honest it would be a meaningless number we might as well ignore. The other important thing about GDP is that households make up a bit over half of it, so if GDP is struggling there\u2019s a good chance that people are, too \u2013 and right now the level of living standards of Australian households is back where it was a decade ago: If the graph does not display click here That is not a sign of health. And what has been the big driver of weak living standards? Well, did you remember my mentioning interest rate rises? If the graph does not display click here The increased cost of paying off home loans has had a major impact on people\u2019s living standards, but so too has weak wages growth. In the March quarter the average compensation for each employee rose 0.6% while the average cost of things we spend our money on (including bills) rose 1%. Not surprisingly what we\u2019re seeing is households spending very frugally. We never quite got back to spending as much as we likely would have were it not for the pandemic \u2013 but now the amount we\u2019re spending is increasing by less than it was before 2020: If the graph does not display click here In the year to March, household spending rose 1.3% \u2013 around half the pre-pandemic rate. And any growth was mostly on essential items. Spending on essentials rose 2.1% over the past year, while spending on discretionary items \u2013 those things you buy when you are feeling good \u2013 rose just 0.1%. That does not sound like excess demand to me, but apparently the RBA thinks it does. We aren\u2019t spending more because we have so much more income, rather that we are saving less. The household saving rate was as low as it has been since 2008: If the graph does not display click here It means overall households did not contribute much to the growth of the economy, but to be honest, no one was really contributing to the growth of the economy because there was hardly any! If the graph does not display click here If you squint you could say the buildup of inventories is a sign that businesses hope to be able to sell stock later, but more likely it is just replenishing the stocks they have run down over the past few months rather than a sign of hope and optimism. The cost of labour in real terms fell 0.7% in the March quarter to reinforce again that wages are not fueling inflation. The real cost of profits remains higher than it was before the pandemic, unlike labour costs: If the graph does not display click here The GDP figures show an economy that has been smashed by interest rate rises. The RBA believes we are too rich, too many of us are employed and we are spending too much money. The GDP figures, however, show our living standards are as bad as they have been for a decade, our wages are not keeping up with our costs, and we are barely increasing our spending on anything other than essential goods and services. The economy has been going backwards for more than a year, except for population growth. Take that away and it looks like a recession. The only reason we are not in one is because \u2013 thankfully \u2013 unemployment has not risen sharply yet. And let us hope that is not the next chapter of the RBA\u2019s sorry tale of how the economy should be managed. Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "content": "When he delivered his State of the Union address in March, Joe Biden framed the state of the American economy as a true success story, pointing to the historically low unemployment rate and falling inflation as signs of the country\u2019s robust recovery from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world,\u201d the US president said. \u201cAnd it takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it.\u201d As Biden frequently boasts, 15m jobs have been created since he took office, and the unemployment rate now stands at 4% after 41 consecutive months of job gains, following the longest stretch of sub-4% unemployment since the 1960s. Inflation has also cooled, after the annual consumer price index hit a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Stock markets have hit new highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average passing 40,000 points for the first time ever. The International Monetary Fund predicted last month that the US economy was on track to grow at double the rate of any other G7 nation this year. But so far, many Americans are not buying what Biden is selling. According to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian last month, 56% of Americans wrongly believe that the US economy is in a recession, even though the country\u2019s GDP has grown in recent months. Republicans were more likely to hold that belief, with 67% of them saying the economy is in a recession compared with 49% of Democrats and 53% of independents. The survey continued a trend of Republicans reporting higher levels of pessimism about the nation\u2019s finances since Biden took office. But the relationship between political identity and consumer sentiment has actually been documented for decades, intensifying alongside partisanship in recent years. This political bias offers a partial \u2013 although far from complete \u2013 explanation for Americans\u2019 persistently dour opinions of the nation\u2019s finances. In recent weeks, the Guardian has dispatched reporters to key swing counties in battleground states, and voters representing a wide array of political views expressed disappointment with the higher cost of living. As LeMario Brown, a former city council member in Fort Valley, Georgia, and local pecan farmer, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re Republican or Democrat, we all got to eat.\u201d With less than five months left before election day, Biden must find a way to break through the gloom and sell his vision of economic success. A partisan split The partisan skew in perceptions of the economy dates back at least to the Reagan administration, as the University of Michigan\u2019s national consumer confidence data shows. With a Republican in the White House, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say the economy is strong, and the same principle applies when a Democrat takes office. Though the correlation between political identity and consumer sentiment has long been recognized by economists, it appears to have grown stronger in recent years. One study from the University of Florida, based on decades of data from the Florida Consumer Attitude survey, found that state residents reported notably higher levels of consumer confidence after their preferred party regained control of the White House. In the fall of 2016, after Trump won the presidential race, Republicans started expressing much more optimism about their personal finances. \u201cOver time, [these shifts] have gotten bigger and bigger* \u2026 It\u2019s true that, somehow, this kind of partisanship has been increasing,\u201d said Hector Sandoval, director of the economic analysis program at the University of Florida\u2019s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Sandoval noted that, in 2016, the shift in sentiment can be observed in the immediate month after Trump won the election in November, even though he did not take office until January. \u201cThat\u2019s even kind of striking because nothing has really happened [by this time],\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cThe change in power isn\u2019t until the next year, in January. But already by then you see how the consumer sentiment is changing a lot.\u201d Although Democrats\u2019 consumer attitudes have also been found to vary depending on the national political environment, Sandoval\u2019s research found this shift to be particularly pronounced among Republicans, a finding that has been corroborated by other studies. Ryan Cummings, who previously worked for Biden\u2019s council of economic advisers, and Neale Mahoney, who served as an adviser to the Biden administration\u2019s national economic council, refer to this pattern as \u201casymmetric amplification\u201d. According to an analysis by Cummings and Mahoney, the magnitude of the partisan bias on consumer sentiment is roughly two and a half times larger for Republicans compared with Democrats. In a phone call, Mahoney, now an economics professor at Stanford University, summarized the finding by saying that Republicans \u201ccheer louder and boo harder\u201d when their party controls the White House. Cummings and Mahoney found that this asymmetric amplification accounts for roughly a third of the gap between predicted consumer sentiment, based on current economic conditions, and observed consumer sentiment. In the Harris poll, Republicans were indeed more likely to incorrectly say that the economy is in a recession, but notably, nearly half of Democrats believed the same. So even when accounting for partisan bias, about two-thirds of the consumer sentiment gap remains. That has left economists \u2013 and many frustrated members of Biden\u2019s team \u2013 searching for answers. Beyond the politics Potential explanations for consumers\u2019 lingering pessimism have abounded as election day nears. Greg Ip, a Wall Street Journal columnist, has attributed the pessimism to what he calls \u201creferred pain\u201d, meaning Americans are casting their broader doubts and fears about the state of the world on to the economy. \u201cJust as one part of your body can hurt because of injury to another, pessimism about the economy may reflect dissatisfaction with the country as a whole,\u201d Ip wrote in November. \u201cLately, there has been a lot to be dissatisfied about: intensifying political and cultural conflict and intolerance, the pandemic, the border, mass shootings, crime, war in Ukraine and now the war in the Middle East.\u201d Another explanation touches on the role of the media, with some experts arguing that coverage of the economy has become skewed toward bad news. One recent study from Ben Harris and Aaron Sojourner of the Brookings Institution concluded that \u201ceconomic news has become systemically more negative beginning in 2018, with the negative bias growing over the past three years\u201d. A third school of thought addresses the long-term pain and general psychology around inflation. Although the most recent CPI data found that prices rose by 3.4% over the past 12 months, prices have increased by roughly 20% since 2019. So even as the rate of inflation has fallen, Americans are still adjusting to the overall rise in the cost of living over the past few years. Prices also show no sign of significantly decreasing, a phenomenon known as deflation that is generally associated with times of severe economic distress. A separate analysis from Cummings and Mahoney found that \u201cthe impact of inflation on consumer sentiment fades out with a decay rate of about 50 percent per year,\u201d meaning it takes a few years for the sting of a high inflationary period to substantially dissipate. \u201cThe impact of inflation this year is half as big as the impact last year, which is half as big as the impact in the year beforehand, so it has a half-life of basically one year,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cBut it takes two to three years for most of the impact of inflation to no longer show up in an analysis which connects inflation to consumer sentiment.\u201d That lingering effect can dramatically alter views on the economy because, to put it bluntly, consumers really hate high inflation. Research by Stefanie Stantcheva, an economics professor at Harvard University, found that high inflation triggered feelings of anger, fear and injustice. Respondents expressed a widespread belief that their wages were not keeping pace with inflation, resulting in decreased buying power for their households. Respondents do report receiving wage increases as the inflation rate rose, but people tend to associate those raises with their own job performance or career progression, rather than the higher cost of living, so they often feel like inflation is robbing them of their hard-won earnings. Interestingly, people also tend to believe that the salaries of higher-income individuals are better able to keep up with inflation, amplifying feelings of unfairness. \u201cAs a result, when you ask people about the emotions that are triggered when they see prices rise, it\u2019s a lot of stress, fear, anger,\u201d Stantcheva said. \u201c[That anger] tends to be directed at businesses [and] quite a lot at the government.\u201d The way forward? Behind Americans\u2019 doubts about the health of the economy are statistics that go beyond jobs and inflation rates. Understanding those metrics could be key to moving beyond some of the partisan perspectives. Despite the overall economic improvement, persistently high interest rates have increased the cost of carrying debt, adding to the burden of credit card bills and auto loans. Credit card debt hit a record high of $1.1tn in the final quarter of 2023, although that figure slightly declined in the first quarter of this year. Mortgage rates have come down marginally since last fall, when they reached a 23-year high, but their elevation has added to Americans\u2019 existing concerns that the goal of homeownership has moved permanently out of reach. Underlying these statistics is the grim reality of how they disproportionately affect lower-income families. Stantcheva\u2019s study found that lower-income Americans report being most adversely affected by high inflation, with some saying they have even delayed buying essentials to cope with rising prices. Her work builds on existing research suggesting that, though high inflation is loathed by all, the burden of the rising cost of living is not equally shared. Stantcheva\u2019s research also offers some insight into Americans\u2019 thoughts on building a fairer economic system. Like other recent surveys, respondents displayed broad support for a number of policy proposals that might address some of those concerns, including raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest households. Biden has called for such changes to the tax code, although he has struggled to get them approved by Congress, and he has incorporated his support for tax reform into his campaign messaging. The messaging could help Biden bridge the divide between his story of economic success and the reality that many Americans are not yet feeling the benefit of the recovery. \u201cWe don\u2019t know each person\u2019s situation, and the statistics just don\u2019t capture this very well,\u201d Stantcheva said. \u201cSo I think these feelings should not be dismissed at all. They should be taken quite seriously.\u201d"

            "content": "The Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to keep rates steady reinforced that the economy at this moment remains one with both good and bad signs, and the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, is refreshingly upfront about the difficulties. Unsurprisingly, the RBA\u2019s call to keep rates unchanged was met by some in the media and conservative commentariat as a failure to be tough. Some would prefer the RBA to be less concerned about the risk of a recession or rising unemployment than getting inflation from 3.6% to below 3%. Such views are much easier to make when your own job is safe and your income is very comfortable. It is worth remembering that in the past two years the share of household income spent on mortgage repayments has risen by the amount it did in five years during the mining boom, and by more than occurred in the run-up to the 1990s recession: If the graph does not display click here And while we\u2019re not quite spending as great of a share of our income on repayments as we were in 2008, the cost of an average dwelling is now equivalent to 16.6 years\u2019 worth of the average household disposable income, compared to 12.3 years then and 9.5 years in 1989 when the cost of servicing a loan peaked before the recession: If the graph does not display click here So those wanting more pain are really talking about a historical level of hurt, even though inflation has come down at the same pace it has in other nations with higher rates such as the US and Canada. Fortunately, Bullock is rather more careful than are those blithely dismissing concerns of a recession. In her press conference, and the RBA\u2019s policy statement, Bullock noted that the \u201coutlook remains highly uncertain\u201d. One of the biggest reasons for this uncertainty is something that happened in the latest GDP figures. The RBA has been trying to work out why household spending was so bad. After all, unemployment was still around 4.0%, wage growth was at 4.1%, and finally real wages were rising. And yet household spending was utterly stuffed \u2013 growing a mere 0.1% over the year in 2023. Then, in the March GDP data, the Australia Bureau of Statistics revised the figures, in an attempt to get \u201cseasonally adjusted\u201d back to some sort of sense after the years of Covid insanity. And it now estimates that we spent more in 2023 than previously thought. Rather than just 0.1% annual growth last year, the ABS now estimates our spending increased by 1.0%. If the graph does not display click here Now that is still pathetic. As I noted earlier this month, most of the growth was on essential items. The figures in March were just bad rather than terrible. But the ABS also revised down how much we saved: If the graph does not display click here The household savings ratio in December was revised down from 3.2% to 1.6%. In dollar terms the changes look like this: If the graph does not display click here Household income was not revised by much, so all the changes were about what we were doing with our money \u2013 spending more and saving less, or in effect, saving less to spend more. The question is: what does this mean for inflation and interest rates? Bullock doesn\u2019t seem to be sure. And she was upfront about this. She told the media gathering on Tuesday that you can think about these changes \u201cin a couple of ways\u201d. The first way is the glass half-full view. People, she suggested, are \u201csaving less to support their consumption because they\u2019re very confident about the future\u201d. That is, we feel confident that our jobs are secure and that our wages will rise above inflation and so why save for a rainy day? Let\u2019s go spend! The other way is more of a glass half-empty view. In this view she suggested the figures show that \u201cpeople are really hurting and they\u2019re not saving as much, and they\u2019re really struggling to make ends meet, in which case that doesn\u2019t bode so well for consumption\u201d. If the glass half-full view is correct, then the coming stage-three tax cuts might add to the amount of spending in a manner that may cause inflation to rise. If the glass half-empty view is correct, then the stage-three tax cuts will lessen the struggle and have a negligible impact on inflation. For now, the market continues to believe that the next move is for a rate cut: If the graph does not display click here But the future here is uncertain and, while the media does like to suggest that uncertainty means a rate rise is more likely, the uncertainty also relates to the possible need for a rate cut. Bullock noted that the RBA is also focused on unemployment because \u201cpeople having jobs is critical to them being able to meet the challenges of the higher cost of living\u201d. She also said the bank still believes it is \u201con the narrow path\u201d to getting inflation down while keeping unemployment low and Australia out of a recession. But crucially she added that the path \u201cdoes appear to be getting a bit narrower\u201d. This certainly is worrying, but it is good to know that the RBA is much more concerned about the great cost of people losing their jobs than are those who blithely suggest rates need to be raised with little to no regard for the risks of a recession or the loss of jobs that would bring. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "content": "The UK economy flatlined in April, held back by wet weather, as the signs of a recovery from last year\u2019s recession began to fade. In a blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s hopes of signalling a strong bounceback before the general election on 4 July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said monthly growth stalled after a 0.4% increase in March. The economy was unable to maintain its momentum after being weighed down by the struggling retail sector, a downturn in manufacturing and a drop in construction output. The 0.0% growth figure matched the forecast by City economists, who blamed the month\u2019s heavy rains for difficulties faced by workers on building sites and the lack of shoppers on the high street. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the underlying weakness of the economy was revealed by figures that showed growth so far in 2024 had only recovered lost ground from the recession last year. \u201cRishi Sunak claims we have turned a corner, but the economy has stalled and there is no growth,\u201d she said. Sunak said in March that the economy was \u201cbouncing back\u201d from a downturn in 2023. Responding to Wednesday\u2019s figures, a spokesperson for the Conservative party said: \u201cThere is more to do, but the economy is turning a corner and inflation is back down to normal.\u201d Manufacturing output fell by 1.4% month on month in April, while construction activity was 1.4% lower and retailers lost 2% of their trade. These declines were balanced out by a 2% rise across the whole services sector, boosted by rises in IT and communication services, professional businesses (1.2%), and arts and entertainment (2.6%). The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, said the economy\u2019s stagnation was causing long-term harm to households\u2019 incomes. \u201cOur economy is slowing yet again,\u201d the TUC leader said. \u201cThis has been the worst government for growth in modern times \u2013 and working people have paid the price.\u201d He said analysis of official figures showed that annual growth had averaged 1.5% since 2010, the worst performance for a government since the great depression. Wages, after taking inflation into account, were worth less than 2008, Nowak added, and unemployment had risen at the fastest rate in the G7 this year. \u201cThe Conservatives can spin all they like. But the last 14 years have been dismal for growth and living standards.\u201d Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the economy could begin to grow again during the summer. \u201cDespite the stalling of the recovery in April, the dual drags on economic growth from higher interest rates and higher inflation will continue to fade throughout the year. That will generate a bit of an economic tailwind for the next government,\u201d he said. Separate surveys of private sector businesses show most areas of the economy have expanded month on month since the beginning of the year. Figures released last month showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to the end of March \u2013 the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021 \u2013 confirming the UK had officially exited recession after the economy contracted in the second half of last year. In the three months to the end of April growth was 0.7%, the same level forecast for the whole year by the International Monetary Fund in its biannual outlook in spring. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently downgraded its prediction for UK growth this year from 0.7% to 0.4%. The Paris-based organisation said longer-term issues faced by the UK, including a major skills shortage, high prices in the shops and elevated interest rates, accounted for the gloomy outlook. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said April\u2019s zero growth rate in national income, or gross domestic product (GDP), was unlikely to encourage the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its meeting later this month. \u201cDespite these disappointing GDP figures, a June interest rate cut looks improbable, with the Bank of England likely to be a little wary of shifting policy in the middle of a general election campaign,\u201d he said."

            "title": "What can lipstick and underwear sales tell us about the economy?",
            "date": "2024-06-30T11:00:20Z",
            "content": "Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you\u2019ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data \u2013 GDP, jobs, etc \u2013 and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I\u2019ve seen. Uniform patches One known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there\u2019s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world\u2019s largest makers of emblems and patches \u2013 privately held World Emblem \u2013 can\u2019t be easily obtained. But the company\u2019s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing it,\u201d says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe there would be.\u201d Men\u2019s underwear Ask any guy about underwear, and they\u2019ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we\u2019re buying the good material. When money\u2019s tight, we\u2019re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men\u2019s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some \u2013 including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan \u2013 think so. If you want to check out how the men\u2019s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. \u201cBottom\u201d line: men\u2019s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months. Lipstick For the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don\u2019t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that\u2019s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L\u2019Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year. Overseas freight World shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They\u2019re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times. Recreational vehicles If you\u2019ve never taken a trip in a recreational vehicle (RV), you\u2019re missing out. It\u2019s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs \u2013 a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how\u2019s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America\u2019s largest makers of these vehicles \u2013 Winnebago \u2013 not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company\u2019s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year. I\u2019m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men\u2019s underwear you can also track women\u2019s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it. Goofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I\u2019ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I\u2019ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick."

            "content": "Labour must combine tackling the climate crisis with pursuing social justice, if elected, to show that achieving net zero will not be done \u201con the backs of the poor\u201d, the UK\u2019s outgoing Green party MP has warned. Caroline Lucas, who has held the seat of Brighton Pavilion since 2010, said: \u201cThe biggest priority is to demonstrate that is not the case. We have to make sure that this is a strategy and a policy that is the opposite of being done on the backs of the poor.\u201d That should be achievable, she added, as social justice and shifting to a green economy go hand in hand. But if Labour takes power, as polls predict, the party must avoid mistakes that put costs on low-income families or that hurt people\u2019s jobs, she said. \u201cThe truth of it is that the policies that we need to get [greenhouse gas] emissions down are actually policies that will increase people\u2019s wellbeing in any case,\u201d she said. Home insulation was one example, where if a minimum energy efficiency standard were enforced on landlords then tenants would have warmer homes, less energy waste and lower emissions. \u201cAgain and again there are concrete examples of where green policy is actually social justice policy, it\u2019s one and the same thing. But that story doesn\u2019t get told nearly strongly enough.\u201d Lucas looked beyond the current election to the next, five years away, to warn that a resurgent Conservative or Reform party right wing would be planning to \u201cweaponise\u201d the climate crisis, and would seize on any missteps by Labour on the issue. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hope riding on what a new Labour government could do after 14 years of Tory chaos, and if they aren\u2019t seen to deliver something in that first term then I worry about what\u2019s going to happen during those next four or five years is that [Nigel] Farage and [Kemi] Badenoch and whoever else within the Tory right are going to be reorganising and getting ready for a comeback. And surely one of the things they\u2019re going to have on top of their list is going to be rolling back on net zero still further,\u201d she told the Guardian. Lucas warned that Labour was not putting enough money behind net zero to ensure that its ambition for a \u201cjust transition\u201d to a green economy could be met. Earlier this year, Keir Starmer scaled back a longstanding pledge to invest \u00a328bn a year in a \u201cgreen prosperity plan\u201d, roughly halving the money available, even though economists and industrial experts forecast that the original investment would be quickly paid back by supercharging economic growth. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t enough money on the table \u2013 for example, if there isn\u2019t a sufficiently well-resourced scrappage scheme [for people moving away from diesel cars] \u2013 it\u2019s easier for people to make the case that this policy is going to hurt those on lowest incomes,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless Labour is willing to get out of the straitjacket it has voluntarily and arbitrarily strapped itself into [on spending] then net zero will be one of those areas of policy that they\u2019re not going to be able to deliver on during their first term, and therefore the level of disillusionment, disengagement, disappointment is going to ratchet up.\u201d The Green party is planning to put candidates in all constituencies across the country, but targeting four key seats to win, as the first past the post system militates against them. Polling suggests the party could win two rural seats, while national polls, which usually downplay Green support, indicate they are likely to retain Lucas\u2019s old seat of Brighton Pavilion and gain Bristol Central, a constituency newly created by boundary changes. Lucas is enthusiastic about the impact of this potential quadrupling of Green MPs. \u201cThe thing that I found most stressful about being a Green MP over the past 14 years has been the fact that I can\u2019t be in more than one place at once,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the time there is so much to be done, and [so] the idea that the four of us at least could spread our voice and amplify our voice across so many more places at any given time within the parliamentary day is just so exciting. \u201cOne of the things we always say is that a Green in the room changes the nature of the debate because questions that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be asked are being asked.\u201d Lucas still strongly advocates a change to the UK\u2019s voting system to a form of proportional representation, as the Green party has never achieved more than a single seat in parliament despite having polled 866,000 votes at the last election. She dismissed fears that the Reform party, led by Farage, which has anti-net zero policies and whose chair, Richard Tice, has made many false statements about climate breakdown and net zero, would benefit from changing the system. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should skew your democratic system for fear of what it throws up. I am absolutely no fan of Nigel Farage, his politics are abhorrent to me, but I would far rather we address the symptoms that have given rise to his popularity, rather than trying to suppress things we don\u2019t like,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should have a fair voting system because that\u2019s the democratically right thing to do.\u201d Sian Berry will contest Lucas\u2019s old seat in Brighton. Lucas is leaving to become an end of life doula."

            "date": "2024-06-14T19:20:39Z",
            "content": "The US Department of Justice on Friday told the Republican House of Representatives speaker, Mike Johnson, that it would decline to pursue criminal contempt of Congress charges against the attorney general, Merrick Garland, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The Republican-controlled House had voted on Wednesday to hold Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio of Joe Biden\u2019s interview with the special counsel investigating his retention of classified documents after he was Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president. It was Republicans\u2019 latest and strongest rebuke of the justice department as partisan conflict over the rule of law animates the 2024 presidential campaign. The 216-207 vote fell along party lines, with Republicans coalescing behind the contempt effort despite reservations among some of the party\u2019s more centrist members. It was immediately predicted that the justice department would not pursue a prosecution. \u201cThis contempt resolution will do very little, other than smear the reputation of Merrick Garland, who will remain a good and decent public servant no matter what Republicans say about him today,\u201d Jerry Nadler, a New York congressman and the top Democrat on the judiciary committee, said during floor debate. Johnson said the House would go to court to enforce the subpoena against Garland, for access to Biden\u2019s special counsel audio interview. \u201cIt is sadly predictable that the Biden Administration\u2019s justice department will not prosecute Garland for defying congressional subpoenas even though the department aggressively prosecuted Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro for the same thing,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cThis is yet another example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration.\u201d Garland has defended the justice department, saying officials have gone to extraordinary lengths to provide information to the committees about the special counsel, Robert Hur, and the classified-documents investigation, including a transcript of Biden\u2019s interview with him. Hur did not recommend charges against Biden, but when he issued his report in early 2024 described the president as an elderly man with a poor memory, creating a storm in Washington. The role of the justice department in American political life has become a huge issue in the 2024 election, with Republicans making unfounded statements that it has been \u201cweaponized\u201d by Biden. In fact, the department has successfully prosecuted Biden\u2019s own son, Hunter Biden, on gun charges and it is the Republican challenger, Donald Trump, who has made repeated threats to come after his political enemies should he win November\u2019s presidential election. Before Garland, the last attorney general held in contempt was Republican Bill Barr in 2019. That was when the Democratically controlled House voted to issue a referral against Barr after he refused to turn over documents related to a special counsel investigation into Trump. Years before that under Barack Obama, the then attorney general Eric Holder was held in contempt related to the gun-running operation known as Operation Fast and Furious. In each of those instances, the justice department took no action against the attorney general."

            "date": "2024-06-25T06:31:24Z",
            "content": "Julian Assange has been released from a British prison and is expected to plead guilty to violating US espionage law, in a deal that would allow him to return home to his native Australia. Assange, 52, agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents, according to filings in the US district court for the Northern Mariana Islands. Wikileaks posted on social media a video of its founder boarding a flight at London\u2019s Stansted airport on Monday evening and Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese confirmed he had left the UK. The plane \u2013 chartered flight VJT199 \u2013 later landed in Bangkok for refuelling, officials at the Thai airport said. Assange is reportedly travelling to a hearing on the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, where he will be sentenced at 9am local time on Wednesday (11pm GMT on Tuesday). According to Albanese, he is being accompanied by Australia\u2019s high commissioner to the UK, Stephen Smith. \u201cRegardless of the views that people have about Julian Assange and his activities, the case has dragged on for too long, there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia,\u201d Albanese said on Tuesday. Under the deal, which must be approved by a judge, Assange is likely to be credited for the five years he has already served and face no new jail time. In a letter to a federal judge in the district court for the Northern Mariana Islands, a senior justice department official said that he was being sent to Saipan because of its \u201cproximity to the defendant\u2019s country of citizenship\u201d. The official added that once the sentencing hearing was completed, Assange was expected to travel on to Australia. WikiLeaks said on X that Assange had left Belmarsh prison on Monday morning, after 1,901 days of captivity there. He had spent the time, the organisation said, \u201cin a 2x3 metre cell, isolated 23 hours a day\u201d. Assange was set to be reunited with his wife, Stella, who confirmed on X that he was free. She thanked Assange\u2019s supporters, saying \u201cwords cannot express our immense gratitude\u201d. In the WikiLeaks video, Assange, looking healthy dressed in a shirt and jeans with his white hair cut short, is seen climbing the stairs into a plane. Assange\u2019s mother Christine welcomed the developments, saying \u201cI am grateful my son\u2019s ordeal is finally coming to an end.\u201d The plea agreement comes months after the US president, Joe Biden, said he was considering a request from Australia to drop the US push to prosecute Assange. WikiLeaks in 2010 released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington\u2019s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 the largest security breaches of their kind in US military history \u2013 along with swaths of diplomatic cables. Assange was indicted during the former president Donald Trump\u2019s administration over the release of documents, which were leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former US military intelligence analyst who was also prosecuted under the Espionage Act. Many press freedom advocates have argued that criminally charging Assange represents a threat to free speech. In a court document filed with the US district court for the Northern Mariana Islands ahead of Wednesday\u2019s sentencing, the US government laid out the details of the charge of conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defense information that lies at the heart of the plea deal. It accuses Assange of \u201cknowingly and unlawfully\u201d conspiring with the US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to \u201creceive and obtain documents, writings, and notes connected with the national defense \u2026 up to the SECRET level\u201d. As news of the plea deal spread on Monday night, there were widespread expressions of relief that Assange\u2019s years-long captivity appeared to be coming to an end. But there were also concerns that a conviction, even on a single count, could have a devastating and prolonged impact on investigative and national security journalism. Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University which defends press freedom, said that the plea deal averted the worst-case scenario of a full-on prosecution. \u201cBut this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day.\u201d Jaffer warned that the outcome could \u201ccast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world\u201d. Meanwhile Mike Pence, the former US vice-president, criticised the deal, saying it was a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. Writing on X he said: \u201cThere should be no plea deals to avoid prison for anyone that endangers the security of our military or the national security of the United States. Ever.\u201d Assange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a European arrest warrant after Swedish authorities said they wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations that were later dropped. He fled to Ecuador\u2019s embassy, where he remained for seven years, to avoid extradition to Sweden. He was dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail. He has been in London\u2019s Belmarsh top security jail ever since, from where he has been fighting extradition to the US. While in Belmarsh, Assange married his partner Stella with whom he had two children while he was in the Ecuadorian embassy. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being convicted of violating the Espionage Act and other offences for leaking classified government and military documents to WikiLeaks. President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017, allowing her release after about seven years behind bars. Reuters contributed to this report"

            "date": "2024-06-23T13:24:54Z",
            "content": "When Ella Janneh was awarded \u00a3217,000 in damages in the high court after a civil case against a TV sex therapist she accused of raping her, it was the culmination of an eight-year fight that she said at times almost broke her. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody chooses to make the most humiliating experience of their life something to be publicly known for,\u201d she said in an interview with the Guardian, explaining why she continued to pursue justice despite the odds. \u201cBut this shame is not ours, and I want to make this easier for the next person to speak out.\u201d Despite going to the police the day after the alleged rape, her case was not prosecuted. Two appeals to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) were dismissed and she was denied criminal injuries compensation because police told the awarding body she was \u201cnot a credible witness\u201d. \u201cFirst and foremost I wanted justice,\u201d said Janneh, now 37. \u201cI wanted to be able to share this story with the world.\u201d Janneh first saw the therapist, Michael Lousada, in 2011. She had been sexually abused as a child, and had not received proper help to process this. It had left her with depression, as well as having panic attacks during consensual sexual activity with partners. \u201cBecause I really did not understand what was happening to me and it was really overwhelming, and I experienced a lot of shame and embarrassment about it, I felt like I needed to get help,\u201d she said. One day she picked up a copy of the Metro newspaper and read an article about Lousada, in which he said he wanted to bring the services he offered to the NHS. She booked two sessions with him, which was all she could afford at the time, and did not have any concerns arising from those. In the intervening years before she saw Lousada again, she had more traditional talking therapy. \u201cI was in a really good place psychologically and emotionally,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt very excited about my future. I felt very, very good about the progress I had made.\u201d However, she was still experiencing panic symptoms during sexual activity, which she found \u201creally difficult to deal with\u201d. \u201c[As] a woman in my 20s [I] didn\u2019t want to be dealing with having these types of conversations with sexual partners about my sexual abuse,\u201d she said. And so she began scouring websites for survivors of sexual abuse, and read about \u201cbodywork\u201d, described as \u201can emerging field that survivors were finding healing in\u201d. She remembered that she had seen Lousada years before and booked another appointment. Having seen Lousada\u2019s reams of media coverage, she believed he was \u201cthis pre-eminent expert in trauma\u201d and paid \u00a3750 for the three-hour session in London. She explained to him how her panic manifested: her hands would close up, she would hyperventilate and struggle to speak. She said Lousada did not explain what she should expect from the session. \u201cThere was nothing, there was no communication on his end,\u201d she said. She did not believe that the session \u201cwould involve anything sexual\u201d and thought \u201che would be treating me in the way a doctor or a therapist would\u201d, she said. After 30 minutes of talking, Janneh was taken through to a room with a bed, where she said the rape took place. In documents filed with the high court, Janneh said Lousada told her his penis was \u201clike a laser beam\u201d that could \u201cburn up trauma\u201d and \u201cabsorb the trauma\u201d. The court heard Lousada did not wear a condom, which he did not dispute. After hearing the evidence, the judge found that Lousada had instructed Ella to regress into her childhood self. Janneh claimed the incident caused her to suffer a panic attack, leaving her unable to communicate and \u201cincapable of providing valid and informed consent\u201d. In his defence, Lousada admitted penetration occurred but said he repeatedly received \u201cclear verbal consent\u201d from Janneh, although the judge decided that was not the case. The judge said he had \u201cno doubt\u201d Janneh had suffered a \u201cfull-blown dissociative panic attack\u201d and that she had \u201centirely lacked capacity\u201d to consent to what happened. After she left Lousada\u2019s office, Janneh said she had \u201cstarted to come to\u201d and phoned her friend while she was on the train, but realised she could not talk about what had happened, and hung up. \u201cOnce I got to the station it had started to filter through what had happened, and I called her and started screaming, at Dalston Kingsland station [in east London], at the top of the platform. \u201cI just started screaming and then I hung up the phone, and went straight across the road and bought a bottle, and went home and just turned off my phone because I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone.\u201d She added: \u201cI felt totally and utterly humiliated, more humiliated than when I was a child, because that abuse had been used against me.\u201d The next morning, she switched her phone back on, and after hardly sleeping, called a sexual assault service as soon as it opened. \u201cI just started screaming again,\u201d she said. The same day, she reported Lousada to the Metropolitan police, who began a rape investigation. Janneh claimed there were failings in how it was carried out, with what she described as poor evidence-gathering and officers repeatedly getting her name wrong. Following the police investigation, the case was referred to the CPS, but she was told that Lousada would not be prosecuted. In a letter, the agency told her the issues around consent would be too difficult for a jury to understand. \u201cI absolutely did not feel like justice was done,\u201d she said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t understand how this was allowed to continue, and I just couldn\u2019t sit with the fact that this was allowed to continue. \u201cI had wanted to die. That\u2019s how bad I felt, that\u2019s how destroyed I was, I almost lost my mind. I\u2019ve gone in a space that is supposed to be therapeutic and the whole thing was turned on its head.\u201d She said that after the CPS dropped the case, she fell apart. In the same week she got the final decision letter, she found out she was pregnant. She said she was \u201cso heartbroken about the decision\u201d that she felt she could not continue with the pregnancy: \u201cI was so full of sorrow that I didn\u2019t feel it would be fair to try to raise a child.\u201d She had a termination, and then: \u201cI began drinking, taking drugs, it was just total annihilation, I had no self-esteem.\u201d Eventually Janneh found a job in a cafe, and began seeing a therapist. She also applied to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority for compensation, though she said she was rejected \u201con the grounds that police had given evidence against me \u2026 saying that I was a contradictory witness\u201d. By now it was 2019. Although she had exhausted all criminal avenues, Janneh said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t let it go.\u201d Lousada, she said, was still working as a therapist and appearing in the media. Janneh had been on a waiting list for support from an independent sexual violence advocate, a service guiding people through the criminal justice system. It was only then that she found out that she might be able to bring a civil case. While criminal prosecutions must prove \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d, civil cases can be ruled upon on the balance of probabilities. \u201cIt was the first time in this experience that I felt listened to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really important for me to finally get in that courtroom, to do what I needed to do. I had worked really hard to get there. \u201cI put it to the police and CPS to truly justify their decision not to hold this man to account. I couldn\u2019t rely on them, and thousands of other victims couldn\u2019t rely on them \u2026 The system is completely inadequate to deal with rape.\u201d Catriona Rubens of Leigh Day Solicitors, which represented Janneh, said: \u201cIn a system where so few reports of rape to the police result in a criminal prosecution, we urgently need to address the legal and cultural silencing of victims and survivors. By standing up and speaking out, Ella has helped to break this silence.\u201d Lousada, 57, said: \u201cI have told both the police and the court what happened that day, and you will appreciate that I am very disappointed that my evidence has been rejected. I no longer engage in this sort of work and have not done so since the incident in question. \u201cI was seeking to help Ms Janneh and never intended to cause her any harm. I have always regretted the outcome and the effects on her, and I wish her well for the future.\u201d A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand the devastating impact rape has on victims, which is why each case is looked at by specialist prosecutors who are committed to bringing perpetrators to justice wherever possible. \u201cCriminal and civil cases require different standards of proof. In criminal cases we must prove beyond reasonable doubt that an individual is guilty and following a careful review of the evidence in this case, we concluded there was not a realistic prospect of conviction \u2013 a decision later supported by two independent reviews. \u201cWe are continuing to improve how every rape case is handled and our suspect-centred approach means we always focus on the behaviour and actions of the suspect, and not the victim.\u201d The Met police commander Kevin Southworth, who leads on public protection, said: \u201cWe strive to deliver the best service we can and take allegations of rape and sexual assault seriously, so it\u2019s concerning whenever we hear that someone feels they have been let down. \u201cWhile there is currently no active police investigation, in light of the outcome of the civil proceedings we are reviewing the information we hold and will also consider any new detail that has emerged during the civil case.\u201d Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732). Other international helplines can be found at ibiblio.org/rcip/internl.html"

            "date": "2024-06-10T18:21:49Z",
            "content": "Reform UK has defended one of its candidates who said Britain should have \u201ctaken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality\u201d, saying the comments were \u201cprobably true\u201d. The row prompted the Conservatives to directly criticise Ian Gribbin, the party\u2019s candidate in Bexhill and Battle, who was reported to have written on a website\u2019s comment section: \u201cBritain\u2019s warped mindset values weird notions of international morality rather than looking after its own people.\u201d The BBC said Gribbin had written that Britain needed to \u201cexorcise the cult of Churchill and recognise that in both policy and military strategy, he was abysmal\u201d. He is also reported to have said that women were the \u201csponging gender\u201d and should be \u201cdeprived of health care\u201d. Reform\u2019s spokesperson told the BBC the views on Hitler\u2019s offer were not endorsements but were \u201cshared by the vast majority of the British establishment including the BBC of its day, and is probably true\u201d. He said they were written with \u201can eye to inconvenient perspectives and truths. That doesn\u2019t make them endorsements, just arguing points in long-distance debates.\u201d The spokesperson also told the Jewish Chronicle the party would not sack the candidate and he had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201d The BBC later said Gribbin had apologised for the \u201cold comments and withdraw them unreservedly and the upset that they have caused\u201d. He said his \u201cmother was the daughter of Russian Jews fleeing persecution\u201d and he had been \u201cupset at the way these comments were taken out of context\u201d. The veterans minister, Johnny Mercer, said the comments were outrageous. \u201cThe suggestion from a Reform spokesperson that Britain would have been better off accepting the Nazis\u2019 squalid offer of neutrality instead of standing against them is shameful and shows a shocking lack of judgment. \u201cThese comments ignore the millions murdered by the Nazis in their bid for European domination and the ultimate sacrifice paid by the men and women who stood up to Hitler in our darkest hour. Misusing appeasement to justify Nazi apologism is disgraceful and comments like this are deeply troubling coming from a political party.\u201d The Reform leader, Nigel Farage, distanced himself from the comments and said the snap election had meant the party\u2019s vetting programme had run out of time. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a bigger problem in the Green party,\u201d he told a press conference on Monday. \u201cThey\u2019ve had to suspend 20 of their candidates for putting out pretty vile antisemitic tweets. Here\u2019s something I think every party will suffer because it was a snap election. We\u2019ve put in place a good vetting programme, but we\u2019ve run out of time.\u201d The party chair, Richard Tice, added: \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased with all candidates. When people do inappropriate things, say daft things, then of course we\u2019ll look at it and investigate it and that\u2019s what we do.\u201d"

            "content": "The Reform UK candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong has resigned after it was discovered he had previously encouraged people to vote for the far-right British National party. StClair-Armstrong, 71, is standing for election in North West Essex, challenging the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch. The Times reported that he wrote a blog post in 2010 that lamented the state of the UK, writing: \u201cI could weep now, every time I pick up a British newspaper and read the latest about the state of the UK. No doubt, Enoch Powell would be doing the same if he was alive. My solution \u2026 vote BNP!\u201d His comments were unearthed from an archived version of the Joli Triste website, which has since been changed. It also featured posts including racial slurs about Chinese and Pakistani people and a joke about \u201cfemale hormones\u201d. Asked about the BNP comment by the Times, StClair-Armstrong said: \u201cI\u2019ve got no excuses for that. I think they\u2019re a disgusting party. I don\u2019t like the English Defence League. I don\u2019t like them.\u201d He added that he would resign over the matter. \u201cI don\u2019t really see any alternative,\u201d he said. StClair-Armstrong also told the Times: \u201cI don\u2019t have this stuff on my website any more \u2026 I removed all that stuff and made the website respectable. It was at a time when I was feeling particularly hard done by, I\u2019d been shafted by a lot of people. I cleaned up my act a long, long time ago.\u201d In a post on X on Sunday evening, StClair-Armstrong said: \u201cI do not and have never supported the BNP, particularly the nasty Nick Griffin. I posted it in a moment of frustration, the only person in the world who has ever done so.\u201d As nominations cannot be changed at this stage of the election, StClair-Armstrong\u2019s name will still appear on the ballot paper in the constituency next to Reform UK. However, if he won a seat in parliament he would be an independent. A spokesperson for Reform told the Times: \u201cMr StClair-Armstrong has tendered his resignation as a member of Reform UK due to the revelation of unacceptable historic social media comments and we have accepted his resignation.\u201d According to his profile on Reform\u2019s website, StClair-Armstrong worked in the RAF. He was active in the local Conservative party and served four years as a town councillor before deciding to join Reform early last year. StClair-Armstrong and Reform UK have been contacted for comment."

            "title": "Reform UK activist filmed making racist comments about Rishi Sunak",
            "date": "2024-06-27T19:04:45Z",
            "content": "A Reform UK activist in the constituency where Nigel Farage is standing has been secretly filmed making extremely racist comments about Rishi Sunak, as well as using Islamophobic and other offensive language. Farage said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the views expressed by Andrew Parker, a Reform canvasser, who was filmed as part of an undercover investigation by Channel 4 News. The channel also secretly filmed George Jones, a longtime party activist who organises events for Farage, making homophobic comments, calling the Pride flag \u201cdegenerate\u201d and LGBT people \u201cnonces\u201d. The emergence of the footage, filming of which concluded last week, comes on the same day that Reform dropped an election candidate in another seat, after the Guardian informed the party that Raymond Saint had been on a list of members of the British National party. The most serious comments uncovered by Channel 4 News involved Parker, who was covertly filmed making them while canvassing and travelling by car around Clacton, where Farage is the favourite to unseat the incumbent Conservative. During one journey, Parker described Sunak as \u201cfucking [P-word]\u201d. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve always been a Tory voter, but what annoys me is that fucking [P-word] we\u2019ve got in. What good is he? You tell me, you know. He\u2019s just wet. Fucking useless.\u201d Telling the reporter, who was posing as an activist, to \u201cemphasise \u2018illegal\u2019\u201d if discussing migration with minority ethnic voters, Parker called Islam \u201ca cult\u201d, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re fucking kicking all the Muslims out of the mosques and turning them into Wetherspoon\u2019s.\u201d In one doorstep conversation with a voter, Parker suggests shooting asylum seekers who try to come to England on small boats. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Deal, haven\u2019t you,\u201d he says, referring to the town in Kent. \u201cThe place near Dover. Army recruitment. Get the young recruits there, yeah, with guns on the fucking beach, target practice. Fucking just shoot them.\u201d In another covertly filmed exchange, at a pub in Clacton, Jones reacts with scorn when he sees a police car going past displaying a Pride flag. He says: \u201cYou see that fucking degenerate flag on the front bonnet? What are the old bill doing promoting that crap? They should be out catching nonces not promoting the fuckers.\u201d Later, explaining what he says would be policies for a future Reform government, Jones says: \u201cOur police officers will be paramilitaries, they won\u2019t be police,\u201d and that the party should \u201cbring back the noose\u201d. In a statement to Channel 4 News, Parker said Farage and Reform were not aware of his views, and he was sorry if they \u201chave reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute\u201d. \u201cI would like to make it clear that neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform party are aware of my personal views on immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cAny comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. At no time before I was sent out to canvass did I discuss my personal views with any representative of the Reform party or Nigel Farage.\u201d Farage said: \u201cI am dismayed by the reported comments of a handful of people associated with my local campaign, particularly those who are volunteers. They will no longer be with the campaign. \u201cThe appalling sentiments expressed by some in these exchanges bear no relation to my own views, those of the vast majority of our supporters or Reform UK policy. Some of the language used was reprehensible.\u201d While the party swiftly distanced itself from the rhetoric, it is the latest in a series of controversies in which Reform candidates or other party figures have been shown to have said offensive things or held extreme views. This month, the Reform UK candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after it was discovered he had previously encouraged people to vote for the BNP. The party has not yet appeared to have taken any action against its candidate in Southend East and Rochford who was reported as having said arriving asylum seekers should be \u201cslaughtered\u201d. Leslie Lilley made the comments in a Facebook post in 2020, the Times reported, also referring to \u201cmore scum entering the UK\u201d."

            "content": "A Reform UK general election candidate has been dropped after it emerged that he had been on a list of members of the British National party (BNP). Raymond Saint, a retired owner of a plumbing company, had been standing for the radical right populist party in Basingstoke. A Raymond Saint, at the same address, was recorded as a member of the BNP in a list that was published by WikiLeaks in 2009. Reform UK moved to withdraw its support for him after the connection was brought to its attention by the Guardian, and accused Saint of failing to declare his BNP membership. A party spokesperson said: \u201cAs Nigel Farage has repeatedly made plain, people who belong or used to belong to the BNP are not welcome in the Reform UK party. \u201cEvery candidate was asked to declare their past or present political affiliations and was specifically asked whether they had ever been a member of the BNP. Mr Saint failed to do so and clearly lied to us.\u201d When the Guardian asked Saint if he had been a member of the BNP, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t wish to discuss it, thank you.\u201d His Conservative opponent in Basingstoke, the former minister Maria Miller, said: \u201cBasingstoke residents will be shocked and troubled that the Reform party candidate, Raymond Saint, has been a member of the BNP. \u201cIt raises worries about the kind of politics that are acceptable to Reform. Fringe extremism and racism have no place in Basingstoke. Nigel Farage should hang his head in shame that he \u2026 put such candidates before Basingstoke\u2019s electorate.\u201d Reform UK has faced constant pressure over racist and offensive comments by its candidates. Earlier this month, the Reform UK candidate Grant StClair-Armstrong resigned after it was discovered he had previously encouraged people to vote for the BNP. A spokesperson for Reform said that StClair-Armstrong, who was challenging the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, in North West Essex, had tendered his resignation because of the revelation of \u201cunacceptable historic social media comments\u201d. Reform UK has complained that it was let down by a company it paid to carry out vetting of its candidates. Farage has said lawyers are being instructed. The company has reportedly said it had been working on the assumption the general election would be this autumn, giving it the summer to complete its work.. The name Raymond Saint appeared on a detailed membership list of the BNP containing names, addresses and telephone numbers published by WikiLeaks in October 2009. The data included details of the BNP\u2019s members and supporters on 15 April 2009, as well as data about members whose subscriptions to the party had lapsed. On Reform UK\u2019s website, Raymond Saint is quoted as saying: \u201cI would regard myself as Conservative and always voted accordingly but unfortunately during the last few years I find myself politically homeless as the party has completely lost its way and in my opinion can no longer be regarded as conservative.\u201d He added that his first priority would be to \u201cfix our borders\u201d. Reform threatens to eat into the 14,198 majority that the Conservatives are defending in Basingstoke. In 2015 Ukip came third with 8,290 votes."

            "title": "Who is Matt Kean and what is the Climate Change Authority?",
            "date": "2024-06-24T03:43:47Z",
            "content": "The federal Labor government has appointed prominent New South Wales Liberal Matt Kean as the new chair of the Climate Change Authority. Here\u2019s a short explainer on Kean and the agency he will chair. Who is Matt Kean? Kean, 42, had been a Liberal MP in the NSW parliament until announcing his resignation last week. He gave his valedictory speech to parliament on Friday. Kean entered politics in the 2011 landslide as the member for Hornsby, a seat in northern Sydney. His first major appointment was as minister for innovation and better regulation in 2017, a role that suited his education, including gaining a graduate diploma from the Institute of Chartered Accountants and his time at consultants PriceWaterhouseCoopers. He found his calling and gained a higher profile after the 2019 state election when he became energy and environment minister. As head of the Liberal\u2019s moderate faction, and being close to then-premier Gladys Berejiklian, Kean was able to implement far-reaching changes \u2013 particularly in the energy sector \u2013 that had eluded similarly inclined moderate Liberal ministers. He secured cross-party support for an ambitious road map to drive renewables into the grid in NSW \u2013 a state that had been slow to decarbonise \u2013 and a large expansion of national parks. Increasingly alarmed at the scale of the 2019-20 black summer bushfires, Kean spoke out against the lack of climate action including by his federal counterparts in the Morrison government. Morrison bristled in response that \u201cmost of the federal cabinet wouldn\u2019t even know who Matt Kean was\u201d \u2013 helping to boost Kean\u2019s national profile. When Berejiklian resigned following revelations the state\u2019s corruption commission was investigating whether she had been involved in \u201ca breach of public trust\u201d, Kean was elevated to treasurer and deputy Liberal leader under Dominic Perrottet. After the March 2023 election ended the Coalition\u2019s 12 years in office, Kean took a much less publicised role as shadow health minister. Why did Kean leave politics now? Kean had made no secret of his wider ambitions \u2013 including a potential tilt at federal politics. He could have chosen to challenge sitting Liberal MP Paul Fletcher for pre-selection in the federal seat of Bradfield, for example, arguing his track record on tackling climate action would help counter any threat posed by an independent teal candidate. However, Kean\u2019s climate stance would have put him at odds with the federal opposition, not least its plans to build nuclear power plants at seven sites across Australia. Close observers have noted Kean\u2019s resignation as a Liberal MP came just a day before that policy was announced. It also came not long after Peter Dutton announced a federal Coalition government would ditch Australia\u2019s 2030 emissions target under the Paris climate agreement. \u201cMy grandparents\u2019 generation fought for freedom in the second world war,\u201d Kean said in his valedictory speech. \u201cMy parents\u2019 generation saw off the threat of communism during the cold war. \u201cIt is incumbent upon our generation to take decisive and responsible action on climate change. It is the biggest challenge that will face our society and economy in our lifetime.\u201d Speaking on Monday after his new role as the chair of the Climate Change Authority was announced, Kean noted he had previously asked his state\u2019s chief scientist, Prof Hugh Durrant-Whyte, to examine nuclear\u2019s prospects. (Durrant-Whyte reiterated the points here last week.) Standing alongside the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, in Canberra, Kean said nuclear energy didn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cI did not want to bankrupt the state and I did not want to put those huge costs on to families.\u201d What is the Climate Change Authority? The authority was set up by the Gillard Labor government in 2012 to provide independent advice on what Australia\u2019s carbon emissions reduction targets should be. The Abbott government sought to scrap the authority \u2013 and other emissions-reducing bodies such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation \u2013 but was stymied by the Senate. However, the Coalition made it clear the authority\u2019s advice wasn\u2019t welcomed, with one after another of the authority\u2019s board members resigning, including former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser. Since April 2021, the authority has been chaired by Grant King, a former managing director of Origin Energy for 16 years. During that time, Origin expanded rapidly, particularly in coal seam gas for export. King, though, has held other roles, including chairing CWP Renewables, and Kean too may take up roles in clean energy. King\u2019s term was scheduled to run until April next year but Bowen said the current chair had sought to leave the role early. The authority reviews Australia\u2019s national greenhouse gas reporting and the safeguard mechanism aimed at forcing industry to cut carbon emissions over time. It can also order its own research or act on requests for analysis from the government. Perhaps as a signal to how Kean will view his new role as authority chair, he had this to say in his valedictory speech: \u201cFor critics who complain of an economic and financial cost of acting on climate change, I say as treasurer I saw the catastrophic cost of not acting\u2014the cost of rebuilding infrastructure, towns, lives and livelihoods. There is no comparison.\u201d"

            "content": "The Albanese government has announced that former New South Wales Liberal treasurer Matt Kean will lead the Climate Change Authority in a surprise cross-party appointment that follow\u2019s Kean\u2019s sudden resignation from state politics. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, revealed the appointment on Monday at a news conference with Kean and federal climate change minister, Chris Bowen. Bowen acknowledged Kean was from the opposite side of politics. \u201cCarbon dioxide doesn\u2019t recognise political parties,\u201d he said. Kean announced last week that he was leaving politics to pursue work in the private sector but acknowledged he will continue to be in the public sector instead. \u201cThe Climate Change Authority has an important role to play in providing independent advice to the government of the day, based on facts science, evidence, engineering, and economics,\u201d Kean said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to become a stronger and even more prosperous nation, we have an opportunity to deliver a family some of the cheapest electricity bills anywhere in the world. But we\u2019ve got to get it right. This is too important to leave to chance. We need policies based on facts and evidence. And that\u2019s what I intend to be advising the government.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Asked about the federal Coalition\u2019s plan to introduce nuclear energy, Kean said that the advice to him when he was NSW energy minister considering the transition away from coal was that it was too costly and would take too long. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to bankrupt the state.\u201d Kean said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to put those huge costs on to families.\u201d That advice had come from the then NSW chief scientist in 2019. But Kean said the most current available advice supported that view. \u201cThe latest scientific engineering and economic advice that\u2019s looked at these matters that I\u2019m aware of is from the CSIRO and Aemo, and they very clearly say that the cheapest way to transition our electricity system is to move towards renewables backed up by firming, and also storage,\u201d Kean said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the CSIRO says that\u2019s what Aemo says. That\u2019s the evidence available to us. I\u2019m not aware of anything different.\u201d Albanese described it as \u201can outstanding appointment\u201d and said Kean was \u201cuniquely placed\u201d to take on the job, having served at the state level in the treasury, energy and environment portfolios. \u201cMr Kean understands the opportunity that the transition to clean energy represents for our nation,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cHe understood it as a member of the NSW government \u2026 and he also understands the folly that walking away from the renewables transition represents for our nation.\u201d Kean called for a bipartisan consensus in the transition away from fossil fuels. \u201cThis is not about ideology, this is about outcomes,\u201d Kean said. Kean replaces the outgoing authority chair, Grant King, who finishes in the position in August. Albanese continued his attack on the Coalition\u2019s proposal to introduce nuclear energy to Australia, declaring his government had no plans to overturn the Howard government\u2019s existing legislated moratorium. He refused to name a 2035 emissions reduction target and said the Climate Change Authority\u2019s advice on that was \u201csome time off\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m focused on the 2030 target and delivering the policy that we put in place,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my focus, the 2035 target is something for down the track.\u201d He accused the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, of presenting a proposal that was \u201cnot a serious plan\u201d. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why a plan that\u2019s always been on the fringes of the serious energy debate in this country is now being put front and centre by Mr Dutton, who is on the fringe of Australian politics, is nowhere near the centre, is out there on the hard right of Australian politics, being driven by ideology not being driven by common sense.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-24T07:00:24Z",
            "content": "When we think about who gave voice to women during their fight for the right to vote, or their battle to legalise abortion, those in the arts have often been at the forefront. Likewise the Black Panthers in the US civil rights movement and people with Aids shunned by the government. Artists haven\u2019t only captured political shifts \u2013 their work has changed vital conversations. At times, they have even changed laws. Paula Rego\u2019s agonising depictions of women going through unsafe illegal abortions helped sway public opinion in Portugal\u2019s 2007 referendum on legalising the practice. The one-woman show Prima Facie, by Suzie Miller, about a female barrister and sexual abuse survivor, exposed flaws in the law when it comes to rape victims. By asking the accused if consent was given, it influenced a senior British judge to rewrite the direction read to the jury during rape cases. Art and artists can have a huge influence. Right now, the climate emergency is one of the most pressing crises the world faces. In the UK, 2022 and 2023 were the hottest and second-hottest years on record. A wet spring has caused potato shortages, triggering increases in food prices. And, as the 2022 UK Climate Change Risk Assessment lays out, there are increasing risks to livestock, soil health, freshwater habits, food chains, human health and wellbeing. How can artists push conversations and persuade people to take action about these problems? In 1984, Agnes Denes drew attention to capitalist greed and the gap between the urban and rural environment by planting and harvesting a two-acre wheatfield in Battery Park, Manhattan. Four months in the making, it highlighted mismanagement of land and, as the artist said, \u201cour misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values\u201d. Judy Chicago\u2019s drawing series, The End: A Meditation on Death and Extinction, part of her current show at the Serpentine in London, depicts flora and fauna under threat of extinction, giving a voice to nature that is slowly being eaten away by this crisis. While it\u2019s important that artists of all kinds document what is happening, urgent action is required too. I recently went to the launch of Murmur, a climate initiative and grant-providing scheme pushing for the decarbonisation of the arts and music industries. While some artists have been doing this work for a long time, it\u2019s important for them to harness their influence. As founder Victoria Siddall, the former director of the Frieze art fair, stresses: \u201cArt and artists have a special power to inspire people.\u201d It is sad that we need these organisations. But their existence is a result of the dangerous lack of activity from our current government. The prime minister downplayed the climate crisis in the Conservative manifesto and has U-turned on his strategy, prioritising cost over the planet. Nor does he seem to fully recognise that high oil and gas prices are driving the cost-of-living crisis. All this despite a public letter signed by 408 scientists urging party leaders to make climate a top priority. \u201cIt is very clear,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthat a failure to tackle climate change with sufficient urgency and scale is making the UK and the rest of the world more dangerous and insecure.\u201d On Saturday, London Climate Action Week began, packing the city full of events and discussions about how we can do better, and next week\u2019s general election is the most crucial vote of our generation. In these times, we need to use all the resources we can to shift the conversation and take action. Like Suzie Miller changing judges\u2019 directions or Paula Rego influencing Portuguese law, art can be a powerful tool. But individuals, leaders and organisations must use their influence, too. Climate must be prioritised. If not, what will artists of the future have to document? Will there even be any? You can\u2019t document extinction if you\u2019ve ceased to exist."

            "content": "The proverb \u201cone swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer\u201d, first attributed to Aristotle, sums up our love of this elegant bird. Swallows visit us for roughly half the year, between April and September, before travelling almost 6,000 miles (10,000 km) to South Africa, where they enjoy a second spring and summer. But unpredictable weather patterns are now affecting swallows throughout their lifecycle: in Africa, on their journeys south in autumn and north in spring, and during the breeding season here in the UK. A mixture of wet springs and summer droughts, leading to major falls in numbers of the flying insects on which they feed, has reduced the swallow\u2019s breeding population by almost a quarter in the past 25 years or so. Anecdotally, many of my farming neighbours here in Somerset tell me they have far fewer nesting swallows than before; some have even lost them altogether. And a recent report confirms that those other familiar denizens of our summer skies, the house martin and swift, have suffered even greater falls in numbers over the past decade. Once again, our changing climate is to blame; but this comes on top of the huge loss of insects caused by modern industrial agriculture. This is ironic, given that the swallow\u2019s success over the past few millennia began when it adapted to living alongside farmers, nesting in their barns, and feeding on insects attracted by their livestock."

            "date": "2024-06-12T17:03:43Z",
            "content": "Swiss politicians have rejected a landmark climate ruling from the European court of human rights, raising fears that other polluting countries may follow suit. A panel of Strasbourg judges ruled in April that Switzerland had violated the human rights of older women through weak climate policies that leave them more vulnerable to heatwaves. Activists hailed the judgment as a breakthrough because it leaves all members of the Council of Europe exposed to legal challenges for sluggish efforts to clean up carbon-intensive economies. But the Swiss parliament\u2019s lower house voted on Wednesday to disregard the ruling \u2013 with 111 votes in favour and 72 against \u2013 arguing that the judges had overstepped their bounds and that Switzerland had done enough. The declaration, which has been adopted by the upper house but does not bind the federal government, accused the court of \u201cinadmissible and disproportionate judicial activism\u201d. \u201cThis is terrible from a rule-of-law perspective,\u201d said Corina Heri, a law researcher at the University of Z\u00fcrich, adding that \u201cthe whole system would fall apart\u201d if lots of states started to pick and choose which rulings they complied with. \u201cThe term \u2018slippery slope\u2019 is overused, obviously, but it is a dangerous precedent to create.\u201d The KlimaSeniorinnen \u2013 or Swiss female climate elders \u2013 are a group of 2,400 women over the age of 65 who took the Swiss government to court for failing to do its fair share to stop the planet heating 1.5C (2.7F). After years of setbacks in regional and national courts, they escalated the case to Europe\u2019s top human rights court and scored a partial victory. But in a fiery debate on Wednesday, Swiss politicians attacked the court and mocked the women. Jean-Luc Addor, from the rightwing populist Swiss People\u2019s Party, the largest in the federal assembly, said: \u201cThese \u2018climate elder\u2019 are just a bunch of apparently healthy \u201cboomeuses\u201d [female boomers], who are trying to deny our children the living conditions they have enjoyed all their lives.\u201d Scientists have found that older women die at higher rates during heatwaves, which have grown hotter, longer and more common as people have pumped out pollutants that trap sunlight. A study from doctors and climate scientists found 60% of the heatwave deaths in Switzerland in summer 2022 were the result of climate change and that older women were hit hardest. Ahead of the debate, the KlimaSeniorinnen and Greenpeace submitted a petition with 22,000 signatures urging politicians to recognise that human rights are the basis of democracy and should be independent of political majorities. Rosmarie Wydler-W\u00e4lti, co-president of the KlimaSeniorinnen, said she was appalled by the declaration, and that it was not worthy of a constitutional state. \u201cThe declaration is a betrayal of us older women \u2013 and of all those who are suffering from the real consequences of global warming today and in the future.\u201d The vote comes days after the far-right scored sizable gains in European Union elections. Switzerland, which is not part of the EU, will mark the 50th anniversary of its ratification of the European convention on human rights in November. The convention legally commits it to implementing the court\u2019s judgments. Evelyne Schmid, a professor of international law at the University of Lausanne, said small states such as Switzerland have a particular interest in respecting international treaties \u2013 and that the declaration from politicians will put the federal government in a difficult position. \u201cMembers of parliament and everyone else can criticise judgments they don\u2019t like \u2013 that\u2019s of course legitimate in a democracy, and courts exist precisely for situations in which there is disagreement,\u201d said Schmid. \u201cBut a parliament officially accusing the institution of \u2018undue judicial activism\u2019 sends a different, problematic message.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-22T15:01:41Z",
            "content": "Carbon emissions from vans in the UK have risen by 63% since 1990, new analysis shows, as cars are getting cleaner. While more people are opting to drive electric or plug-in hybrid cars, van drivers still prefer diesel because electric vans are much more expensive with little choice of models. Those who do choose an electric van find they cannot use some public electric vehicle charging stations, which can be too small or have charging cables that are too short. Campaigners say the next government should give businesses financial incentives to pick zero emission vans and improve charging infrastructure. Research from Transport and Environment, a clean transport and energy advocacy group, found there are a million more vans on the road since 2014, and nearly all are diesel fuelled. Although the growth of online shopping has meant more delivery vans, most are still used by small businesses or sole traders. The steady rise adds up to a 63% increase in carbon emissions from light vans since 1990, while the rapid uptake of electric cars and taxis in the past decade means emissions from cars are down by 19% over the same period, even though the total number of cars on the road has also risen. Although there have been substantial reductions in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, vans are bucking that trend. Since 1990, NOx emissions from cars are down by 88% and from HGVs by 91%. But vans are down only 38% since 1990, are higher than in 2011 and overtook HGV emissions in 2015. NOx has been linked to the onset of asthma in children, and roadside emissions have remained at illegally high levels in some places. Ralph Palmer of Transport and Environment said the rise in van emissions was \u201calarming\u201d. \u201cDespite the push for more electric vans on our roads, we are still witnessing a surge in greenhouse gas emissions from vans as a result of sustained sales of diesel vans, countering trends we are seeing in the car market,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough progress being made to support businesses and sole traders to make the switch.\u201d Oliver Lord, UK head of the Clean Cities campaign, said the UK was lagging behind European neighbours such as the Netherlands, which is working to create zero emission logistics zones. Lord said: \u201cIt means that when you\u2019re driving a van into their cities, if it\u2019s registered after next year, it has to be electric. And by 2030, they\u2019ve all got to be electric. The share of electric vans sold in the Netherlands is twice that in the UK. There\u2019s no way we\u2019ll clean our air and hit our climate goals unless we do more to help businesses switch away from polluting diesel vans.\u201d Last September, the government set out a zero emission vehicles (ZEV) mandate, which means that by the end of this year, 10% of all new van and car sales should be electric, rising to 100% by 2035. In theory, if manufacturers do not meet that target they will have to pay \u00a315,000 for each extra diesel or petrol vehicle sold. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said 341,455 new vans were registered last year, of which 20,253 were powered by electric batteries. Palmer said: \u201cThere are very, very generous flexibilities that have been given to automakers in the first two or three years of this scheme, which basically means that we won\u2019t hit that 10% mark this year. But that should actually help bring far more van models to the market.\u201d Michael Salter-Church, sustainability director at BT subsidiary Openreach, said it had been \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the range of vehicles on the market and the ZEV mandate was a \u201creally important step\u201d. \u201cOur engineers really like them \u2013 the [lack of] noise, the ability to warm them up very quickly during winter weather,\u201d he said. Openreach aims to convert all of its 30,000 vans by 2031, and so far they have 4,100 battery-powered electric vans, helped by government grants of up to \u00a35,000 a van for a maximum of 1,500 vans a year per company.\u201cIt is right to put more pressure on the manufacturers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were very concerned that no political party has pledged to extend the electric van grants beyond 31 March, 2025.\u201d Openreach has installed chargers at 2,000 of its engineers\u2019 homes \u2013 most park at home overnight \u2013 but Salter-Church said they sometimes faced problems charging while on the road. \u201cQuite often charging points are designed for cars, so we\u2019ve found limited parking spaces, short cables and sometimes we found they are installed in car parks where the barrier height means vans can\u2019t get in. Charging infrastructure needs to be improved.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-17T13:00:46Z",
            "content": "Governments faced with economic upheaval caused by artificial intelligence should consider fiscal policies including taxes on excess profits and a green levy to atone for AI-related carbon emissions, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said unlike previous technological breakthroughs such as the steam engine, generative AI \u2013 the term for computer systems such as ChatGPT that can produce convincing, human-like text, voices and images from simple prompts \u2013 can spread \u201cmuch faster\u201d and advances in the technology are happening at \u201cbreakneck speed\u201d. The international lender of last resort said governments should consider a range of policies to mitigate the impact on jobs, including a carbon tax to account for the environmental impact of operating the computer servers that train and operate AI systems. \u201cGiven the large amount of energy consumed by AI servers, taxing the associated carbon emissions is a good way to reflect the external environmental costs in the price of the technology,\u201d said the IMF in a report published on Monday. AI currently accounts for less than half of electricity use in datacentres but it could become their main source of consumption and push up the overall amount of electricity such facilities require, according to a recent report. Datacentres, servers and data transmission networks account for up to 1.5% of global emissions at present. The report also warned that the share of wages as a proportion of national income may decline further as a result of AI, causing a widening of inequality, while dominant tech companies could reinforce their market power and reap excessive financial rewards. The IMF report counselled against taxing investment in AI but suggested raising capital income taxes such as corporation tax and personal income taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains. The changes could include an excess profits tax, said the IMF. It added that corporate income tax had recently come under \u201csevere pressure\u201d from profit shifting and some countries lowering their rates. \u201cMore effective taxation of capital income requires restoration of the corporate incomes tax and calls for well-designed excess profit taxes, higher personal income taxes on capital through better enforcement of automatic information exchange between countries, and enhanced taxation of capital gains,\u201d said the IMF. The IMF said there were many potential benefits for the private and public sectors including cost savings, new sources of revenue and more efficient delivery of services. However, it warned that AI could hit jobs across the skills spectrum, affecting both white-collar and blue-collar jobs. Research suggests that AI will primarily affect white-collar professions such as law, finance and medicine, but the IMF added that manufacturing or trade-related jobs in the blue-collar sector could also be hit. The IMF estimates about 60% of jobs in advanced economies such as the US and UK are exposed to AI and half of these jobs may be negatively affected. \u201cLabour-saving automation could amplify job losses in both low-skill and cognitive occupations,\u201d said the IMF. It added that an AI-related increase in productivity \u2013 a measure of economic efficiency, or the amount of output generated by a worker for each hour worked \u2013 could create new jobs but such a transition could be \u201ccostly\u201d. The report, Broadening the Gains from Generative AI, made a number of other recommendations, including: extending unemployment insurance to self-employed workers; targeting social benefits at people \u201cpermanently displaced\u201d by AI-related job disruption; and gearing education and training towards giving workers new skills and ability to adapt to new technologies. It also recommended using AI, and its analytical abilities, to overhaul the tax systems and introduce new levies, such as a real-time market-value-based property tax. The report also expressed caution about universal basic income, under which working-age adults are given a state stipend regardless of their earnings or employment status, saying it would generate significant costs. It said providing \u201cunconditional benefits to all\u201d would cover higher-income groups, \u201cpotentially generating significant fiscal costs\u201d. Era Dabla-Norris, the deputy director of the IMF\u2019s fiscal affairs department and a co-author of the report, said if AI led to \u201cmuch more significant disruption\u201d in the future, then governments might consider UBI. \u201cCountries could start thinking about how such systems could be designed and implemented,\u201d she added."

Each 140g vinyl copy of Moon Music, released 4 October, will be manufactured from nine plastic bottles recovered from consumer waste. For a special \u201cnotebook edition\u201d, 70% of the plastic has been intercepted by the environmental nonprofit The Ocean Cleanup from Rio Las Vacas, Guatemala, preventing it from entering the Gulf of Honduras and the Atlantic Ocean. The band say they will reduce carbon emissions compared with regular 140g vinyl production by 85%, and prevent the manufacture of 25 tonnes of virgin plastic. CD copies will be made from 90% recycled plastic, with a 78% reduction in emissions compared with traditional CD manufacture. The initiative comes alongside Coldplay\u2019s attempt to reduce the environmental impact of touring, as the band continue their epic Music of the Spheres world tour which is now the third-highest grossing tour of all time. Earlier this month the band said they had reduced their carbon footprint by 59% compared with their previous world tour. As well as trying to avoid plane travel where possible, creative technological solutions were deployed, such as \u201ckinetic dancefloors\u201d that harnessed energy from the movement of the crowd. Moon Music will be Coldplay\u2019s 10th album, in a discography that stretches back to their 2000 debut Parachutes. They have re-teamed with Max Martin, the producer for their previous album Music of the Spheres and one of the greatest pop producers of all time, who has had a hand in 27 US No 1 hits. The first single from Moon Music, feelslikeimfallinginlove, will be released on Friday 21 June. It will likely feature in their headline Glastonbury festival set on 29 June. Other artists are attempting to reduce the environmental impact of vinyl production, such as Billie Eilish, who used recycled vinyl \u2013 made from offcuts of traditional vinyl production \u2013 for the release of her recent album Hit Me Hard and Soft. In a March interview with Billboard, Eilish lamented how \u201csome of the biggest artists in the world [are] making fucking 40 different vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more. It\u2019s so wasteful.\u201d. She later added on Instagram: \u201cI wasn\u2019t singling anyone out, these are industry-wide systemic issues.\u201d"

            "content": "The carbon-credit market must reform or \u201cgo out of business\u201d, leading scientists have concluded in an international review of the offsetting industry. The market for carbon offsets shrank dramatically last year after a series of scientific and media reports found many offsetting schemes had little environmental impact. However, if comprehensively reformed, offsetting could still generate billions of dollars for action on the climate and biodiversity, experts concluded. The Climate Crisis Advisory Group (CCAG), headed by the former UK chief scientific adviser Sir David King and made up of some of the world\u2019s leading scientists, has produced a new assessment of the voluntary carbon market and how it can rebuild trust. The unregulated sector should adopt rigorous scientific standards to produce carbon credits, ensure financial benefits were clear to local communities involved with projects, and prioritise carbon-removal projects that suck greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, the CCAG said. King said it was clear that there were deep problems with the current system for producing many carbon credits and that unless the voluntary carbon market changed, it would go out of business and be replaced by a system with higher standards. \u201cThe voluntary carbon market is very reluctant to take this fully on board. Our report is totally independent of them. It is going to be challenging, but our simple message is that unless you do this, you\u2019re out of business,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust has been lost and it\u2019s got to be regained.\u201d In recent weeks, governments and voluntary initiatives have tried to restore confidence in carbon markets after the volume more than halved in a year, falling from $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) to $723m in 2023. Leading climate and biodiversity researchers, including the University College London professor Mark Maslin and the Chilean biologist Mercedes Bustamante, produced the report. It was funded by Verra, the non-profit organisation that operates the world\u2019s leading carbon standard, though it had no oversight of the findings. Maslin said: \u201cBe under no illusions: what we are saying is that it is not good at the moment, but we need to fix it. \u201cIt cannot be left up to the industry. There need to be rules and regulations in place; we need it to be much stricter.\u201d Up to 90% of carbon credits now sold are based on \u201cavoidance\u201d of emissions (such as funding renewable energy, so less fossil fuels are used) rather than actually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The report recommended a shift to high-quality removals. \u201cAvoidance is an utter nightmare,\u201d Maslin said. \u201cAll of us agree that getting a carbon credit for a renewable energy project in most countries doesn\u2019t make sense because it\u2019s already cheaper.\u201d Verra\u2019s president and interim chief executive, Judith Simon, said in a statement that the organisation was \u201cproud to support independent research that asks the tough questions\u201d and that \u201ckey recommendations endorsed in this report are very much aligned with the many steps we are taking\u201d. \u201cWe entirely agree,\u201d she added, \u201cthat carbon credits must be transparent, scientifically sound, and both well-measured and monitored with commitment to the principles of each project.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features"

            "date": "2024-06-26T15:00:22Z",
            "content": "The New South Wales government is facing criticism over a review of how to cut emissions from coalmines that claims the goal of limiting global heating to well below 2C will not be met \u2013 a position at odds with the state\u2019s laws and policies. Climate campaigners and scientists said the assertion in the report, prepared for the planning department, is inconsistent with state legislation that commits to pursuing efforts to limit temperature increases to 1.5C. In 2016 NSW formally committed to the landmark Paris climate agreement and to take action \u201cconsistent with the level of effort to achieve Australia\u2019s commitments to it. The agreement\u2019s temperature goals agreement were adopted when the state parliament passed climate laws in November. The report, prepared by the consultancy Katestone, is a checklist for the best methods to reduce emissions from existing coalmines, including the management of fugitive methane emissions. Its introduction states: \u201cIt is generally accepted that the original Paris treaty goal of keeping mean global temperature change at or below 2.0C (and preferably 1.5C) compared to preindustrial levels (1800s) will not be met.\u201d Science agencies have said the world was not on track to limit heating to 2C but not that the goal cannot be met. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The head of research and investigations at the environment group Lock the Gate, Georgina Woods, said the report was \u201cfatally compromised\u201d as it \u201cstarts by discarding the climate change goals the NSW government is legally bound to achieve\u201d. \u201cThe NSW government is not going to take the actions needed to achieve this crucial goal of keeping global warming to 1.5C if the advice it relies on is not seriously pursuing that goal and doesn\u2019t come to grips with the urgent actions necessary to keep it alive,\u201d she said. Lock the Gate obtained the report under NSW government information public access laws. It was finalised in May last year, before the passage of the Minns government\u2019s climate laws. The chief executive of the science and policy institute Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, said to argue that the 1.5C heating goal would not be met, let alone the 2C, was a \u201cself-interested and self-reinforcing prophecy\u201d. \u201cOf course, if we don\u2019t take sufficient action and continue to approve new coalmines and gas fields then there is no way of limiting warming to 1.5C, 2C or even 3C,\u201d he said. The NSW Greens environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said it was \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d that a report described as a \u201cbest-practice checklist\u201d for cutting emissions from coalmines said it was generally accepted that the 2C goal would not be met. \u201cWhat confidence can we have that we are doing all we can, and what we are legally obliged to be doing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, if the advice government is commissioning starts with the wrong premise?\u201d The state climate change minister, Penny Sharpe, was approached for comment. Lock the Gate and the Australian Conservation Foundation said the report\u2019s advice about what coalmining companies should do to reduce emissions of methane \u2013 a particularly potent greenhouse gas \u2013 was inadequate. \u201cMuch of Australia\u2019s methane pollution comes from coalmines in New South Wales and Queensland, so it\u2019s a serious concern that this advice does not adequately address the urgent task of cutting methane emissions,\u201d said Piper Rollins, a methane campaigner for ACF. A spokesperson for the planning department said the checklist was used internally \u201cin reviewing air quality and greenhouse gas management plans\u201d that coal companies submitted for approval. \u201cCoalmine projects considered by the Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure undergo rigorous assessment to implement measures to minimise greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d they said. \u201cThe review checklist provides further rigour in the department\u2019s review of these management plans.\u201d The spokesperson said the document was not used in the assessment of new mines. They said in assessing mines the department relied on other guidelines and policies, including from the state\u2019s Environment Protection Authority. They said the planning minister, Paul Scully, had written to the NSW Independent Planning Commission to note the state\u2019s legislated net zero commitments and the EPA\u2019s draft greenhouse assessment guide for large emitters."

            "date": "2024-06-21T09:15:11Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s most hazardous nuclear site, Sellafield, has pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to cybersecurity failings brought by the industry regulator. Lawyers acting for Sellafield told Westminster magistrates\u2019 court on Thursday that cybersecurity requirements were \u201cnot sufficiently adhered to for a period\u201d at the vast nuclear waste dump in Cumbria. The charges relate to information technology security offences spanning a four-year period from 2019 to 2023. It emerged in March that the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) intended to prosecute Sellafield for technology security offences. Late last year the Guardian\u2019s Nuclear Leaks investigation revealed a catalogue of IT failings at the site dating back several years. Sellafield pleaded guilty to a charge that it had failed to \u201censure that there was adequate protection of sensitive nuclear information on its information technology network\u201d, the Financial Times reported. The Guardian reported last year that the site systems had been hacked by groups linked to Russia and China in December last year, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems. At the time, Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack. Paul Greaney KC, acting for Sellafield, told the court: \u201cIt is important to emphasise there was not and has never been a successful cyber-attack on Sellafield.\u201d Greaney added that Sellafield\u2019s systems were now robust and said media reports of hacks were \u201cfalse\u201d. An ONR spokesperson said: \u201cWe acknowledge that Sellafield Limited has pleaded guilty to all charges. \u201cThere is no evidence that any vulnerabilities have been exploited,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that due to ongoing legal proceedings the ONR could not offer further detail at this time. Sentencing is expected to take place on 8 August. The site has the largest store of plutonium in the world and is a sprawling rubbish dump for nuclear waste from weapons programmes and decades of atomic power generation. The Guardian investigation revealed a string of IT issues, including concerns about external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into its computer system while unsupervised. The investigation found problems had been known by senior figures at the nuclear site for at least a decade, according to a report dated from 2012, which warned there were \u201ccritical security vulnerabilities\u201d that needed to be addressed urgently. Sellafield\u2019s computer servers were deemed so insecure that the problem was nicknamed Voldemort after the Harry Potter villain, according to a government official familiar with the ONR investigation and IT failings at the site, because it was so sensitive and dangerous. At the time, Sellafield said that \u201call of our systems and servers have multiple layers of protection\u201d. \u201cCritical networks that enable us to operate safely are isolated from our general IT network, meaning an attack on our IT system would not penetrate these,\u201d a spokesperson said. Britain\u2019s public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, launched an investigation into risks and costs at Sellafield earlier this year. A spokesperson for Sellafield said: \u201cWe have pleaded guilty to all charges and cooperated fully with ONR throughout this process. The charges relate to historic offences and there is no suggestion that public safety was compromised. \u201cAs the issue remains the subject of active court proceedings, we are unable to comment further.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-08T15:00:49Z",
            "content": "Here\u2019s a familiar scenario. You\u2019re going to a meeting in an unfamiliar part of town. You\u2019re running late and it\u2019s raining. And there isn\u2019t a car park in sight. Ah, but here\u2019s some on-street parking and you gratefully pull into the empty bay. Now all you have to do is pay for a couple of hours and then scuttle along to your meeting. But the parking meter (of course) no longer takes coins. This is the 21st century, after all. No worries \u2013 you can pay by phone. There are notices plastered all over the meter on how to pay using an app that \u2013 of course \u2013 you have not yet downloaded. The rain is getting heavier and there\u2019s no mobile signal. You\u2019re getting increasingly flustered. And then you spot that there\u2019s a Quick Response (QR) code \u2013 a nice (if incomprehensible) square with lots of funny squares and spaces \u2013 on one side of the meter. Phew! All you have to do is scan it and you\u2019ll be through to a website in no time. So you do and you are. Job done. Relax. Er, possibly. Or possibly not. Because you were flustered, you probably didn\u2019t take a close look at the QR code. Was it an integral part of the payment instructions issued by the local council? Or had it been pasted over the official QR code? If it\u2019s the latter, then you\u2019ve been scammed. Just like David Birch\u2019s sister. Birch is a renowned expert on digital identity and he tells her story on his blog. On a visit to some friends, she parked her car in a public car park. \u201cShe went to look at the schedule of charges and there was a handy sign advising drivers with smartphones to pay via a QR code. She scanned the code and was directed to a superficially plausible website. After giving her debit card details to what she thought was a legitimate car parking company, my sister fortunately spotted that the website was wholly fraudulent and was able to alert her bank in time to block transactions. But plenty of other people are getting caught in these scams as QR codes are quickly becoming a favourite tool in the criminal fraternity, with one cybersecurity vendor saying that QR featured in a fifth of phishing campaigns it detected in the first weeks of the final quarter of last year.\u201d In the past few years, QR codes have become ubiquitous. It\u2019s now nearly impossible to board a plane without having a code on your phone, for example. Likewise, an increasing number of rail passengers have them instead of paper tickets. The imperative to go contactless during Covid really turbocharged the spread of the technology. Want to see the menu in a restaurant? Just scan a QR code. The codes are essentially two-dimensional barcodes, but have the advantage that they can carry a lot more information than their linear cousins. So they\u2019re genuinely useful. And so, so seductively convenient. But they\u2019re a security nightmare. Anyone can create one: just go to a free online service such as QR Code Generator, type in the URL you want to have coded and \u2013 bingo! \u2013 there\u2019s your magic square for reproduction on a business card, company stationery, website, blog, whatever. And of course these creative opportunities are also available to bad actors, particularly scammers looking for a way of directing you to malevolent websites without having to post their dodgy URLs in plain sight. Cybersecurity people have a term that denotes the target area for online crime: the \u201cattack surface\u201d. The wildfire spread of QR codes means that the global attack surface has been expanded by several orders of magnitude. It\u2019s now, in effect, infinite. Which probably explains why the US Federal Trade Commission has recently issued a consumer alert about the dangers of the technology. The alert does, naturally, mention the car parking scam, but focused more on those conducted via messaging systems. Examples include emails or texts containing a QR code accompanied by ostensibly plausible reasons why you may need to scan it. They couldn\u2019t deliver your package, perhaps, and you need to contact them to reschedule delivery. Or there\u2019s a problem with your account and you need to confirm your personal information. Or that some suspicious activity has been detected on your bank account, which means that you need to change your password. The key idea is to create a sense of urgency that the hapless victim will feel when they switch on their computer or smartphone first thing in the morning. Thus doth technology make suckers of us all. What can be done about it? Not much, really, except to try to inculcate in users a healthy scepticism towards the codes. Many smartphones now enable you to preview the URL that is concealed in a particular code before scanning it. There\u2019s plenty of sensible consumer advice on YouTube and elsewhere: think before you scan; never scan QR codes that come in emails or junk snail mail; be wary of shortened URLs (Bitly, TinyURL et al) because they conceal the actual address; never, ever give bank information to online services \u2013 and so on. Common sense, basically. Oh, and never forget the late Intel chief executive Andy Grove\u2019s celebrated injunction: in the digital world, only the paranoid survive. What I\u2019ve been reading Take a letter If You\u2019re Z, Here\u2019s What You See is a remarkably perceptive essay about gen Z by Timothy Burke on Substack.

            "content": "A Russian-speaking ransomware criminal gang called Qilin is thought to be behind the cyber-attack on NHS medical services provider Synnovis, that halted tests and operations at hospital trusts to a halt and affected GPs across London. Although the location of the group is unknown, if it is based in Russia, it will be difficult for British law enforcement to directly target it. The Russian state has long had a ban on extraditing criminals overseas, and since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it has largely ended all cooperation on cybersecurity matters so long as the hackers focus their attacks on foreign targets. Qilin has been active since October 2022, when it launched its first wave of attacks on companies including the French company Robert Bernard and Australian IT consultancy Dialog. It operates a \u201cransomware as a service\u201d approach, letting independent hackers use its tools and infrastructure in exchange for a 15 to 20% cut of the proceeds. The group was behind a previous attack on the publisher of the Big Issue in March this year, when it trashed the group\u2019s systems before stealing and publishing confidential data. More than 500GB of information taken from the publisher was posted on the dark web after it refused to pay the ransom, including passport scans of employees and payroll information. The group has steadily increased its activity over the past year, claiming responsibility for more than 50 hacks in the past four months. According to cybersecurity experts Secureworks, \u201cits attacks tend to be opportunistic rather than targeted and so good security hygiene is the best defence against Qilin and other similar groups\u201d. \u201cIn total, there have been 112 organisations posted to their site, and although information technology companies lead the way in terms of impacted industries, they have attacked organisations across a wide range of sectors,\u201d a Secureworks spokesperson added. In 2023, Qilin\u2019s typical ransom demand was anything from $50,000 to $800,000, according to Group-IB, a cybersecurity firm which infiltrated the group that year. It generally gains its initial foothold in its victims\u2019 networks through spear phishing, targeted messages to insiders to convince them to share credentials or install malware."

The 42-year-old Western Australian man is facing nine cybercrime charges and was due to appear in Perth magistrates court on Friday. Australian federal police allege the man created \u201cevil twin\u201d wifi networks \u2013 which mimicked legitimate networks \u2013 to trick users into entering their personal details. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The fake pages were allegedly set up at Perth, Melbourne and Adelaide airports, on domestic flights, and at other locations that police said were linked to the man\u2019s previous employment. Police launched an investigation in April after an airline reported its staff were worried about a suspicious wifi network that popped up during a domestic flight. Federal police said on Friday they had discovered a portable wireless device, laptop and mobile phone when they searched the man\u2019s baggage after he returned to Perth airport. The man was arrested and charged after a second search of his home in the Perth suburb of Palmyra. Police allege the man\u2019s fake wifi networks took users to a dummy page that asked for their email or social media login details. Those details were then saved to the man\u2019s devices and could be used to access other personal information, including the online communications, photos, videos or bank details. The 42-year-old has been charged with unauthorised impairment of electronic communication; possession of data with the intent to commit a serious offence; unauthorised access or modification of restricted data; dishonestly obtaining personal financial information; and a possession of identification offence. Det Insp Andrea Coleman, from the AFP\u2019s cybercrime division, said members of the public should be careful when logging on to public wifi networks. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to enter any personal details \u2013 such as logging in through an email or social media account,\u201d she said. Coleman advised anyone who tried connecting to free wifi networks in airports or on domestic flights to change their passwords and report any suspicious activity to the police. She also urged users of public networks to ensure they had taken personal cybersecurity precautions \u2013 such as refraining from logging on to banking sites and performing other tasks involving sensitive information, disabling filesharing on their devices and installing virtual private networks."

            "date": "2024-06-21T19:01:18Z",
            "content": "The government is considering striking back against Russian hackers who have stolen records covering 300m patient interactions with the NHS, including the results of blood tests for HIV and cancer, the Guardian can reveal. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is weighing up the possibility of taking retaliatory action against Qilin, the Russian-based ransomware gang who put into the public domain early on Friday a huge tranche of highly sensitive NHS records they stole in a cyber-attack on 3 June. Health service bosses in London, where the hack was focused, have responded to the widespread alarm that Qilin\u2019s action has caused by setting up a helpline to answer queries from anxious patients. They have urged patients who may have had details of care they received from the NHS trusts and GP surgeries affected in south-east London to \u201cnot contact your local hospital or GP practice to ask whether your data has been impacted by this attack as they do not hold this information\u201d. Qilin\u2019s action, which was an indication its demand for a reported $50m (\u00a340m) ransom had been ignored, has prompted discussions between the NCA and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) about how to respond. The government\u2019s communications centre, GCHQ, is thought to be aware of the conversations. A source with knowledge of the options being explored said: \u201cThere\u2019s a specialist [NCA] team behind the scenes working to access, understand and remove the data if possible.\u201d The NCA is contemplating taking action to remove as much of the data as possible that Qilin put on a messaging platform in the early hours of Friday morning, the source added. \u201cThat\u2019s being investigated and what\u2019s possible. [Action is likely because] it\u2019s effectively an attack on the state.\u201d Cybersecurity sources said the impact of any operation to reclaim the data, or take it down, could be lessened if the Qilin gang had already copied the files and was able to post them elsewhere. UK law enforcement has set a precedent for taking on ransomware gangs directly. The gangs represent a challenge for authorities because they are known to operate out of Russia or former Soviet states. However, the NCA recently disrupted the operations of the world\u2019s largest ransomware outfit \u2013 the LockBit group \u2013 in a joint operation with international partners. In February the agency said it had seized the entire \u201ccommand and control\u201d apparatus for LockBit, including the leak site where it displayed victims\u2019 hacked data. The operation also took control of the infrastructure behind LockBit\u2019s ransomware-as-a-service operation, in which affiliates lease out the malicious software, or malware, that infiltrates and disables victims\u2019 computer systems. The operation was carried out jointly with the FBI, Europol and a coalition of international police agencies and led to the unmasking of the gang\u2019s alleged leader, the Russian national Dmitry Khoroshev. The Guardian disclosed on Friday that the hackers had stolen far more data than previously thought. They obtained records covering 300m patient interactions with the NHS, including the results of blood tests for HIV and cancer. The attack has caused serious disruption for seven hospitals run by King\u2019s College hospital foundation trust and Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 foundation trust, two of the health service\u2019s biggest and busiest care providers. Qilin targeted Synnovis, a private/NHS joint venture that provides pathology services such as blood tests and transfusions. It is unclear at this stage if the hack involved only hospitals in those trusts or was more widespread, as Synnovis also undertakes work for other NHS trusts elsewhere in England. The two trusts had to cancel 1,134 planned operations, including cancer and transplant surgery, and postpone 2,194 outpatient appointments in the first 13 days alone after the attack, NHS England\u2019s London region said on Thursday. It is as yet unclear exactly what data, or how much of the haul, the ransomware group has made public. But well-placed sources said the stolen data included details of the results of blood tests conducted on patients having many types of surgery, including organ transplants; on those suspected of having a sexually transmitted infection; and on those who had had a blood transfusion. In a statement on Friday, NHS England said the NCA and NCSC were \u201cworking to verify the data included in the files published by the criminals. These files are not simple uploads and so investigations of this nature are highly complex and can take weeks, if not longer, to complete.\u201d However, the amount and sensitive nature of the data obtained by Qilin , as well as the gang making public at least some of what it took, has caused alarm among NHS bosses. NHS England said, in a warning that patients could now be targeted by criminals seeking a ransom: \u201cYou should always be alert to approaches from anyone claiming to have your data and to any other suspicious calls or emails, particularly if you are asked to provide personal or financial data.\u201d Anyone who is contacted in relation to their NHS data should immediately call Action Fraud, it added. The NHS\u2019s \u201cincident helpline\u201d went live on Friday and is available on 0345 8778967. In addition, in a development that will cause anxiety among patients who have received private healthcare in recent years, Qilin\u2019s haul is understood to include records of tests that people have had at multiple private healthcare providers. It is not clear which private healthcare firms Synnovis \u2013 a joint venture between the pathology firm Synlab and the two London acute hospital trusts \u2013 works for and if they include operators of the capital\u2019s array of private hospitals. The NHS is working hard to shift what care it can to other providers and has managed over the last week to increase the amount of blood tests it can do from 10% of the usual number to 30%. The fact that Qilin has locked Synnovis out of its own IT system means the hospitals and GP surgeries affected, which care for 2 million patients, are still having to severely ration access to blood tests. They can only do 30% of their usual numbers. Tim Mitchell, a senior researcher at the cybersecurity company Secureworks, said the data-posting signalled that the negotiation period had ended. \u201cFor the most part, by the time the data has been leaked the ransomware negotiations are generally over,\u201d he said. Synnovis has not confirmed whether it has held talks with Qilin."

            "content": "Is the country heading towards a recession? Ask 10 economists and you\u2019ll likely get 10 different answers. Which is why some people have given up on the traditional data \u2013 GDP, jobs, etc \u2013 and have instead recently been tinkering with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here are a few that I\u2019ve seen. Uniform patches One known economic indicator is jobs and for that we tend to rely on unemployment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But maybe there\u2019s something better. Like the number of uniform patches sold each year. Uniform patches? Yes, those are the emblems that go on the uniforms worn by millions of workers, from fast food cashiers to drywall contractors. The financial data of one of the world\u2019s largest makers of emblems and patches \u2013 privately held World Emblem \u2013 can\u2019t be easily obtained. But the company\u2019s owner recently told USA Today that sales are up 19% from the same period last year. A recession? \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing it,\u201d says Randy Carr, CEO of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe there would be.\u201d Men\u2019s underwear Ask any guy about underwear, and they\u2019ll usually admit the same thing. When times are good, we\u2019re buying the good material. When money\u2019s tight, we\u2019re wearing those things until they literally fall off. So do men\u2019s underwear sales mirror the economy overall? Some \u2013 including former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan \u2013 think so. If you want to check out how the men\u2019s underwear business is doing you can look at Hanesbrands or PVH Corp (which owns several leading brands, including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger) or Ralph Lauren Corporation. \u201cBottom\u201d line: men\u2019s underwear sales have been mostly flat over the past 12 months. Lipstick For the most part, lipstick is a relatively inexpensive accessory, with a typical tube costing anywhere from $5 to $20. History has shown that women will cut back on more expensive beauty goods like makeup and perfume when times are tight. But lipstick? Don\u2019t even go there. When lipstick sales increase as luxury beauty item accessories decrease, that\u2019s another potential sign of economic headwinds. Where to research lipstick sales? Try the big cosmetics companies like L\u2019Oreal, Estee Lauder and Ulta Beauty. All three companies have shown strong revenue gains over the past year. Overseas freight World shipping has a significant impact on our economy and instead of tracking units and cargo activity, some economists instead track the price of freight. Why? Because in a supply and demand world, the greater the demand for shipping, the more freight should cost. To track this phenomena, look no further than the Baltic Dry Index. This is a well-watched measure of freight costs for shipping items across the Baltic Sea, one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes. So how are freight costs doing? They\u2019re up more than 55% over the past year and even slightly higher than pre-Covid times. Recreational vehicles If you\u2019ve never taken a trip in a recreational vehicle (RV), you\u2019re missing out. It\u2019s fun and a great way to explore our national parks. Some economists think that RV sales are an economic indicator because RVs \u2013 a luxury item - are not only expensive to buy, but they come with high maintenance costs and tend to calculate gas usage by gallons per mile. So how\u2019s the RV industry doing? Judging by one of America\u2019s largest makers of these vehicles \u2013 Winnebago \u2013 not so great. Sales have been declining for the past few years and the company\u2019s stock price has fallen 35% in the past year. I\u2019m only scratching the surface on unusual economic indicators. Besides RVs you can follow the sales of champagne. Instead of men\u2019s underwear you can also track women\u2019s hemlines (which are believed to rise and fall along with the stock market). You can dig into the buttered popcorn index (which some say increases during times of recession as a small bit of a luxury in an otherwise cruel world). You can even keep track of hairstyles in Japan, where some say that women wear their hair longer when times are good and shorter when times are tough. Good luck finding this data, let alone making any sense of it. Goofy economic metrics like these are fun to talk about with your friends and colleagues. But they shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. I run a business, and my go-to economic indicator is my clients. I\u2019ve learned that the best way to insulate my business from the economy is to diversify: have as many clients in as many industries and geographic locations as possible. The US is a big country, and even when one client is cutting back on his underwear purchases in Illinois, I\u2019ll likely have another buying uniform emblems in Texas. Focus on this instead of lipstick."

            "content": "When he delivered his State of the Union address in March, Joe Biden framed the state of the American economy as a true success story, pointing to the historically low unemployment rate and falling inflation as signs of the country\u2019s robust recovery from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world,\u201d the US president said. \u201cAnd it takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it.\u201d As Biden frequently boasts, 15m jobs have been created since he took office, and the unemployment rate now stands at 4% after 41 consecutive months of job gains, following the longest stretch of sub-4% unemployment since the 1960s. Inflation has also cooled, after the annual consumer price index hit a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Stock markets have hit new highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average passing 40,000 points for the first time ever. The International Monetary Fund predicted last month that the US economy was on track to grow at double the rate of any other G7 nation this year. But so far, many Americans are not buying what Biden is selling. According to a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian last month, 56% of Americans wrongly believe that the US economy is in a recession, even though the country\u2019s GDP has grown in recent months. Republicans were more likely to hold that belief, with 67% of them saying the economy is in a recession compared with 49% of Democrats and 53% of independents. The survey continued a trend of Republicans reporting higher levels of pessimism about the nation\u2019s finances since Biden took office. But the relationship between political identity and consumer sentiment has actually been documented for decades, intensifying alongside partisanship in recent years. This political bias offers a partial \u2013 although far from complete \u2013 explanation for Americans\u2019 persistently dour opinions of the nation\u2019s finances. In recent weeks, the Guardian has dispatched reporters to key swing counties in battleground states, and voters representing a wide array of political views expressed disappointment with the higher cost of living. As LeMario Brown, a former city council member in Fort Valley, Georgia, and local pecan farmer, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re Republican or Democrat, we all got to eat.\u201d With less than five months left before election day, Biden must find a way to break through the gloom and sell his vision of economic success. A partisan split The partisan skew in perceptions of the economy dates back at least to the Reagan administration, as the University of Michigan\u2019s national consumer confidence data shows. With a Republican in the White House, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say the economy is strong, and the same principle applies when a Democrat takes office. Though the correlation between political identity and consumer sentiment has long been recognized by economists, it appears to have grown stronger in recent years. One study from the University of Florida, based on decades of data from the Florida Consumer Attitude survey, found that state residents reported notably higher levels of consumer confidence after their preferred party regained control of the White House. In the fall of 2016, after Trump won the presidential race, Republicans started expressing much more optimism about their personal finances. \u201cOver time, [these shifts] have gotten bigger and bigger* \u2026 It\u2019s true that, somehow, this kind of partisanship has been increasing,\u201d said Hector Sandoval, director of the economic analysis program at the University of Florida\u2019s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Sandoval noted that, in 2016, the shift in sentiment can be observed in the immediate month after Trump won the election in November, even though he did not take office until January. \u201cThat\u2019s even kind of striking because nothing has really happened [by this time],\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cThe change in power isn\u2019t until the next year, in January. But already by then you see how the consumer sentiment is changing a lot.\u201d Although Democrats\u2019 consumer attitudes have also been found to vary depending on the national political environment, Sandoval\u2019s research found this shift to be particularly pronounced among Republicans, a finding that has been corroborated by other studies. Ryan Cummings, who previously worked for Biden\u2019s council of economic advisers, and Neale Mahoney, who served as an adviser to the Biden administration\u2019s national economic council, refer to this pattern as \u201casymmetric amplification\u201d. According to an analysis by Cummings and Mahoney, the magnitude of the partisan bias on consumer sentiment is roughly two and a half times larger for Republicans compared with Democrats. In a phone call, Mahoney, now an economics professor at Stanford University, summarized the finding by saying that Republicans \u201ccheer louder and boo harder\u201d when their party controls the White House. Cummings and Mahoney found that this asymmetric amplification accounts for roughly a third of the gap between predicted consumer sentiment, based on current economic conditions, and observed consumer sentiment. In the Harris poll, Republicans were indeed more likely to incorrectly say that the economy is in a recession, but notably, nearly half of Democrats believed the same. So even when accounting for partisan bias, about two-thirds of the consumer sentiment gap remains. That has left economists \u2013 and many frustrated members of Biden\u2019s team \u2013 searching for answers. Beyond the politics Potential explanations for consumers\u2019 lingering pessimism have abounded as election day nears. Greg Ip, a Wall Street Journal columnist, has attributed the pessimism to what he calls \u201creferred pain\u201d, meaning Americans are casting their broader doubts and fears about the state of the world on to the economy. \u201cJust as one part of your body can hurt because of injury to another, pessimism about the economy may reflect dissatisfaction with the country as a whole,\u201d Ip wrote in November. \u201cLately, there has been a lot to be dissatisfied about: intensifying political and cultural conflict and intolerance, the pandemic, the border, mass shootings, crime, war in Ukraine and now the war in the Middle East.\u201d Another explanation touches on the role of the media, with some experts arguing that coverage of the economy has become skewed toward bad news. One recent study from Ben Harris and Aaron Sojourner of the Brookings Institution concluded that \u201ceconomic news has become systemically more negative beginning in 2018, with the negative bias growing over the past three years\u201d. A third school of thought addresses the long-term pain and general psychology around inflation. Although the most recent CPI data found that prices rose by 3.4% over the past 12 months, prices have increased by roughly 20% since 2019. So even as the rate of inflation has fallen, Americans are still adjusting to the overall rise in the cost of living over the past few years. Prices also show no sign of significantly decreasing, a phenomenon known as deflation that is generally associated with times of severe economic distress. A separate analysis from Cummings and Mahoney found that \u201cthe impact of inflation on consumer sentiment fades out with a decay rate of about 50 percent per year,\u201d meaning it takes a few years for the sting of a high inflationary period to substantially dissipate. \u201cThe impact of inflation this year is half as big as the impact last year, which is half as big as the impact in the year beforehand, so it has a half-life of basically one year,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cBut it takes two to three years for most of the impact of inflation to no longer show up in an analysis which connects inflation to consumer sentiment.\u201d That lingering effect can dramatically alter views on the economy because, to put it bluntly, consumers really hate high inflation. Research by Stefanie Stantcheva, an economics professor at Harvard University, found that high inflation triggered feelings of anger, fear and injustice. Respondents expressed a widespread belief that their wages were not keeping pace with inflation, resulting in decreased buying power for their households. Respondents do report receiving wage increases as the inflation rate rose, but people tend to associate those raises with their own job performance or career progression, rather than the higher cost of living, so they often feel like inflation is robbing them of their hard-won earnings. Interestingly, people also tend to believe that the salaries of higher-income individuals are better able to keep up with inflation, amplifying feelings of unfairness. \u201cAs a result, when you ask people about the emotions that are triggered when they see prices rise, it\u2019s a lot of stress, fear, anger,\u201d Stantcheva said. \u201c[That anger] tends to be directed at businesses [and] quite a lot at the government.\u201d The way forward? Behind Americans\u2019 doubts about the health of the economy are statistics that go beyond jobs and inflation rates. Understanding those metrics could be key to moving beyond some of the partisan perspectives. Despite the overall economic improvement, persistently high interest rates have increased the cost of carrying debt, adding to the burden of credit card bills and auto loans. Credit card debt hit a record high of $1.1tn in the final quarter of 2023, although that figure slightly declined in the first quarter of this year. Mortgage rates have come down marginally since last fall, when they reached a 23-year high, but their elevation has added to Americans\u2019 existing concerns that the goal of homeownership has moved permanently out of reach. Underlying these statistics is the grim reality of how they disproportionately affect lower-income families. Stantcheva\u2019s study found that lower-income Americans report being most adversely affected by high inflation, with some saying they have even delayed buying essentials to cope with rising prices. Her work builds on existing research suggesting that, though high inflation is loathed by all, the burden of the rising cost of living is not equally shared. Stantcheva\u2019s research also offers some insight into Americans\u2019 thoughts on building a fairer economic system. Like other recent surveys, respondents displayed broad support for a number of policy proposals that might address some of those concerns, including raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest households. Biden has called for such changes to the tax code, although he has struggled to get them approved by Congress, and he has incorporated his support for tax reform into his campaign messaging. The messaging could help Biden bridge the divide between his story of economic success and the reality that many Americans are not yet feeling the benefit of the recovery. \u201cWe don\u2019t know each person\u2019s situation, and the statistics just don\u2019t capture this very well,\u201d Stantcheva said. \u201cSo I think these feelings should not be dismissed at all. They should be taken quite seriously.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-06-14T14:38:50Z",
            "content": "The \u201cBridgerton effect\u201d has been hard to ignore since the drama first appeared on our screens, inspiring clothing and interiors trends with a period twist and helped make afternoon tea and visiting stately homes sexy. Now Netflix has put a big number on the worth of what it calls the \u201cBridgerton universe\u201d, suggesting the period romp produced by the company Shondaland has given a \u00a3275m shot in the arm to the UK\u2019s ailing economy over the past five years. Indeed, in a move that served to underscore the franchise\u2019s bankability, Shonda Rhimes \u2013 the chief executive of Shondaland and the veteran producer behind hits such as Grey\u2019s Anatomy \u2013 made a cameo in London\u2019s financial centre on Friday, opening trading at the London Stock Exchange. While the TV show, now into its third series, may offer escapism, Rhimes suggested its cultural impact was not to be underestimated. \u201cThe Bridgerton universe occupies a special space in culture, resonating with young and old alike, creating conversation, starting trends and influencing everything from baby names to weddings,\u201d she said. \u201cThe shows have had a seismic impact on the UK economy, boosting it by a quarter of a billion pounds over the last five years and supporting thousands of jobs and businesses.\u201d Netflix claimed the production had supported almost 5,000 local businesses over the past five years, with Rhimes stating that it was clear that the \u201cbusiness of art and culture can make a huge economic contribution to local communities\u201d. Anna Mallett, the vice-president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa production at Netflix, seconded Rhimes. \u201cAs well as an economic boost, the shows have had a huge cultural impact,\u201d she said. \u201cThe UK is our home and this is one part of our huge investment in creating stories our members will love.\u201d The \u00a3275m figure was calculated in-house by Netflix and includes direct and indirect spending, through money spent with other companies, getting it on to the screen. The upbeat message comes at a difficult time for UK film and TV studios, where jobs are going as the pandemic streaming boom unwinds. While it is not clear if Julia Hoggett is a Bridgerton fan, the London Stock Exchange chief executive said she was \u201cthrilled to celebrate the significant economic and cultural impact\u201d of the film and creative industries in the UK. The headline figure does not include other money-spinning activities piggybacking on the show, such as themed events and product ranges sold by retailers, or the likely tourism fillip as fans make pilgrimages to grand locations such as Castle Howard in Yorkshire and Ranger\u2019s House in Greenwich, London. This points to the \u00a3275m being a conservative estimate, as with its young glamorous cast the glossy drama is credited with spawning trend after \u201cRegencycore\u201d trend, with no sign of it running out of steam. Indeed a \u201cBridgerton tea party\u201d ranked highly in a recent Pinterest report looking at this summer\u2019s \u201chottest trends\u201d, with searches up 430% in April compared with a year earlier. Creative tea recipes were trending, it said, as people sought inspiration for what to serve and floral decor ideas. \u201cRegencycore\u201d is also still going strong on the high street with the upmarket London department store Liberty currently hosting an immersive Bridgerton pop-up and selling a dedicated fabric collection. The sumptuous interiors in the show are also said to be prompting the current craze for DIY panelling. While the series has given sales of, perhaps neglected, corsets, empire-waist and baby-doll dresses some oomph, the show\u2019s influence has now moved beyond fashion into beauty, with the online retailer Cult Beauty pointing to this summer\u2019s \u201cdefiant romance\u201d trend of blush cheeks and faux freckles. It is also behind new period-inspired looks for interiors and gardens. Beth Boulton, the marketing director at the home improvement specialist Eurocell, said that since the new series began airing, shoppers were searching online for wisteria plants, pergolas, water fountains and outdoor candles. \u201cThe show is synonymous with pots spilling with plants, and bright climbing flowers such as ivy and wisteria, that all add a sense of wonder to your garden,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-06-06T18:05:56Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s statistics watchdog has closed an investigation into remarks made by an official about the economy \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d that were cited by Rishi Sunak. It was looking into the comments made by chief economist of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last month amid concerns that politicians could misuse economic data in the run-up to the election. Grant Fitzner used the phrase in a briefing with journalists on 10 May after figures showed the UK was officially out of recession and that the economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of the year and became the basis of a Daily Mail front page story the following day. A week later Sunak, in an interview on the Radio 4 Today programme, repeated the words, telling listeners: \u201cThe facts are the facts. You had, I think, the person from the Office for National Statistics talking about the economic growth that the country produced in the first quarter of the year. He said what he said about that and I think he used the term \u2018gangbusters\u2019, so I will leave it at that.\u201d The UK Statistics Authority, chaired by Sir Robert Chote, said on Tuesday that it was investigating the remarks. However, the case was examined by a different watchdog, the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), which looked only at the ONS use of the term and not Sunak\u2019s. The OSR reported on Thursday that it had closed the case, but did not provide any further information on its findings, beyond referring the Guardian to a statement from the ONS, which said: \u201cThe use of the word \u2018gangbusters\u2019 was a passing reference used when our chief economist was discussing the first quarter\u2019s economic growth with journalists at our press briefing on release day. \u201cThe reference was made \u2013 paraphrasing a remark by a former Australian prime minister \u2013 as [first quarter] growth had come in stronger than commentators expected, with broad-based growth across services and manufacturing industries, and with quarterly growth at its strongest pace since the pandemic. \u201cIt was certainly not intended as a comment about the overall state of the economy and when the comment was made it was immediately clarified to those present that this was not a word that the ONS would use to describe the first quarter\u2019s growth. We also put the comment in context for journalists who followed up afterwards.\u201d Dario Perkins, a senior economist at the consultancy TS Lombard and former Treasury official, said it was unwise for the ONS to say the economy was growing quickly and wrong for the prime minister to use one quarter of GDP growth to argue that economic health had been restored. \u201cThe ONS is not supposed to use these kinds of descriptive words to tell a story about the economy. And it is also wrong to say the economy is booming in the first three months of the year when we have only just recovered lost growth from last year\u2019s recession and suffered the worst incomes squeeze in a generation.\u201d The OSR intervention came hours after Chote began a review of Sunak\u2019s claim in Tuesday night\u2019s leaders debate that independent civil servants calculated that Labour would raise taxes by \u00a32,000 for everyone should it win the election on 4 July. Labour has complained that the figure was wrong and was erroneously described as independently verified by Treasury civil servants. On Tuesday, hours before the TV debate between Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer, Chote wrote to the main political parties and top civil servants to warn them about \u201censuring the appropriate and transparent use of statistics\u201d. Chote previously ran the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, and was the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, a leading arbiter of government tax and spending policies. On Thursday, the UK Statistics Authority said the \u00a32,000 claim failed an \u201cintelligent transparency\u201d test and was misleading. It warned all parties to refrain from making exaggerated or misleading claims about tax and spending policies. \u2022 This article was updated on 6 June 2024 to replace an earlier version that carried the headline: \u201cUK statistics watchdog to investigate Sunak\u2019s use of term \u2018economy going gangbusters\u2019\u201d. The investigation by the UK Statistics Authority concerned remarks made by an ONS official during a briefing with journalists, not the repetition of those remarks by Rishi Sunak, as the previous version stated. This investigation was not personally carried out by Sir Robert Chote but, as the updated version makes clear, by the Office for Statistics Regulation."

            "date": "2024-06-03T05:06:36Z",
            "content": "Qantas is rolling out a new boarding regime that will see passengers split into six boarding groups as it seeks to fill its planes faster and to ensure they depart on time. The new boarding protocol will initially apply only to domestic flights on Airbus A330s and Boeing 737s \u2013 the workhorses of its domestic services between capital cities. The new system was put in place at Brisbane airport from Monday, and its introduction will be staggered throughout the month, coming into effect at Perth airport from 10 June, at Melbourne from 17 June and Sydney from 25 June. Qantas will now split passengers into six groups in an attempt to avoid the chaotic queues that form at gates when economy is called to board. Premium travellers and the most loyal customers will retain superior priority. Group one will include those in business class, frequent flyers with platinum or platinum one status, as well as travellers from the exclusive chairman\u2019s lounge. Gold frequent flyers will board as group two. However, instead of the traditional approach where the front and back half of the plane are called to board separately, the cabin will be split into quarters. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Group three will include everyone seated in the back quarter of the plane, progressing to group six, which consists of passengers in the front quarter of economy. Each passenger\u2019s group will be printed on their boarding pass, with scanners at the gate only permitting customers of a group already called to pass through. The new system is intended to speed up boarding and minimise congestion throughout the cabin as travellers in back rows are forced to wait while those in earlier rows stand to load luggage into overhead lockers or shuffle between seats. The Qantas domestic chief executive, Markus Svensson, said the change was the most significant change to boarding in a decade. \u201cGroup Boarding is designed to minimise the time our customers spend waiting to board and allows them to get settled more quickly,\u201d Svensson said. \u201cWe know how important on time departure is to our customers, so this process is also about doing everything possible to ensure we depart on time.\u201d Qantas noted similar boarding methods had already been implemented by rivals overseas. The airline\u2019s approach is in contrast to US carrier United Airlines, which last year announced it would board economy passengers by their seat, not just their row, as part of its multi group boarding stages. On United flights, window seat passengers board first, followed by those with middle seats, before aisle seat travellers board. The system is designed to minimise traffic in the cabin aisles by avoiding the need for already seated passengers to get up to allow a window seat passenger in. United believes its approach cuts its boarding times by two minutes a flight."

            "content": "We\u2019ve launched a separate live blog to cover tonight\u2019s presidential debate. In the meantime, here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: The supreme court issued three major decisions on cases involving OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, an air pollution rule by the Environmental Protection Agency and abortion access in Idaho. The court rejected Purdue Pharma\u2019s bankruptcy settlement plan that included an extraordinary measure to protect its Sackler family owners from further liability over the American opioid epidemic, in exchange for providing funds for compensation and rehabilitation treatment. The court cleared the way for Idaho hospitals to provide emergency abortions, for now, in a procedural order that left key questions unanswered and potentially delayed a final decision to beyond the November elections. The court also decided to put a hold on an attempt by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce harmful air pollution that drifts across state lines. The US district judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s prosecution for retaining classified documents, ruled that she would schedule a hearing to weigh excluding key evidence that forms the backbone of the obstruction-of-justice part of the case against the former president. Donald Trump and Joe Biden arrived in Atlanta ahead of tonight\u2019s debate. Jill Biden, the first lady, will watch the debate from a separate hold room. It is not clear if Melania Trump, the former first lady, is in Atlanta tonight. We\u2019ve come a long way from Milwaukee where, for the first Republican presidential primary debate (sans Donald Trump), the media were housed in a parking garage with outside porta-potties. For Joe Biden v Trump, reporters are perched high in Georgia Tech university\u2019s McCamish Pavilion, an Atlanta sports arena on a site that used to be known as the \u201cThrillerdome\u201d. There are plenty of bathrooms and two concessions available: one is selling hot dogs and giant pretzels; the other is that Republican favourite Chick-fil-A. The arena is festooned with CNN logos. Every available video screen says \u201cCNN presidential debate\u201d. Down below, on what would normally be a basketball court, there is a bright red carpet, more CNN branding and a CNN set where guests are being interviewed. After the debate this will become the melee that is known as the \u201cspin room\u201d. As grand as the setting is, the one thing reporters don\u2019t see at presidential debates is the candidates themselves. Biden and Trump will be inside a nearby studio without an audience. Reporters will be watching on TV like everyone else. On my way here I observed numerous surrounding roads have been closed to traffic to create a security bubble. On grass embankments, I saw numerous signs for Biden and Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 leaving Trump trailing in a poor third. Joe Biden is \u201cready to go\u201d and feeling \u201cconfident\u201d ahead of tonight\u2019s debate, according to his wife, Jill Biden. The first lady arrived at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia, where she was greeted by Democratic officials including Atlanta mayor Andre Dickens. She then made a brief stop at a Biden-Harris fundraising retreat in downtown Atlanta, where she told a group of supporters: We\u2019re almost there. I know Joe\u2019s ready to go. He\u2019s prepared; he\u2019s confident. You\u2019ve all seen him today. You know what a great debater he is. Joe Biden posted photos of him meeting with \u201cincredible\u201d supporters in Atlanta ahead of tonight\u2019s debate. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back,\u201d he wrote. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California and a lead Biden surrogate, stopped to talk to reporters at the McCamish Pavilion, a sports arena in Atlanta that has been turned into a media centre and post-debate spin room. I asked Newsom what difference muted microphones and lack of studio audience might make. \u201cI have a little bias because I did a debate here in Georgia without an audience and it\u2019s just better for the American people because now you\u2019re not playing to the audience, you\u2019re not just playing to a crowd in the room,\u201d he said. You\u2019ve got to create a framework of engagement that speaks to a much larger audience so that\u2019s a very healthy thing. It\u2019s a very good thing for the Biden campaign. We\u2019ll see how it plays out and same thing with the mic and talking over each other, which is part and parcel of Trump the bully, so that\u2019s a helpful and healthy thing too. From my perspective, in many ways Biden\u2019s already won this debate. First of all, it\u2019s on his calendar, it\u2019s on his timeline, he asserted himself and Trump blinked in every single category as it relates to this effort. I\u2019ve been really impressed and inspired by the Biden strategy so far. I wondered if Biden might miss the energy of the audience that fired him up at the State of the Union address. But Newsom insisted: Biden\u2019s a good debater. He\u2019s done a lot of these debates over many, many decades so one should not underestimate them. It was indicative of the Trump campaign completely flipping the last 72 hours, realising that they\u2019ve set such a low bar of expectation that if he even shows up at the podium that he\u2019s somehow confident he\u2019s going to win this campaign. So they start to panic a little bit in that respect, hedge bets, which is indicative of a little broader consciousness that Biden is very effective in these formats. I honestly have tremendous confidence in the outcome tonight - the message, obviously, the record and, more importantly, the vision. I hope we get to that. Joe Biden and Donald Trump will hold the first of two scheduled US presidential debates on Thursday, a high-stakes rematch between two well-defined political foes. The earlier-than-usual confrontation will give both men a chance to make their case for a second-term to what could be one of the largest television \u2013 and internet \u2013 audiences of the election cycle. Thursday\u2019s show down also carries the risk that Americans already dissatisfied with their options will come away even more dismayed. Polls show an extremely tight race between the 81-year-old incumbent and the 78-year-old former US president \u2013 and both candidates remain broadly unpopular. The 90-minute debate is scheduled to kick off at 9pm ET inside a CNN studio in Atlanta. Here\u2019s what to know and what to watch. Donald Trump was pictured stepping off his plane after it touched down at Hartsfield-Jackson international airport in Atlanta. Also seen exiting Trump\u2019s private plane were his campaign advisers Steven Cheung, Jason Miller, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, as well as his former campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski and the Florida congressman Matt Gaetz. It could be the moment when a rematch that few seem to want finally comes to life: like two ageing prizefighters, Joe Biden and Donald Trump will enter the arena of political bloodsport on Thursday evening to resume a verbal sparring bout that will revive memories of the ugly exchanges when the two debated face to face four years ago. A CNN studio in Atlanta will host the first presidential debate of the campaign between the same two candidates who contested the last election, which Biden won. With more than four months to go until polling day in November, it is the earliest in any US presidential campaign that a debate between the two main candidates has ever been staged. While some see the timing as premature, it could provide a chance to open up a contest that has become overshadowed by, among other things, Trump\u2019s recent felony conviction, as well as assorted other legal travails that see him facing 54 criminal charges for trying to overturn the last election and for retaining classified documents. Both candidates are deeply unpopular: Trump because his opponents see him as an aspiring dictator who threatens democracy, Biden because, at 81 (although just three years older than his Republican opponent), he is viewed \u2013 even among many Democrats \u2013 as too old for another term as president. Knife-edge polls indicate a race essentially tied, with a national polling average for May and June showing the candidates at 46% each. Polls in seven key battleground states \u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina \u2013 give Trump a narrow advantage, though usually within the margin of error. NBC News\u2019 Sahil Kapur writes that the debate hall is right next to the Kappa Sigma fraternity house at Georgia Tech, which is currently hosting a party under a sign that reads \u201cMake America DRUNK Again\u201d. A private plane carrying Donald Trump has touched down in Atlanta ahead of tonight\u2019s debate. The former president\u2019s plane was greeted by a group of his supporters on the tarmac. It is not clear if Melania Trump, the former first lady, will join her husband at tonight\u2019s debate. Melania Trump\u2019s office did not return a request for comment about whether she would be in Atlanta during the presidential debate, according the New York Times. The former first lady has largely been absent from the campaign trail this year, and she notably did not attend Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York. Donald Trump Jr, Trump\u2019s eldest child, will not attend the debate due to a family commitment involving his oldest daughter, according to NBC News, citing a source. Trump\u2019s second son, Eric Trump, is not expected to be in Atlanta for the debate, but Eric\u2019s wife, Lara Trump, will attend in her official capacity as Republican National Committee (RNC) chair, NBC reports. Jill Biden, the first lady, will be in Atlanta for tonight\u2019s debate, according to the Biden campaign. Jill Biden is expected to be the only Biden family member in attendance, according to the New York Times. She is expected to watch the debate from a separate hold room on the debate campus. After the debate, Biden and his wife are scheduled to stop by a nearby Democratic watch party, before flying to Raleigh overnight. Candidates traditionally bring along their family members for support during a debate. Less common: bringing a member of your opponent\u2019s family for support. On Thursday night, Donald Trump\u2019s niece, Mary Trump, will be in the post-debate spin room making the case for Joe Biden. Mary Trump, one of the former president\u2019s harshest critics, has warned that her uncle is a threat to democracy and should not be re-elected. She did not hold back. In a statement, she said: I\u2019m in Atlanta tonight to remind everyone who Donald is as a person and how he would rule as a president because the stakes are far too high for us to get this wrong: We cannot afford to allow Donald Trump anywhere near the levers of power again. Donald cannot be trusted and we must recognize that his last administration was simply a warm-up for much worse to come just as January 6th was a dress rehearsal for a man who will stop at nothing to ascend, once again, to this country\u2019s highest office. He is desperate for power and has shown himself both unworthy of wielding it and obsessed with regaining it purely for his own benefit. He must be stopped. Joining Mary Trump in the spin-room \u2013 a chaotic room where campaign staff and surrogates try to persuade reporters that their candidate won the debate \u2013 will be: Keisha Lance-Bottoms, former Atlanta mayor and a senior advisor on the Biden-Harris campaign Texas congresswoman Jasmine Crockett California governor Gavin Newsom California congressman Robert Garcia Former Louisiana congressman Cedric Richmond Georgia senator Raphael Warnock Joe Biden and Donald Trump will debate on Thursday for the first time this election cycle and it holds the potential for some history-making moments. Debates can inform voters on both the issues and temperaments of the candidates, potentially swaying an undecided voter toward one candidate\u2019s direction. They can also make for good TV, creating soundbites that resonate for decades to come. From the candidates\u2019 physical appearances to gaffes to planned attacks to off-the-cuff retorts, here are some memorable moments from US presidential debate history. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association (WHCA) has released a statement complaining that CNN rejected its request to include a pool reporter inside the studio during tonight\u2019s presidential debate. The WHCA \u201cis deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio\u201d, a statement by WHCA president and NBC correspondent Kelly O\u2019Donnell reads. The debate, which is being held on a closed set, will not feature an audience. Print pool photographers will be present for the entirety of the debate, while one print pool reporter will be permitted to enter during commercial breaks, according to CNN. The letter says: That is not sufficient in our view and diminishes a core principle of presidential coverage. The White House pool has a duty to document, report and witness the president\u2019s events and his movements on behalf of the American people. Donald Trump is on his way to Atlanta, where he is scheduled to land in about an hour. Trump aide Margo Martin, in a post to X, shared a video of the former president boarding his plane. Joe Biden has arrived in Atlanta ahead of tonight\u2019s presidential debate, where he was greeted by a crowd of supporters who chanted \u201cfour more years\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s go Joe\u201d, according to a pool report. While on Air Force One en route to Georgia, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House\u2019s press secretary was asked how the president feels about \u201cstanding toe to toe with his main adversary tonight\u201d. According to the Washington Post, replied: He likes to fight. He likes to fight for the American people. US district judge Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case, has granted a request from the former president\u2019s defense team to hold a hearing to challenge some of the evidence gathered against him. Cannon said she would schedule a hearing to consider whether prosecutors had improperly obtained the cooperation of Trump\u2019s lawyers through an exception to attorney-client privilege. From my colleague Hugo Lowell: But Judge Cannon also denied a defense request for a hearing on a separate claim that FBI officials had submitted false or misleading information to obtain a warrant to search Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents. The supreme court\u2019s ruling earlier today to allow Idaho hospitals to provide emergency abortions \u2013 for now \u2013 has left key questions unanswered and could mean a final decision is delayed to beyond the November elections. A draft decision in the case was briefly posted on the court\u2019s website yesterday and abruptly removed. The final version of the decision published today appeared to closely resemble the draft. Responding to the order, Joe Biden said the ruling ensures that Idaho women can get the care they need while the case continues to play out, adding: Doctors should be able to practice medicine. Patients should be able to get the care they need. The White House\u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said: No woman should be denied care or wait until she\u2019s near death or forced to flee her home state just to receive the healthcare she needs. Merrick Garland, the attorney general, said the justice department will continue pressing its case and using \u201cevery available tool to ensure that women in every state have access to that care\u201d. His statement reads: Today\u2019s order means that, while we continue to litigate our case, women in Idaho will once again have access to the emergency care guaranteed to them under federal law. Donald Trump has appeared to share his talking points for tonight\u2019s debate on his Truth Social platform. The post shows what appears to be a set of recommendations from Andrew Wheeler, Trump\u2019s former Environmental Protection Agency chief. Wheeler, in the post, advises Trump to pledge to reduce carbon emissions and to point out that Joe Biden rejoined the Paris climate accord, and \u201call that does is send American dollars overseas\u201d. Ammar Moussa, a Biden campaign spokesperson, shared Trump\u2019s talking points on Twitter/X, writing: Donald Trump is just posting his debate talking points. Thanks I guess. Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s anger and frustration at what he describes as his exclusion from the debate despite six qualifying polls and confirmed ballot access in five states \u2013 with Democratic legal challenges to his inclusion in five more, including one in New Jersey under the state\u2019s \u201csore loser law\u201d \u2013 comes as Democrats accuse him of being a political stooge for Republicans. Biden supporters worry Kennedy\u2019s famous name and his history of environmental advocacy could sway voters from the left. His family members are largely against his candidacy, which they have made clear in public statements and by visiting the Biden White House en masse on St Patrick\u2019s Day in March. But Republicans also have not welcomed his quixotic intervention in a tight race that could serve to siphon off vital votes from both candidates. Donald Trump has described him as \u201cfar more LIBERAL than anyone running as a Democrat, including West and Stein\u201d, referring to third-party candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the independent US presidential candidate polling at about 8%, won\u2019t be at tonight\u2019s Biden-Trump TV smackdown in Atlanta. But he\u2019s not taking the diss quietly, and has accused debate host CNN of colluding with the major party campaigns to exclude him. In an email statement on Wednesday, the Kennedy campaign claimed that 71% of Americans want to see him on the debate stage, and in an act of counter-programming he plans an alternative \u201creal\u201d debate on Elon\u2019s Musk\u2019s Twitter/X platform at the same time. \u201cThe American people want leaders who trust them to make up their own minds,\u201d Kennedy said. Instead, our last two presidents are restricting voters from choosing anyone other than themselves. Presidents Biden and Trump have sucked trillions of dollars from the pockets of working people and Americans deserve to hear from the one candidate who can hold them to account. Young voters were key to Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. And they helped forestall a Republican \u201cred wave\u201d in 2022. But recent polling suggests the 81-year-old president may have a problem with the youth of America. One theory for the shift is that young people don\u2019t have strong memories of Trump\u2019s presidency. Some who will vote for the first time this year were just 10 when the reality-TV star was first elected. They have only ever known polarization and politics in the age of Trump. One gen Z-led group is working to remind their peers of what the Trump presidency was like. Ahead of the debate, the group is warning viewers not to believe what the former president is telling them. \u201cDonald Trump \u2013 a criminally convicted liar \u2013 will undoubtedly lie about his destructive record and alarming agenda tonight,\u201d said Santiago Mayer, the 22-year-old founder and executive director of Voters of Tomorrow. Trump will try to distract us from the fact that his presidency was the worst thing to happen to gen Z in our lifetime. The group has launched, ironically, GenZforTrump.org, as a resource for young people to fact-check the former president, whose relationship with the truth has always been \u2026 casual. Responding to the Harrington v Purdue Pharma decision, several state attorneys general issued statements praising the court\u2019s ruling. Josh Stein, the attorney general of North Carolina, said in a statement reported by Reuters: Purdue and the Sacklers must pay so we can save lives and help people live free of addiction. If they won\u2019t pay up, I\u2019ll see them in court. William Tong, the attorney general of Connecticut, whose office first sued and eventually agreed to the deal, said: The US supreme court got it right \u2013 billionaire wrongdoers should not be allowed to shield blood money in bankruptcy court \u2026 We will be front and center again in any new negotiations. Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator for Massachusetts, said the supreme court\u2019s ruling blocking Purdue Pharma\u2019s bankruptcy settlement plan was a \u201cfirst step towards accountability for the Sackler family\u201d. The Sacklers \u201cmade a fortune from hooking people to opioids that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, and then tried to use the bankruptcy system to keep their money,\u201d Warren said in a statement posted to social media. The Supreme Court closed this bankruptcy loophole, but that doesn\u2019t make things right for the millions of people who have lost loved ones to opioid overdoses. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Sacklers to pay up.\u201d Opponents of the Purdue Pharma settlement praised the court\u2019s decision, while some called on the justice department to seek criminal charges against members of the Sackler family. Mike Quinn, who represents Ellen Isaacs, whose son Ryan died after becoming dependent on Oxycontin and who filed a brief in support of the plaintiffs in the supreme court case, said: This is a victory for all Americans \u2013 a victory for everybody that wealthy wrong-doers don\u2019t have the right to receive liability and write the law, that anybody can stand up against them and protect their rights under the constitution. Ed Bisch, whose son Eddie died from an overdose after taking OxyContin, said he would have accepted the deal if he thought it would have made a dent in the opioid crisis. A statement to AP read: This is a step toward justice. It was outrageous what they were trying to get away with. They have made a mockery of the justice system and then they tried to make a mockery of the bankruptcy system.\u201d In a statement following the supreme court\u2019s Harrington v Purdue Pharma decision, the company described the ruling as \u201cheart-crushing\u201d. Members of the Sackler family branches who own Purdue suggested they plan return to negotiations. A statement to AP reads: While we are confident that we would prevail in any future litigation given the profound misrepresentations about our families and the opioid crisis, we continue to believe that a swift negotiated agreement to provide billions of dollars for people and communities in need is the best way forward. Edward Neiger, a lawyer representing more than 60,000 overdose victims, said the court\u2019s decision was a major setback. \u201cThe Purdue plan was a victim-centered plan that would provide billions of dollars to the states to be used exclusively to abate the opioid crisis and $750m for victims of the crisis, so that they could begin to rebuild their lives,\u201d Neiger said in a statement. As a result of the senseless three-year crusade by the government against the plan, thousands of people died of overdose, and today\u2019s decision will lead to more needless overdose deaths. The supreme court, in its decision to reject Purdue Pharma\u2019s bankruptcy settlement plan earlier today, blocked a controversial deal that would have protected the Sackler family from further liability over the US opioid epidemic, in exchange for providing funds for compensation and rehabilitation treatment. The 5-4 decision, written by Justice Neil M Gorsuch, was voted on non-ideological lines. It was backed by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A Alito Jr, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Brett M Kavanaugh, Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented. The deal was constructed to allow Purdue, the Connecticut company behind the prescription opioid OxyContin, to restructure and also shield the relevant Sackler billionaires without them having to declare personal bankruptcy. As part of the deal, the Sackler family had agreed to contribute $6bn to the settlement from the vast fortune they made from OxyContin and give up ownership. Court filings showed that 95% of creditors in the Purdue bankruptcy case had agreed to sign on to the plan, although many reluctantly, partly seeing it as the only way to finally get some recompense. But several states, Canadian municipalities and Indigenous tribes, and more than 2,600 individuals, including high-profile activists, were opposed. Today\u2019s ruling now leaves matters between the company and plaintiffs unresolved. The case is seen as having consequences for other corporate bankruptcies where company owners or officials want immunity from liability. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer left the door open to a presidential run in 2028 when Katie Couric asked her about her plans for the political future during a session this morning at the Aspen Ideas festival. Whitmer is often mentioned as one of the top Democratic contenders to be the next president. Noting she had a tough job for the next two and a half years, Whitmer said: I\u2019m making no plans right now and then I\u2019ll see what happens next. She added: Maybe there\u2019s someone I\u2019m gonna be excited about. Maybe another scenario. That\u2019s as far as I am down that path. She also weighed in on whether Joe Biden could face trouble in Michigan, a key battleground state, from its large concentration of Arab-American voters. More than 100,000 people voted uncommitted in the Democratic primary in the state amid concerns over how Biden handled the war in Gaza. While Whitmer said the Biden campaign was \u201cnot thrilled\u201d about that result, she said she actually thought it was a positive thing because \u201cpeople were able to register their discontent and it opened up a line of communication.\u201d Whitmer also acknowledged that she thought \u201cwe can do more\u201d to make American voters understand that Biden gets their concerns about the economy. Congress is facing increasing pressure to withdraw its invitation to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is set to speak on Capitol Hill next month. Robert Tait reports for the Guardian: A group of prominent Israelis \u2013 including a former prime minister and an ex-head of Mossad, the foreign intelligence service \u2013 have added their voices to the growing domestic calls in the US for Congress to withdraw its invitation to Benjamin Netanyahu to address it next month, calling the move \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d. The plea, in an op-ed article in the New York Times, argues that the invitation rewards Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s current prime minister, for \u201cscandalous and destructive conduct\u201d, including intelligence failures that led to last October\u2019s deadly Hamas attack and the ensuing bloody war in Gaza which shows no sign of ending. \u201cCongress has made a terrible mistake. Mr Netanyahu\u2019s appearance in Washington will not represent the State of Israel and its citizens, and it will reward his scandalous and destructive conduct toward our country,\u201d the article\u2019s six authors argue in a blistering critique that also accuses the Israeli prime minister of failing to secure the release of scores of hostages taken in last year\u2019s attack and still held captive. For the full story, click here: Pro-democracy groups gathered at the Wisconsin state capitol Thursday morning to call on the resignation of Robert Spindell, a Republican who served as a pro-Trump false elector in 2020, from the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Spindell has also bragged about GOP voter suppression efforts in Milwaukee. In an email first reported in January 2023, Spindell wrote that Republicans could be \u201cespecially proud of the City of Milwaukee (80.2% Dem Vote) casting 37,000 less votes than cast in the 2018 election with the major reduction happening in the overwhelming Black and Hispanic areas.\u201d During public comments before the Wisconsin Elections Commission, speakers decried Spindell\u2019s participation in the false elector scheme and his comments about voters of color. \u201cYou wanna know what\u2019s exhausting? Living in a country where people get to live above the law,\u201d said Nick Ramos, director of the watchdog group Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. In response to comments calling on his resignation, Spindell made repeated reference to \u201cMilwaukee\u2019s white Democrats,\u201d who he blamed for voter suppression in Milwaukee. Individuals who served as false electors in Arizona and Michigan are facing prosecution over their role in Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Earlier this month, Wisconsin attorney general Josh Kaul filed felony charges against two attorneys involved in the false elector scheme; the ten Wisconsin false electors, including Spindell, have not yet been charged. I\u2019m sitting in a packed auditorium here at the Aspen Ideas Festival where attendees are packed in to hear from Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, who is speaking with journalist Katie Couric. Talking about her childhood, Couric brought up how Whitmer was a troublemaking teenager and even once threw up on her high school principal from drinking. \u201cNot my best day,\u201d Whitmer said to laughs. She then paused and took a shot at Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor who has come under fire for sharing a story about killing her pets. \u201cI\u2019ve never executed any dogs or goats,\u201d Whitmer said, prompting more laughter. I couldn\u2019t make it out exactly, but one woman in front of me whispered to her friend, \u201cshe\u2019s got my vote.\u201d Joe Biden and his allies are leaning heavily into their message that Donald Trump represents a threat to democracy in the final hours leading up to tonight\u2019s debate. The Democratic National Committee plans to run a mobile billboard around the debate venue in Atlanta, with the featured ad highlighting Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and the reversal of Roe v Wade. The DNC has also placed ads on five billboards near the debate venue to spotlight Trump\u2019s policy proposals and his recent felony conviction in New York. \u201cAs Donald Trump prepares to lie for 90 straight minutes on the debate stage this evening, the DNC is already on the ground in Atlanta to remind voters of how he tried to undermine Georgia\u2019s democracy, threatens to leave working families behind again, and is hellbent on ripping away reproductive freedoms,\u201d DNC spokesperson Abhi Rahman said. \u201cTonight, voters across the country will see the clear choice in front of them, and they will make Trump a loser once again in November.\u201d The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee has issued a similar statement following the supreme court\u2019s Idaho abortion case decision, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s SCOTUS ruling reiterates that state legislatures remain the arbiters of abortion access. The best defense against Republicans\u2019 assault on reproductive freedoms is to elect Democrats to state legislatures who will champion reproductive care and counter GOP extremism. The balance of power in the states is especially important given the supreme court remains hostile to reproductive freedoms and has demonstrated a repeated willingness to catapult extreme GOP state laws to the national stage to become law of the land \u2013 as they did with Dobbs.\u201d Reproductive Freedom for All has issued a response to the supreme court\u2019s decision on Idaho\u2019s emergency abortion case, saying: \u201cThe court could have upheld this basic right, but they refused to. Instead, the conservative majority kicked the case back to a lower court, punting so that they didn\u2019t need to weigh in before an election where attacks on abortion access are already top of mind for voters. While the Biden administration is fighting tooth and nail to ensure people can get the emergency abortion care they need, anti-abortion extremists will continue to do whatever they can to stop them. Let this serve as a reminder of what\u2019s at stake this November.\u201d The supreme court on Thursday issued three major decisions on cases involving OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, an air pollution rule by the Environmental Protection Agency and abortion access in Idaho. In a 5-4 decision, the conservative-majority court rejected Purdue Pharma\u2019s multi-billion dollar settlement that would have shielded the wealthy Sackler family from future lawsuits over the country\u2019s deadly opioid epidemic, but would have also provided compensation and rehabilitation funds to victims. In his opinion, conservative justice Neil Gorsuch wrote: \u201cThe Sacklers seek greater relief than a bankruptcy discharge normally affords, for they hope to extinguish even claims for wrongful death and fraud, and they seek to do so without putting anything close to all their assets on the table.\u201d In a separate 5-4 decision, the court put on hold an attempt by the EPA to reduce air pollution from power plants in \u201cupwind\u201d states that would affect air quality in \u201cdownwind\u201d states. Along with industry allies, Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana have been challenging the EPA\u2019s rule. Conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court\u2019s three liberal justices, in dissent, wrote that the court \u201cjustifies this decision based on an alleged procedural error that likely had no impact on the plan.\u201d Meanwhile, in a victory for reproductive rights activists, the court dismissed a case over whether emergency room doctors can perform abortions to save a pregnant woman\u2019s life. The court\u2019s 6-3 decision marks a win for the Joe Biden administration, for now, as the case is returned to a lower court and potentially delays a final decision until after the election. Idaho had tried to have the procedure exempted from the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The supreme court has dismissed a case that sought to block emergency abortions in Idaho, a state with a near-total abortion ban. The court\u2019s decision marks a win for the Joe Biden administration, for now, as the case is returned to a lower court and potentially delays a final decision until after the election. Idaho had tried to have the procedure exempted from the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The court\u2019s 6-3 decision, which came after a version of the ruling was prematurely posted on to its website yesterday, reinstates a lower court\u2019s decision that EMTALA takes precedence over Idaho\u2019s abortion ban. Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas were in the minority opinion. In its second decision of the morning, the supreme court has blocked Purdue Pharma\u2019s multi-billion dollar bankruptcy settlement. The settlement would have excused and shielded the wealthy Sackler family and their company Purdue Pharma, maker of the highly addictive opioid OxyContin, from lawsuits surrounding the country\u2019s opioid epidemic. The decision came at 5-4, with Brett Kavanaugh, John Roberts, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissenting. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is wrong on the law and devastating for more than 100,000 opioid victims and their families,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. In its first decision of the morning, the supreme court has issued a ruling that puts on hold the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s enforcement of an air pollution rule. With a 5-4 decision with Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting, the decision grants states the application to put the EPA\u2019s rule on hold as the case moves to the lower courts. The EPA\u2019s \u201cgood neighbor\u201d rule seeks to restrict air pollution from power plants in \u201cupwind\u201d states that would affect air quality in \u201cdownwind\u201d states. Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 campaign has launched a new website landing page in attempts to underscore the threat of Donald Trump\u2019s Project 2025. The launch comes in response to Trump\u2019s blueprint of policy proposals that could dismantle and disrupt the US government while replacing career staff with political loyalists. \u201cProject 2025 is the plan by Donald Trump\u2019s Maga Republican allies to give Trump more power over your daily life, gut democratic checks and balances, and consolidate power in the Oval Office if he wins. Trump\u2019s campaign advisors and close allies wrote it \u2013 and are doing everything they can to elect him so he can execute their playbook immediately,\u201d the page reads. It goes on to break down the various ways Trump \u201cis planning to reach into your daily life and how his extreme Maga allies are planning to consolidate power.\u201d The website\u2019s new landing page launch comes ahead of the first presidential debate tonight between Trump and Biden where the current president is expected to highlight the various threats surrounding Project 2025. Here is a look at some of the major decisions the supreme court has issued so far this term: On Wednesday, the court struck down a lower court ruling, in turn allowing the federal government to request the removal of misinformation from social media platforms. Earlier this month, the court upheld access to the common abortion pill mifepristone, marking a major victory for reproductive rights activists since the court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago. The court, in a 8-1 ruling - with conservative justice Clarence Thomas dissenting - also upheld a federal ban that prevents domestic violence abusers from possessing guns. In a setback for gun control activists, the court struck down a federal ban on \u201cbump stock\u201d accessories for guns, which allow semiautomatic firearms to fire as quickly as machine guns. Good morning, The supreme court is set to issue another set of opinions today at 10am which may include major decisions on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential immunity case and whether states are allowed to carry out emergency abortions. So far, the conservative-majority court this term has upheld access to the common abortion pill mifepristone, upheld a federal ban that prevents domestic abusers from possessing guns, struck down a federal ban on \u201cbump stock\u201d accessories for guns, as well as a struck down a lower court ruling to allow the federal government to request misinformation removal from social media. The decisions for major cases that have yet to be released include Trump\u2019s immunity petition from the federal charges he faces over the 2020 presidential election interference, as well as whether hospitals in states with abortion bans are required to perform emergency abortions \u2013 a case fought between the Joe Biden administration and the state of Idaho. According to a report from Bloomberg, the court\u2019s alleged opinion on the Idaho abortion case \u2013 which would allow for emergency abortions in the state \u2013 was briefly posted on the court\u2019s website on Wednesday. Here are other developments in US politics: The first presidential debate between Biden and Trump is set to take place this evening in Atlanta, Georgia. Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg is set to testify before the House\u2019s transportation and infrastructure committee. Renowned polling expert Nate Silver has predicted a 66% chance of Trump winning the 2024 presidential election."

The final straw was last Wednesday\u2019s desperate \u201cdebate\u201d (it was no such thing) between the two leaders, one of whom will be our prime minister as of Friday. Who on earth thinks there is any value in the increasingly impolite exchange of unsubstantiated claims and counter-claims? There cannot be a single other person who behaves in this way in their professional place of work, and what connection does any of this have to the day-to-day role of being an effective leader and prime minister? Time for change indeed. Richard Bryant London \u2022 According to Thomas Jefferson, democracies get the government they deserve \u2013 and I believe that includes the campaign, the candidates and the level of debate as well. The only people to blame for the standards in our democracy are we, the voters. We chose to vote for a known liar just because he promised to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. (He didn\u2019t.) We rejected Ed Miliband because he looked a bit silly eating a bacon sandwich, and we rejected Neil Kinnock because he refused to reduce complex arguments to soundbites and was labelled the \u201cWelsh windbag\u201d. We demonise the most vulnerable in our society because the rightwing press tell us to. So I disagree with your headline that voters deserve better. We are getting exactly what we deserve. Daryl Birden Great Dunmow, Essex \u2022 Future leaders\u2019 debates would be improved if the concept of \u201chead to head\u201d, which invites combat, were replaced by a format more likely to promote civilised discussion. Rather than standing behind podiums, participants should be seated in armchairs, with interruptions prevented by cutting off their microphones when it is not their turn to speak.

            "title": "How politics affects the wine we drink",

            "content": "Touraine Rouge Le B\u00e9cassou, Domaine des Echardi\u00e8res, Loire, France 2023 (\u00a310.50, thewinesociety.com) It\u2019s never going to be a subject that comes up on the doorstep, and it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone posing a question about it at a local hustings or TV debate. Still, wine, like everything else, does have a political dimension and the decisions taken by whichever party takes power on Thursday 4 July will affect those who drink and make it. The most common legislative interventions involve duty. Successive governments have tended to view alcohol, like tobacco, as a convenient and politically neutral place to raise tax revenues: the Office of Budget Responsibility reckons the current duty regime will bring in \u00a316.1bn by 2028/29. Last year, the Tories added another dimension: pegging duty to alcoholic strength. In wine that\u2019s already had the effect of increasing the number of wines coming in below the 11.5% threshold where a higher rate kicks in \u2013 no bad thing when they\u2019re as delightfully fragrant and refreshing as Domaine des Echardi\u00e8re\u2019s summery Loire Malbec. Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Discovery Collection Chilean Semillon, Apalta, Colchagua Valley, Chile 2023 (\u00a310.50, Sainsbury\u2019s) The problem with pegging duty to alcohol level is that it effectively penalises conscientious producers operating in traditional, warmer wine regions where the combination of grape variety and climate makes it very hard to make a quality wine below 13% or 14% alcohol. It\u2019s a matter of how much sugar the grapes accumulate by the time they have reached what winemakers call full \u201cphenolic\u201d or \u201cflavour\u201d ripeness. The temptation, certainly at the lower end of the market, is to pick the grapes too early, before the grapes are properly ripe, and to leave a few grams more sugar in the finished wine rather than converting it all (or almost all) into alcohol during fermentatoin. That leads to wines that may avoid the higher rate of duty, but which are an awkward mix of sweet, hollow and harshly green. With ever-hotter vintages, the problem is only getting more acute, although, with thoughtful work in the vineyard and the right choice of grape variety, making a relatively light wine is not impossible: witness Sainsbury\u2019s arrestingly incisive fresh, mineral, peachy new 12.5% white from the very warm Colchagua Valley in Chile. Vinteloper s/h 19 Shiraz, Adelaide Hills, Australia 2019 (\u00a337.95, thewhiskyexchange.com) Winemakers in Chile are among those who are most concerned about an increasingly hot political issue all over the world: water rights. With water scarcity now acute in many of the world\u2019s wine regions, governmental decisions both local and national about who gets access to water, and who doesn\u2019t, are much on winemakers\u2019 minds: when push comes to shove, wine is always going to come below more essential agricultural crops and the needs of urban populations. This is, of course, just part of a more general concern about climate change, and the extreme weather events that accompany it. The fate of Vinteloper in Australia\u2019s Adelaide Hills, whose 2019 vintage of their gorgeously fluent, herby-spicy shiraz, is the last before they lost their vineyards to wildfires (it continues with grapes bought elsewhere) is the sort of thing that should focus the minds of legislators everywhere on addressing what is, for everyone, and despite its strange absence on the UK election trail, by far the most consequential political issue of the day.

            "content": "Yet another election; yet more promises to put things right, to make everything better; yet more politicians telling us that they are listening and will enact our concerns and needs; yet more excuses and denials about broken promises and things not done; yet more politicians telling us that they are totally right and the other lot are totally wrong. Who to believe? Most of us know the country is broken. All of us know, depending on our political persuasion, who is to blame \u2013 it\u2019s the other lot. Yet it\u2019s not that simple. Rory Stewart almost put his finger on it in describing that he left parliament after having five ministerial posts in four years and being unable to complete his job in any of them (I\u2019d like to say Johnson and Brexit made me quit politics. But they were symptoms of the problem, not the cause, 3 June). He is not alone: during the past 14 years we have had five prime ministers, seven chancellors of the exchequer, eight foreign secretaries, eight home secretaries and countless other senior and junior ministers. How could any of them have the time to do a proper job? Our broken country illustrates that none of them have been able to see their briefs through. This experience has shown us that the once proud \u201cnatural party of government\u201d is no longer capable of actually governing. One can only hope that Keir Starmer\u2019s desire to change this country includes giving ministers time to do their jobs, as well as the stability that all competent governments need. John Robinson Lichfield \u2022 One can sympathise to some extent with Rory Stewart\u2019s depiction of the complexity of juggling roles as a government minister, MP, parliamentarian and parent. If even a beneficiary of the splendid advantages he enjoyed was unable to find a way through this thicket, perhaps the system in which he flourished and then floundered does need fixing. In the meantime, the core of Stewart\u2019s northern constituency has now been incorporated into the new Penrith and Solway, and I doubt that he would be greatly enamoured of his erstwhile party\u2019s current candidate here, a man who, notably, stood as the Ukip candidate for Workington in 2015. As a member of the constituency Labour party, I am more than just hoping that the people of Penrith will awake on 5 July to find that they have a non-Tory MP for the first time in almost 75 years. Our task is made harder by the cynicism and dismay expressed on the doorstep by many of Stewart\u2019s former constituents, who have lost whatever faith they had in politicians and for whom Stewart doesn\u2019t quite manage to conceal his mild disdain. Ian Smith Loweswater, Cumbria \u2022 At the recent Hay festival, I listened to Rory Stewart defining his Toryism as respect for the monarchy and a love of dry\u2011stone walls in Cumbria. What he neglected to say was that dry\u2011stone walls were the result of the 18th\u2011 and 19th-century enclosure of common land, in effect a privatisation of the landscape that Margaret Thatcher would have admired. This forced landless labour to move away, many to the growing cities, where they were exploited by slum landlords and factory owners. No wonder Mr Stewart and his friends like dry-stone walls. They are fossilised remnants of class struggle. Prof emeritus Peter J Atkins Durham \u2022 I remember being disappointed when Rory Stewart joined the Tories. There always seemed to be more about him than that. Diana Morgan Chichester \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "content": "Reaction to the news that Julian Assange had agreed to plead guilty to a single charge under the Espionage Act in order to go free came from various parts of the US political spectrum on Tuesday. James Clapper, director of US national intelligence in 2010 when Assange and his WikiLeaks organization published secret US intelligence documents with a consortium of newspapers including the Guardian, told CNN: \u201cI actually think this came out pretty well \u2026 Critical to this was his plea of one count of espionage. \u201cHe\u2019s paid his dues,\u201d Clapper added. \u201cThere was a damage assessment done at the time \u2013 there was concern but I don\u2019t recall direct proof that assets in Afghanistan and Iraq supporting or helping the US were exposed.\u201d Former Republican vice-president Mike Pence, however, described Assange\u2019s plea deal as \u201ca miscarriage of justice and dishonors the service and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces and their families\u201d. \u201cJulian Assange endangered the lives of our troops in a time of war and should have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d Pence said, adding: \u201cThere should be no plea deals to avoid prison for anyone that endangers the security of our military or the national security of the United States. Ever.\u201d The liberal film-maker Michael Moore, who put up a $20,0000 bond in 2010 for Assange\u2019s release on bail, said this was a \u201chappy day\u201d. Moore said of Assange: \u201cThe good people of this world will never forget your sacrifice.\u201d He continued, saying that Assange \u201cwould face no further harassment or threats from the American government. Although 14 years of his life were stolen from him by a government of, yes, war criminals, they were never able to lay a hand on him. \u201cHopefully, someday, this country of ours will apologize to him for this torture. In the meantime, let us all draw from him the kind of courage that is needed during our darkest times of aggression and the funding of foreign slaughter with our tax dollars,\u201d Moore added. \u201cIt is also my hope that we will sometime soon return to having a vital and vibrant press that exists to uncover the lies and protect us, the citizens, from those who would seek to end our democracy.\u201d Former congresswoman and Iraq veteran Tulsi Gabbard said: \u201cThis should never have happened, but finally, Julian Assange is free.\u201d The press freedom group PEN America, which had long called for the charges to be dropped, said it welcomed the resolution of the case. \u201cThe US government\u2019s pursuit of charges against Julian Assange under the Espionage Act has posed an alarming threat to press freedom in the United States and globally, sending a chilling message to journalists and risking emboldening authoritarian governments,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe charges targeted activity routinely undertaken by journalists in the course of their work to expose wrongdoing and hold the powerful to account. It is critical that his guilty plea on the single count not be construed as setting a precedent for further prosecutions or convictions of journalists under the Espionage Act.\u201d It called for reform the Espionage Act to include an exception for information disclosures that advance the public interest. President Biden and his Republican challenger, Donald Trump, have yet to comment on the plea deal. In April, Biden said he was \u201cconsidering\u201d dropping the charges against Assange and the US extradition attempt. The state department later deflected over the progress of talks. \u201cOne of the crimes that Julian Assange is charged with is helping Chelsea Manning hack into government systems,\u201d state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, \u201cwhich as far as I\u2019m aware has never been considered a legitimate journalistic practice.\u201d During his presidency, Trump reportedly asked for legal options on how to resolve the case. At an extradition hearing in London in 2020, lawyers for Assange said Trump had offered Assange a pardon if he said Russia was not involved in leaking Democratic party emails. Assange\u2019s lawyers alleged that during a visit to London in August 2017, the former US congressman Dana Rohrabacher told the WikiLeaks founder that \u201con instructions from the president, he was offering a pardon or some other way out, if Mr Assange \u2026 said Russia had nothing to do with the DNC [Democratic National Committee] leaks\u201d. The allegation was denied by Rohrabacher."

            "content": "Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, the disgraced former president of Honduras, has been sentenced to 45 years in prison for enabling drug traffickers to use his military and national police force to help ship tons of cocaine into the United States. US federal judge P Kevin Castel sentenced Hern\u00e1ndez to 45 years in a US prison and fined him $8m. A jury convicted him in March in a Manhattan federal court after a two-week trial, which was closely followed in his home country. \u201cI am innocent,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said at his sentencing. \u201cI was wrongly and unjustly accused.\u201d Castel called Hern\u00e1ndez a \u201ctwo-faced politician hungry for power\u201d who protected a select group of traffickers. Hern\u00e1ndez was in a full green prison uniform as he stood in court with his lawyers. Two US marshals stood behind him. Prosecutors had sought a sentence of life in prison, plus 30 years. Hern\u00e1ndez, 55, was the first former head of state to be found guilty of drug trafficking in the United States since the Panamanian strongman Gen Manuel Noriega was convicted in 1992. His conviction marked a spectacular fall from grace for a president who was once considered one of Washington\u2019s top allies in the region. Hern\u00e1ndez served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. He was arrested at his home in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, three months after leaving office in 2022 and was extradited to the US in April of that year. US prosecutors say Hern\u00e1ndez worked with drug traffickers as long ago as 2004, taking millions of dollars in bribes as he rose from rural congressman to president of the national congress and then to the country\u2019s highest office. During closing arguments, one prosecutor told the court that Hern\u00e1ndez had \u201cpaved a cocaine superhighway to the United States\u201d. In his testimony, Hern\u00e1ndez acknowledged that drug money was paid to virtually all political parties in Honduras, but he denied accepting bribes himself. Hern\u00e1ndez insisted in a lengthy statement made through an interpreter that his trial was unjust because he was not allowed to include evidence that would have caused the jury to find him not guilty. He said he was being persecuted by politicians and drug traffickers. \u201cIt\u2019s as if I had been thrown into a deep river with my hands bound,\u201d he said. Trial witnesses included traffickers who admitted responsibility for dozens of murders and said Hern\u00e1ndez was an enthusiastic protector of some of the world\u2019s most powerful cocaine dealers, including the notorious Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is now serving a life prison term in the US. His brother, Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, a former Honduran congressman, was sentenced to life in a US prison in 2021 for his own conviction on drug charges."

            "content": "European politicians, already drowning in multiple crises of their own, were left shell-shocked and aghast at Joe Biden\u2019s meandering performance in Thursday\u2019s presidential debate, aware that a second Trump term had drawn that much nearer \u2013 with all that this implies for the rise of populism in the continent, the future of Nato, and for Ukraine and the Middle East. The voices of despair came from across the mainstream political spectrum, interspersed with the odd call for Europe to prepare even more intensively for a Trump second coming. \u201cAmerican democracy killed before our eyes by gerontocracy,\u201d Guy Verhofstadt, a member of the European parliament and a former prime minister of Belgium, posted on X. The German CDU foreign policy specialist Norbert R\u00f6ttgen said: \u201cThis night will not be forgotten. The Democrats have to rethink their choices now. And Germany must prepare at full speed for an uncertain future. If we don\u2019t take responsibility for European security now, no one will.\u201d The Polish foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, issued the most delphic advice about the importance of planning succession. \u201cMarcus Aurelius was a great emperor but he screwed up his succession by passing the baton to his feckless son Commodus (he from the Gladiator). Whose disastrous rule started Rome\u2019s decline. It\u2019s important to manage one\u2019s ride into the sunset.\u201d Whether Barack Obama or Biden was cast in the role of Aurelius was unclear. Dr Leslie Vinjamuri, the director of the Americas programme at the Chatham House thinktank, who is deeply immersed in Democratic politics, struggled to make a case for Biden\u2019s defence, even though she said she regarded his policy performance as strong. \u201cIt is universally agreed this was a very challenging debate,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Biden had a very slow start and struggled throughout \u2013 admittedly in a very difficult format. To be in a room for 90 minutes without any audience is gruelling and not what President Biden was able to meet.\u201d Although she accused Trump of engaging in fact-free debate on pretty much every issue, she felt the debate \u201cwill leave most Americans despairing\u201d. In a tweet she was more blunt, saying: \u201cAmerica and Americans are best when they see a problem, seize on it, find a solution. Make it happen.\u201d Carl Bildt, a co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank and a former Swedish prime minister, said Biden\u2019s performance was so bad that the ECFR\u2019s six published warnings about Trump\u2019s foreign policy was \u201cnow required reading\u201d. One of the warnings is that a deep nightmare lurks beneath the potential foreign policy shocks that Trump would cause. Bildt said an international coalition \u201ccould emerge as a framework for populists in Europe to establish special ties with Trump\u2019s Washington. Trump\u2019s re-election might well embolden the populist right in Europe to obstruct common EU policies and initiatives more forcefully.\u201d Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, of Germany\u2019s liberal FDP, told the Rheinische Post: \u201cThe fact that a man like Trump could become president again because the Democrats are unable to put up a strong candidate against him would be a historic tragedy that the whole world would feel.\u201d Indeed, one of the messages being conveyed directly to the White House was that this was about not just America but the world. In Italy, the former prime minister Matteo Renzi said simply: \u201cJoe Biden can\u2019t do it.\u201d He wrote on X that Biden had served the US with honour, adding: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve an inglorious ending, he doesn\u2019t deserve one. Changing horses is a duty for everyone.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry gave no response to Trump\u2019s ominous remarks during the debate that Kyiv had taken too much military aid from the US, and his reference to Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a \u201csalesman\u201d. Trump repeated his claim that had he been president in 2022, Russia would not have launched the full-scale invasion, and he said a peace settlement would be agreed between his election in November and inauguration in January. Moscow affected indifference, saying Vladimir Putin had not woken up specially to watch the debate. The Russian official press was less merciful. \u201cBiden unexpectedly misspoke multiple times and stammered. Democrats have already called his performance a failure,\u201d the state news agency RIA concluded while leaving Trump free of criticism. In the UK, Rishi Sunak said the only debate he was interested in was the one he was holding with Keir Starmer about Labour\u2019s plans to raise taxes. Silence emanated from David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, whose imminent period in office is destined to be defined by America\u2019s choice in November. He has made strenuous efforts to meet all shades of Republicanism, and even argued that Trump may not be as bad as some predictions. But one of Lammy\u2019s closest allies, Ben Rhodes, who was among Barack Obama\u2019s most senior aides, posted: \u201cJust think about what that debate looked like to people and leaders around the world \u2026 Telling people they didn\u2019t see what they saw is not the way to respond to this.\u201d"

            "content": "When Joe Biden and Donald Trump secured enough delegates to lead the Democratic and Republican party presidential tickets in November, they confirmed what many voters expected but fewer actually wanted: a redo of the 2020 election. Republicans skeptical about giving Trump a second shot tried in vain to elevate a viable primary opponent. Powerful donors, including the Koch-aligned Americans for Prosperity Action, poured money into former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley\u2019s campaign, but Haley was unable to claw enough support away from Trump to pose a threat to the former president. So for the first time in more than 50 years, the Republican party will rerun a candidate who already lost a general presidential election \u2013 the last time that happened was in 1968, when Richard Nixon, who had lost the 1960 general presidential election, ran again and won. It has been even longer since a presidential candidate faced a true rematch. When was the last presidential rematch? The last time Americans voted in a contest between the same two presidential candidates as the election before was in 1956, when the Republican Dwight Eisenhower and the Democrat Adlai Stevenson faced off for the second time in four years. Eisenhower, a former military officer famed for his triumph as a second world war general, beat the Stevenson, who was known as cerebral and humorless (\u201cEisenhower a Typical Man of Action And Stevenson a Man of Thought,\u201d read a 1952 New York Times headline), in a landslide in 1952. During his first term, Eisenhower, an anti-communist, backed the regime changes in Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954 \u2013 replacing elected leaders with authoritarian regimes. The same year, he signed the Communist Control Act, which made the Communist party illegal in the United States, calling it a \u201cconspiracy dedicated to the violent overthrow of our entire form of government\u201d. On domestic economic issues, he governed as a moderate, expanding social security benefits to millions of people and creating the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (later renamed the Department of Health and Human Services). By the end of his first term, Eisenhower had grown elderly but remained popular. Stevenson scraped by in the Democratic primary but lost resoundingly in the 1956 general election by an even wider margin than the first time around, with Eisenhower winning more than 57% of the vote, 457 electoral college votes and all but seven of the states.

Elected in 1884, Cleveland was the first Democrat to win the presidency after the civil war. The former New York governor had crusaded against corruption in politics and was active in the economically conservative, pro-business \u201cBourbon Democrat\u201d movement. In the lead-up to the election, Cleveland\u2019s supporters lobbed allegations of corruption against his opponent James Blaine, questioning Blaine\u2019s financial dealings with railroad companies. Republicans, in turn, hammered on allegations that Cleveland had secretly fathered a child during an illicit affair with a waitress \u2013 their respective alleged moral failings became central to the 1884 campaign. The personal attacks ignored a deeper, fundamental moral corruption in American politics and society. As historian Henry Graff observed in his biography of Cleveland, the president\u2019s first campaign took place amid Jim Crow and the backlash to Reconstruction-era policies granting equal rights to Black Americans: \u201c[R]acism was rampant in the country\u201d with formerly enslaved Americans facing \u201cdiscrimination and segregation and, increasingly in the South, lynching\u201d, while the genocidal conquest of Indigenous lands continued into the end of the 19th century. \u201cThe campaign,\u201d wrote Graff, \u201cavoided these pressing and shameful matters.\u201d Cleveland won the popular vote narrowly and picked up 37 more electoral votes than Blaine. During his first term, Cleveland advocated for, but ultimately failed to enact tariff reform \u2013 a key issue of his first campaign. He viewed his post as president as an administrative one and was reluctant to act forcefully. He ran for re-election in 1888 against the Republican Benjamin Harrison, narrowly winning the popular vote but losing the electoral vote resoundingly. Determined to hold office again, Cleveland decided to run for president in the 1892 cycle, campaigning again in opposition to tariff hikes. A few important things had changed in the four years that Cleveland was out of office. The Populist party, which advocated an eight-hour workday and benefits for veterans, was drawing increasing support from the Republican voters who prioritized those issues. Meanwhile, Harrison\u2019s wife, Caroline Harrison, was dying of tuberculosis. During Caroline\u2019s illness, Harrison had refrained from campaigning, and when she died two weeks before the election, the other candidates stopped campaigning out of respect, too. Cleveland won by a wide margin in both the popular vote and electoral college, making him the only president to come back and win after losing to the same candidate four years earlier. What lessons can Cleveland\u2019s non-consecutive presidencies teach us about Biden v Trump? Cleveland\u2019s example shows it\u2019s possible for an ex-president to claw the office back after losing it to the same opponent. But it\u2019s also a tricky comparison: Cleveland was, according to Graff, \u201cthe very symbol of rectitude and incorruptibility\u201d and didn\u2019t face a barrage of criminal indictments or a well-coordinated opposition campaign like Biden\u2019s. Meanwhile, his supporters may have agreed with him on economic issues, but they were hardly fanatics. \u201cCleveland had fans but it wasn\u2019t like there was a Cleveland cult,\u201d said Pasley. \u201cHe just happened to be the last successful Democratic president.\u201d"

Earlier in the day the pro-business DA said it would vote for Ramaphosa as part of an agreement with the former liberation movement to form a unity government.

The deal was struck amid criticisms that the DA favours the interests of South Africa\u2019s white minority, something it denies. The ANC lost its parliamentary majority in the 29 May elections for the first time since it swept to power in 1994 at the end of apartheid. Its vote share collapsed from 57.5% in 2019 to 40.2%, as supporters defected to breakaway parties amid chronic unemployment and worsening public services. The DA, which received almost 22% of the vote, will back Ramaphosa\u2019s election by lawmakers for a second term, while its MPs will also vote for an ANC speaker of parliament in return for the position of deputy speaker, its leader, John Steenhuisen, told a press briefing. \u201cToday, the DA becomes a party of national government,\u201d Steenhuisen said, after the legislators were sworn in at a convention centre in Cape Town, while the parliament buildings are still being renovated after a fire in 2022. \u201cThrough their votes, the people have made it clear that they do not want any one party to dominate our society. The people have also told us that the time for finger-pointing is over and that the time for a new politics of collaboration and problem-solving has arrived.\u201d An ANC-DA coalition was favoured by large businesses and international investors, with Ramaphosa, 71, expected to continue to try pushing forward policies such as allowing the private sector to generate renewable energy, which has contributed to a fall in power cuts. Negotiations will continue after Friday on policies and cabinet positions, Steenhuisen said, adding that the two-week period after election results that the constitution mandates for the election of a president was not long enough to reach a full coalition agreement. A \u201cstatement of intent\u201d signed by the ANC and DA includes a commitment to a \u201cmerit-based, nonpartisan and professional civil service\u201d. The DA has long criticised the ANC appointment of its supporters to public sector positions, known in South Africa as \u201ccadre deployment\u201d, claiming it fosters corruption. Two smaller parties, the Inkatha Freedom party (IFP), a Zulu nationalist party, and the Patriotic Alliance (PA), which wants to bring back the death penalty and deport illegal immigrants, have also said they will join the government. The inclusion of the IFP, which received 3.8% of the vote, is viewed as a way to deflect criticism of the ANC for working with the white-led DA. The PA, led by the self-described reformed bank robber Gayton McKenzie, received 2% of the vote and has its support base in South Africa\u2019s Coloured communities. The ANC\u2019s vote share collapsed in large part due to the new uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, named for the ANC\u2019s armed wing during apartheid. It came a surprise third in the election with 14.6% of the vote, just six months after it was launched by the former president Jacob Zuma, who has feuded bitterly with Ramaphosa since being forced to resign the presidency in 2018. The MK party, which wants to replace constitutional democracy with parliamentary supremacy, boycotted parliament\u2019s opening, after a legal challenge to the election results was rejected by the country\u2019s top court. It has said it would not work with the ANC while it is led by Ramaphosa, who said that potential coalition partners needed to respect the constitution. Meanwhile, the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who were sworn in as MPs in their trademark red overalls, some wearing hard hats and rubber boots, were among the parties that turned down Ramaphosa\u2019s call to join a Government of National Unity (GNU). Malema, the EFF leader, who founded the Marxist party in 2013 after he was expelled by the ANC while its youth leader, said it would not join a government with the \u201cneo-colonial\u201d DA, which he labelled \u201cour enemy\u201d. Some ANC politicians and supporters had favoured a coalition with either or both the EFF and MK, viewing them as political and ideological relatives. Ramaphosa\u2019s call for a GNU, however, was in keeping with his cautious political approach, some analysts said, and positioned the ANC as inclusive, with parties that didn\u2019t join excluding themselves."

            "title": "Anti-Trump Republican Adam Kinzinger endorses Biden for president",
            "date": "2024-06-26T15:09:42Z",
            "content": "The former Republican representative Adam Kinzinger has endorsed Joe Biden for president, as the Biden campaign attempts to win over anti-Trump voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election. In a video released on Wednesday, Kinzinger said he was a \u201cproud conservative\u201d who had put \u201cdemocracy and our constitution above all else. \u201cAnd it\u2019s because of my unwavering support for democracy that today, as a proud conservative, I\u2019m endorsing Joe Biden for re-election,\u201d Kinzinger said. Kinzinger warned that former president Donald Trump poses a \u201cdirect threat to every fundamental American value. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about our country. He doesn\u2019t care about you. He only cares about himself,\u201d Kinzinger added. Biden acknowledged Kinzinger\u2019s endorsement in a reply on X. \u201cThis is what putting your country before your party looks like. I\u2019m grateful for your endorsement, Adam,\u201d Biden said. Kinzinger\u2019s announcement has received predictable flak from far-right Republicans. In a reply to the endorsement, Representative Majorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said: \u201cOh look, Kinzinger finally came out of the closet. As usual, we knew all along, so not a surprise and none of us care.\u201d Kinzinger has remained one of the most staunch Republican critics of Trump. Following the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Kinzinger publicly denounced Trump for inciting \u201can angry mob\u201d with false claims of stolen election results. Kinzinger was also among 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. Later, Kinzinger and Republican representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming were the only two Republicans who joined a committee to investigate the Capitol insurrection. Kinzinger later announced he would not seek re-election in 2021 after facing a potential primary challenge from a pro-Trump candidate due to changes in district mapping. In a February interview with the Guardian, the former congressman warned that a second Trump term would be \u201cdevastating for the world order\u201d. \u201cThe best-case scenario is a completely inept, ineffective government,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cThe worst-case scenario is look, in his four-year term, he did not understand what he was doing. He was just trying to survive and he actually listened to people around him until the end. Now he\u2019s going to put people around him that share his views, that will only reaffirm his views and, frankly, some of these people are pretty smart and they know how to work around the constitution or around the law to bring these authoritarian measures in.\u201d Kinzinger\u2019s announcement comes weeks after the Biden-Harris campaign announced that Kinzinger\u2019s former chief of staff Austin Weatherford would be running the Biden campaign\u2019s outreach to Republican voters."
