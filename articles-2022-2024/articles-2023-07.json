            "content": "The US has issued a warning over possible efforts to interfere with Guatemala\u2019s presidential election result, after the country\u2019s top court ordered ballots from the first-round vote be reviewed, setting up the potential for a recount. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington had endorsed findings from observers over the vote\u2019s validity, and said undermining the outcome would be a \u201cgrave threat to democracy with far-reaching implications\u201d. Guatemala\u2019s top court on Saturday ordered ballots from the 25 June election to be reviewed after the frontrunner\u2019s party and allies challenged the results. Sandra Torres, a former first lady who won the first round, has alleged votes were manipulated. Bernardo Arevalo, who bucked forecasts to become a close runner-up to Torres, described Torres\u2019s vote review request as lacking legal merit and endangering the electoral process. Guatemala\u2019s supreme electoral tribunal said it would abide by the court decision and instruct its local branches to review the ballots within five days. The European Union, which monitored the vote and backed the results announced by the electoral tribunal, called on Guatemala\u2019s institutions and political parties to respect the electoral process and what it called the \u201cclearly manifested will of citizens\u201d. The Organization of American States (OAS) said that its observers had witnessed \u201ca satisfactory election day, in which citizens expressed their will, members of the electoral board facilitated the vote, and political parties inspected the vote at every stage\u201d. The OAS echoed calls for the results to be recognized, saying: \u201cRespect for the citizens\u2019 will as expressed at the ballot box is a democratic imperative which must be upheld, honouring the decision already made by the voters.\u201d In a public statement addressed to the international community, Guatemala\u2019s Foreign Ministry requested respect for its sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs. It also said the government respected the independence of its electoral authorities and judicial branch."

            "title": "US investigators zone in on Trump election-plot lawyer John Eastman",
            "date": "2023-07-04T10:00:12Z",
            "content": "John Eastman, who was in the vanguard of lawyers plotting schemes involving \u201cfake electors\u201d and other ploys to help Donald Trump thwart Joe Biden\u2019s win in 2020, is now under close scrutiny in federal and state investigations of Trump\u2019s drives to stay in power, and faces possible disbarment in California, say former prosecutors. The former California law professor is one of several lawyers whose legal stratagems have been heavily examined by Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s accelerating investigation into Trump and his allies\u2019 efforts to block Biden from taking office. The fake electors scheme was a central part of Trump\u2019s strategy to reverse his defeat. It was called that because Republican electors in seven key battleground states signed certificates falsely declaring themselves \u201cduly elected and qualified\u201d to affirm Donald Trump won the 2020 election. But Eastman has drawn scrutiny too in an overlapping inquiry in Georgia by Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis, who is expected to bring criminal charges in August against Trump and some of his legal gurus. The federal and Georgia inquiries have zeroed in on Trump legal advisers including Rudy Giuliani, who helped oversee the fake electors plot, and ex-justice department official Jeffrey Clark. Trump tried briefly to elevate Clark to attorney general in order to prod Georgia and several other swing states to substitute fake Trump electors for ones Biden actually won. Smith\u2019s inquiry, which encompasses Trump\u2019s inflammatory talk to a rally that Eastman and Giuliani also addressed before the Capitol attack on January 6, has accelerated with grand jury testimony from former vice-president Mike Pence and ex-chief of staff Mark Meadows. Smith has also gained cooperation from two Nevada fake electors who have testified before a Washington grand jury. Moreover, investigators from Smith\u2019s office interviewed Giuliani under a \u201cproffer\u201d arrangement, which does not preclude charges against him, seeking to ferret out details about the fake electors plotting and related schemes, as the New York Times reported. Former DoJ prosecutors say Smith\u2019s inquiry is making notable progress. \u201cThe pace of activity in the special counsel investigation into the fake electors scheme seems to be quickening,\u201d with significant cooperation from key witnesses and a focus on Trump\u2019s top legal advisers, former DoJ prosecutor Michael Zeldin told the Guardian. Other ex-prosecutors also see Smith\u2019s inquiry gaining steam. \u201cBy obtaining testimony from fake electors, Smith may be better able to nail down what information and advice passed between these soldiers in the larger scheme and those Trump lawyers who helped to concoct it,\u201d said Dan Richman, a law professor at Columbia and an ex-prosecutor in New York. \u201cTestimony that, say, electors were advised to make false statements or given deliberately misleading advice would go far to showing a deliberate fraud by Trump\u2019s \u2018brain trust\u2019 of lawyers, including Eastman.\u201d Richman added: \u201cGiuliani\u2019s willingness to give a proffer likely reflects his desire to avoid charges by showing a lack of an intent to defraud. Smith\u2019s readiness to accept the proffer likely reflects his interest in hearing what Giuliani had to say and avoiding a grand jury proceeding at which Giuliani might well invoke his fifth amendment privilege.\u201d Other DoJ veterans see Meadows\u2019 grand jury testimony as significant. \u201cThe cooperation of Meadows has the potential to help put a stake in the heart of Trump and other high level insurrectionists,\u201d said Paul Pelletier, a former acting head of the DoJ\u2019s fraud section. Smith, who was tapped as special counsel last November, and others at the justice department have spent months conducting their sprawling inquiry into Trump\u2019s zealous efforts to cling to power, and his coterie of legal advisers. Last summer, federal agents seized the cell phones of Eastman and Clark, whose home was also raided. A harbinger of the potential legal headaches for Trump and his elite lawyers came late last year when a House panel that spent months investigating Trump and the January 6 insurrection and produced an 845-page report, referred Trump to the DoJ for prosecution, plus Eastman, Giuliani, Clark and lawyer Kenneth Chesebro. The referrals did not mandate DoJ action, but provided substantial evidence against Trump and those lawyers. The panel\u2019s referral accused Trump of criminally engaging in \u201ca multi-part conspiracy\u201d, citing four specific crimes that seems to track what special counsel Smith is looking into: making false statements, obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and aiding or comforting insurrection, all of which were referred to the DoJ for prosecution. All four lawyers were referred for conspiring to defraud the United States. Except for Giuliani, the others were cited for conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, referring to Congress certifying Biden\u2019s win on 6 January. The panel noted when Eastman addressed the \u201cstop the steal\u201d rally on January 6 he floated a wild conspiracy theory about \u201csecret folders\u201d in voting machines that were used to cast votes for Democrats. The report also discussed a \u201ccoup memo\u201d authored by Eastman which proposed avenues Pence could use to assist Trump in reversing his election loss, including unilaterally throwing out certain state electoral college votes. At House panel hearings, Pence\u2019s then counsel Greg Jacob testified that Eastman acknowledged to him that his push with Trump to get Pence to reject Biden\u2019s winning electoral college count would violate the Electoral Count Act, and that Trump too was informed that if Pence tried to block Biden\u2019s certification it would be illegal. This June, Jacob testified at California bar hearings weighing disbarment of Eastman for making false public statements about voter fraud in the 2020 elections, and misleading courts. At the hearings, Jacob charged that Eastman\u2019s advice to Pence \u201cbrought our profession into disrepute\u201d. Eastman has denied breaking any laws, stating that he was engaged in \u201cgood faith\u201d advocacy on a legal question that was not settled. Trump and the other lawyers referred for DoJ prosecution have all also denied violating any laws. But ex-federal prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig said he doubted Eastman will escape prosecution completely. \u201cIt will be surprising, indeed, if neither of those investigations ends in a criminal charge against Eastman, as well, possibly, as other lawyers and Trump himself.\u201d But more broadly, DoJ veterans say it is unclear exactly what charges Smith may bring. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether the false electors scheme will serve as the basis of a standalone indictment or whether it will be merged into a broader case involving the multiple ways Trump and his allies attempted to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election,\u201d former DoJ inspector general Michael Bromwich told the Guardian \u201cA standalone case may have less jury appeal than a case in which it is one of many sets of tactics used to overturn the election,\u201d he added, but noted that \u201ca broader case will almost inevitably be longer, more complex, include numerous defendants, and be more difficult to try.\u201d Any new federal charges against Trump would come on top of the 37-count indictment of Trump by Smith for retaining hundreds of classified and national security documents after he left office, and obstructing investigators seeking to retrieve them. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denounced the charges and the other probes as \u201cwitch-hunts\u201d. Still, the Georgia inquiry into efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s win there seems likely to create more headaches for Trump and some of his legal advisers. Willis has indicated that Giuliani, who testified after receiving a subpoena before a special grand jury, is a target of her broad inquiry. Eastman was reportedly advised by his own lawyer that he was probably a target and invoked the fifth amendment when subpoenaed to testify. A key focus of Willis\u2019s inquiry has been Trump\u2019s high-pressure call on 2 January 2021 to Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, beseeching him to just \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 votes to overturn his loss to Biden in the state. Willis\u2019s scrutiny of Giuliani has looked at testimony he gave to Georgia legislators three times after Trump\u2019s defeat, where he promoted discredited fraud claims and urged legislators to take action. A once star federal prosecutor, Giuliani had his law licence suspended in New York and DC in the wake of his misguided legal efforts to help Trump. Willis has said she will announce charging decisions in August, and experts say the Georgia inquiry looks poised to include criminal charges against Trump and some elite lawyers. \u201cLawyers have a professional responsibility to tell the truth, and they may face legal liability when they don\u2019t,\u201d former US attorney in Georgia Michael Moore said. \u201cIn the Georgia investigation, the intentional perpetration of a fraud, if borne out by the investigation, may land them in hot water. All indications are that the DA is looking at some lawyers as directors, not just bit players, in the story of attempted election fraud.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-30T10:00:05Z",
            "content": "The first job many people take out of college usually doesn\u2019t come with a lot of responsibility. Adam Byrnes\u2019s first job is to make sure democracy works in a critical US swing state. Before graduating with a political science degree from Emory University, Byrnes, 21, applied to be the director of elections for Swain county, a mountainous region of about 14,000 people in western North Carolina. He was offered the job before he had a diploma in hand and started at the end of May. He\u2019s currently preparing for municipal elections in the county seat of Bryson City, which take place in November, while also laying the foundations for the 2024 presidential contest. Although he\u2019d worked with an on-campus civic engagement organization and an outside group that researched voter access in Georgia, Byrnes quickly learned that those outward-facing concerns were just the tip of the electoral iceberg. \u201cAdministratively, there\u2019s a lot to learn. For instance, right now we\u2019re dealing with mid-year campaign finance reports,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a civic engagement group, that\u2019s not really something you deal with.\u201d The decentralized system of elections in the United States places a lot of responsibility on county-level officials like Byrnes. And while he may be North Carolina\u2019s youngest election director, he\u2019s far from the only one learning the ropes during a crucial period for American democracy. Over the last four years, at least 40 of North Carolina\u2019s 100 counties have had to replace their election directors due to retirements, resignations and other career moves. Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the state Board of Elections, said that\u2019s a significantly greater level of turnover than the state has seen before. Similar trends hold true across the rest of the United States. A Boston Globe analysis of data from the US Vote Foundation found that county election official turnover had spiked after the 2020 election in battleground states like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia. According to a 2022 survey by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, 20% of officials serving at the time said they planned to leave their posts before the 2024 presidential contest. Those filling the vacancies are entering a high-pressure environment, especially in North Carolina, where Donald Trump defeated Joe Biden by fewer than 75,000 votes. Over 25% of the state\u2019s county election directors have personally experienced threats, according to a March poll by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Election Data and Science Lab, and 85% say their work-related stress has grown since 2019. New election workers will help manage a voting system that\u2019s among the most complex in the world, said David Becker, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, a non-profit that works to build trust in the electoral process. That system, Becker said, includes many checks and balances to ensure the outcome reflects the will of the people. Votes are counted carefully, and rates of fraud are negligible. He said he\u2019s confident that even if those running the system have less experience than before, the candidate who gets the most votes will win. No election is perfect, however. Inexperienced officials may take longer than usual to release election results or make minor administrative missteps. And in the current political environment, Becker said, bad actors can spin those hiccups into dangerous conspiracy theories. \u201cThat could create a very volatile period of time where there are efforts to delay the counting and intimidate people who are counting ballots, delay the certification and intimidate people who are in charge of certification and perhaps delay or obstruct the meeting of the Electoral College members in each state,\u201d he added. \u201cAll of which are unlikely to stop the duly elected individual from being declared the winner of the presidency, but could create a volatile situation that\u2019s ripe for political violence.\u201d North Carolina\u2019s elections in particular are undergoing a period of rapid change, which may place extra stress on new officials trying to grasp how the system works. For example, the state\u2019s 2023 municipal elections will be first in which citizens must present identification in order to vote. The voter ID law had been struck down as racially biased by a Democratic-controlled supreme court in 2022, but after Republicans took control of the court this year, they overturned the previous ruling. Josh Jones, who in 2022 became the director of elections for Greene county, said he expects voter ID to be controversial at the polls this year. Although the state\u2019s voters backed a referendum on the requirement in 2018, many voting rights groups say the measure will harm Black and Latino residents. \u201cAs elections officials and poll workers, we have to follow the law,\u201d Jones said. \u201cMy hope is that the voting public, when they come to vote, realize that our election officials and poll workers are doing just that, following the law.\u201d Yet the rules aren\u2019t always crystal clear, and election officials are often tasked with deciding how to put them into practice. Corinne Duncan, director of elections in Buncombe county since 2020, said the role has gained more responsibility in recent years as election law has become more complicated. \u201cWe\u2019re in charge of interpreting the law, which is unique. And law in the United States is a lot about case law and application,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cThe longer that you\u2019ve been around and seen how the law plays out, the more effective of a leader you are.\u201d When veteran directors leave, that leadership capacity leaves with them. And because each type of election only comes around once every four years, Duncan pointed out, new directors need a lot of time to build up practical experience in voting law. \u201cDirectors are retiring and they\u2019re not coming back. That\u2019s a lot of knowledge lost,\u201d Duncan said. North Carolina\u2019s legislature has proposed a series of bills that would introduce even more wrinkles into how officials are required to run elections. Republicans hold a supermajority in both the state House and Senate and can pass those changes without support from Democratic lawmakers or Roy Cooper, the Democratic governor. Some elements of those bills seem likely to spark conflict, said Michella Huff, who has overseen elections in Surry county since 2019. She pointed to House Bill 772, which would allow observers appointed by county political parties to move freely around polling locations, record poll workers and stand just 5ft away as voters cast their ballots. Officials could be charged with misdemeanors if they interfere with poll observers, so new elections directors might give them freer rein than the rules allow. \u201cWhen I try to envision what that will look like, I do not see how that is not voter intimidation,\u201d Huff said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cause some disruption to the process.\u201d None of the proposed bills provide new resources or financial support for county election officials, said Gannon with the state board of elections. In fact, budget constraints have led the board to cut four of its eight security and support technicians \u2013 experts who help train new election directors and provide advice to counties \u2013 since 2020. The legislature is currently developing North Carolina\u2019s budget for 2023-25. The state board has requested more than $7.6m in new funds over that period to \u201censure the smooth implementation of\u201d the voter ID law, as well as over $13.6m to update software systems it calls \u201cantiquated, inefficient, and vulnerable to defects\u201d. Without these resources, new officials will have a harder time making sure the new rules are applied consistently and fairly. \u201cWe have been told that all those matters are being considered by budget negotiators,\u201d Gannon said, although lawmakers have yet to release a draft of the spending plan. \u201cWe will continue to work with legislators to make sure they understand potential effects on election administration of any proposed statutory changes, as we do routinely.\u201d Regardless of these headwinds, North Carolina\u2019s elections officials are trying to build trust in advance of 2024. In Swain county, Byrnes said he\u2019s worked with local media to share details about the new voter ID requirements before polling starts and is meeting with both Republican and Democratic leaders in the area to build good lines of communication. Despite being new to the job and having to run his first presidential election, he said he feels confident that he will be prepared. \u201cAt the end of the day, if we do everything right and people still don\u2019t like it, there\u2019s not anything we can do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to just control what we can.\u201d"

            "content": "What happened in Spain\u2019s snap general election on Sunday? Pretty much the opposite of everything the pollsters and pundits had predicted would happen. The election, called by the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, after his Spanish Socialist Workers party (PSOE) did badly in May\u2019s regional and municipal elections, had been expected to usher in a coalition government between the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the far-right Vox party. Although the PP finished first and picked up 47 more seats than in the November 2019 election, its victory over a resurgent PSOE was far narrower than had been forecast and the party failed to secure the absolute majority it had hoped for. What about Vox? Sunday was indisputably a bad night for the far-right party. It lost 19 seats, saw its share of the vote cut and had its chances of playing kingmaker slashed. The PP won 136 seats and Vox 33, giving them a combined total of 169 \u2013 seven seats short of the 176-seat absolute majority needed in Spain\u2019s 350-seat congress. How did the Spanish left do? The PSOE picked up 122 seats \u2013 two more than it won last time \u2013 while its allies in the new leftwing Sumar coalition won 31, giving the two main parties of the Spanish left 153 seats. While the PSOE and Sumar have fewer seats than the PP and Vox, they have more options when it comes to doing deals to win the support of smaller parties as they endeavour to form a new government. What happens next? Both the PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, and S\u00e1nchez are going to try to put together new governments over the coming weeks. Congress will convene on 17 August and King Felipe VI will then meet party leaders to determine which candidate could win MPs\u2019 backing to become the next prime minister. That candidate would then take part in an investiture debate followed by a vote that requires an absolute majority in Spain\u2019s lower house (the aforementioned 176 seats). If the candidate falls short of that number, a second vote will be held 48 hours later in which a simple majority \u2013 more votes for than against \u2013 will suffice. Should that fail to happen, MPs have two months to appoint a prime minister. When those two months are up, parliament will be dissolved and new elections called for the end of the year. So who is most likely to be able to pull together a government? S\u00e1nchez and his allies. Feij\u00f3o\u2019s decision to enter into more regional and municipal coalitions with the far right following May\u2019s elections has not endeared the PP to more moderate parties, which simply won\u2019t entertain supporting an alliance that includes Vox, an anti-feminist, anti-immigrant party that denies the existence of gender-based violence and human-made climate change. And any attempt by Feij\u00f3o to try to forge a minority government would be sunk by the PSOE\u2019s refusal to back it or to abstain to allow it into office. What are S\u00e1nchez\u2019s options? By enlisting the support of smaller regional parties, including the separatist Catalan Republican Left party and the pro-independence Basque party EH Bildu, the PSOE leader could potentially secure the backing of 172 MPs \u2013 enough to get him over the line in a second investiture debate. But S\u00e1nchez would also need to negotiate a deal to ensure the abstention of Junts, the hardline, centre-right pro-independence party of the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. In another of the election\u2019s many twists of fate, Puigdemont\u2019s party \u2013 which spearheaded the unsuccessful push to secede from the rest of Spain almost six years ago \u2013 could find itself playing kingmaker. \u201cWe won\u2019t make Pedro S\u00e1nchez PM in exchange for nothing,\u201d its leader, M\u00edriam Nogueras, warned on Sunday night. While the PSOE may have a numerical advantage over the PP, deals with Catalan and Basque independence parties would play neatly into the hands of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s rivals, who accuse him of being far too reliant on them. The campaign for May\u2019s elections was dominated by the legacy of the defunct Basque terrorist group Eta after it emerged that EH Bildu \u2013 whose support the S\u00e1nchez government has enlisted in congress \u2013 was fielding 44 convicted Eta members, including seven people found guilty of violent crimes, as candidates. S\u00e1nchez criticised Bildu\u2019s decision \u2013 describing it as legal but \u201cobviously indecent\u201d \u2013 but it was swiftly seized on by his opponents, who have also attacked his government over its botched sexual offences reforms, which have led to more than 100 convicted sex offenders being granted early release. \u201cYou\u2019re the great electoral hope for rapists and pederasts, for mutineers, squatters, corrupt people, and now for those who used to go about in balaclavas with pistols,\u201d Feij\u00f3o told S\u00e1nchez. \u201cAnd I will never be that.\u201d What\u2019s the most likely outcome? As the PP has once again learned to its cost, it never pays to bet against S\u00e1nchez. That said, the coming weeks and months are unlikely to be easy for the socialists and their allies as they try to put together a new government. Spanish politics continues to be fragmented and another general election remains a distinct possibility. It\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that Sunday\u2019s vote means that the last five Spanish general elections have resulted in hung parliaments."

            "content": "When Barack Obama is leading the tributes, it is impossible not to realise the scale of success. Allisen Corpuz prevailed over Charley Hull at the US Women\u2019s Open at Pebble Beach on Sunday and Obama was immediate in his praise towards his fellow Hawaiian. \u201cYou make us all proud,\u201d said the 44th president of the United States on social media. \u201cHe has done a lot in his career,\u201d Corpuz responded with more than a hint of understatement. \u201cThat is really special.\u201d The nature of Corpuz\u2019s triumph was similarly striking. The 25-year-old had been trending in the right direction in majors \u2013 she was tied fourth at the Chevron Championship and shared 15th at the PGA championship \u2013 but missed three cuts in four previous US Open appearances. Corpuz had never won a mainstream tour event before; the weight of expectation at Pebble Beach played a part in her deliberate approach and she was warned she could be penalised for slow play during round four. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a pretty calm demeanour,\u201d she said. \u201cNot so much on the inside, but projecting that outwardly. I\u2019ve always been pretty calm. I was really telling myself I belong out here, I\u2019m good enough to compete. That\u2019s just been what I\u2019ve been telling myself for the past two years. \u201cGetting my tour card, that was just kind of the beginning of the journey and you never really know what\u2019s going to happen after that. I have just really been working really hard the last few years but I have a lot of gratitude just to be out here. Every few holes I looked out and said, \u2018I\u2019m out here at Pebble Beach.\u2019 There\u2019s not many places that are better.\u201d Hull emerged as the key threat on the final day in California but Corpuz won by three, at nine under par, after a closing 69. Her highest 18-hole score at the famous venue was 71. \u201cThis was something I had dreamed of, but at the same time kind of just never really expected it to happen,\u201d Corpuz said. \u201cEspecially just knowing the history. Tiger Woods absolutely annihilated this place [in 2000]. Yeah, it\u2019s really special.\u201d Corpuz had also took regular motivation from Michelle Wie, whom as a school pupil she watched win the US Open in 2014. Wie bid farewell to professional golf, aged 33, at Pebble Beach on Friday. \u201cI never really compared myself to her,\u201d Corpuz said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to make my own name. She has just served as a really big inspiration.\u201d Wie, who also hails from Hawaii, was supposedly destined to add to that major win of nine years ago but never did. Corpuz has moved to third in the US Solheim Cup standings and it now seems inevitable she will make her debut in the clash with Europe in September. Hull, meanwhile, was understandably bullish after her highest major finish since 2016. The Englishwomen closed with a terrific 66, which included a front nine of just 32. Hull\u2019s freewheeling approach was noticeable. \u201cI\u2019m quite an aggressive person when it comes to life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m quite fast and I just feel like I\u2019m quite aggressive on the course. I like to go for pins. At the end of the day it\u2019s just a game and might as well make it fun. If I want something, I\u2019ll go and get it. That\u2019s my mentality. \u201cI was the one chasing it down so it was quite fun. I enjoy chasing someone because you have got to make birdies and make a move up that leaderboard. That was pretty much my mindset.\u201d Hull\u2019s consolation was a cheque for almost $970,000 (\u00a3756,000). Corpuz\u2019s win earned her $2m, which supplied further proof of the increased commitment to women\u2019s golf by the United States Golf Association."

            "title": "Why are so many Republican candidates jumping into the presidential race? | Osita Nwanevu",
            "date": "2023-07-11T12:59:37Z",
            "content": "Already in this early stretch of the Republican presidential primary campaign, there are nearly as many candidates in the field as there were in 2016, when Donald Trump bested a slew of the Republican party\u2019s most prominent figures on his way to the White House. But unlike 2016, of course, Trump has been the race\u2019s perhaps prohibitive favorite from the jump \u2060\u2013 over the last three months, Trump has moved from plurality to outright majority support from the Republican electorate in the polls. Far from damaging his candidacy, his two indictments have, if anything, encouraged more and more Republican voters to rally to his side. And, unfortunately for those hoping he loses the nomination, the sheer size of the field will make it difficult for any one of his rivals to consolidate enough of the non-Trump vote to mount a real challenge to his candidacy. Each of his long-shot competitors had to have known that their entry into the race would only make his renomination likelier. Yet they jumped in anyway. Why? Charitably, we might want to set aside the numerous financial and professional incentives candidates have to run even losing campaigns for the presidency these days and choose to assume that the candidates in the field are offering policy agendas so robust and compelling \u2060\u2013 are so on fire about what they actually want to do as president \u2060\u2013 that they couldn\u2019t help but throw their hats into the ring. Ron DeSantis, for his part, has shoved rightwing paranoia about education and the rollback of LGBTQ+ rights onto the party\u2019s center stage; Florida has become the crucible for a cultural agenda social conservatives are plainly eager to advance from Congress and the White House once they get the chance. But nearly everyone else in the race seems intent on making it a pure referendum on Donald Trump. Chris Christie, for instance, now up for his second try against Trump for the nomination and currently averaging less than 3% in the primary polls, spent the bulk of his announcement speech last month disparaging Trump\u2019s character; his slogan, a rather audacious one for someone who left office mired in legal controversy and scandal, is \u201cbecause the truth matters\u201d. At the opposite end of the field, Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami \u2060\u2013 a mostly ceremonial office \u2060\u2013 has suggested he might pardon Trump if elected; he\u2019s also about as attentive as Trump to matters of policy substance. When asked by the conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt about the persecution of the Uyghur people in China recently, Suarez confessed ignorance. \u201cI will search Uyghurs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a good learner. I\u2019m a fast learner.\u201d In fairness, Trump \u2060\u2013 or at least his team \u2060\u2013 has been notably more thoroughgoing in advancing a policy agenda this time around than his rivals. He made headlines earlier this year with proposals to invest in the development of flying cars and to construct up to ten new \u201cFreedom Cities\u201d \u2060\u2013 state-of-the-art megalopolises of the future \u2060\u2013 from scratch on federal land. All this was good for a few laughs, but the bulk of the Trump campaign\u2019s public platform on the issues at the heart of Republican politics are both more plausible and more alarming, though nearly all of them would be very heavy lifts legislatively. On crime, the next Trump administration will pursue tighter penalties for violent offenders, more funding for police departments and a strengthening of qualified immunity. On education, Trump promises to \u201ccut federal funding for any school or program pushing critical race theory or gender ideology on our children\u201d and give states incentives not only to achieve longstanding conservative priorities like abolishing teacher tenure and implementing merit pay, but introducing parental bills of rights and measures like the direct election of school principals. On LGBTQ+ rights, Trump wants to ban gender-affirming care for minors and prohibit the federal recognition of transgender identity. And on immigration, the next Trump administration will revive the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy and other measures aimed at frustrating asylum seekers and continue the militarization of the border. The absence of fleshed out platforms from the other candidates as yet means that Trump remains not only the tonal but the substantive center of the Republican race thus far. And even those running the campaigns most explicitly aimed at resuscitating the pre-Trump GOP establishment have shown a willingness to follow Trump to the extremes. It might surprise many American voters for instance \u2060\u2013 though neither President Biden nor most of the political press has made much of it \u2060\u2013 that there\u2019s a consensus among Republican candidates, as Reason\u2019s Matt Welch has noted, that the next administration should launch a new war in Mexico, with American troops on the ground if need be, against the drug cartels. This was an idea Trump first put forward four years ago; in his current platform, it survives as a pledge to order the Department of Defense to \u201cinflict maximum damage\u201d on the cartels and to take them down \u201cjust as he took down Isis\u201d. The majority of the major candidates in the field are on board with this, including South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott and Nikki Haley, who are still routinely framed as comparatively moderate figures by much of the political press. In his very announcement speech, in fact, Scott went as far as to call cartels terrorists and promised to \u201callow the world\u2019s greatest military to fight\u201d them. Haley has also echoed Trump directly \u2013 the cartels, she said in the spring, are to be dealt with \u201cjust like we dealt with Isis\u201d. This is the same Nikki Haley who noted correctly and with some candor in her campaign announcement video that the Republicans have lost the popular vote in \u201cseven out of the last eight presidential elections\u201d. That\u2019s an insight that can cut two ways. On the one hand, it should be plain to all running that neither Trumpism nor a mere return to the unpopular Republican platforms of old will broaden the Republican base \u2060\u2013 a conservatism that can reliably win popular majorities in 2024 and beyond has yet to be discovered or forged and none of the candidates in the running seem especially interested in paving novel ground. On the other hand, it should similarly be plain that next Republican nominee will not actually need a popular majority to win the White House in 2024 \u2060\u2013 dusting off Trumpism and missteps and malaise within the Democratic party may well be enough to deliver victory again, no platform innovations necessary. As it stands, Trump himself seems likeliest to carry the party\u2019s mantle again next year \u2060\u2013 his rivals remain too numerous; his gravitational pull on the party\u2019s discourse and agenda remains too strong.

            "date": "2023-07-20T11:30:13Z",
            "content": "Over breakfast at an upscale Mexico City restaurant, Senator X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez struggled to get a word in amid the stream of interruptions as well-wishers came to shake her hand, pleading with her to run for higher office. Such shows of enthusiasm are rare these days for politicians in Mexico\u2019s seemingly soulless opposition. But since she announced a bid for the presidency last month, the excitement around G\u00e1lvez has risen to fever pitch: a poll published on Wednesday by El Financiero newspaper showed the senator within striking distance of the governing party\u2019s leading candidates. Suddenly, G\u00e1lvez has energized Mexico\u2019s 2024 presidential race, which for years had seemed all but certain. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s landslide win in 2018 dealt a crushing blow to opposition parties: they lost election after election, while the president\u2019s popularity remained sky-high. Given Mexican law forbids re-election, the only question seemed to be which of the president\u2019s favorites would be vaulted to victory. Now, that path may be more difficult. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman with a lot of personal confidence, a lot of humor,\u201d said Blanca Heredia, a Mexican political analyst, of G\u00e1lvez. \u201cAnd for me something that is especially important is that she\u2019s not afraid of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\u201d Although representing the conservative Pan party, G\u00e1lvez has pushed a more progressive agenda, promoting laws to expand domestic workers\u2019 rights and championing clean energy. But she built up her brand through a series of political stunts, including dressing in an inflatable dinosaur costume to protest controversial electoral reforms. And when L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo as he\u2019s known, falsely claimed G\u00e1lvez wanted to end his social programs, G\u00e1lvez obtained a judge\u2019s order securing her right of reply and showed up at one of the president\u2019s morning press briefings last month. The doors to the National Palace remained shut, but the ensuing media frenzy opened a path for the freshman senator\u2019s presidential ambitions. Within weeks, G\u00e1lvez, who many assumed would run for mayor of Mexico City, was coasting down the Paseo de la Reforma, the city\u2019s main boulevard, on her bike, traditional huipil blouse blowing in the wind, cameras clicking as she arrived to register for the opposition primary. \u201cAt the very least I knew that I was going to make this thing interesting because it\u2019s been really dull,\u201d G\u00e1lvez said in a recent interview. \u201cIt got a lot more interesting than I thought.\u201d Since then, G\u00e1lvez has inspired fawning opinion columns, graced front pages of major newspapers, gone viral on social media and drawn crowds at rallies across the country. But her greatest boost has come from Amlo himself, who has regularly attacked her in his daily news conferences. \u201cIt seems like Andr\u00e9s Manuel is her campaign director,\u201d said Heredia. \u201cThe president has the biggest audience imaginable in Mexico.\u201d Amlo\u2019s most recent attacks have focused on G\u00e1lvez\u2019s business, going so far as to tweet a document listing state and private contracts obtained by the firm, supposedly worth tens of millions of dollars. \u201cWhen the president messes with my business and makes public my clients\u2019 private information \u2013 that\u2019s a crime,\u201d said G\u00e1lvez. \u201cAs Shakira says, \u2018Women don\u2019t cry \u2013 we invoice.\u2019 I have a business on the straight and narrow that\u2019s been running for 31 years.\u201d Such cheeky quips are partly what have made G\u00e1lvez stand out from the rather uninspiring figures leading Mexico\u2019s political landscape. But her personal story has also been crucial. G\u00e1lvez was born in an impoverished community in Hidalgo state; her father was physically abusive and battled alcoholism. As a young girl, she worked with her mother selling puddings to make ends meet. She graduated with an engineering degree from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University, and went on to found a successful firm specializing in intelligent building design. In 2000, then president Vicente Fox chose her to head up the National Institute of Indigenous Peoples. She ran unsuccessfully for governor of Hidalgo in 2010, before winning the mayorship of the wealthy Miguel Hidalgo borough in Mexico City in 2015. She entered the Mexican senate in 2018. G\u00e1lvez\u2019s rags-to-riches story provides a sharp contrast to other opposition candidates, one of whom is the son of a former president. And despite being in politics for years, she hasn\u2019t been tainted by the graft scandals that have ensnared many in Mexico, making it harder for Amlo\u2019s punches against the \u201ccorrupt elite\u201d to find their mark. \u201cShe has a kind of armor through her own story,\u201d said Heredia. Still, Mexico\u2019s elections are nearly a year away, and there are relatively few polls showing that G\u00e1lvez has been embraced by Mexican voters, millions of whom are fiercely loyal to Amlo. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that that media buzz, from the columnists and pundits and opinion writers, has a social base,\u201d said Carlos P\u00e9rez Ricart, a political scientist at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City. \u201cShe reminds me more of a good song on Spotify that rises rapidly up the charts, but can fall just as quickly.\u201d To even claim the nomination, G\u00e1lvez will first have to win over voters from the Pan party, a conservative base largely opposed to the senator\u2019s progressive views on issues like abortion. And even if she manages to secure the nomination, she will still have to unite a fractious coalition while also carrying the baggage of political parties tainted by decades of corruption. \u201cA personal narrative is great for a reality show,\u201d said P\u00e9rez Ricart. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s enough to win the presidency.\u201d G\u00e1lvez counters that her campaign is not about party ideology but rather about uniting voters desperate to address some of Mexico\u2019s greatest issues: widespread violence, an ailing healthcare system, an economy driven by dirty power. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer who knows how to solve problems,\u201d she said."

            "title": "What happened in Spain\u2019s snap general election?",
            "date": "2023-07-24T10:22:50Z",
            "content": "What happened in Spain\u2019s snap general election on Sunday? Pretty much the opposite of everything the pollsters and pundits had predicted would happen. The election, called by the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, after his Spanish Socialist Workers party (PSOE) did badly in May\u2019s regional and municipal elections, had been expected to usher in a coalition government between the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the far-right Vox party. Although the PP finished first and picked up 47 more seats than in the November 2019 election, its victory over a resurgent PSOE was far narrower than had been forecast and the party failed to secure the absolute majority it had hoped for. What about Vox? Sunday was indisputably a bad night for the far-right party. It lost 19 seats, saw its share of the vote cut and had its chances of playing kingmaker slashed. The PP won 136 seats and Vox 33, giving them a combined total of 169 \u2013 seven seats short of the 176-seat absolute majority needed in Spain\u2019s 350-seat congress. How did the Spanish left do? The PSOE picked up 122 seats \u2013 two more than it won last time \u2013 while its allies in the new leftwing Sumar coalition won 31, giving the two main parties of the Spanish left 153 seats. While the PSOE and Sumar have fewer seats than the PP and Vox, they have more options when it comes to doing deals to win the support of smaller parties as they endeavour to form a new government. What happens next? Both the PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, and S\u00e1nchez are going to try to put together new governments over the coming weeks. Congress will convene on 17 August and King Felipe VI will then meet party leaders to determine which candidate could win MPs\u2019 backing to become the next prime minister. That candidate would then take part in an investiture debate followed by a vote that requires an absolute majority in Spain\u2019s lower house (the aforementioned 176 seats). If the candidate falls short of that number, a second vote will be held 48 hours later in which a simple majority \u2013 more votes for than against \u2013 will suffice. Should that fail to happen, MPs have two months to appoint a prime minister. When those two months are up, parliament will be dissolved and new elections called for the end of the year. So who is most likely to be able to pull together a government? S\u00e1nchez and his allies. Feij\u00f3o\u2019s decision to enter into more regional and municipal coalitions with the far right following May\u2019s elections has not endeared the PP to more moderate parties, which simply won\u2019t entertain supporting an alliance that includes Vox, an anti-feminist, anti-immigrant party that denies the existence of gender-based violence and human-made climate change. And any attempt by Feij\u00f3o to try to forge a minority government would be sunk by the PSOE\u2019s refusal to back it or to abstain to allow it into office. What are S\u00e1nchez\u2019s options? By enlisting the support of smaller regional parties, including the separatist Catalan Republican Left party and the pro-independence Basque party EH Bildu, the PSOE leader could potentially secure the backing of 172 MPs \u2013 enough to get him over the line in a second investiture debate. But S\u00e1nchez would also need to negotiate a deal to ensure the abstention of Junts, the hardline, centre-right pro-independence party of the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. In another of the election\u2019s many twists of fate, Puigdemont\u2019s party \u2013 which spearheaded the unsuccessful push to secede from the rest of Spain almost six years ago \u2013 could find itself playing kingmaker. \u201cWe won\u2019t make Pedro S\u00e1nchez PM in exchange for nothing,\u201d its leader, M\u00edriam Nogueras, warned on Sunday night. While the PSOE may have a numerical advantage over the PP, deals with Catalan and Basque independence parties would play neatly into the hands of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s rivals, who accuse him of being far too reliant on them. The campaign for May\u2019s elections was dominated by the legacy of the defunct Basque terrorist group Eta after it emerged that EH Bildu \u2013 whose support the S\u00e1nchez government has enlisted in congress \u2013 was fielding 44 convicted Eta members, including seven people found guilty of violent crimes, as candidates. S\u00e1nchez criticised Bildu\u2019s decision \u2013 describing it as legal but \u201cobviously indecent\u201d \u2013 but it was swiftly seized on by his opponents, who have also attacked his government over its botched sexual offences reforms, which have led to more than 100 convicted sex offenders being granted early release. \u201cYou\u2019re the great electoral hope for rapists and pederasts, for mutineers, squatters, corrupt people, and now for those who used to go about in balaclavas with pistols,\u201d Feij\u00f3o told S\u00e1nchez. \u201cAnd I will never be that.\u201d What\u2019s the most likely outcome? As the PP has once again learned to its cost, it never pays to bet against S\u00e1nchez. That said, the coming weeks and months are unlikely to be easy for the socialists and their allies as they try to put together a new government. Spanish politics continues to be fragmented and another general election remains a distinct possibility. It\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that Sunday\u2019s vote means that the last five Spanish general elections have resulted in hung parliaments."

            "content": "We\u2019re wrapping up our live coverage for the night. With 100% of the vote counted, Spain\u2019s snap election has yielded a fragmented result that will yield weeks \u2013 if not months \u2013 of dealmaking attempts. While the PP, led by Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, won the most seats in the election, the party\u2019s 136 seats will not be enough to topple the Socialists\u2019 Pedro S\u00e1nchez. Even with Vox\u2019s 33 seats, the two parties will fall short of the 176 seats needed for a majority in Spain\u2019s parliament. The results stand in sharp contrast to the outcome predicted by pollsters for this snap general election. Instead this snap election saw S\u00e1nchez again prove to be one of Europe\u2019s most resilient politicians. Between the Socialists\u2019 122 seats \u2013 a slight increase over the 120 seats won last election \u2013 and Sumar\u2019s 31 seats, the left bloc could manage to cobble together enough support in the coming months to take power. If not, Spain will again have to head to the polls. You can read our full story of tonight\u2019s election here: The Associated Press has crunched the numbers, reporting that the bloc that could likely support S\u00e1nchez\u2019s return to power in Spain totals 172 seats. In contrast, the right bloc, led by the PP, sits at 170 seats. As I mentioned earlier, the fragmented result means that the hardline Catalan separatist party Junts per Catalunya is now in the position of kingmaker. \u201cWe won\u2019t make Pedro S\u00e1nchez PM in exchange for nothing,\u201d the party\u2019s leader, M\u00edriam Nogueras, said earlier tonight after it became clear that her party could play a decisive role in ushering in Spain\u2019s new government. While the PP won the most seats in the election, political analyst Ver\u00f3nica Fumanal described the win as a \u201cPyrrhic victory\u201d as the party will likely not be able to form government. \u201cI see a deadlock scenario in the parliament,\u201d she told the Associated Press. Some interesting analysis from one of Spain\u2019s best-known television personalities on the left, Jordi Evol\u00e9, on Twitter. He points out that Spain has bucked the tide sweeping most of Europe in this election: The extreme right, which is in its best moment across much of Europe, is losing votes and seats in Spain. Almost 20 \u2026 Today, more than ever, VIVA ESPA\u00d1A. The far-right party Vox has taken some of the biggest losses of the night, with its seat count dropping from 52 in the country\u2019s parliament to 33. In another tweet, Evol\u00e9 also points out that despite obtaining their worst electoral result in years, Catalan separatists now hold the key to forming Spain\u2019s next government. The leader of the conservative People\u2019s party, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, is addressing his supporters outside the PP headquarters in Madrid. \u201cFriends, we have obtained a result that just over a year and a half ago seemed impossible,\u201d he says to loud cheers. \u201cAs the candidate of the party that received the most votes, I believe it is my duty to lead the talks from the first minute and try to govern our country in accordance with the election results and the electoral victory\u201d, he adds. With 99.8% of the votes counted, the PP won tonight\u2019s election with 136 seats. But the result is far from the outright majority needed to topple the incumbent Socialists, even with the far-right\u2019s 33 seats. Instead it hints at weeks \u2013 if not months \u2013 of negotiations as parties try to gather enough support to lead the country\u2019s 350-seat parliament. Outside the Socialists headquarters, the mood appears to be jubilant. \u201cThere are far more of us, those who want to see Spain continue to advance,\u201d said Pedro S\u00e1nchez to resounding cheers. The backward-looking bloc who wanted to abolish the advances of the last four years has failed\u201d, he added. The Socialists did better tonight than polls had predicted, winning 122 seats. The result is a slight gain over the 120 seats it won in the November 2019 election. Spanish media are highlighting that the potential kingmaker of the election is not the far-right Vox \u2013 but rather the Catalan separatist party Junts per Catalunya. With 99% of the votes counted, Junts has 7 seats. If the Socialists are able to strike a deal with the party, perhaps convincing them to abstain, Pedro S\u00e1nchez could potentially pave a return to power. The negotiations, however, would likely take weeks or months. And as Juanlu S\u00e1nchez of Eldiario.es points out in this tweet, if Junts decides to vote against both the left and the right bloc, Spain will be heading towards new elections. My colleague Sam Jones has put together this look at the Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and his risky gamble in calling tonight\u2019s snap general election. Polarisation, discord and fury have been the defining features of Spain\u2019s volatile and rapidly changing politics over the past few years,\u201d Sam writes. He adds: Now that Spain has gone to the polls for the fifth time in eight years, results suggest an electorate finely divided, and S\u00e1nchez will soon learn whether his latest bet was the right one.\u201d With 100% of the votes counted, the PP has won the election with 136 seats. But the result is far from an outright majority and hints at weeks \u2013 if not months \u2013 of political gridlock and negotiations as parties try to hammer out whether Spain\u2019s next government will tack to the right or left. The Socialists did better than polls had predicted, winning 122 seats. The result is a slight gain over the 120 seats it won in the November 2019 election. The new leftwing movement, Sumar, won 31 seats. The far-right party Vox has taken some of the biggest losses of the night, with its seat count dropping from 52 in the country\u2019s parliament to 33. While polls had suggested that Vox\u2019s seat count would drop, they also suggested that this drop would be compensated by the party\u2019s role as a kingmaker following the election. A PP-Vox coalition would have 169 seats \u2013 meaning it would need to secure a handful of votes from other parties to secure the 176 seats needed for a majority in the 350-seat parliament. It is a tall order, given that most regional parties have expressed hesitation over striking deals that could ease Vox\u2019s path to power. The Socialists and Sumar would have 153 seats together, meaning they could potentially try to strike deals with smaller regional parties to govern. But doing so would require fraught negotiations, meaning Spain risks heading into new elections. Sam Jones, The Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, has filed his take on the election results: The early results suggested the political hue of the next government is far from a foregone conclusion, with the left and right blocs running almost neck and neck in their race to get as close to 176 seats as possible. Weeks of negotiations and horse-trading are likely to follow Sunday\u2019s vote.\u201d With 90% of the vote counted, the PP has now firmly pulled into the lead with 136 seats. The Socialists have 122 seats, while the leftwing movement, Sumar, is at 31 seats. The far-right party Vox has 33 seats. The results so far suggest that the PP and Vox together would have 169 seats \u2013 meaning they would need to secure a handful of votes from other parties to secure a majority in the 350-seat parliament. It is a tall order, given that most regional parties have expressed hesitation over deals that would ease Vox\u2019s path to power. The Socialists and Sumar would have 153 seats together, meaning they could potentially try to strike deals with smaller regional parties in order to govern. But doing so would require weeks \u2013 if not months \u2013 of fraught negotiations, meaning Spain risks heading into new elections. With 10% or so of votes left to count, the results could still see an increase or decrease by a handful of seats. Writer Michael Reid, author of a recently published book on Spain, points out that so far the results hint at how the country\u2019s two traditional parties, the Socialists and the PP, are bouncing back after an era of deep fragmentation in Spanish politics: People\u2019s party pulls ahead of the Socialists with three-quarters of the vote counted Just over 75% of the votes have been counted and live results published by the Spanish government continue to show a narrow gap between the Socialists and the PP. The PP \u2013 which polls had suggested would win the election by a substantial margin \u2013 has 132 seats. The Socialists trail slightly behind at 126. The far-right Vox party has 33 seats while the leftwing movement Sumar has 30. The preliminary count suggests that PP and Vox together would have 165 seats \u2013 just shy of the 176 seats needed for a majority in the country\u2019s 350-seat parliament. With a quarter of the vote left to count, the results could still increase or decrease by a handful of seats. Spanish radio station Cadena SER has published video from the PP headquarters in Madrid. It shows people milling outside as results roll in. After weeks of polls suggesting the PP would win the election by a significant margin, the mood of supporters appears to be more cautious than jubilant: We now have slightly more than 55% of the votes counted and live results published by the Spanish government show a very narrow gap between the Socialists and the PP. The PP \u2013 widely tipped to win the most seats in this snap election \u2013 have 130. The Socialists are closely behind them with 129. The far-right Vox party has 33 seats while leftwing movement Sumar has 30. This suggests that the PP-Vox together would have 163 seats \u2013 a result that falls short of the 176 seats needed for a majority in the country\u2019s 350-seat parliament. These are still early results, however, so they could change as more votes are counted. In past elections the variation over the course of the count has not tended to be very large, but it could increase or decrease by a handful of seats, leading to changes in the balance of power. With slightly more than 33% of votes counted, live results published by the Spanish government suggests that Socialists and the PP are tied at 131 seats. The far-right Vox party has 32 seats while leftwing movement Sumar has 28. This suggests that the PP-Vox together would have 163 seats, while the Socialists and Sumar would have 159. At least 176 seats are needed for a majority in the country\u2019s 350-seat parliament. These are preliminary results, however, so they could change significantly in the coming hours. In past elections the variation over the course of the count has not tended to be very large, but it could increase or decrease by a handful of seats and alter the balance of power. As we wait for the results of Spain\u2019s snap election, a reminder of the potential outcomes: Polls suggest the most likely outcome is that the PP and Vox could together earn the 176 seats needed to govern the country\u2019s 350-seat parliament. If so, the result would pave the way for a rightward shift in Spain following the Socialists\u2019 push to advance transgender rights, access to abortion and menstrual leave. If PP and Vox fall short of this threshold, the Socialists could seek to forge an alliance with Sumar, a grouping of 15 leftist parties, and rely on the votes of a handful of smaller regional parties to govern. If the vote yields a fragmented result that makes it impossible for the parties to strike deals, it could mean fresh elections for Spain in 2024. No matter the outcome, the lack of an outright majority for any one party would mean that Spanish politicians are facing weeks \u2013 if not months \u2013 of complex negotiations. Polls have just closed in the country\u2019s snap general election. Snapshots of voting intention taken during the campaign suggest that there is no clear majority for any one party, though the PP and Vox could have enough for a majority, according to Reuters. Given that the results of the election are likely to come down to a dozen or so seats, it probably won\u2019t be until around midnight local time (11pm UK) when we have a more concrete idea of what lies ahead for Spain. Polls are now closed in Spain. As the results of the hard-fought snap general election begin trickling in, it\u2019s worth highlighting what is at stake, as argued by the former UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, in this piece: If the bloc of rightist parties ends up ahead of S\u00e1nchez, the near-50-year political taboo against neofascist parties in power will be broken. Vox will have moved from a gang of backstreet demagogues to the Spanish cabinet room, creating a political earthquake that will be felt right across the continent in the year of Spain\u2019s presidency of the European Union,\u201d he writes. With voter surveys suggesting that there is no clear majority for any one party in Spain\u2019s snap election, tonight\u2019s poll has been waged on potential pacts as much as policy. Speaking to the Associated Press, voter Alejandro Bleda, 45, alluded to the PP\u2019s willingness to work with the far-right Vox party to explain how he voted. \u201cGiven the polarisation in this country, it\u2019s to vote either for 50 years of backwardness or for progress,\u201d he said. In contrast Carmen Acero, 62, said she was voting for the PP and accused S\u00e1nchez of being an \u201cassassin\u201d due to his willingness to rely on the small Basque regional party Bildu, which includes some former members of the now-defunct armed separatist group, ETA. In recent days, the extent of what the far-right could do as a junior partner in a coalition with the PP has become a talking point. Earlier this month I travelled to Castile and Le\u00f3n, where the far-right has controlled a handful of ministries for the past 15 months as part of a PP-led government, to ask that very question. Rights groups said the steady drip of rollbacks, rhetoric and reversals from the region\u2019s institutions had derailed the push for progress while also leaving some feeling more vulnerable. For the first time in a very long time, we felt that Pride was not about demanding more rights,\u201d said Virginia Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00f3mez of LGBTQ+ rights group Fundaci\u00f3n Tri\u00e1ngulo. \u201cInstead, it was about demanding that the rights we have not be taken away.\u201d Spain\u2019s snap election \u2013 framed by politicians as a battle between the left and right \u2013 has taken on a wider significance as a barometer of Europeans\u2019 shifting attitude towards the far-right. Polls suggest that the ultraconservative Vox party could emerge as kingmaker tonight, meaning its aggressive stance against feminists, LGBT+ rights and migrants could gain a foothold in Spain\u2019s central government. The vote comes weeks after Spain took over the rotating presidency of the European Union. A coalition that includes the far-right would be a fresh \u2013 and very symbolic \u2013 blow to the European left. My colleague Jon Henley put together this look at how the far-right is increasingly shaping politics across Europe. After every crisis, we have told ourselves that the populists and far-right are waning in Europe, and the fact is they have been rising more or less steadily, with a few interruptions, since the 1980s,\u201d Catherine Fieschi, director of policy at Open Society Foundations Europe and an expert on populism, authoritarianism and the far-right told Jon. \u201cThey are really now a part of the landscape.\u201d Polls have just closed across mainland Spain in the country\u2019s snap general election. Polls on the Canary Islands will remain open for one more hour as the archipelago falls in a different time zone. Snapshots of voting intention taking during the campaign suggest that there is no clear majority for any one party, though the PP and Vox could have enough for a majority, according to Reuters. Given that the results of the election are likely to come down to a dozen or so seats, it probably won\u2019t be until around midnight local time (11pm UK) when we have a more concrete idea of what lies ahead for Spain. Here is more from Reuters on the voter surveys: Spain\u2019s conservative opposition People\u2019s Party (PP) was seen ahead in Sunday\u2019s snap election, but short of an outright parliamentary majority, which it could however achieve in a potential tie-up with far-right Vox, two voter surveys showed. A survey by GAD3 for media group Mediaset, published shortly after mainland voting ended at 8pm and based on 10,000 voter intentions collated over the course of the election campaign through Saturday, showed the PP would win 150 seats, and Vox 31. The leftist coalition, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Socialists, would get a combined 149 seats in the 350-seat lower chamber, GAD3 said. Another survey, of 17,000 people by Sigma Dos pollster for the state broadcaster RTVE also showed no single party close to winning a parliamentary majority, and the combined right achieving it only at the top of the ranges provided.\u201d Polls in Spain\u2019s snap general election have just closed in mainland Spain. Polls on the Canary Islands will remain open for one more hour due to the archipelago falling in a different time zone. Snapshots of voting intention taking during the course of the campaign suggest that there is no clear majority for any one party, though the PP and Vox could have enough for a majority, according to Reuters. Given that the results of the election will likely come down to a dozen or so seats, the these voter surveys should be viewed cautiously. It likely won\u2019t be until around midnight local time (11pm UK) when we have a more concrete idea of what lies ahead for Spain. Standing firmly in the Socialists\u2019 corner is the new Sumar movement \u2013 a platform of some 15 leftist and green parties \u2013 that is hoping to act as a bulwark against the far-right. Led by Yolanda D\u00edaz, the country\u2019s 52-year-old minister of labour and the Spanish politician with the highest approval rating, Sumar has sought to appeal to the widest possible range of left-of-centre voters. Their promises include the eye-catching \u201cuniversal inheritance,\u201d which would give all young Spaniards \u20ac20,000 (\u00a317,000) in a bid to boost social mobility. My colleague Sam Jones has more on Sumar and D\u00edaz here, including this fascinating quote: When it comes to -isms, I hate putting labels on things,\u201d D\u00edaz said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never find me in all that. What I am is a progressive woman who is the daughter of an anti-Franco activist who was a member of the Spanish Communist party.\u201d The piece notes: Her task is not easy. Although Spain\u2019s economy is in decent shape \u2013 the inflation rate fell to 1.9% in June \u2013 the cost of living crisis continues to bite and political disenchantment, especially on the left, is rife.\u201d Across Spain people have been pouring into polling stations to vote, despite the soaring summer temperatures. In the northern Spanish town of Salda\u00f1a, officials took a break from hosting the town\u2019s traditional Roman market to cast their votes: With about 30 minutes left until the majority of polls close in Spain, it\u2019s probably worth taking a look at how Spain \u2013 once widely considered to be relatively immune to far-right politics \u2013 could end up with Vox as part of its central government. Analysts link the fortunes of the far-right Vox party, founded almost a decade ago by disenchanted PP members, to the failed push for Catalan independence some six years ago. As Spain grappled with its worst political and territorial crisis in decades, it \u201cawakened a long-dormant strain of nationalism,\u201d my colleague Sam Jones writes in this piece exploring the rise of Vox. Add to that the social, economic and demographic factors in play in Spain and many other European countries \u2013 ageing populations, fears about immigration, and digital and equality revolutions that have left many people feeling left behind \u2013 and the conditions for Vox were ripe.\u201d Residents of Gibraltar will be among those watching tonight\u2019s election result closely, as the outcome could have far-reaching impact on their lives. The Brexit withdrawal agreement, announced on Christmas Eve 2020, did not cover Gibraltar. Instead the tiny territory\u2019s post-Brexit fate has been the subject of more than a dozen rounds of talks between the EU and the UK. The talks are ongoing. But if tonight\u2019s government ends up being a coalition between the PP and Vox, as polls suggest, it could complicate efforts to end Gibraltar\u2019s post-Brexit limbo. In the lead-up to regional and municipal elections in May, the Vox leader, Santiago Abascal, argued that any deal with the UK that did not recognise Spanish sovereignty over the British territory would be \u201can act of betrayal against Spain\u201d. I delved into what is at risk for the Rock this weekend in a piece for the Observer: I would be very concerned that an eventual rightwing government would seek to block the treaty over ideological interests that are weighed down by \u2013 let\u2019s say it clearly \u2013 vestiges of Francoism,\u201d Jes\u00fas Verd\u00fa Baeza, a law professor at the University of C\u00e1diz told me. The far-right party Vox is not expected to come in first or second place in this election. Polls suggest it is even poised to lose some of the 52 seats it currently holds in Spain\u2019s parliament. Even so, the party \u2013 which has long railed against feminism, LGBT+ rights and Muslim immigration \u2013 has dominated the conversation during this election. Led by 47-year-old Santiago Abascal, the party could emerge as kingmaker in tonight\u2019s election, if polls are to be believed. If so, it will breathe new life into the party\u2019s promises to eradicate Spanish laws on abortion and euthanasia, abolish regional autonomy and parliaments as well as set up a naval blockade to prevent irregular migrants from arriving at the country\u2019s shores. The third generation of politicians in his family, Abascal joined the PP at the age of 18. In 2013, disenchanted with the party\u2019s handling of corruption and separatism, he founded Vox with several other former PP members. The party has gone on to forge close ties with the far-right across Europe; Abascal has turned up at summits with France\u2019s Marine Le Pen, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni, who earlier this month made a videolink appearance at a Vox rally in Valencia. Pointing to governments in Italy, Finland, Sweden, Poland and the Czech Republic, Meloni told the rally that the time had come for \u201cpatriots\u201d to take power. For all of us it is crucial that on 23 July a conservative patriotic alternative is established, in which Vox plays a leading and decisive role in the formation of the new national government,\u201d she added. When people seek to describe Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the leader of the PP and the man tipped to win tonight\u2019s election, the word boring often comes up. \u201cThe boring guy who wins every election by a landslide,\u201d is how an Associated Press headline recently described him, while a Reuters profile was swift to note his \u201creputation for dullness\u201d. It\u2019s an image that Feij\u00f3o has sought to nurture since taking the reins of the PP some 16 months ago. \u201cI know this speech might sound boring or old-fashioned but I\u2019m sorry, I believe politics isn\u2019t a fashion or reality show,\u201d he told a rally last year in the lead up to regional elections in Andalusia. Relatively unknown outside of Spain, Feij\u00f3o made the jump into politics at the age of 41 after a successful career as a high-ranking civil servant. He was elected to lead the northwestern region of Galicia in 2009, racking up four absolute majorities in the regional parliament. His push to paint himself as a moderate, however, stands in contrast to his party\u2019s willingness to forge municipal and regional governments with the far-right. My colleague Sam Jones has this piece with more background on Feij\u00f3o: Much has been made of his calm, understated demeanour \u2013 especially in contrast to the slick, telegenic and sometimes unpredictable charms of S\u00e1nchez,\u201d writes Sam. He adds: \u201cDespite his low-key image, Feij\u00f3o has not always managed to avoid scandal.The publication 10 years ago of photographs showing him on holiday in the mid-1990s with a friend who was later convicted of drug trafficking led to calls for him to step down as Galicia\u2019s president. Despite efforts by politicians to paint Spain\u2019s snap election as a stark choice between the left and right blocs, it appears it wasn\u2019t enough to convince some voters. At 6pm local time, turnout for the snap general election stood at 53%, down from 56.85% recorded at the same time in the previous November 2019 election, according to data from the country\u2019s interior ministry. Some of this can be blamed on the extreme heat gripping parts of the country, others pointed to the fact that the election comes at a time when many in Spain are on vacation. One man found a creative way to express his frustration at being called to vote during his vacation: Some nuts and bolts about tonight\u2019s vote. Polls will close at 8pm local time (7pm UK time) We expect exit polls shortly after that. Given that the results of the election will likely come down to a dozen or so seats, the exit polls should be viewed cautiously. It likely won\u2019t be until around midnight local time (11pm UK) when we have an idea of what lies ahead for Spain. There are a few potential outcomes, all of which suggest that weeks or months of complex negotiations lay ahead for Spain. The most likely is that the PP and Vox could together earn the 176 seats needed to govern the country\u2019s 350-seat parliament. If so, the result would pave the way for a shift to the hard right following the Socialists\u2019 push to advance transgender rights, access to abortion and menstrual leave. If PP and Vox fall short of this threshold, the Socialists could forge an alliance with Sumar, a grouping of 15 leftist parties, as well as a handful of smaller regional parties in order to govern. And if the vote yields a fragmented result that makes it impossible for the parties to strike deals, it could mean fresh elections for Spain in 2024. This election \u2013 called by Spain\u2019s Socialist prime minister hours after his party suffered a drubbing in May\u2019s regional and municipal elections \u2013 came as a surprise to most in the country. It was a high stakes gamble, even for a politician known for embracing risk. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, 51, has proven himself to be among Europe\u2019s most resilient politicians; riding a grassroots insurgency to return to power after he was ousted as leader of his party and going on to become the first politician in Spain to topple a sitting government using a no-confidence motion. The election might be his riskiest bet to-date, with S\u00e1nchez hoping that the rash of deals forged in recent weeks between the PP and Vox in dozens of municipalities and a handful of regions would help mobilise leftwing voters. It remains to be seen whether it will be enough. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s reliance on support from separatists to govern and swing to the left as his party sought common ground with coalition partner Podemos have proven deeply unpopular with many in Spain, while his opponents have sought to portray him as a man willing to cling to power at any cost. Good evening and buenas tardes to those following the results of Spain\u2019s snap general election. I\u2019m Ashifa Kassam in Madrid and I \u2013 along with Guardian colleague Sam Jones \u2013 will be bringing you all the latest from Spain\u2019s hard-fought general election. The snap election, called two months ago by Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is being closely watched across Europe and much of the world; polls suggest that it could yield the far-right\u2019s first foray into central government since the death of dictator Francisco Franco. The opposition conservative People\u2019s party (PP) is expected to win the election, but polls suggest it will fall short of the 176 seats needed for a majority in the country\u2019s 350-seat parliament. If so, the party, led by Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, will likely need to strike a deal with the far-right Vox party in order to govern the eurozone\u2019s fourth largest economy. The final outcome of tonight\u2019s election is anyone\u2019s guess. The last week of campaigning saw the PP frontrunner, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, called out over untrue claims on pensions, criticised for remarks seen as sexist and stumble as he sought to explain his ties to a man convicted of drug trafficking. As a result, the Socialists began pointing to a resurgence of the left. This morning S\u00e1nchez was among the first candidates to cast his ballot, telling reporters that the election was giving him \u201cgood vibes\u201d. Will the country\u2019s 37 million or so eligible voters prove him right? Stay tuned."

            "content": "The US has issued a warning over possible efforts to interfere with Guatemala\u2019s presidential election result, after the country\u2019s top court ordered ballots from the first-round vote be reviewed, setting up the potential for a recount. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington had endorsed findings from observers over the vote\u2019s validity, and said undermining the outcome would be a \u201cgrave threat to democracy with far-reaching implications\u201d. Guatemala\u2019s top court on Saturday ordered ballots from the 25 June election to be reviewed after the frontrunner\u2019s party and allies challenged the results. Sandra Torres, a former first lady who won the first round, has alleged votes were manipulated. Bernardo Arevalo, who bucked forecasts to become a close runner-up to Torres, described Torres\u2019s vote review request as lacking legal merit and endangering the electoral process. Guatemala\u2019s supreme electoral tribunal said it would abide by the court decision and instruct its local branches to review the ballots within five days. The European Union, which monitored the vote and backed the results announced by the electoral tribunal, called on Guatemala\u2019s institutions and political parties to respect the electoral process and what it called the \u201cclearly manifested will of citizens\u201d. The Organization of American States (OAS) said that its observers had witnessed \u201ca satisfactory election day, in which citizens expressed their will, members of the electoral board facilitated the vote, and political parties inspected the vote at every stage\u201d. The OAS echoed calls for the results to be recognized, saying: \u201cRespect for the citizens\u2019 will as expressed at the ballot box is a democratic imperative which must be upheld, honouring the decision already made by the voters.\u201d In a public statement addressed to the international community, Guatemala\u2019s Foreign Ministry requested respect for its sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs.

            "title": "Byelection results paint ominous picture for Tories despite Uxbridge win",
            "date": "2023-07-21T06:40:18Z",
            "content": "In the end the byelection scoreline was 2-1 to the opposition; a Labour triumph in Selby and Ainsty and a Liberal Democrat victory in Somerton and Frome, and a consolation win for the Conservatives in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. On the surface it looks like something for everyone, but taken together, the results paint a truly ominous picture for the Conservatives. The swing to Labour in Selby and Ainsty was a monster 23.7%. This is the second-highest swing to the main opposition in any government seat since 1945, with only the 1994 landslide in Dudley West (29.1%) being larger. It is a historically terrible result for a government, and correspondingly an amazing one for a principal opposition party. There may be one or two excuses for the Conservatives \u2013 many electors will not have been sympathetic to Nigel Adams\u2019 reasons for resigning, the organisation may have become complacent, turnout was sharply down \u2013 but these are not enough to take away from the scale of the verdict on the government. There have been several massive swings to the Lib Dems in recent years \u2013 Chesham and Amersham, North Shropshire, Tiverton and Honiton \u2013 so Somerton and Frome does not tell us much that is new despite the big Lib Dem victory. Selby and Ainsty shows Labour is capable of winning big, and that tactical voting is working consistently against the Conservatives. However, Uxbridge and South Ruislip has a certain amount to show us about the politics of outer London and the limits of the patience of the electorate during a cost of living crisis. Uxbridge seems to be a jinxed constituency for Labour. This result makes it three times \u2013 December 1972, July 1997 and now July 2023 \u2013 that it has fallen short of the polling and expectations. The third time was not the charm for Labour, and Frank Beswick (1945-59) and John Ryan (1966-70) remain the only non-Tory MPs for the constituency. Big byelections attract minor party and independent candidates, and Uxbridge and South Ruislip was no exception. There were two independent candidates standing in opposition to the London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) who polled 394 votes between them, but the Conservatives ran by far the most successful single-issue anti- Ulez campaign. Their new MP Steve Tuckwell\u2019s victory speech was about London politics rather than a defence of the Sunak government. There can be no doubt that Ulez enabled the Tories to run an anti-incumbent campaign that turned out enough of their vote to squeak home. The Uxbridge result will cause short-term problems for Labour. Their candidate, Danny Beales, had already expressed reservations about the implementation of Ulez during the campaign. Dropping the change to the scheme would fit in with the cautious approach of the national leadership and be a gesture of listening to voters in a cost of living crisis. This is not the first Ulez election \u2013 Labour performed poorly against the Conservatives in the May local elections in places just outside London, such as Dartford and Harlow, where it was an issue. However, Khan regards clean air as a vital climate and public health issue, and can hope that the politics of it will settle down after August when many people realise it will not affect them. Labour campaigners also pointed to the lack of a \u201cretail offer\u201d \u2013 a simple promise to improve people\u2019s lives that would enable the conversation to move on from Ulez, and some on the left blame the national leadership\u2019s lack of ambition. Uxbridge and South Ruislip could be a stress test for how well the anti-Tory vote holds up in the face of a vigorous campaign. The longer-term dilemma is for the Conservatives. Going all-in on Ulez was enough to stave off defeat in Uxbridge, and the Tories will be tempted to go further down the road to campaigning as the motorists\u2019 party, even at the cost of their own net zero transition policies and their long-term future with younger voters. The Conservatives will find it hard to replicate the anti-incumbent technique outside London or Wales, and there are only a handful of other constituencies that resemble Uxbridge electorally or demographically (and the Uxbridge swing is big enough to take out some of them). The problem the Tories have is that there are large numbers of constituencies that are a bit like Selby and Ainsty or Somerton and Frome. Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire is a mixture of small towns, commuter villages and some countryside, neither poor nor affluent. It has elements of \u201cred wall\u201d and \u201cmiddle England\u201d and a big swing here has wide implications. The Uxbridge result might caution us against expecting too many Labour advances into new territory in 2024, but Selby and Ainsty suggests Labour is on course to rebuild the electoral coalition that previously brought it victory. Somerton and Frome was part of a swathe of rural and small-town former Lib Dem seats in the south-west that seemed like extinct volcanoes after the coalition government and Brexit. If these seats are in flux, the Conservatives face a daunting task if they are to retain an overall majority. The swings since 2019 look as if they are all over the place \u2013 29% to the Lib Dems in Somerton and Frome, 24% to Labour in Selby and Ainsty, and only 7% to Labour in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. But from a longer perspective it looks a lot clearer. It is less dangerous to prognosticate on the basis of three byelections in very different types of seat than it is for a single byelection. In 1997 the Lib Dems gained Somerton and Frome by 130 votes \u2013 in 2023 they gained it by 11,008. In 1997 Labour gained the Selby constituency by 3,836 \u2013 in 2023, on less favourable boundaries, Labour gained by 4,161. And in 1997 the Conservatives held Uxbridge by 724 votes; in 2023 they held a somewhat more Tory version of the seat by 495 votes. These results, allowing for the Lib Dems\u2019 winning ways in byelections, show the level and distribution of the parties\u2019 support is a bit worse for the Conservatives than it was in 1997. The Brexit realignment? Left on economics, right on culture? Gone like tears in rain."

            "content": "Most Britons support healthcare workers in their wave of strikes over pay and conditions this year despite the worsening disruption, polling shows. About two-thirds of the public said they supported striking nurses, ambulance workers and junior doctors, despite growing numbers of appointments and operations having to be cancelled, according to Ipsos polling carried out between January and June. The figures have roughly held steady since the beginning of the year, though they dipped slightly in early spring when doctors, ambulance workers and nurses all held strikes. Ipsos\u2019s director of politics, Keiran Pedley, said the polling showed that \u201cNHS staff are consistently the most supported by the public\u201d out of all the striking workers. He said: \u201cLevels of support have been sustained over time despite any disruption caused. Support for NHS workers likely reflects strong public concern about the current state of the NHS and an inclination to blame the government, rather than the NHS or its staff, for problems that exist.\u201d Support for junior doctors has grown from 47% in January to 56% in June, while the figure for nurses has increased from 61% to 62% and support for ambulance workers has grown from 58% to 62%. In June, just 24% of the more than 1,000 respondents said they opposed the junior doctors\u2019 strike, and 21% for ambulance workers and nurses. Healthcare workers are striking in an effort to reverse the deep cuts to their salaries that have resulted from a decade of pay rises that have not kept up with inflation. Doctors, nurses and some other healthcare professionals have voted against the government\u2019s offer of 5% plus a non-consolidated payment. Junior doctors, who can have up to eight years of experience as a hospital doctor or three years in general practice, voted this month to strike from 7am on 13 July until 7am on 18 July, the longest such strike in NHS history. It is expected to result in thousands of appointments being rescheduled or cancelled. On Tuesday it was announced that senior doctors had voted to join them for the first time in this pay dispute, with their first two-day strike in more than 50 years scheduled from 20 July. On the same day, it emerged that nursing union members had failed to vote in sufficient numbers for further strike action. There are no available figures yet on public support for senior doctors. Ipsos polling from February found that 21% of people thought consultants were overpaid, a figure that rose to 47% when respondents were informed that senior doctors receive average salaries of \u00a3128,000. Ipsos polling also showed that nearly half (48%) of the public said they supported teachers in their strikes in June, up from 41% in June 2022. However, they were less supportive of some other professions. In June, just over a third (36%) supported airline workers, railway workers and border force staff taking action, while 35% supported university lecturers, 34% civil servants and 28% driving instructors. The proportion of the public opposed to rail strikes has fallen since reaching a high of 45% in March, when RMT members went on strike after rejecting a pay deal, and now stands at 37%. Opposition to civil service workers\u2019 strikes has fallen from 41% in June 2022 to 35% this month."

            "date": "2023-07-20T06:00:22Z",
            "content": "Polls have opened in three parliamentary seats where byelections are being held, with Rishi Sunak braced for an electoral test of his premiership. The Conservative-held constituencies are being targeted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who hope to overturn large majorities and send Tory MPs off into the summer recess nervous about their own political futures come the general election. Voters can cast their ballots from 7am on Thursday, across the south-western Tory stronghold of Somerton and Frome, Boris Johnson\u2019s old seat in the west London suburbs Uxbridge and South Ruislip, as well as Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire. Sunak was privately downcast on Wednesday afternoon about the his party\u2019s electoral prospects, in part given the nature of why the contests were triggered. Johnson stood down to avoid being suspended from parliament over a report that found he misled MPs over Partygate. Adams quit after being passed over for a peerage. And David Warbuton, an MP in Somerset since 2015, quit after being investigated over claims of harassment and drug use. On top of the circumstances of the byelections being called, Sunak\u2019s party is also polling poorly, nationally. At a behind-closed-doors meeting of Tory backbenchers on the eve of the byelections, MPs said he appeared to acknowledge the results would be \u201ctough\u201d. If the Conservatives are trounced, Sunak could become the first prime minister since Harold Wilson in 1968 to lose three byelections in a single day. The safest Tory seat is Selby and Ainsty \u2013 which delivered a 20,000 majority at the 2019 general election. Both Labour and the Conservatives say they expect the result to be tight \u2013 within about 1,000 votes. Keir Starmer\u2019s party want to pull off a win there to show they can win in rural areas as well as metropolitan cities and their traditional former industrial heartlands. But the swing required is much greater than current polls suggest they would achieve at a general election. Somerton and Frome should also be a Tory safe seat \u2013 with the party holding a 19,000 majority at the last election. But after the loss of Tiverton and Honiton last year, which saw an area in neighbouring Devon clinched by the Liberal Democrats, it is considered the most likely to flip. In Uxbridge and South Ruislip, hopes of a Tory resurgence have grown in recent days given some anger at the extension of the London ultra-low emissions zone by the capital\u2019s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan. The byelections will have a unique tinge to them. They will be the first parliamentary elections where voter ID is required, after the scheme was rolled out to council elections earlier this spring."

            "date": "2023-07-24T14:52:19Z",
            "content": "The Spanish Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has ruled out a return to the polls following Sunday\u2019s inconclusive snap general election, insisting a new government can be formed after his ruling coalition was narrowly beaten by the opposition conservative People\u2019s party (PP). Numerous opinion polls had suggested the PP and its potential allies in the far-right Vox party would comfortably win enough votes to topple the government of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) and its partners in the far-left Unidas Podemos alliance. The conservatives finished first with 136 seats in Spain\u2019s 350-seat congress but found themselves up against a resurgent PSOE, which finished second with 122 seats. The Vox party, heavily touted as a kingmaker, suffered a crushing night with its seat count dropping from 52 to 33. The hung parliament means the left and right blocs are trying to put together coalition governments while S\u00e1nchez remains as acting prime minister. Between them, the PP and Vox won 169 seats \u2013 seven short of the threshold needed for an absolute majority in congress \u2013 while the PSOE and its allies in the new, far-left Sumar coalition won 153 seats between them. Although the right bloc has more seats, the left bloc has a greater chance of securing the support of smaller regional parties, many of which will be put off a potential PP government because of the party\u2019s recent coalition deals with Vox following May\u2019s regional and municipal elections. PSOE sources said the acting prime minister had told his party there was no need for another election because he was \u201csure that our democracy can find a formula for government\u201d. However, S\u00e1nchez \u2013 who is routinely accused by his critics of being far too reliant on the votes of Catalan and Basque separatists \u2013 looks likely to need the backing of Junts, a hardline Catalan pro-independence party. Junts is the party of the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who fled Spain to avoid arrest after his unilateral attempts to secure Catalan independence failed six years ago \u2013 and who is no fan of S\u00e1nchez. Speaking on Monday, the PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, admitted his party hadn\u2019t \u201clived up to our expectations\u201d but said he had already spoken to Vox and three regional parties \u2013 the Navarrese People\u2019s Union, the Canarian Coalition and the Basque Nationalist party \u2013 with a few to forming \u201ca stable government\u201d. Other senior PP members said the party had a clear mandate to rule and a duty to avoid the possibility of a repeat election later this year. The party\u2019s deputy organisational secretary, Miguel Tellado, told the state broadcaster TVE that \u201cdialogue, dialogue and dialogue is the challenge that lies ahead for us\u201d, adding: \u201cNo one wants a political impasse that could lead to another election.\u201d Cuca Gamarra, the PP\u2019s general secretary, said her party had won the elections in terms of seats and share of the vote and called on the socialists not to try to cut deals with Catalan separatists. \u201cYou can\u2019t try to pull off an investiture vote at any cost and using anyone\u2019s vote because you\u2019ll end up in the hands of Puigdemont, a fugitive from justice, and in the hands of parties that only want to push for independence,\u201d she told Telecinco on Monday. Gamarra said there were only two possible options when it came to the next government of Spain: \u201cEither the party that won the elections governs or we end up in a situation with an impasse and another Frankenstein [government].\u201d Junts has already signalled that its help in returning the socialists to power would have a price. It said it would like to see an amnesty for exiled Catalan politicians and a proper referendum on self-determination. S\u00e1nchez, however, has repeatedly said there will be no independence vote. \u201cWe won\u2019t make Pedro S\u00e1nchez PM in exchange for nothing,\u201d its leader, M\u00edriam Nogueras, warned on Sunday night. Puigdemont, meanwhile, said his party \u201cowes nothing to anyone but our voters\u201d, adding that it had never supported S\u00e1nchez\u2019s budgets, reforms or the \u201cfarce\u201d of his dialogue aimed at finding a solution to the question of Catalan independence. Puigdemont\u2019s suddenly acquired say over who governs Spain will come as a welcome boost to the bitterly divided and stalled regional independence movement. The two main pro-independence parties \u2013 Junts and the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) \u2013 suffered dismal results on Sunday. The Catalan branch of the socialist party came first, followed by Sumar. The ERC came third, losing six seats, followed by Junts, which lost one seat. The ERC, which belongs to the more moderate, pragmatic wing of the independence movement, has said it is prepared to support a new, socialist-led government to provide an alternative to a PP-Vox coalition. Negotiations are likely to be further complicated by a request from prosecutors for a Spanish supreme court judge to issue an arrest warrant for Puidgdemont over this role in the unsuccessful push for independence. Prosecutors have asked for a European arrest warrant to be issued in light of a decision three weeks ago by the general court of the European Union that dismissed Puigdemont\u2019s appeal to retain immunity from prosecution as a member of the European parliament. The former regional president\u2019s lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, accused the Spanish judicial authorities of playing politics. \u201cThe petition has come in the middle of the debate about the election results,\u201d said Boye. \u201cThey are trying to take part in the political debate.\u201d Puigdemont expressed similar sentiments in a tweet on Monday. \u201cOne day you are decisive in order to form a Spanish government, the next day Spain orders your arrest,\u201d he wrote."

            "date": "2023-07-23T13:21:49Z",
            "content": "Spaniards are heading to the polls to vote in a bitterly contested general election that could see the far right play a key role in government for the first time since the country returned to democracy after General Franco\u2019s death five decades ago. The vote, called two months ago by Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, after his Spanish Socialist Workers party (PSOE) suffered a drubbing in May\u2019s regional and municipal elections, offers people a stark choice between the left and right blocs. While the opposition conservative People\u2019s party (PP) is expected to finish first, polls suggest it is likely to fall short of an absolute majority and to have to rely on the support of the far-right Vox party to form a government. The prime minister has depicted Sunday\u2019s vote as a crucial showdown between the forces of progress and the forces of reactionary conservatism. He argues that only the PSOE and the new, leftwing Sumar alliance, led by Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister and labour minister, Yolanda D\u00edaz, can defend and deliver the progressive agenda he has pursued over the past four years. Although the PP has consistently led the polls and waged an aggressive campaign, it suffered a poor final week as the focus shifted to its leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o. He had already been left looking awkward after his claims about the PP\u2019s track record on pensions turned out to be untrue, but was then criticised for the sexist tone of an apparent reference to D\u00edaz\u2019s makeup. By Friday, Feij\u00f3o found himself having to respond to renewed questions about his friendship in the 1990s with a man who was later convicted of drug trafficking. Following the controversy, S\u00e1nchez \u2013 who was unexpectedly beaten by the PP leader in the only head-to-head debate between the leaders of Spain\u2019s two biggest parties \u2013 has insisted that the left is staging a comeback. \u201cThe only thing I can ask for is the highest possible turnout and the largest possible mobilisation because that\u2019s how we can ensure that the government that emerges from this vote will be a strong one so that Spain can move forward for another four years,\u201d the prime minister said after casting his ballot on Sunday morning. S\u00e1nchez added that the election was \u201cimportant not just for us, but also for the world and for Europe\u201d. D\u00edaz, meanwhile, called on all citizens to vote, adding: \u201cThe next decade is at stake.\u201d Feij\u00f3o also urged Spaniards to vote despite the heat and the summer holidays. \u201cI feel very proud of our country because, despite the temperatures and it being the summer season, we\u2019re seeing a good turnout, he said. \u201cWhatever happens, I\u2019ll keep working for my country, which I believe in. That\u2019s my commitment, my vocation and my destiny.\u201d Vox, which has made culture wars a central part of its campaign, also called on voters to come out and speak up. But its leader, Santiago Abascal, also appeared to concede that, despite its potential king-making power, the party might see its seat count reduced because of a resurgent PP. \u201cAny result Vox gets under these circumstances is going to be a heroic result,\u201d he said on Sunday. At 2pm, turnout was at 40.5% \u2013 2.6 percentage points up on same time in the 2019 elections. According to Spain\u2019s postal service, the summer election has seen a record 2.47 million registered voters casting an absentee ballot. The PP and Vox \u2013 which have forged more regional governing coalitions since May\u2019s elections \u2013 accuse S\u00e1nchez and his minority government partners in the Unidas Podemos alliance of being weak, opportunistic and over-reliant on the Catalan and Basque separatist parties on which it depends for support in parliament. They also say S\u00e1nchez and his partners have failed Spaniards through their badly botched reform of sexual offences legislation which has led to more than 100 convicted sex offenders being granted early release. Feij\u00f3o, who was a senior politician in Galicia before serving as regional president between 2009 and last year, has faced fresh scrutiny over his relationship with Marcial Dorado, who was arrested in 2003 and subsequently jailed for offences including drug trafficking, bribery and money laundering. Feij\u00f3o has always said he had no reason to suspect Dorado was involved in anything illegal and has said he broke off contact with him as soon as he was charged with criminal offences. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to find out about these things now because you\u2019ve got the internet and Google,\u201d Feij\u00f3o said on Wednesday. \u201cWhen I knew him, this gentleman wasn\u2019t facing any proceedings over drug trafficking.\u201d Two days later, Feij\u00f3o accused his opponents of trying to smear him, adding that when he knew Dorado, he \u201chad been a smuggler [but] never a drug trafficker\u201d. An Ipsos poll for La Vanguardia this month found that the economy was the single biggest issue for voters, with 31% of those surveyed putting it at the top of their list. Next was unemployment (10%) and healthcare (9%). Immigration, one of Vox\u2019s favourite talking points, was the most important issue for just 2% of those polled."

Here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments from the day: Polls opened this morning in three parliamentary seats where byelections are being held, with Rishi Sunak braced for an electoral test of his premiership. Voters have been able to cast their ballots from 7am in the south-western Tory stronghold of Somerton and Frome, Boris Johnson\u2019s old seat in the west London suburbs Uxbridge and South Ruislip, as well as Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire. Ministers will lay out their final year of legislation at King Charles\u2019 first king\u2019s speech in November, the government has confirmed. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, said on Thursday the king\u2019s speech will take place on 7 November, in what is likely to be the last such speech before a general election. Lobbying rules will be toughened up across Whitehall in a long-awaited response by ministers to issues raised by the Greensill scandal, the Guardian has learned. Government departments will be forced to release more information about meetings with lobbyists and extend current requirements for disclosure to phone and video calls, sources say. Rishi Sunak has criticised the European Union\u2019s \u201cregrettable choice of words\u201d after it appeared to have endorsed the name Argentina uses for the Falkland Islands. A diplomatic row erupted after the EU referred to the islands as \u201cIslas Malvinas\u201d in a declaration jointly signed with Argentina and other Latin American countries. The ongoing Stormont stalemate is \u201ctotally unsustainable\u201d, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president, Michelle O\u2019Neill, has said. Following a meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, at Hillsborough Castle, O\u2019Neil said engagement would continue, but stressed it had to be meaningful. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng received about \u00a3400 in severance pay for every day they were in office, according to government accounts published on Thursday. The former prime minister and former chancellor each received more than \u00a316,000 on leaving their jobs after just a few weeks, the Treasury\u2019s annual report shows, while Tom Scholar, the department\u2019s most senior civil servant, received \u00a3457,000 after being sacked by Truss.

The government\u2019s sweeping and controversial asylum reforms have become law as the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats topped 14,000 for the year so far, PA news reports. The illegal migration bill has become an Act of Parliament after being given royal assent, deputy speaker Sir Roger Gale announced in the Commons on Thursday afternoon. It comes as Channel crossings for the year to date reached a provisional total of 14,071, after 297 people were recorded making the journey on Wednesday. The total number of migrant crossings for 2023 so far is still lower than the more than 15,000 arrivals recorded this time last year. Crossings continued on Thursday amid calm weather conditions at sea. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng received about \u00a3400 in severance pay for every day they were in office, according to government accounts published on Thursday. The former prime minister and former chancellor each received more than \u00a316,000 on leaving their jobs after just a few weeks, the Treasury\u2019s annual report shows, while Tom Scholar, the department\u2019s most senior civil servant, received \u00a3457,000 after being sacked by Truss. The figures are contained in a series of annual reports from across government, which also show that Boris Johnson was given a payout of \u00a318,660 after quitting as prime minister. Truss and her allies saw Scholar, who was sacked on her first day in office, as representative of orthodox Treasury thinking, which they were determined to overhaul as part of their plan to bring in much lower UK tax rates. Meanwhile the Department for Transport\u2019s accounts show that Grant Shapps received \u00a316,876 after quitting as transport secretary in September, even though he returned to government as home secretary six weeks later. He is now energy secretary. Rishi Sunak, however, who spent just over three months out of government between quitting as chancellor and becoming prime minister, handed back his payout of the same amount. Labour criticised Johnson and Truss for taking their payments after resigning, the former after a series of ethics scandals and the latter amid economic turmoil created by her government\u2019s fiscal policies. UK mortgage rates rocketed after the Truss government\u2019s mini-budget last September, and have not returned to the same level since. Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: After the mess they left our country in, they should be hanging their heads in embarrassment, not walking away with an enormous payoff. At a time when people up and down the country are struggling to pay their mortgages and put food on the table, it shows a staggering lack of shame for Johnson and Truss to accept this money, but is exactly what we\u2019ve come to expect from a bunch of Tories who only care about themselves. Read more here: The ongoing Stormont stalemate is \u201ctotally unsustainable\u201d, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president, Michelle O\u2019Neill, has said. This from PA Media: Following a meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, at Hillsborough Castle, the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president, Michelle O\u2019Neil, said engagement would continue, but stressed it had to be meaningful and lead to the restoration of the devolved power-sharing institutions. Heaton-Harris is concluding a round of talks with party leaders in the latest attempt to break the Stormont stalemate. The assembly has been in flux for more than a year amid DUP protest action over the Northern Ireland protocol. The Windsor framework was agreed by the EU and UK earlier this year as a way to reduce red tape on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the DUP has insisted it will not return to Stormont until the UK government provides further legislative assurances around Northern Ireland\u2019s place within the UK internal market. Senior civil servants have been left running Stormont departments and having to make substantial cuts following a budget set by Heaton-Harris. After the meeting, O\u2019Neill said the British and Irish governments had to do more to bring Stormont back. She said: We have just had our meeting with the secretary of state and we have made it very clear to him that the current position is totally unsustainable, this vacuum isn\u2019t good enough, all it is serving is to punish the public. O\u2019Neill added: Whilst people within the DUP take themselves off on summer holidays, workers and families are left struggling and worrying about how they are going to deal with the cost-of-living issues. We have impressed upon the secretary of state that both himself, the British government and the Irish government must do more; this position just isn\u2019t tenable. We need to see action, the public rightly expect that everybody will work together. We have heard from the secretary of state that they intend to be engaged over the summer, but there is a difference between engagement, and engagement which is actually meaningful and leads to a restoration of the executive. Heaton-Harris met earlier this week with the DUP, Alliance party and the SDLP in London. The DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said after his meeting on Wednesday the \u201cball is in the government\u2019s court\u201d with regards to action which would see the restoration of the Stormont power-sharing arrangements. Donaldson said there had so far been a \u201clack of meaningful action\u201d from Westminster in addressing his concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements. Heaton-Harris has been pressing the parties on their plans for a costed programme for government for any incoming executive. Rishi Sunak has criticised the European Union\u2019s \u201cregrettable choice of words\u201d after it appeared to have endorsed the name Argentina uses for the Falkland Islands. A diplomatic row erupted after the EU referred to the islands as \u201cIslas Malvinas\u201d in a declaration jointly signed with Argentina and other Latin American countries, PA Media reports. Downing Street said any suggestion that the EU would recognise Argentina\u2019s claims on the Falklands would have been \u201centirely unacceptable\u201d, as it welcomed a subsequent clarification that EU countries have not in fact changed their position on their status. The initial statement, published on Tuesday after a summit between EU nations and the Celac bloc of Latin American and Caribbean states, said: Regarding the question of sovereignty over the Islas Malvinas / Falkland Islands, the European Union took note of Celac\u2019s historical position based on the importance of dialogue and respect for international law in the peaceful solution of disputes. British diplomats reportedly complained about the wording, which Argentina\u2019s president, Alberto Fernandez, appeared to hail on Twitter as support for his country\u2019s long-standing \u201cclaim to sovereignty\u201d over the Falklands. In a statement, the EU foreign affairs spokesman, Peter Stano, said: The EU member states have not changed their views and positions concerning the Falklands/Islas Malvinas. The EU is not in a situation to express any position on the Falklands/Islas Malvinas, as there is not any council discussion on this matter. Sunak\u2019s official spokesman told reporters on Thursday: The prime minister\u2019s view is that it would have been entirely unacceptable for the EU to question the Falkland Islanders\u2019 right to decide their own future. To be clear, the Falkland Islands are British, that was the choice of the islanders themselves. The EU has rightly now clarified that their position on the Falklands has not changed after their regrettable choice of words. And just as a reminder, in the 2013 referendum, 99.8% of islanders voted to be part of the UK family. It\u2019s a position supported by international law and the UN charter which is binding on all UN members. And we will continue to defend the Falklands\u2019 right to self-determination in all international forums and have called on the EU to respect the democratic rights of the Falkland Islands. He added: The concern is any suggestion that EU states would recognise Argentina\u2019s claims on the Falklands, which they have now clarified is incorrect. The islands were the subject of a war in 1982 which killed 255 British service personnel, three islanders and 649 Argentinian personnel. Lobbying rules will be toughened up across Whitehall in a long-awaited response by ministers to issues raised by the Greensill scandal, the Guardian has learned. Government departments will be forced to release more information about meetings with lobbyists and extend current requirements for disclosure to phone and video calls, sources say. Private emails, as well as WhatsApps and texts on personal phones that are used to discuss government business, will also now need to be declared, and senior civil servants will have to comply with the new rules. The changes come nearly two years after a major report was published following the Greensill lobbying scandal, involving a multinational supply chain finance firm, the former prime minister David Cameron, serving ministers and top officials. Nineteen reforms were proposed by Nigel Boardman, a corporate lawyer who was commissioned by the government to conduct an independent investigation and published his findings in August 2021. In its response, the government will commit to improving the quality of departments\u2019 transparency disclosures, which cover meetings, gifts and hospitality, and are meant to guard against any perception of improper or secretive lobbying. Declarations will be aimed to be published monthly instead of quarterly under the plans to be announced later this week. Read the full story here: The controversial sacking of a top Treasury civil servant, Sir Tom Scholar, cost the government \u00a3457,000 in compensation, PA Media reports. The department\u2019s annual accounts reveal Scholar, who was dismissed as permanent secretary when Liz Truss came to power in September 2022, received a \u00a3335,000 severance payment along with \u00a3122,000 in annual leave adjustments, payment in lieu of notice and other payments. The accounts also show the extent of severance payments made to ministers in the wake of last year\u2019s mass resignations. Among those to receive severance payments was Chris Pincher, who resigned as deputy chief whip in June 2022 over allegations he groped two men at the Carlton Club. Pincher received \u00a37,920 in severance. The former prime ministers Truss and Boris Johnson received \u00a318,660 each after resigning, while the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng received \u00a316,876. The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, has confirmed that the controversial guidance to schools on trans pupils will now be delayed. Rishi Sunak had promised the guidance would be published before the end of the school year but it has been beset by ministerial in-fighting and legal wrangles. Keegan did not give any hint of when the guidance would now appear. In a written statement, Keegan said: It is vital that the guidance we publish gives clarity for schools and colleges and reassurance for parents. So, we have made the decision to allow more time \u2013 to speak to teachers, parents, lawyers and other stakeholders \u2013 in order to ensure this guidance meets the high expectations that these groups rightly have for it. The Law Society has said the illegal migration bill, expected to be given royal assent today, will be unworkable. Lubna Shuja, the president of the independent body for solicitors in England and Wales, said: We have been clear from the start that this legislation threatens to undermine the rule of law and access to justice. Whilst the act will soon come into force on paper, it will be unworkable in practice because it doesn\u2019t provide solutions to the asylum backlog, and there isn\u2019t capacity in the legal aid sector to provide the immigration advice needed. The Rwanda removal agreement has been ruled unlawful and is subject to an appeal in the supreme court. Even if that appeal proves successful, there are no other removal agreements in place. Rwanda alone would not be able to accept anywhere near the number of people who will be scheduled for \u2018removal\u2019. A growing number of people will be left in limbo as they cannot be removed, and they cannot claim asylum. The cost to the taxpayer will continue to increase as the individuals left in limbo are housed in various accommodation indefinitely. Ministers will lay out their final year of legislation at King Charles\u2019 first king\u2019s speech in November, the government has confirmed. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons, said on Thursday the king\u2019s speech will take place on 7 November, in what is likely to be the last such speech before a general election. The event will not only give the government a final chance to set the legislative agenda before that election but will also give the king his first chance to attend a state opening of parliament as monarch. Nigel Farage has praised a \u201cswift\u201d intervention by government ministers after reports that new laws could be drawn up to stop banks closing customers\u2019 accounts because they disagree with their political views. The former Ukip leader said MPs were \u201cbeginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well\u201d after his bank accounts were closed by Coutts, he says because his views \u201cdid not align with\u201d its values. Ministers are considering legislation to protect free speech by threatening banks with losing their licences if they blacklist people with controversial views, according to the Times. Farage said it was \u201cone of the swiftest interventions I\u2019ve seen by government for many, many years\u201d, and suggested it was a problem that had been \u201cbuilding up for years and years and years\u201d. He told PA media: Every MP will know of constituents, small businessmen and women, who\u2019ve literally been shut down by their banks with no reason given whatsoever. I also think that because of the politically exposed persons (PEP) rule, I think they\u2019re beginning to realise that this system is coming for them as well. Those designated a PEP are typically political representatives and their family members, whose accounts can be treated with extra due diligence by financial institutions. Farage claimed there was \u201ca real sense of anger\u201d among the public, who bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis, that now such banks could \u201ctreat us with contempt\u201d. The closure of Farage\u2019s accounts sparked outrage among senior Tory MPs, who have put pressure on Coutts and its owner, NatWest. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, intervened in the row on Wednesday to say it was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cno one should be barred from using basic services for their political views\u201d. Read more here: A senior Conservative MP has apologised and deleted a video in which he praised the Taliban and credited them with improving safety in Afghanistan. Tobias Ellwood said he was \u201csorry for my poor communication\u201d after his actions outraged fellow Tory MPs and military veterans, and an attempt was launched to challenge his role as chair of the Commons defence select committee. In a tweet and accompanying video, Ellwood described Afghanistan as a \u201ccountry transformed\u201d and talked up the group that seized power in August 2021, claiming \u201csecurity has vastly improved, corruption is down and the opium trade has all but disappeared\u201d. Following the backlash, Ellwood said: The last couple of days have probably been the most miserable as a member of parliament. I got it wrong. He called the row a Twitter \u201cstorm\u201d and said he stood by criticisms in the video about Britain\u2019s lack of engagement with Afghanistan\u2019s new leadership since the chaotic exit of western countries\u2019 armed forces from Kabul nearly two years ago. But Ellwood used a TV interview to repeatedly apologise, and said the video \u201ccould have been much better done\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s important to put your hand up and acknowledge errors, however well intentioned,\u201d the Bournemouth East MP and former army captain told TalkTV. Read the full story here: The Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary, Mick Lynch, has accused the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, of a \u201cdilution of traditional Labour positions\u201d and \u201ctaking the side of the Conservatives\u201d over the two-child benefit cap. Lynch told Sky News on Thursday: It\u2019s not just our members, we\u2019d like him to show that he supports the trade unions, that he supports working people who are struggling, and we think some of the stuff that we\u2019re hearing is a dilution of traditional Labour positions and even the positions that he himself adopted when he was elected as leader. So the stuff about the two-child cap is not really good enough; it\u2019s taking the side of the Conservatives, it\u2019s taking the side of austerity. Lynch said Starmer needs to show that he is a progressive Labour politician and that if he wants to win working-class votes and wants the support of the trade unions, then \u201che might want to start saying things that we can agree with\u201d. He continued: I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll get a new deal for workers, the repeal of many of these anti-trade union laws that restrict our rights and our freedoms, and that he shows that in terms of funding public services like education, health, care for our elders and addressing the housing crisis that we\u2019ve got in this country that he can do something positive in favour of working people. If he does that then more people will support him, if he doesn\u2019t then some people might conclude \u2026 they may as well have the Tories because there\u2019s not much difference between them. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think it\u2019s in our interest to get rid of this government, but he\u2019s got to show some distinction and some distinguishing policies that set him out as different and as a radical person pushing for change. Staff working for MPs need better HR access and a more supportive culture in parliament, but the system through which they are directly employed by members does not need to change, a report by a committee of MPs has concluded. The speaker\u2019s conference on the employment conditions of members\u2019 staff, chaired by Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, was set up last year after a wave of stories about sexual harassment and bullying in parliament. There was particular concern that staff working directly for MPs, as opposed to those centrally employed by parliament, were vulnerable because the HR practices and working culture were directly set by the MP, who was also their employer. Before the inquiry, Hoyle called for a change to this system, suggesting the idea of setting up an outside employer, meaning staff would have independent input into their careers and concerns. But the report, produced by a cross-party group of 16 MPs, led by Hoyle, said the problems faced by staff were \u201cnot inherently related to the identity of the employer\u201d, and that changing the employer would be expensive, time consuming, and \u201cultimately a blunt instrument\u201d. They said: We conclude that the nature of the work of an MP, and the close working arrangements and personal loyalty between members and their staff mean that members should continue to be the employers of their staff. The report, which will be debated in the Commons before it is implemented, sets out other proposals, including universal access to professional HR, and reforms to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which has a significant role in the contracts and salaries of MPs\u2019 staff. More widely, the MPs said, there was a need for \u201ca culture which recognises and values the work that [MPs\u2019 staff] do and makes these staff feel part of the wider parliamentary community\u201d. Rishi Sunak told MPs at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers on the eve of the polls on Wednesday night that they faced a \u201ctough battle\u201d in what were seen as safe seats for his party. The prime minister told them that governing parties rarely win byelections but urged the MPs to unite in the face of any defeat as he pledged to \u201cthrow everything\u201d at winning the next general election, PA Media reports. Labour hopes to snatch Uxbridge and South Ruislip, which was Boris Johnson\u2019s seat until he quit, and Selby and Ainsty - vacated by his ally Nigel Adams\u2019 resignation. The Liberal Democrats are eyeing victory in the contest in Somerton and Frome that was triggered by David Warburton quitting after admitting cocaine use amid allegations of sexual harassment. Losses for the Tories in all of the seats would be the first time in 55 years that a government has been defeated in three byelections on the same day. On Wednesday evening, Sunak was understood to have told his MPs: In the coming months, I am going to set out more of what I would do if I had a full term. I was recently described as a full-spectrum, modern Conservative and you are going to see that in the programme I lay out. Sunak pledged to show the public \u201cwho is really on their side\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd that is what will propel us to victory.\u201d Sunak told the meeting. When we come back in September we have a choice to make, all of us. Do we come together and throw everything at winning the next election or not? I\u2019ve made my choice, I\u2019m all in with you to win. I promise you we can do this but we can only do it together as one team. The Tory backbencher Jonathan Gullis told reporters outside the meeting that the problem is \u201capathetic Conservative voters\u201d rather than the public\u2019s support for the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer. He said Sunak told them \u201cwhat we already know, which is it\u2019s going to be a tough battle\u201d in the byelections. Tory MPs at the meeting said he did not address suggestions that he could spring a Cabinet reshuffle on Friday in an attempt to reset his premiership. During a visit to Warwickshire, Sunak told reporters asking whether he would shake up his top team that \u201cyou would never expect me to comment on things like that\u201d \u2013 in what was clearly not a denial. He welcomed a fall in the rate of inflation as proof his government\u2019s plans were working. The prime minister\u2019s press secretary acknowledged it would be tough for the Tories to hold the three seats on Thursday. She said: Byelections, for incumbent governments, are very difficult, that is the nature of them. The election that the Conservative party is most focused on is the general election. Polls have opened in three parliamentary seats where byelections are being held, with Rishi Sunak braced for an electoral test of his premiership. The Conservative-held constituencies are being targeted by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who hope to overturn large majorities and send Tory MPs off into the summer recess nervous about their own political futures come the general election. Voters have been able to cast their ballots from 7am in the south-western Tory stronghold of Somerton and Frome, Boris Johnson\u2019s old seat in the west London suburbs Uxbridge and South Ruislip, as well as Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire. Sunak was privately downcast on Wednesday afternoon about the his party\u2019s electoral prospects, in part given the nature of why the contests were triggered. Johnson stood down to avoid being suspended from parliament over a report that found he misled MPs over Partygate. Nigel Adams quit after being passed over for a peerage. And David Warbuton, an MP in Somerset since 2015, quit after being investigated over claims of harassment and drug use. On top of the circumstances of the byelections being called, Sunak\u2019s party is also polling poorly, nationally. At a behind-closed-doors meeting of Tory backbenchers on the eve of the byelections, MPs said Sunak appeared to acknowledge the results would be \u201ctough\u201d. If the Conservatives are trounced, Sunak could become the first prime minister since Harold Wilson in 1968 to lose three byelections in a single day. I will be looking after the politics blog today.

            "date": "2023-07-12T07:40:25Z",
            "content": "Embattled consultancy firm PwC has admitted to another serious conflict of interest breach, but has clarified that it did not involve the misuse of government information. The breach occurred in 2018 and is separate to the misuse of confidential tax policy information that has triggered a reputation crisis for the firm and seen the divestment of its government services division for just $1. This breach involved a PwC staff member entering into an exclusivity agreement with a client without proper authorisation from the firm\u2019s conflict of interests team. It was revealed in response to questions from Greens senator Barbara Pocock, who asked PwC to detail \u201chow many disciplinary actions have been taken in relation to conflicts of interest and/or the misuse of government information in the past five years?\u201d. In response, PwC told the Senate that it was aware \u201cthe firm had taken action in relation to two matters involving conflicts of interest and/or the misuse of government information in the past five years, including the Tax Practitioners Board matter in which disciplinary action was taken this year\u201d. \u201cThe other matter occurred in 2018\u201d. When asked to provide more detail, a PwC spokesperson told Guardian Australia \u201cthere is no second misuse of information breach\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cPwC, like other firms, was asked about disciplinary actions and PwC confirmed it had taken discipline against a partner over an internal process oversight where the partner did not obtain approval for an exclusivity undertaking in an engagement,\u201d the spokesperson said. The partner involved received a financial penalty and was not fired. Details about the 2018 matter were not addressed during previous parliamentary inquiries and are likely to prompt more scrutiny and criticism of the firm, which initially sought to downplay the seriousness of the scandal. PwC has also provided more information about other scandals within the firm, including multiple sackings after a racist trivia event and a separate, additional breach of standards by Canberra-based partners. \u201cIn September 2021, allegations of racism were made against two employees who were hosting an online team trivia event,\u201d the PwC submission said. \u201cIssues were also raised that other people in attendance at the online event, including partners, did not speak up or raise concerns.\u201d The event was investigated by an external law firm and prompted a cultural overhaul to create a \u201cmore inclusive and fairer PwC\u201d. \u201cThe panel made findings that resulted in the termination of two employees, financial penalties for three partners and formal warnings for 13 partners who were either in leadership positions in the team that ran the event, managed the employees who were terminated or who attended the event,\u201d the submission said. The firm also revealed an investigation was launched after a former employee accused a partner in the financial advisory team of breaching behaviour standards. The specific allegation and the date are not disclosed. \u201cThese allegations were investigated and the facts lead to a broader group of employees in the same financial advisory team being investigated for their conduct,\u201d the PwC submission said. \u201c[It was] determined that the partner was to be mandatorily retired and three employees had their employment terminated as a result of their breaches of the code of conduct.\u201d"

            "title": "Niger coup leaders accuse France of plotting military intervention",
            "date": "2023-07-31T16:28:05Z",
            "content": "The military junta that seized power in Niger has accused France of plotting military intervention to reinstate the deposed president, Mohamed Bazoum, as tensions in the region continued to grow in the wake of the coup. The junta said on national TV that France was searching \u201cfor ways and means to intervene militarily in Niger\u201d and had held a meeting with the chief of staff of Niger\u2019s national guard \u201cto obtain the necessary political and military authorisation\u201d. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, denied any alleged intention of military intervention in the west African country. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told BFMTV news channel on Monday night, adding that it was still possible to return Niger\u2019s democratically elected president to power. \u201cAnd it\u2019s necessary because destabilisation is perilous for Niger and its neighbours,\u201d she said. Bazoum, an ally of western powers, was toppled on 26 July in a coup by Niger\u2019s elite presidential guard. Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani declared himself leader but his claim has been shunned internationally. On Monday, Bazoum\u2019s party said several ministers in his ousted government had been arrested, including the mines minister. Niger is the world\u2019s seventh-biggest producer of uranium, the radioactive metal widely used for nuclear energy and treating cancer. The Chadian president, Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by, who flew to Niger to try to mediate, on Monday posted what appeared to be the first images of Bazoum since the takeover, showing him smiling and apparently unharmed. D\u00e9by said he had met Bazoum and coup leader Tchiani to explore ways \u201cto find a peaceful solution\u201d, without going into further detail. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has given the junta a week to give back power, warning in a statement that if Bazoum was not reinstated it would take \u201call measures\u201d to restore constitutional order, which \u201cmay include the use of force\u201d. ECOWAS has suspended all commercial and financial transactions, while France, the EU and the US, which has about 1,000 troops in Niger, have either cut off support or threatened to do so. Germany suspended financial aid and development cooperation, and UN humanitarian operations have been put on hold. Russia called for the swift return of \u201cthe rule of law\u201d and \u201crestraint from all parties so that this doesn\u2019t result in human casualties\u201d. Niger, with a population of 26 million, frequently ranks at the bottom of the UN\u2019s human development index benchmark of prosperity. The country, which became independent from France in 1960, is a landlocked state, and strict economic sanctions against it could affect many supplies, including electricity. The coup, according to the putschists, was a response to \u201cthe degradation of the security situation\u201d linked to the jihadist conflict, as well as corruption and economic difficulties. As Niger struggles with two jihadist campaigns \u2013 one in the south-west, which swept in from Mali in 2015, and the other in the south-east, involving jihadists from north-eastern Nigeria \u2013 the coup has shone a spotlight on France\u2019s reduced and contested military presence in the Sahel region of Africa after 10 years fighting jihadist insurgencies. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, chose unusually strong language towards the junta in Niger, vowing there would be \u201cimmediate and uncompromising\u201d action if French citizens or interests were attacked, after thousands rallied outside the French embassy. News agencies reported anti-French and pro-Russian slogans were shouted at the rallies on Sunday, which were televised. Protesters, some carrying Russian flags, said France, the country\u2019s traditional ally, had failed to shield them against the jihadists, whereas Russia would be a stronger ally. The coup is a serious threat to French strategy in the Sahel, after several military coups in other countries had already forced France to rethink its decade-long military presence and anti-jihadist mission. France first deployed troops against jihadists in Mali in 2013 under the Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, but in the past three years several military coups in the region, as well as a continued jihadist presence, have exposed the limitations of the military strategy and forced France to scale back its presence and focus its efforts in Niger, with Bazoum as a firm ally. It has 1,500 troops in the country and an airbase near Niamey. In Mali a coup in 2020 led to a diplomatic standoff with France, which withdrew its troops last year. France also quit Burkina Faso after two coups last year brought in a junta that adopted a nationalist line. Niagal\u00e9 Bagayoko, a political scientist and defence expert, told France Inter radio that the G5 Sahel group of nations set up to combat jihadist insurgency now featured a majority of military juntas. She said France could not continue its military engagement in Niger under the current circumstances, adding that France had been rethinking its presence in the region for more than two years. She said foreign troops, including the US and other Europeans as well as the French, were seen as unpopular and people wanted their withdrawal. The writer and analyst Seidik Abba told France Inter that the broader problem for Paris was that the poor results of its military and security drive against jihadists had made France a scapegoat. He said the strategy in the Sahel had been a security and military one, when in fact \u201cit wasn\u2019t just a security and military issue, it was also a question of development, justice and governance\u201d."

            "title": "Fears for Libyan oil production amid military threats",
            "date": "2023-07-04T13:33:45Z",
            "content": "Fears have been raised of a damaging oil shutdown in Libya with implications for global energy markets after Libya\u2019s strongman in the east, Gen Khalifa Haftar, warned of military action unless oil revenues are divided fairly within the next two months. With the country long divided between two governments in the east and west and little prospect of presidential elections designed to reunify the country at least until next year, politicians in the east have threatened to put oil revenues under judicial control preventing the revenue reaching the Central Bank from the National Oil Corporation (NOC), the state-run oil firm. Eastern politicians claim the Central Bank distributes the bulk of oil revenues to the rival UN-recognised government based in Tripoli, even though the oil is produced in fields largely based in the east of the country. The US special envoy to Libya, Richard Norland, eager to keep oil production flowing, had urged the east not to disrupt production. In a speech near Benghazi on Monday night, Haftar demanded a new \u201chigher financial committee\u201d be established to agree on the distribution of Libya\u2019s oil resources. He warned that if the body was not established by the end of August, \u201cthe armed forces will be ready for orders when the time comes\u201d, remarks that suggest he would shut down the oil fields. Libya produces 1.2m barrels a day, but has plans to increase production to 2m barrels by 2027. Much of the oil goes to European customers looking for a replacement for lost Russian crude. Haftar\u2019s speech included an attack on the leadership of the Central Bank of Libya for allowing rampant corruption. He also called on foreign ambassadors, naming Norland, to stay out of the affairs of Libya saying their interventions had been an abject failure, self-interested and only worsened divides in the country. Norland had earlier urged the east not to shut down oil production, saying: \u201cWe call on all Libyan leaders to put in place a comprehensive mechanism to control revenues as a constructive way to address grievances about the distribution of oil revenues and to establish transparency without jeopardising the integrity of Libya\u2019s economy or the non-political nature of the National Oil Corporation.\u201d There have been rumours that the NOC chairman, Farhat bin Qadara, appointed a year ago after his predecessor was forced out, was prepared to quit due to the political pressure, but he appears to be willing to stay on and try to mediate between Haftar and the Tripoli-based government led by a wealthy businessman prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh. Haftar claimed the central bank\u2019s data indicated that \u201cthe documentary credits for the year 2022 valued at $10bn were distributed to 1,646 private companies last year, of which the share of the eastern region was 7%, and the southern region received only 2% of the total of these credits\u201d. He said that official audit reports showed shocking tampering with the capabilities of the Libyan people with more than 200bn dinars distributed without any benefit to the Libyan people, adding that public funds are still wasted on a daily basis. He claimed government spending amounted to 122bn dinars, while oil revenues amounted to 135bn dinars. \u201cThere is a level of looting of public money that has not happened in the contemporary history of Libya, with the inability of oversight and the judiciary to do anything to stop the bleeding and theft of public money openly during the day, and in return the Libyans are starving and getting poorer day by day,\u201d he said. Libya is ranked 172 out of 179 in the Transparency International corruption perceptions index, and Haftar is an unlikely champion of an anti-corruption drive. Norland ignored the personal attacks mounted on him over his interventions, saying before Haftar\u2019s speech: \u201cThe important issue of how Libya\u2019s oil revenues are distributed has been one of the issues underlying conflict in Libya so I am pleased that my recent comments have generated such useful debate among Libyan leaders.\u201d"

            "title": "Manipur: why is there conflict and how is the government responding?",
            "date": "2023-07-21T17:27:27Z",
            "content": "How did the conflict in Manipur begin? Manipur is a state in north-east India with a population of around three million. It has been embroiled in an ethnic conflict since early May, fought between the majority Meitei community and the minority Kuki tribe. India\u2019s north-eastern states have a history of ethnic rivalries dating back to before the country became independent in 1947. In Manipur, violence has erupted between the Meitei and the Kuki communities several times before. Tensions had been simmering between the two communities recently, driven in part by the Meitei-controlled state government. The government was accused of pursuing policies that discriminated against Kukis, including forced evictions that threatened the security of their land, and through an attempt to cast them as illegal immigrants. The violence was sparked by a court ruling in March that granted the majority Meitei \u201cscheduled tribal status\u201d, entitling them to the same economic benefits and quotas in government jobs and education as the minority Kuki. It also allowed Meiteis to buy land in the hills, where the Kukis predominately live, further fuelling fears that their lands, jobs and opportunities would be taken away. This prompted protests, mostly by Kuki student groups, which were met with violence and by early May, it had escalated into all-out violence. In the state capital, Imphal, Meitei mobs began targeting Kuki homes and attacked Kuki people who tried to flee the city for the hills, where they control much of the land. Kuki villages were also burned to the ground by Meitei militias numbering in their hundreds, sometimes thousands. The court ruling was later stayed by the supreme court, which called it \u201cfactually wrong\u201d, but by then the conflict had already taken hold. How has the violence unfolded? The majority of the violence was initially perpetrated by Meitei groups against the Kuki villages and communities. As the clashes spread, villages were burned down and more than 250 churches belonging to the Kuki community, who are Christian, were destroyed. As fake news and misinformation circulated, claiming that Meitei women had been raped and killed by Kukis, Kuki women began to be systematically targeted in revenge attacks, which included rape, torture and assault. There have also been several reports of beheadings. The state was swiftly bifurcated along ethnic lines, with the Meiteis in the valley and the Kukis in the hills, defending their territory against violent mobs, with a buffer zone created in the middle. To enter the territory of the opposing tribe was soon considered to be a death sentence. Much of the violence has been fought with thousands of weapons stolen from police and army barracks. So far, more than 140 people have died in the violence and 60,000 have been displaced. The internet remains shut down in large parts of the state. Though the state and central government \u2013 which are both ruled by the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) \u2013 have claimed that the situation has begun to calm down, intermittent clashes have continued to erupt and those fighting on both sides have warned that Manipur remains on the brink of civil war. The clashes have renewed and strengthened a longstanding demand by the Kukis for their own separate state. Kuki groups say the violence has proved they can no longer live safely under the oppressions of a Meitei-dominant state and have pledged they will not stop fighting until their own state is granted. The Meitei community and the state government fiercely oppose the creation of a separate Kuki state. How has the government responded? Even as the violence escalated, the response from the central BJP government was notably muted. The BJP state government \u2013 dominated by the Meitei community \u2013 has been accused of being complicit in the violence against the Kuki minority by allowing Meitei gangs to carry out violence with impunity. Prime minister Narendra Modi maintained a months-long public silence on the conflict and has yet to visit Manipur since the violence broke out. It was only after a viral video of two Kuki women being forcibly stripped naked, publicly groped and then allegedly gang raped by a Meitei mob caused outrage across the country that Modi commented on the issue. Modi said that \u201cwhat happened to the daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven\u201d and that the \u201centire country had been shamed by the incident\u201d. However, he has faced criticism for not addressing the broader conflict or referring to those who have died in the fighting. Some allege that the Hindu nationalist Modi government is not stepping in to protect the Kukis, who are Christian, from the Meitei, who are Hindu. India\u2019s home minister, Amit Shah, visited Manipur at the end of May, but he failed to bring about a ceasefire between the groups or bring the two parties together for negotiation. The \u201cpeace committee\u201d set up by Shah has been shunned by Kuki groups, who allege it is dominated by Meitei figures, including the BJP chief minister. Police have been accused of refusing to assist those in the Kuki community who have been attacked and have not investigated reports of rape, torture and violence against the Kukis. It wasn\u2019t until the video of Kuki women being stripped naked, assaulted and allegedly gang-raped went viral that the police arrested four Meitei men \u2013 more than 70 days after the attack took place. The supreme court also chastised the government for not getting the situation in Manipur under control. Chief justice Dhananjaya Chandrachud said: \u201cIt\u2019s time that the government really steps in and takes action because this is simply unacceptable\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-13T18:05:41Z",
            "content": "The Alabama Republican senator Tommy Tuberville is jeopardising US national security by blocking military leadership confirmations in protest of Pentagon policy on abortion, Joe Biden and the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Thursday. Speaking to reporters in Finland, where he attended meetings after the Nato summit in Lithuania, Biden said he would talk to Tuberville if he thought there was any prospect he would change his \u201cridiculous\u201d position. \u201cHe\u2019s jeopardising US security by what he\u2019s doing,\u201d the president said. \u201cI expect the Republican party to stand up \u2013 stand up \u2013 and do something about it. It\u2019s in their power to do that \u2026 they\u2019ve got to stand up and be counted. That\u2019s how it ends.\u201d The conservative-dominated US supreme court removed the federal right to abortion last year. Tuberville, a former football coach now a supporter of Donald Trump on the far right of the Republican party, mounted his obstruction effort earlier this year. He is seeking the end of Department of Defense policy that provides paid time off and covers travel costs for servicewomen and dependents in need of abortion services. The effect of Tuberville\u2019s block became strikingly evident this week, when the US Marine Corps found itself without a permanent commander for the first time in 164 years, since before the civil war. The Pentagon has said more than 650 leadership positions could be vacant by the end of the year. Biden\u2019s secretary of defense, the retired army general Lloyd Austin, told CNN: \u201cThis is a national security issue. It\u2019s a readiness issue. And we shouldn\u2019t kid ourselves, I think any member of the Senate armed services committee knows that.\u201d Austin added: \u201cI don\u2019t have an abortion policy, I have an access to non-covered reproductive healthcare policy \u2026 and I think that\u2019s an important policy. \u201cOne in five of my troops \u2026 is a woman and our women provide tremendous value to this force, and I think we need to do everything we can to take care of them.\u201d Earlier this week, Gen Charles Brown Jr, Joe Biden\u2019s nominee for chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told a congressional committee: \u201cWe will lose talent because of these challenges.\u201d Brown\u2019s own confirmation could be held up. The current chair of the joint chiefs, Gen Mark Milley, is due to step down in October. In Finland, Biden said: \u201cThe idea that we don\u2019t have a chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the idea that we have all these promotions that are in abeyance right now \u2026 the idea that we\u2019re injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what is in fact a debate on social policy issues, is bizarre \u2026 it\u2019s totally irresponsible, in my view.\u201d Tuberville is also under fire for having shown reluctance to denounce white nationalism, a position which this week prompted the author Steven King to say the senator \u201cgives new meaning to the word idiot\u201d. Like Austin, Gen Brown is African American. Austin told CNN Brown was \u201cselected by the president not solely because he is African American. He is a really, really good officer and a great fighter pilot \u2026 I think he\u2019s the right guy at the right time for this job.\u201d Tuberville has told Politico his objection to the Pentagon policy is \u201cnot just about abortion\u201d but \u201cabout dictating from the White House. Being a dictator, we don\u2019t need dictators. You can\u2019t dictate a law, it\u2019s supposed to go through us.\u201d According to Politico, Biden sees Tuberville as a profitable campaign-trail target, calling Tuberville \u201cthe former football coach from Alabama, who was a better coach than he\u2019s a senator\u201d. Tuberville told Politico Biden \u201cwas a better senator than a president\u201d. John Wahl, chair of the Alabama Republican party, told the same site Tuberville\u2019s Pentagon protest \u201cdoes not hurt him at all\u201d politically and is \u201cgood representation for the people of Alabama and it\u2019s the right policy for any senator\u201d. The Democratic Virginia congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA case officer, told MSNBC, Tuberville\u2019s protest was \u201cirresponsible\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous and it needs to stop,\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cIt is dangerous to our nation, and to our readiness.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-24T10:10:07Z",
            "content": "The US Senate is now debating an $886bn defense authorization bill. Unless there are major changes to the bill, I intend to vote against it. Here\u2019s why. As everyone knows, our country faces enormous crises. As a result of climate change our planet is experiencing unprecedented and rising temperatures. Along with the rest of the world, we need to make major investments to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into more efficient and sustainable energy sources, or the life we leave our kids and future generations will become increasingly unhealthy and precarious. Our healthcare system is broken. While the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry make hundreds of billions in profit, 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, our life expectancy is declining, and we have a massive shortage of doctors, nurses, mental health practitioners and dentists. Our educational system is teetering. While we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty of almost any major country, millions of parents cannot find affordable and quality childcare. The number of our young people who graduate from college is falling behind many other countries and 45 million Americans are struggling under the weight of student debt. Our housing stock is totally inadequate. While gentrification is causing rents to soar in many parts of our country some 600,000 Americans are homeless, and 18 million are spending more than half of their limited incomes on housing. These are some of the crises our country faces. And we\u2019re not dealing with them. And then there is defense spending. Well, that\u2019s a whole other story. The proposed military budget that the Senate is now debating would increase defense spending by $28bn to over $886bn, an all-time record. The total is over $900bn if you include nuclear weapons spending through the Department of Energy. I will oppose this bloated defense budget and efforts to further increase military spending through a defense supplemental for three main reasons. First, more military spending is unnecessary. The $886bn in defense spending agreed in the debt ceiling deal matches the Pentagon\u2019s budget request and is more than sufficient to protect the United States and our allies. The United States spends more than three times what China spends on its military. This record high defense spending would come in spite of the end of the war in Afghanistan and despite the fact that the United States spends more on the military than the next 10 countries combined, most of whom are allies. Second, the Pentagon cannot keep track of the dollars it already has, leading to massive waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling military-industrial complex. The Pentagon accounts for about two-thirds of all federal contracting activity, obligating more money every year than all civilian federal agencies combined. Yet the Department of Defense (DOD) remains the only major federal agency that cannot pass an independent audit. Last year, the department was unable to account for over half of its assets, which are in excess of $3.1tn. The Government Accountability Office (Gao) reports that DOD still cannot accurately track its finances or post transactions to the correct accounts. Each year, auditors find billions of dollars in the Pentagon\u2019s proverbial couch cushions; in fiscal year 2022, navy auditors found $4.4bn in untracked inventory, while the air force identified $5.2bn worth of variances in its general ledger. A serious effort to address this waste should be undertaken before Congress throws more money at the Pentagon. Third, much of this additional military spending will go to line the pockets of hugely profitable defense contractors \u2013 it is corporate welfare by a different name. Almost half of the Pentagon budget goes to private contractors, some of whom are exploiting their monopoly positions and the trust granted them by the United States to line their pockets. Repeated investigations by the DOD inspector general, the GAO and CBS News have uncovered numerous instances of contractors massively overcharging DOD, helping boost these companies\u2019 profits to nearly 40% \u2013 and sometimes as high as 4,451% \u2013 while costing US taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. TransDigm, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon are among the offenders, dramatically overcharging the taxpayer while reaping enormous profits, seeing their stock prices soar and handing out massive executive compensation packages. Last year, Lockheed Martin received $46bn in unclassified federal contracts, returned $11bn to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, and paid its CEO $25m a year. TransDigm, the company behind the 4,451% markup, touted $3.1bn in profits on $5.4bn of net sales, almost boasting to investors about just how fully it was fleecing the taxpayer. The fact that a share of the profits from these lucrative contracts will flow back to the congressional backers of higher defense budgets in the form of campaign contributions \u2013 America\u2019s unique system of legalized bribery \u2013 makes the whole situation even more unconscionable. Let\u2019s be clear. Defending the American people is not only about pouring money into the Pentagon. It\u2019s about making sure our children go to good schools and will have a habitable planet when they get older. It\u2019s about making sure that every American has a decent standard of living and can enjoy quality healthcare and affordable housing. As a nation, the time is long overdue for fundamental changes to our national priorities. Cutting military spending is a good first step. Bernie Sanders is a US senator, and chairman of the health education labor and pensions committee. He represents the state of Vermont, and is the longest-serving independent in the history of Congress"

            "date": "2023-07-14T18:45:32Z",
            "content": "The Republican-led House of Representatives on Friday approved a huge defense bill that includes amendments overturning the Pentagon\u2019s policies on covering abortion services for the military, healthcare costs for transgender service members and diversity initiatives \u2013 setting up a historic clash with Democrats and the Biden administration that could imperil spending on the armed forces. The amendments, pushed by the GOP\u2019s right flank with the support of the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, represent the latest instance of conservative lawmakers using their influence in Congress\u2019s lower chamber to attempt to change Joe Biden\u2019s policies on a range of issues that chiefly animate the Republican base. They also seems certain to spark a major battle with Democrats who hold control of the Senate, and whose assent will be needed for the defense spending bill, a version of which Congress approves every year, to become law. \u201cHouse Republicans have made a commitment to America that we fight for a nation that is safe,\u201d McCarthy said shortly after the amended National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) covering the 2024 fiscal year passed on a mostly party-line vote. \u201cRadical programs that are forced [on] our troops at the expense of readiness are now eliminated. Cutting-edge technology that is essential for the future of this country and to keep freedom around the world in the rise of China and Russia, will receive more investment than we\u2019ve watched in the past,\u201d McCarthy said, adding that the legislation costing $886.3bn would also give service members their largest pay increase in two decades. The NDAA is one of the bills Congress must pass every year, and often attracts bipartisan support, with politicians of both parties eager to show they support the United States military. But while it is not unusual for the defense spending measure to include provisions addressing other issues on Congress\u2019s mind, rightwing Republicans this year proposed several amendments dealing with some of the most divisive issues in American society. On Thursday evening, Republicans pushed through an amendment to the bill that reverses a defense department policy covering expenses and leave for troops who must travel out of state to seek an abortion. The policy was implemented after the supreme court last year struck down Roe v Wade and allowed states to ban the procedure. The party also supported amendments banning the Pentagon\u2019s healthcare plans from covering gender-affirming care for transgender individuals, as well as a provisions targeting diversity, equity and inclusions programs and banning any teaching in the defense department\u2019s school system that America is \u201ca fundamentally racist country\u201d. Amendments halting military assistance to Ukraine and ending a policy of renaming military bases bearing monikers inspired by the Confederacy were voted down. While they did not formally tell their members to vote against the NDAA, the House\u2019s top Democrats, Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader, whip Katherine Clark and caucus chair Pete Aguilar released a joint statement accusing Republicans of corrupting legislation that should be used to support American troops. \u201cExtreme Maga Republicans have chosen to hijack the historically bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act to continue attacking reproductive freedom and jamming their rightwing ideology down the throats of the American people. House Republicans have turned what should be a meaningful investment in our men and women in uniform into an extreme and reckless legislative joyride,\u201d the trio wrote, adding that they would vote against the bill. In the end, only four Democrats supported the NDAA, all of whom represent swing districts. The four Republicans who voted against it were conservatives of varying stripes, with Colorado\u2019s Ken Buck releasing a statement saying the legislation is too expensive. \u201cOur country is careening toward fiscal ruin, and Congress continues to turn a blind eye by passing these massive spending packages with no attention to their cost or efficacy,\u201d Buck wrote, noting that he agrees \u201cwith several amendments to this bill\u201d."

            "title": "Naomi Girma: the brilliant scientist at the heart of USA\u2019s defense",
            "date": "2023-07-14T07:00:04Z",
            "content": "Each Saturday morning as a young child growing up in San Jose, California, Naomi Girma would show up to the park to play a version of soccer that was \u201cas informal as you can think\u201d, she says now. The children were divided by the adults into three groups: little, medium, and big. From there, the kids would scrimmage, their voices cutting through the crisp, California air uninterrupted by any formal coaching. Girma never made it to the big-kids group \u2013 which still upsets her, she jokes \u2013 but for good reason. By the time she reached third grade, Girma\u2019s talent had become clear. She entered the formal, competitive US youth soccer landscape, ascending from the complicated system that she and her parents learned on the fly to her position today as a budding star for the United States women\u2019s national team. \u201cI kind of just walked into [soccer], and I\u2019m very grateful I did,\u201d Girma tells the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s always just been around.\u201d Girma will most likely play an integral role at center-back for the USA this summer in the team\u2019s bid to win an unprecedented third consecutive World Cup. She only turned 23 last month but has already positioned herself to be one of the next great center-backs for the United States by combining her exceptional one-on-one defending with a calmness on the ball to spark attacks. Who Girma is today \u2013 as a player and a person \u2013 was shaped by her formative years growing up in the Bay Area. Her father, a refugee from Ethiopia who arrived in San Francisco in the early 1980s, established those Saturday morning gatherings in the park as the basis of the Maleda Soccer Club, \u201cmaleda\u201d meaning \u201cdawn\u201d in one of Ethiopia\u2019s languages. The purpose was then and is to this day to gather Ethiopian families \u2013 tens of thousands of Ethiopians are estimated to live in the Bay Area today \u2013 and strengthen community bonds. Those Saturday mornings also served as the dawn of Girma\u2019s soccer career. \u201cI think it just really made me value community and family,\u201d Girma says. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s really big in Ethiopian culture and not always as big in the American culture, so that was definitely something that my parents wanted to make sure was ingrained in us from a young age.\u201d Saturdays in the park for Girma soon became weekly jaunts around California. Her mom, who also came to the United States from Ethiopia, would drive the two around in their navy blue 2000 Toyota Camry. Together, they figured out the USA\u2019s complicated pay-to-play youth soccer system in the country\u2019s largest hotbed of talent. For Girma\u2019s mother, who didn\u2019t share a soccer background with her husband, some of the lessons were a little more basic. Explaining the offside rule to her mom was a particular process, Girma recalls. Those years paved the way for Girma\u2019s path to Stanford University, the prestigious school where she earned nearly perfect grades in symbolic systems \u2013 a combination of \u201cmind and machine\u201d in a world of technology and artificial intelligence \u2013 before pursuing her master\u2019s degree in management science and engineering. She captained Stanford\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team to an NCAA national championship in her hometown in 2019. Then came the professional and international opportunities. Even as the stakes on the field rose, Girma \u2013 \u201cNay,\u201d as most know her \u2013 remained grounded. Her joy is unabating, summed up by a beaming smile she carries with her on and off the field. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met anybody that\u2019s as good as her and doesn\u2019t realize they\u2019re as good as what she is,\u201d says Casey Stoney, Girma\u2019s head coach at the National Women\u2019s Soccer League\u2019s San Diego Wave FC. \u201cShe\u2019s so humble. Humility is a big thing for her but I\u2019m trying to get her to realize how good she is at the same time, so she plays with that confidence every single week.\u201d Stoney was adamant with her team\u2019s management that the Wave use the top pick in the 2022 draft on Girma. Most players are either good defenders or can distribute the ball. Girma does both, Stoney said recently. Stoney would know, having played for England as a defender at three World Cups. \u201cI wasn\u2019t half as good as what [Girma] is and can be,\u201d Stoney said recently. Stoney was speaking about Girma in response to the club announcing a long-term contract extension for the defender that will keep her in San Diego through 2026. It doesn\u2019t take long to recognize Girma\u2019s unique skills in the position. Less than five minutes into the match against Jamaica at World Cup qualifying last year, Girma hit a diagonal ball to Sophia Smith, who brilliantly beat her defender to open the scoring for the United States. Girma attributes her ability on the ball to spending most of her youth career as a central midfielder. She was converted to a center-back with the USA\u2019s youth national teams in her early teens. \u201cHitting any and every type of ball: whipping it, hitting it over,\u201d Girma says of her strengths before stopping herself to say that she must still improve this skill, among another 10 or so on her list. \u201cI think having that from a center-back is so dangerous because you never know what to expect when the team is building out and that sets up the midfielders and forwards to be even more dangerous and have more time.\u201d Last season, Girma was named the NWSL Rookie of the Year and Defender of the Year while finishing as a finalist for MVP. She was integral to the success of a San Diego team that gave up the second-fewest goals in the league and sat atop the table for half the season. Girma did that in an even larger role than expected after 2019 World Cup champion center-back Abby Dahlkemper missed most of the year due to injuries. Girma admits that her comfort zone was stretched. \u201cI think it was me finding my voice and then kind of being put in a position where I had to find my voice and I had to be a leader in that role as the season progressed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt only pushed me more.\u201d A similar situation is now playing out at the international level. United States captain Becky Sauerbrunn, the center-back who anchored the team\u2019s 2015 and 2019 triumphs, will miss this World Cup due to a foot injury. The news was confirmed only in mid-June, adding to a long list of major injuries for the USA. Previously, Girma was competing for a starting role alongside Sauerbrunn. Dahlkemper\u2019s ongoing absence meant the USA had a particular need for a player capable of accurate, long-range distribution, a trademark of Dahlkemper at her best. Now, given Sauerbrunn\u2019s injury, Girma is almost certainly a starter who must once again assume a leadership role. Girma and Alana Cook, the other regular center-back in the regular rotation, have a combined 41 caps; Sauerbrunn has 216. USA head coach Vlatko Andonovski must now figure out a new plan. Girma and Cook make sense to pair together, although Julie Ertz could move back from a holding midfield role to center-back, where she played at the 2015 World Cup. Andonovski was also a defender as a player and knows that his young center-backs are still in the nascent stages of their careers. Mistakes are to be expected, he says. Girma is \u201cone of those special players\u201d who makes fewer errors than most \u2013 but she will still make them. \u201cIn order to become a good defender, unfortunately, you go through a few mistakes and sometimes it costs you a lot and sometimes it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Andonovski says. \u201cWith Naomi, we see potential, and we understand that she will make mistakes in the stage that she\u2019s at and we\u2019re OK with that and we will support her regardless, because we know she\u2019s going to be one of the most important players on this team.\u201d It is possible that three of the four USA starters in defense will be playing in their first major international tournament. How they perform under their greatest stress test to date will go a long way in determining the team\u2019s success. Girma plays with a noticeable calmness on the field, a reflection of her internal state. \u201cI try to keep a level head during the game,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that helps me perform better. I think it\u2019s calm in my head, too.\u201d Keeping perspective is important to Girma, her past serving as motivation for her present. There are her parents and her older brother, who she still often sees thanks to San Diego\u2019s proximity to home. There is the best friend she lost in early 2022, former Stanford teammate and goalkeeper Katie Meyer, who was found dead in her dorm room in what was ruled a suicide. \u201cMy parents came over here from Ethiopia and sacrificed a lot for me to be in this position,\u201d Girma said. \u201cAll of the work that they\u2019ve put in and their support and their love is a big driver for me. \u201cAnd my best friend passed away last year, Katie. Playing for her, honoring her: she was one of the most competitive people, loved soccer. I think just continuing her legacy is a big thing for me.\u201d Next in that process is Girma\u2019s first senior World Cup. Millions of eyeballs on a game in Auckland, New Zealand \u2013 or Sydney, Australia, should the United States make it to the final \u2013 is about as far away from a quiet park in San Jose, California, as Girma could get. Still, the game is fun. She is still Nay. And she still holds with her the joy of those Saturday-morning kickarounds \u2013 this time, finally, with the big kids."

But while tinned sweetcorn is a store-cupboard staple, and delicious in these scones and salad, fresh corn on the cob is reaching its peak right now, so it\u2019s worth getting your hands on some, if you can. Chargrilling fresh corn in a pan or, better still, on a barbecue is the ideal cooking method. Don\u2019t be afraid to char it really well; the smoky flavour is heavenly when combined with the kernels\u2019 natural sweetness. Charred sweetcorn and green bean salad (pictured top) Prep 10 min Cook 20 min Serves 2 2 corn on the cob, or 200g frozen and defrosted sweetcorn, or tinned and drained 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 100g green beans (fresh or frozen), halved 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed 1 lime, zested and juiced 1 large pinch chipotle chilli flakes 1 tsp brown sugar Sea salt and black pepper \u00bd red onion, peeled, halved and very thinly sliced A handful of fresh coriander, leaves only Stand each cob, if using, on its end and use a sharp knife to cut the kernels away from the cobs. Put half the olive oil into a large pan and set it over a high heat. Once smoking hot, add the corn and green beans, and fry for eight to 10 minutes, until charred and blistered in places. Meanwhile, put the remaining olive oil in a large bowl and combine with the garlic, lime zest and juice, chilli flakes and sugar. Once the corn and green beans are cooked, put them straight into the dressing bowl and toss to combine. Season generously to taste, then leave to cool to room temperature. To serve, toss through the onion and most of the coriander, then taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Transfer to a plate with the remaining coriander scattered over the top, as well as a few more chilli flakes, if you like. Sweetcorn and cheese scones Prep 10 min Cook 30 min Makes 8 scones 100g sweetcorn (cut from the cob, or frozen and defrosted or tinned, drained) Salt and pepper 300g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting 1 tsp baking powder \u00bd tsp sweet smoked paprika \u00bd tsp ground coriander 70g salted butter, chilled and cut into cubes 125g cheddar, grated 130ml whole milk, plus extra for glazing Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Cook the fresh corn, if using, in a pan of boiling salted water for five minutes, then drain and leave to cool. Put the flour, baking powder, smoked paprika, ground coriander, half a teaspoon of salt and a large pinch of pepper in a bowl, then mix to combine. Use the tips of your fingers to rub in the butter, lifting up the flour to add as much air as possible, until the mix resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the grated cheddar and corn. Pour in all but a tablespoon of the milk and, using a metal spoon, very lightly fold it into the flour mixture. Add the last tablespoon of milk, if need be; if it still seems dry, add another teaspoon or two. Turn out the dough on to a floured surface and, using your hands, very gently pat it until it comes together into a ball. Do not be tempted to knead or overwork the dough, otherwise it will result in tough scones. Pat or roll out the dough into a roughly 3cm-thick circle, then cut into eight equal pieces, leaving you with triangular-shaped scones. Alternatively, use a scone cutter. Put the scones on the lined tray, brush the tops with a little milk, then bake for 11-13 minutes, until risen and golden. Serve warm with butter. Jordan Bourke is a chef and broadcaster.

There are endless varieties, from the ubiquitous fire-red, spicy hit of baechu cabbage kimchi to the altogether more subtly flavoured but no less addictive dongchimi radish water kimchi. Here in the UK, kimchi is now widely available, and while it is wonderful eaten raw, these mini kimchi pancakes and kimchi fried rice are a great way to cook with it. Kimchi fried rice (pictured top) Prep 5 min Cook 15 min Serves 2 2 tbsp vegetable oil 130g kimchi, roughly chopped, plus 2 tbsp kimchi juice strained from the jar or bag 2 tsp soy sauce 300g cooked white rice 2 tsp roasted sesame seed oil 2 eggs (optional) 1 spring onion, trimmed and finely chopped Put the vegetable oil in a large pan or wok on a high heat. When hot, add the kimchi and stir-fry for three to five minutes, keeping it moving the whole time, until it starts to caramelise. Add the kimchi juice, soy sauce and cooked rice to the pan, and stir until well combined. Lower the heat to medium-low and fry for another three minutes, until the rice has absorbed all the flavours, then stir in the sesame oil, taste and adjust the seasoning, and take off the heat. Meanwhile, in a frying pan, fry the eggs, if using, to your liking. Serve the rice with a fried egg on top and spring onions scattered over.

Put the soy sauce and vinegar in a small bowl and set aside. Cover the base of a large, nonstick frying pan with a thin layer of vegetable oil and set it over a medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add two tablespoons of batter per pancake, taking care not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for two to three minutes on one side, or until golden and crisp, then flip and drizzle in another one or two teaspoons of oil around the edges of the pancake. Fry for another one to two minutes, until golden and crisp on the other side, then slide on to a plate or board. Keep warm in a low oven while you repeat with the remaining batter. To serve, scatter the chives over the pancakes and eat immediately with the dipping sauce on the side. Jordan Bourke is a chef, broadcaster and co-author of Our Korean Kitchen (Orion, \u00a325)."

            "content": "The world\u2019s chemical weapons watchdog said on Friday that all declared stocks had been \u201cirreversibly destroyed\u201d after the United States revealed it had finally got rid of its last toxic arms. President Joe Biden announced that the Blue Grass Army Depot, a US Army facility in Kentucky, had eliminated its decades-old stocks, completing a global effort started in 1997 to rid the world of chemical weapons. The munitions destroyed in Kentucky are the last of 51,000 M55 rockets with GB nerve agent, AKA sarin, that have been stored at the depot since the 1940s. The move completes a decades-long campaign to clear a stockpile that by the end of the cold war totaled more than 30,000 tons. \u201cThe end of destruction of all declared chemical weapons stockpiles is an important milestone\u201d, Fernando Arias, the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), said in a statement. The US faced a 30 September deadline to eliminate its remaining chemical weapons under the international Chemical Weapons Convention, which took effect in 1997 and was joined by 193 countries. \u201cOne thing that we\u2019re really proud of is how we\u2019re finishing the mission. We\u2019re finishing it for good for the United States of America,\u201d said Kim Jackson, manager of the Pueblo Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant. The Hague-based body said that the step by the US, the \u201clast possessor state\u201d, meant that \u201call declared chemical weapons stockpiles [were] verified as irreversibly destroyed\u201d. But recent use of chemical weapons meant the world still had to be on guard, the Nobel peace prize-winning OPCW warned. The watchdog has in recent years blamed Syria for carrying out chemical attacks during its civil war, and investigated the use of Soviet-era nerve agents against a former Russian spy in Britain and Kremlin opponent Alexei Navalny in Russia. \u201cRecent uses and threats of use of toxic chemicals as weapons illustrate that preventing re-emergence will remain a priority for the organisation,\u201d Arias cautioned. Chemical weapons were first used in modern warfare in the first world war, where they were estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people. Despite their use being subsequently banned under the Geneva Conventions, countries continued to stockpile the weapons until the treaty calling for their destruction. Officials say the elimination of the US stockpile is a major step forward for the Chemical Weapons Convention. Only three countries \u2013 Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan \u2013 have not signed the treaty. A fourth, Israel, has signed but not ratified the treaty. Still, arms control advocates hope this final step by the US could nudge the remaining countries to join. But they also hope it could be used as a model for eliminating other types of weapons. \u201cIt shows that countries can really ban a weapon of mass destruction,\u201d said Paul F Walker, vice-chairman of the Arms Control Association and coordinator of the Chemical Weapons Convention Coalition. \u201cIf they want to do it, it just takes the political will and it takes a good verification system.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 July 2023 because an earlier version said that \u201cchemical weapons were first used in modern warfare in the second world war\u201d. That should have said the first world war."

            "date": "2023-07-20T00:00:14Z",
            "content": "Australian requests for US military equipment would be handled faster than almost all applications \u201cother than from Taiwan and Ukraine\u201d under a proposal before the US Senate. The Australian government has long viewed the complex web of US export controls as a potential barrier to the Aukus security partnership. But US senators are pushing to ease export control bottlenecks, as well as demanding regular reports on how measures under the Aukus deal are \u201cstrengthening the United States strategic position in Asia\u201d. The Aukus deal extends beyond the high-profile project for Australia to acquire eight nuclear-powered submarines. The US and the UK also want to collaborate on advanced capabilities such as hypersonic weapons, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence and undersea technologies. Australia has generally preferred to push for export-control reforms out of the public eye, although a Defence official made unusually frank comments in May about \u201ca permafrost layer of middle management\u201d. Under a proposal that has garnered bipartisan support in the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Australia and the UK would gain priority access to transfer defence equipment and services related to Aukus. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The legislation \u2013 proposed by the committee chair, Bob Menendez \u2013 says the US president should ensure such requests \u201creceive expedited consideration and processing relative to all other letters of request other than from Taiwan and Ukraine\u201d. The proposal is to be added to the annual Department of State Authorization Act. Elsewhere, the proposed legislation argues the US should be proactive and not necessarily wait for letters of request. The administration, it says, should draw up \u201ca list of advanced military platforms, technologies, and equipment that are pre-cleared and prioritized for sale and release to Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada\u201d. The legislation also sets up a process to exempt Aukus countries from licensing and approval requirements, so long as the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, makes an assessment that those countries have export controls comparable to US standards. Under Menendez\u2019s proposal, the US administration would have to submit a report to congressional committees every two years setting out progress on Aukus. It says the report should identify \u201cthe defensive military capability gaps and capacity shortfalls that the Aukus partnership seeks to offset\u201d and the total costs to the US of the submarine project. Congressional committees would also be seeking \u201ca detailed explanation of how enhanced access to the industrial base of Australia is contributing to strengthening the United States strategic position in Asia\u201d. The report would provide a \u201cdetailed explanation of the military and strategic benefit provided by the improved access provided by naval bases of Australia\u201d. It would include \u201ca detailed assessment of how Australia\u2019s sovereign conventionally armed nuclear attack submarines contribute to United States defense and deterrence objectives in the Indo-Pacific region\u201d. Kurt Campbell, the White House Indo-Pacific coordinator, told a thinktank last month: \u201cWhen submarines are provided from the United States to Australia, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re lost. They will just be deployed by the closest possible allied force.\u201d However, the Australian government has repeatedly said it will maintain sovereign control of the submarines, including at least three Virginia-class submarines that it will buy from the US in the 2030s. While Aukus has bipartisan support in the US, it remains unclear what version of the legislation will make it to the president\u2019s desk for signing. Menendez said his amendment \u201cstreamlines the export of US military technology, while ensuring that technology is safeguarded from adversarial espionage\u201d. \u201cI look forward to working with my colleagues in both the Senate and House to pass this bill which will cement the Aukus partnership for decades to come,\u201d he said in a statement last week. Aukus will be on the agenda when Blinken and the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, travel to Australia for annual talks with foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and defence minister, Richard Marles. The meeting will be held in Brisbane late next week. Marles and Austin are due to travel to north Queensland afterwards to watch troops participating in the Talisman Sabre exercise. Marles told ABC TV on Wednesday there had been \u201ca significant move forward in terms of force posture initiatives in Australia\u201d, including the planned rotation of US submarines in Western Australia from 2027."

            "date": "2023-07-16T15:00:03Z",
            "content": "Australia is making itself a bigger military target for China and risks being drawn into a war that \u201ccould end in nuclear catastrophe\u201d, a leading defence analyst has argued. Sam Roggeveen, the director of the Lowy Institute\u2019s international security program and a former Australian intelligence analyst, issues the stark warning in an essay published on Monday. \u201cAustralia has taken the decision to bring US combat forces, and its military strategy to fight China, on to our shores,\u201d Roggeveen wrote in the latest edition of the Australian Foreign Affairs journal. \u201cWe have also chosen to build military capabilities of our own that are designed expressly to contribute to American operations to defeat China. These fateful decisions threaten to draw Australia into a war that is not central to our security interests, and which could end in nuclear catastrophe.\u201d Roggeveen examined the combined effect of decisions, including plans to host up to six US B-52 bombers in the Northern Territory and to rotate US nuclear-powered submarines through HMAS Stirling in Western Australia from 2027. He said US bombers operating from Australia could be assigned to strike China\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, including missile silos, command and control facilities, early warning radars and air defence facilities. Roggeveen said it was \u201chard to overstate the sensitivity involved in threatening another nation\u2019s nuclear forces\u201d and that meant American bombers flying out of the Tindal RAAF base \u201cwould be an important target for Chinese forces\u201d. He said the requirement for Australia\u2019s planned nuclear-powered submarines, acquired under the Aukus deal, to carry Tomahawk cruise missiles \u201ccan only be interpreted one way: Australia wants the capability to strike targets on Chinese soil\u201d. In the event of war, Roggeveen said, the Australian submarines would probably be assigned to sink Chinese naval ships and submarines, blockade ports or strike targets in China with cruise missiles. If Australia eventually acquired hypersonic weapons under the advanced defence technology pillar of the Aukus deal, Roggeveen said, that could further increase the country\u2019s profile in the eyes of Chinese military planners. He said Australia had previously taken risks \u201cbecause we have concluded that, on balance, we are likely to be safer within the alliance, with all the obligations it imposes, than outside it\u201d. \u201cBut if China\u2019s capabilities to strike Australia are set to increase, and if we are raising China\u2019s incentives to do so, then the judgments we have previously made about whether the risks of the alliance outweigh the security benefits need to be re-evaluated.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Roggeveen said whether the trade-offs were worth it depended on the value Australia placed on American military dominance in Asia, including its ability to defeat China in a war over the future of self-governed Taiwan. He said contrary to its rhetoric, the US had not increased the weight of military power it dedicated to Asia, even as it dispersed its forces to be outside China\u2019s missile ranges, raising questions about its long-term commitment. \u201cIn short, six bombers based in Tindal are a less potent military asset than the same number based in Guam, which means America\u2019s deterrent against China is diminishing while the military threat to Australia increases.\u201d Roggeveen is not the first to raise such concerns, although his intervention is notable because of his past experience as a senior strategic analyst at the Office of National Assessments. In the same edition of Australian Foreign Affairs, however, the former senior US official Michael Green argued his country remained \u201cthe indispensable power despite itself\u201d. Green, head of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, wrote that in a world without US leadership, Vladimir Putin \u201cwould today be ruling Ukraine through proxies in Kyiv\u201d and Taiwan \u201cmight have succumbed to Chinese coercion\u201d. \u201cThere is no indication that Labor or the Coalition are going to choose neutrality or distancing from America \u2013 not with Chinese coercive pressure a new reality and other close partners such as Japan and South Korea choosing to reinforce the American alliance system rather than defect,\u201d Green wrote. The Australian government has repeatedly argued its Aukus plans are intended to contribute to regional peace and stability, and it has also said US bombers have visited Australia since the 1980s."

            "title": "Niger coup leaders accuse France of plotting military intervention",
            "date": "2023-07-31T16:28:05Z",
            "content": "The military junta that seized power in Niger has accused France of plotting military intervention to reinstate the deposed president, Mohamed Bazoum, as tensions in the region continued to grow in the wake of the coup. The junta said on national TV that France was searching \u201cfor ways and means to intervene militarily in Niger\u201d and had held a meeting with the chief of staff of Niger\u2019s national guard \u201cto obtain the necessary political and military authorisation\u201d. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, denied any alleged intention of military intervention in the west African country. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told BFMTV news channel on Monday night, adding that it was still possible to return Niger\u2019s democratically elected president to power. \u201cAnd it\u2019s necessary because destabilisation is perilous for Niger and its neighbours,\u201d she said. Bazoum, an ally of western powers, was toppled on 26 July in a coup by Niger\u2019s elite presidential guard. Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani declared himself leader but his claim has been shunned internationally. On Monday, Bazoum\u2019s party said several ministers in his ousted government had been arrested, including the mines minister. Niger is the world\u2019s seventh-biggest producer of uranium, the radioactive metal widely used for nuclear energy and treating cancer. The Chadian president, Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by, who flew to Niger to try to mediate, on Monday posted what appeared to be the first images of Bazoum since the takeover, showing him smiling and apparently unharmed. D\u00e9by said he had met Bazoum and coup leader Tchiani to explore ways \u201cto find a peaceful solution\u201d, without going into further detail. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has given the junta a week to give back power, warning in a statement that if Bazoum was not reinstated it would take \u201call measures\u201d to restore constitutional order, which \u201cmay include the use of force\u201d. ECOWAS has suspended all commercial and financial transactions, while France, the EU and the US, which has about 1,000 troops in Niger, have either cut off support or threatened to do so. Germany suspended financial aid and development cooperation, and UN humanitarian operations have been put on hold. Russia called for the swift return of \u201cthe rule of law\u201d and \u201crestraint from all parties so that this doesn\u2019t result in human casualties\u201d. Niger, with a population of 26 million, frequently ranks at the bottom of the UN\u2019s human development index benchmark of prosperity. The country, which became independent from France in 1960, is a landlocked state, and strict economic sanctions against it could affect many supplies, including electricity. The coup, according to the putschists, was a response to \u201cthe degradation of the security situation\u201d linked to the jihadist conflict, as well as corruption and economic difficulties. As Niger struggles with two jihadist campaigns \u2013 one in the south-west, which swept in from Mali in 2015, and the other in the south-east, involving jihadists from north-eastern Nigeria \u2013 the coup has shone a spotlight on France\u2019s reduced and contested military presence in the Sahel region of Africa after 10 years fighting jihadist insurgencies. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, chose unusually strong language towards the junta in Niger, vowing there would be \u201cimmediate and uncompromising\u201d action if French citizens or interests were attacked, after thousands rallied outside the French embassy. News agencies reported anti-French and pro-Russian slogans were shouted at the rallies on Sunday, which were televised. Protesters, some carrying Russian flags, said France, the country\u2019s traditional ally, had failed to shield them against the jihadists, whereas Russia would be a stronger ally. The coup is a serious threat to French strategy in the Sahel, after several military coups in other countries had already forced France to rethink its decade-long military presence and anti-jihadist mission. France first deployed troops against jihadists in Mali in 2013 under the Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, but in the past three years several military coups in the region, as well as a continued jihadist presence, have exposed the limitations of the military strategy and forced France to scale back its presence and focus its efforts in Niger, with Bazoum as a firm ally. It has 1,500 troops in the country and an airbase near Niamey. In Mali a coup in 2020 led to a diplomatic standoff with France, which withdrew its troops last year. France also quit Burkina Faso after two coups last year brought in a junta that adopted a nationalist line. Niagal\u00e9 Bagayoko, a political scientist and defence expert, told France Inter radio that the G5 Sahel group of nations set up to combat jihadist insurgency now featured a majority of military juntas. She said France could not continue its military engagement in Niger under the current circumstances, adding that France had been rethinking its presence in the region for more than two years. She said foreign troops, including the US and other Europeans as well as the French, were seen as unpopular and people wanted their withdrawal. The writer and analyst Seidik Abba told France Inter that the broader problem for Paris was that the poor results of its military and security drive against jihadists had made France a scapegoat. He said the strategy in the Sahel had been a security and military one, when in fact \u201cit wasn\u2019t just a security and military issue, it was also a question of development, justice and governance\u201d."

            "date": "2023-07-04T13:33:45Z",
            "content": "Fears have been raised of a damaging oil shutdown in Libya with implications for global energy markets after Libya\u2019s strongman in the east, Gen Khalifa Haftar, warned of military action unless oil revenues are divided fairly within the next two months. With the country long divided between two governments in the east and west and little prospect of presidential elections designed to reunify the country at least until next year, politicians in the east have threatened to put oil revenues under judicial control preventing the revenue reaching the Central Bank from the National Oil Corporation (NOC), the state-run oil firm. Eastern politicians claim the Central Bank distributes the bulk of oil revenues to the rival UN-recognised government based in Tripoli, even though the oil is produced in fields largely based in the east of the country. The US special envoy to Libya, Richard Norland, eager to keep oil production flowing, had urged the east not to disrupt production. In a speech near Benghazi on Monday night, Haftar demanded a new \u201chigher financial committee\u201d be established to agree on the distribution of Libya\u2019s oil resources. He warned that if the body was not established by the end of August, \u201cthe armed forces will be ready for orders when the time comes\u201d, remarks that suggest he would shut down the oil fields. Libya produces 1.2m barrels a day, but has plans to increase production to 2m barrels by 2027. Much of the oil goes to European customers looking for a replacement for lost Russian crude. Haftar\u2019s speech included an attack on the leadership of the Central Bank of Libya for allowing rampant corruption. He also called on foreign ambassadors, naming Norland, to stay out of the affairs of Libya saying their interventions had been an abject failure, self-interested and only worsened divides in the country. Norland had earlier urged the east not to shut down oil production, saying: \u201cWe call on all Libyan leaders to put in place a comprehensive mechanism to control revenues as a constructive way to address grievances about the distribution of oil revenues and to establish transparency without jeopardising the integrity of Libya\u2019s economy or the non-political nature of the National Oil Corporation.\u201d There have been rumours that the NOC chairman, Farhat bin Qadara, appointed a year ago after his predecessor was forced out, was prepared to quit due to the political pressure, but he appears to be willing to stay on and try to mediate between Haftar and the Tripoli-based government led by a wealthy businessman prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh. Haftar claimed the central bank\u2019s data indicated that \u201cthe documentary credits for the year 2022 valued at $10bn were distributed to 1,646 private companies last year, of which the share of the eastern region was 7%, and the southern region received only 2% of the total of these credits\u201d. He said that official audit reports showed shocking tampering with the capabilities of the Libyan people with more than 200bn dinars distributed without any benefit to the Libyan people, adding that public funds are still wasted on a daily basis. He claimed government spending amounted to 122bn dinars, while oil revenues amounted to 135bn dinars. \u201cThere is a level of looting of public money that has not happened in the contemporary history of Libya, with the inability of oversight and the judiciary to do anything to stop the bleeding and theft of public money openly during the day, and in return the Libyans are starving and getting poorer day by day,\u201d he said. Libya is ranked 172 out of 179 in the Transparency International corruption perceptions index, and Haftar is an unlikely champion of an anti-corruption drive. Norland ignored the personal attacks mounted on him over his interventions, saying before Haftar\u2019s speech: \u201cThe important issue of how Libya\u2019s oil revenues are distributed has been one of the issues underlying conflict in Libya so I am pleased that my recent comments have generated such useful debate among Libyan leaders.\u201d"

            "content": "The House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, claimed during a TV appearance on Monday that he expects a House GOP investigation into the foreign business activities of Joe Biden\u2019s family to rise to the level of an impeachment inquiry. \u201cWhen Biden was running for office, he told the public he has never talked about business. He said his family has never received a dollar from China \u2013 which we prove is not true,\u201d McCarthy said during an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity on Monday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve only followed where the information has taken us. But, Hannity, this is rising to the level of impeachment inquiry, which provides Congress the strongest power to get the rest of the knowledge and information needed.\u201d McCarthy cited two IRS whistleblowers who alleged prosecutors dragged their feet on an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s tax law violations and referenced findings of House GOP investigations that millions of foreign funds passed to Biden family members and associates through shell companies. The White House spokesman for oversight and investigations, Ian Sams, tweeted in response to McCarthy\u2019s comments: \u201cInstead of focusing on the real issues Americans want us to address like continuing to lower inflation or create jobs, this is what the HouseGOP wants to prioritize. Their eagerness to go after POTUS regardless of the truth is seemingly bottomless.\u201d The claim of a looming impeachment inquiry comes after Senator Chuck Grassley and the House oversight committee chairman, James Comer, released an FBI form containing unverified allegations of corruption related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work for Burisma, a Ukraine-based energy company. On Monday, the New York Post reported that Hunter Biden\u2019s former best friend Devon Archer is expected to testify to Congress this week that Hunter would dial-in his father, who was serving as vice-president at the time, into meetings with business partners overseas. Archer is currently facing jail time for his role in a $60m bond fraud scheme after losing an appeal of his sentence last month. The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, denied President Biden was ever in business with his son during a Monday briefing. Last month, McCarthy also issued a threat of an impeachment inquiry into Merrick Garland, the attorney general, over Garland\u2019s contradiction of claims by IRS whistleblowers concerning the authority the prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden had to bring charges in other jurisdictions. The prosecutor, David Weiss, disputed claims he sought and was denied special counsel status to pursue a case into Hunter Biden. On Monday, Weiss was offered to provide testimony in a letter to the House judiciary committee chair, Jim Jordan, by the assistant attorney general Carlos Uriarte."

            "title": "Hun Sen issues threat to Cambodians who spoiled ballots",
            "date": "2023-07-23T13:32:50Z",
            "content": "Cambodia\u2019s authoritarian leader has warned voters who destroyed their ballots to turn themselves in or face legal consequences, as he claimed victory after running virtually uncontested in a one-sided election. Hun Sen, 70, who has governed for almost four decades, said in a Telegram post on Sunday night that unofficial results showed his party had won 120 seats and a royalist party had won five. There had been little doubt over the outcome of the vote, given that the only opposition party big enough to pose a threat, the Candlelight party, was barred from running after it was accused of not submitting the correct paperwork. A crackdown on opposition voices ahead of the vote, which also included legal challenges to prevent voter boycotts, left spoiled ballots as one of the only remaining outlets for people to protest against the regime. \u201cWe\u2019ve won in a landslide \u2026 but we can\u2019t calculate the number of seats yet,\u201d said Sok Eysan, spokesperson for the Cambodian People\u2019s party (CPP). Hun Sen, Asia\u2019s longest-running leader, said a turnout of 84% in Sunday\u2019s election demonstrated that attempts by the \u201cextremist\u201d opposition to undermine the vote had failed. He is now expected to hand over power to his eldest son and anointed successor, Hun Manet. Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division, said that Hun Sen was \u201cfinally and fully wiping out the remnants of Cambodian democracy in favour of hereditary dictatorship that looks like it\u2019s right out of the North Korean playbook\u201d. \u201cFrom day one, there was no chance this poll would ever be free or fair considering that the succession of Hun Sen to his son, Gen Hun Manet, is at stake, but the government is taking no chances,\u201d Robertson added. In comments shared on social media later on Sunday, Hun Sen said they were waiting to see how many ballots were spoiled. \u201cAny ballot that is destroyed [is a sign of] support for the CDL [the Candlelight party],\u201d he said. \u201cThose who show the ballots being destroyed can confess with the authorities [\u2026] because this movement of destroying the ballots shall face legal action,\u201d he said. Dr Nee Maes, a political commentator, said prior to the election that people may feel cultural or social pressure to vote, adding that some employers would check whether their staff had voted: \u201cAfter election day, they have to show their finger [with] the ink,\u201d he said. Hun Manet, who graduated from the US military academy at West Point, as well as New York University and the University of Bristol, has been endorsed by the ruling CPP as the \u201cfuture prime minister\u201d. On Friday, Hun Sen said his son could take over in three or four weeks. Analysts say there is little indication that, when in office, Hun Manet\u2019s approach to governance will differ greatly from his father, who has little tolerance for dissent and has built close ties with China. On the campaign trail and on social media, his speeches have been similar in style to those of Hun Sen. Chamroeun, a student in Phnom Penh, who spoke to the Guardian ahead of the vote, said he wanted reforms to bring equal access to justice, public services and better education. Asked whether he felt Manet would bring such change, he said: \u201cWhen we look at his qualifications and his characteristics, he is qualified to be prime minister, but if there is no competition and it\u2019s an arrangement \u2013 I have nothing to say.\u201d The EU, US and other western countries did not send observers to Sunday\u2019s election, saying it lacked the conditions to be considered free and fair. Instead, observers from Russia, China and Guinea-Bissau watched as Hun Sun voted at a polling station in his home district outside the capital, Phnom Penh, Associated Press reported. A coalition of 17 election watchdog and human rights groups \u2013 including the Asian Network for Free Elections and the International Federation for Human Rights \u2013 said in a joint statement that they had \u201cprofound concern\u201d over the polls. In the run-up to the election, opposition figures and activists were arrested, harassed, beaten in the streets and forced into exile, in what right groups say were politically motivated attacks. The government has denied that it is intimidating its opponents. Access to independent media has also been restricted, with one of the country\u2019s last remaining independent media outlets, Voice of Democracy, shut down earlier this year. Rong Chhun, vice-president of the Candlelight party, said last week that the space for freedom of expression and freedom of media in Cambodia was shrinking. Explaining why he continues in politics, despite the personal risks, he added: \u201cWe want the country to have a democratic society, rule of law and respect for human rights. So we have to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of real democracy.\u201d About 9.7 million Cambodians were registered to vote to elect members of the 125-seat National Assembly. Hun Sen posted on his Telegram channel late on Sunday that unofficial results compiled by authorities in each province showed his party, the Cambodian People\u2019s Party, won 120 seats and the royalist FUNCINPEC party won five."

In the year to May 2023 alone, Wagner reportedly received more than 86bn roubles from the state budget, or over a billion dollars.

Zelenskiy cited Ukrainian intelligence as the source of his information and called for greater international attention to the situation at the facility, the largest nuclear plant in Europe. Air defence systems were engaged early on Sunday in repelling a Russian air attack on Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Witnesses heard blasts resembling the sound of air defence systems hitting targets, but there was no immediate information about potential damage. A 51-year-old man has been killed and two others injured by shelling in Mala Tokmachka, a village near the frontline in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhia, local officials said. The head of the local military administration, Yuriy Malashko, described the site as a \u201cfrontline community under merciless enemy fire\u201d. US president Joe Biden will host Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson next week to talk about transatlantic security cooperation and the war in Ukraine, the White House said. The two leaders \u201cwill review our growing security cooperation and reaffirm their view that Sweden should join Nato as soon as possible\u201d. Austria, a neutral country, announced its intention to join the European Sky Shield initiative, launched in 2022 by Germany against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer said the decision did not call into question the neutrality of the country but cited \u201ca threat that has considerably worsened\u201d. \u201cWe must and will take precautions to protect our country against the risk of drone or missile attacks,\u201d he said. Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez pledged the EU\u2019s \u201cunequivocal\u201d support for Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv on the first day of Spain assuming presidency of the bloc. Sanchez said his visit \u201cdemonstrates a clear and unequivocal political commitment\u201d to Ukraine\u2019s bid to join the EU. Ukrainian president Zelenskiy has expressed frustration over the slow deliveries of weapons and lack of clarity over pilot training by \u201csome\u201d western nations. \u201cThere is no schedule of training missions. I believe that some partners are dragging their feet. Why are they doing it? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Zelenskiy said. Two children have been injured in the Russian shelling of a residential area in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to the regional governor. A nine-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy were injured and are receiving medical treatment."

            "title": "Republicans target abortion pill access as government shutdown threat looms",
            "date": "2023-07-25T18:00:44Z",
            "content": "A Republican-backed spending bill threatens to end national access to mail-order abortion pills and cut billions from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) that provides low-income families with food benefits. The legislation is part of a spate of appropriations bills that lawmakers will debate this month, and which Congress must reach a decision on by the end of September in order to pass a budget for the 2024 fiscal year and avoid a federal shutdown. It was already approved by a House appropriations subcommittee in May, while being condemned by Democrats and causing internal rifts among Republicans. Republicans have added several provisions to the bill that would have wide-ranging effects on reproductive rights, health policy and benefits. The food and agriculture spending bill is the latest front in the rightwing campaign against reproductive rights. In the year since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, Republicans have passed bills in more than a dozen states that ban or severely restrict abortion access. Ending access to mail-order pills that induce abortions would complicate and limit efforts from abortion rights groups and physicians to provide care for people in states with abortion bans. Specifically, the bill would reverse a 2021 Food and Drug Administration policy that allowed people to get the abortion-inducing drug mifepristone \u2013 which can be used up to 10 weeks after conception \u2013 through the mail rather than via in-person visits to providers. The FDA had temporarily lifted restrictions on the drug during the Covid-19 pandemic, before later making those changes permanent. But the drug, which is widely used for abortion and can also be used for managing miscarriages, has been the center of legal challenges and rightwing attempts to prevent its use ever since. House Republicans\u2019 messaging on the bill claims that their provision \u201creins in wasteful Washington spending\u201d and \u201cprotects the lives of unborn children\u201d. The bill would also decrease the Snap benefit program \u2013 formerly known as food stamps \u2013 by $32bn compared with 2023 levels, as well as prevent the health and human services department from putting limits on the maximum amount of nicotine in cigarettes. The approaching fight over spending bills has echoes of the standoff over debt ceiling negotiations earlier this year, when Democrats accused Republicans of holding the government hostage in an attempt to exact sweeping cuts to federal programs. Hardline Republicans similarly pushed to shift their party towards far-right policies during those negotiations as well. Democrats are eager to prevent a government shutdown such as the one in 2018 during the Trump administration that left about 800,000 government workers without pay and lasted longer than any previous closure in US history. But some have called for establishing red lines around what compromises they are willing to make, with a number of House Democrats such as the Massachusetts representative Jim McGovern pushing back against attempts to cut Snap funding and other conservative provisions in recent legislation. House Democrats previously tried to add two amendments to the food and agriculture spending bill that would have eliminated the anti-abortion provision, but both failed. Several Republicans have also spoken out against the food and agriculture bill, including the New York representative Marc Molinaro, who told Politico he will vote against the legislation if it comes to the floor. Molinaro, along with another New York Republican lawmaker, previously denounced a conservative Texas judge\u2019s ruling that threatened to remove FDA approval of mifepristone. Molinaro\u2019s opposition to the bill highlights a rift within the Republican party over just how far to push an anti-abortion agenda that has proven nationally unpopular and contributed to electoral losses in many states. Abortion policy has divided the GOP as hard-right Republicans, as well as powerful Christian conservative activist groups, have demanded far-reaching bans on abortion access. Others, such as the South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace, have warned that Republicans need to \u201cread the room\u201d on abortion or face defeat in elections. The Republican speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, has meanwhile been left scrambling to manage the different factions of his party as votes on must-pass appropriations bills loom. In addition to limiting abortion access and benefits, far-right Republicans have sought to use spending bills to greatly reduce military aid to Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from earlier this year saw that support for abortion access was at an all-time high, and included a finding that about one-third of Republicans also broadly back the right to abortion access."

            "content": "Regarding your editorial on the results of the Spanish election (24 July), it is perhaps worth considering that while it is a huge relief to see the radical-right Vox party come out of the election in a significantly worse place than they were before, the position of the pro-Catalan separatist Junts party as a possible kingmaker is equally worrying. As you rightly say, the cause of Catalan independence has lost its edge in recent years thanks to the handling of the situation by the Socialists (PSOE) led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez \u2013 a long way from the \u201creferendum\u201d held under the previous conservative People\u2019s party (PP) administration and the ensuing violence. This is the problem. It is actually in the best interests of Junts to allow the situation to get worse \u2013 so it is unlikely, in my view, that they will act as kingmakers for the PSOE and its leftwing allies Sumar in any reasonable way \u2013 the best outcome for them is probably for fresh elections and a new PP/Vox administration which will be so confrontational as to fan the flames of Catalan independence once more. The threat of Vox in power is still there and is still real. Jeff Sutton Madrid, Spain \u2022 A difficult, but possible, strategy would be for the PP, led by Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, to launch an offer to Pedro S\u00e1nchez for a German-style pact backed by 255 deputies out of a total of 350. The possible results would stabilise and consolidate the advances made by the S\u00e1nchez government, neutralise and reduce the presence of the Vox party in the institutions, proclaim to Europe that a cordon sanitaire is possible for the anti-European extreme right and extreme left, establish stable and inclusive alliances with the centre-nationalist Catalan and Basque parties, and reduce the influence of Catalan and Basque separatist radicalism with its disintegrative messages for the European Union. Europe would feel confident with an alliance of these centre-left and centre-right parties and Spain would emerge strongly in Europe, leading and defending its integrating values. Fernando Villoria D\u00edez Santander, Spain \u2022 While I cheer the partial success of PSOE/Sumar in preventing a PP/Vox coalition, the left must learn quickly. While I have become suspicious of the term \u201cthe common good\u201d, the fundamentals of secure and respectful work, housing, healthcare and education must be prioritised. I believe that once these necessities are resolved, the appeal of the right dematerialises. Can I add that your editorial mentions of the pro-independence Basque party EH Bildu and its links with the Basque separatist paramilitaries ETA? This is often repeated by the Spanish right wing as a reason not to vote for the left. It is worth remembering that without recognition of Irish republicanism, there would be no Good Friday agreement. Matt Johnson Mungia, Spain \u2022 As a Spaniard, I have felt quite proud of my compatriots. Indeed, we proved ourselves sensible enough to realise the danger implied in a government including an extreme-right party. However, Mr S\u00e1nchez will have to prove, once again, his snake-charming capabilities to attract the support of the Catalan separatist Carles Puigdemont at a reasonable cost (something done quite successfully up to now with Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya and EH Bildu). If he fails to achieve this, he will risk another election later this year, without the benefit of a number of factors which were in his favour this time \u2013 including the fact that the elections were held in a holiday period, where more people backing right parties would be away from home, and the sense of sure victory which led many rightwing supporters not to bother voting.

Now, a growing number of federal judges are blocking those laws from taking effect. US district court judges have halted such laws in six states so far \u2013 Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee \u2013 finding that they infringe on the constitutional guarantee to equal protection under the 14th amendment to the US constitution. Two lawsuits challenging laws in Montana and Georgia have yet to be ruled on, and in Oklahoma the opposing sides in May agreed to set aside the law until the court case is heard. The court rulings offer temporary relief from the recent rush of bills banning transgender youth from receiving treatments such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. Twenty states have passed such bans, with the bulk of them signed into law this year. \u201cIt\u2019s quite noteworthy that the results in these cases have so far been so consistent,\u201d said Tobias Wolff, a University of Pennsylvania law professor specializing in constitutional law and LGBTQ rights. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because the law in this area was such a slam-dunk. It\u2019s because the facts are so clearly against these laws.\u201d Many conservative lawmakers have endorsed the laws as part of an effort to defend traditional conservative values and portray progressives as out of touch on issues of sex and religion. Democrats, LGBTQ advocacy groups and health providers say the bans unjustly target a community for whom gender-affirming care can be life-saving and which is under attack. \u201cThe courts are starting to find very consistently that these laws are ridiculous,\u201d said Kevin Jennings, chief executive of Lambda Legal, a civil rights organization focused on LGBTQ issues. \u201cThey violate the equal protection clause, they\u2019re motivated by animus not science and they serve no state interest.\u201d Judges, including three appointed by Republican former US president Donald Trump, have found that gender-affirming care is medically necessary for transgender youth suffering from gender dysphoria \u2013 the stress caused by the divergence between one\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.

            "date": "2023-07-22T06:00:05Z",
            "content": "The NHS is losing senior doctors to countries including Ireland, Australia and the United Arab Emirates because they can double their salary and enjoy better working conditions. Medical leaders are concerned about a growing exodus of hugely experienced doctors and surgeons to foreign healthcare systems, the Guardian has been told. Rising numbers of middle-aged consultants are opting for a new life abroad, which is exacerbating the NHS workforce crisis. The revelation comes after NHS consultants in England staged a second day of strike action on Friday in a row over pay with the government. They will strike again for 48 hours towards the end of next month. Global medical recruiters have for years been able to tempt junior doctors away from the NHS, because they are younger and have fewer reasons to remain in the UK. But medical leaders are increasingly worried about an emerging trend of senior doctors, in some cases people with several decades of experience, quitting the NHS and the UK altogether. Simon Walsh, the deputy chair of the British Medical Association consultants\u2019 committee, said rising numbers were being tempted to take jobs abroad because of how much more money they could earn and often superior working conditions. Walsh, an emergency medicine consultant, said he received weekly emails inviting him to apply for lucrative posts in the Middle East and elsewhere. He said: \u201cMy own personal experience is that during the last two years, three of my consultant colleagues have decided to move and work in Australia or New Zealand. In a short period, that is quite a significant number. And those are people that have families. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a big decision, when it will be difficult to see your parents or wider family, and to move your children into a different school system. So it\u2019s not a decision that people take lightly. It\u2019s not surprising, when the salary starting point will probably be double what we would be on here.\u201d In some more remote areas, Walsh said, NHS consultants were being offered even more. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of salaries that were at least three times the UK salary, if not approaching four times,\u201d he said. Steve Barclay, the health secretary, has awarded consultants in England a 6% pay rise. The Department of Health and Social Care says extra payments such as clinical excellence awards and cash for being on call would take the average NHS pay for consultants in 2023-24 to about \u00a3134,000. The BMA has called the pay award \u201cderisory\u201d and said doctors have had their real-term take-home pay fall by more than a third over the last 14 years. According to the BMA, consultants on a 2003 contract earn a starting salary of \u00a388,364 in basic pay, rising to \u00a3119,133 after about 19 years. Global medical recruiters are directly targeting picket lines. At the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham this week, a recruitment agency handed out bottled water to striking consultants and offered them new roles in Ireland paying up to \u00a3233,000. Eye surgeon Sakkaf Ahmed Aftab, the chairman of the BMA Yorkshire consultants\u2019 committee, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been 20 years as a consultant and, where I work, I\u2019ve lost two of my colleagues who have left the country and gone to Abu Dhabi \u2013 out of eight consultants \u2013 and, I\u2019ve lost another one who\u2019s gone to New Zealand. \u201cWe need the most senior doctors to be there to train the juniors. If the senior doctors are leaving for Australia or the Middle East, or taking retirement early, or leaving the NHS completely, who will be there to train the next generation of doctors?\u201d Ben Hockenhull, a consultant at St Mary\u2019s hospital in London, said: \u201cI\u2019m getting job offers from around the world \u2026 more than double my current remuneration package with added benefits and things like my professional expenses are paid for. Currently I have to pay for those myself. \u201cWatching my colleagues disappear from the UK, taking up those benefits packages abroad, moving to Australia and moving to New Zealand, moving to the Middle East, means that those of us that are left behind are the ones who are having to try and keep the service afloat. That\u2019s making us more stressed and more burnt out.\u201d Respiratory consultant Neela Surange said: \u201cI know many, many people who are now finishing the training but they are looking elsewhere because jobs in many other countries, including the Republic of Ireland, are far more lucrative than UK consultant posts. \u201cPublic healthcare services in Ireland pays more than the UK NHS, and other countries too: Gulf countries, Canada, Australia. I come from India and I know that the private sector in India pays a lot more and the work conditions there are far better than the NHS.\u201d"

            "content": "The Republican-led House of Representatives on Friday approved a huge defense bill that includes amendments overturning the Pentagon\u2019s policies on covering abortion services for the military, healthcare costs for transgender service members and diversity initiatives \u2013 setting up a historic clash with Democrats and the Biden administration that could imperil spending on the armed forces. The amendments, pushed by the GOP\u2019s right flank with the support of the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, represent the latest instance of conservative lawmakers using their influence in Congress\u2019s lower chamber to attempt to change Joe Biden\u2019s policies on a range of issues that chiefly animate the Republican base. They also seems certain to spark a major battle with Democrats who hold control of the Senate, and whose assent will be needed for the defense spending bill, a version of which Congress approves every year, to become law. \u201cHouse Republicans have made a commitment to America that we fight for a nation that is safe,\u201d McCarthy said shortly after the amended National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) covering the 2024 fiscal year passed on a mostly party-line vote. \u201cRadical programs that are forced [on] our troops at the expense of readiness are now eliminated. Cutting-edge technology that is essential for the future of this country and to keep freedom around the world in the rise of China and Russia, will receive more investment than we\u2019ve watched in the past,\u201d McCarthy said, adding that the legislation costing $886.3bn would also give service members their largest pay increase in two decades. The NDAA is one of the bills Congress must pass every year, and often attracts bipartisan support, with politicians of both parties eager to show they support the United States military. But while it is not unusual for the defense spending measure to include provisions addressing other issues on Congress\u2019s mind, rightwing Republicans this year proposed several amendments dealing with some of the most divisive issues in American society. On Thursday evening, Republicans pushed through an amendment to the bill that reverses a defense department policy covering expenses and leave for troops who must travel out of state to seek an abortion. The policy was implemented after the supreme court last year struck down Roe v Wade and allowed states to ban the procedure. The party also supported amendments banning the Pentagon\u2019s healthcare plans from covering gender-affirming care for transgender individuals, as well as a provisions targeting diversity, equity and inclusions programs and banning any teaching in the defense department\u2019s school system that America is \u201ca fundamentally racist country\u201d. Amendments halting military assistance to Ukraine and ending a policy of renaming military bases bearing monikers inspired by the Confederacy were voted down. While they did not formally tell their members to vote against the NDAA, the House\u2019s top Democrats, Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader, whip Katherine Clark and caucus chair Pete Aguilar released a joint statement accusing Republicans of corrupting legislation that should be used to support American troops. \u201cExtreme Maga Republicans have chosen to hijack the historically bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act to continue attacking reproductive freedom and jamming their rightwing ideology down the throats of the American people. House Republicans have turned what should be a meaningful investment in our men and women in uniform into an extreme and reckless legislative joyride,\u201d the trio wrote, adding that they would vote against the bill. In the end, only four Democrats supported the NDAA, all of whom represent swing districts. The four Republicans who voted against it were conservatives of varying stripes, with Colorado\u2019s Ken Buck releasing a statement saying the legislation is too expensive. \u201cOur country is careening toward fiscal ruin, and Congress continues to turn a blind eye by passing these massive spending packages with no attention to their cost or efficacy,\u201d Buck wrote, noting that he agrees \u201cwith several amendments to this bill\u201d."

            "date": "2023-07-19T15:00:06Z",
            "content": "An Australian-led research team has uncovered the first genetic link to strong immunity against Covid-19, which may help to explain why some people never develop any symptoms of the illness. A person who carries one copy of the protective HLA-B15 gene is twice as likely to remain asymptomatic after infection with the Sars CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, while someone who carries two copies of the gene is eight times more likely to have no symptoms, the research, published on Thursday in the journal Nature, found. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In a joint statement the lead authors of the paper, La Trobe University\u2019s Prof Stephanie Gras and Dr Dimitra Chatzileontiadou, told Guardian Australia that while most global efforts have focused on understanding factors underlying severe Covid-19 illness, examining asymptomatic infection is also important. It can help scientists understand how the immune system can rapidly clear the virus in some individuals, allowing them to remain healthy despite infection. \u201cOur results may lay the groundwork for refinement of vaccine development and therapeutic options,\u201d they said. While about 10% of people without the HLA-B15 gene had no symptoms after contracting the virus, this rose to between 20 and 30% in those with a copy of the gene, increasing their protection at least twofold. The researchers found that individuals with a particular HLA-B15 gene protein have T-cells (a type of white blood cell that helps protect against disease) that can recognise a part of the Sars CoV-2 spike protein that is similar to other seasonal coronaviruses which cause the common winter cold. This is known as cross-reactivity. A virologist and associate professor at the University of New South Wales\u2019 Kirby Institute, Stuart Turville, said: \u201cMany of us would have had a seasonal coronavirus before and those with this gene would have educated a T-cell population during this past infection.\u201d \u201cSo their T-cells would be ready for battle, so to speak, once Sars CoV-2 turned up,\u201d Turville said. The HLA-B15 gene protein is an important factor because \u201cunlike antibodies, the T-cells cannot see or bind to the virus particle and need HLA proteins to determine how to respond to an infection\u201d. The research is part of a global study including the University of California, San Francisco, which is using data from almost 30,000 registered bone marrow donors in a voluntary program to track Covid-19 infections and symptoms. Of 1,428 unvaccinated donors with positive test results for Covid-19, 136 had no symptoms. Turville said it was \u201creally clever\u201d to use the bone marrow program because it allowed the researchers to track a large population and look for any genetic makeup that may be important for immunity against viruses. \u201cWhat\u2019s also interesting is that HLA proteins are different across a population, enabling some of us to be better equipped to take on a virus we see,\u201d Turville said. \u201cSome people with certain HLAs control HIV infection really well, referred to as \u2018elite controllers\u2019. But this doesn\u2019t mean in general if you have this protein you can fight off all viruses as well. Curiously, other studies have shown this specific protein is associated with poor progression with hepatitis C, for example.\u201d The head of the Garvan Institute\u2019s immunology and immunodeficiency laboratory, Prof Stuart Tangye, said it was important to note there were many factors influencing susceptibility to Covid-19 symptoms and genetics was just one of them. Not everyone with HLA-B15 will be symptom-free. \u201cThis research is a nice extension of previous work done on cross-reactivity, and it helps to further explain asymptomatic infection in some people, but not all people,\u201d Tangye said."

            "date": "2023-07-12T20:00:12Z",
            "content": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 July. Overview Four years ago in France, the United States became the third team to successfully defend a World Cup since the second world war, joining Brazil\u2019s men (in 1962) and Germany\u2019s women (in 2007). And while Vlatko Andonovski\u2019s squad have maintained their uninterrupted six-year perch atop the Fifa rankings and will begin as narrow favourites in Australia and New Zealand, the Americans\u2019 pursuit of an unprecedented third successive world title has been anything but straightforward amid a sometimes tumultuous generational transition and a recent spate of injuries. The US were compelled to retool their roster after a lacklustre bronze-medal finish with a veteran-heavy squad at the Tokyo Olympics, where their once-swashbuckling attack struggled for ideas in the final third despite ample time on the ball, but it\u2019s anything but a finished product as their \u201cthree-peat\u201d bid draws near. While it\u2019s true the 2015 and 2019 tournament-winners faced urgent questions during the run-up before peaking at the right time, those squads were all but set months in advance. Not this year. Andonovski wound up choosing 14 first-time World Cup players, up from 11 debutantes in 2019. Questions over the fitness of mainstays Rose Lavelle, Julie Ertz and Megan Rapinoe are concerning enough, but the recent glut of injuries has ensured the newcomers will be pressed into action. Two of the long-intended attacking centrepieces are out of the picture: Chicago Red Stars forward Mallory Swanson, who was in the form of her life with goals in six straight international appearances when she suffered a torn patella tendon during an April friendly, along with Chelsea-bound forward Catarina Macario, who will not have recovered from a torn ACL in time. Also out are the captain Becky Sauerbrunn and veteran midfielder Sam Mewis. While the Americans do have the squad depth to absorb their absences, they will become far more dependent on youngsters Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Alyssa Thompson, who at 18 is the second youngest player ever to be named to a US World Cup squad after current USWNT assistant coach Tiffany Roberts Sahaydak. The coach Andonovski, a longtime NWSL manager who favours a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formation, has been a steady hand since he succeeded Jill Ellis as the US\u2019s ninth coach in November 2019. But the 23-match unbeaten run to start his tenure was ended by Sweden in their first contest of a Tokyo Olympics that quickly went sideways as his game management came under criticism. Questions over his fitness for the role surfaced in November when the United States suffered their first three-game losing streak in nearly 30 years with friendly defeats to England, Spain and Germany, but his job has never been in any serious jeopardy. His selections have broadly reflected an emphasis on NSWL form. Consider the surprise pick of Savannah DeMelo, a 25-year-old midfielder enjoying a standout club season for Racing Louisville FC, who is the third player ever to make a US World Cup squad without having previously made an international appearance. Star player The pacy 22-year-old Sophia Smith made a convincing pitch as the next face of US women\u2019s soccer with an extraordinary 2022 for club and country, becoming the youngest NWSL MVP in leading the Portland Thorns to a third league title while adding 11 international goals to become the youngest player to lead the USWNT in scoring in a calendar year since 1993. With Swanson and Macario both out of the World Cup, the US will rely on Smith even more for scoring punch. \u201cShe can stop pushing now, and she will still be a very good player, one of the best players this country has ever produced,\u201d says Thorns coach Rhian Wilkinson. \u201cAnd my job is to keep pushing her, and to make sure she is the best player this country has ever produced because she has that in her right now.\u201d Rising star The 22-year-old centre-back Naomi Girma, who has been capped 15 times since making her senior debut last year, has established herself in Andonovski\u2019s team with her mature poise, vision, distribution and ability in a position where experience is typically valued. During a standout debut season with the San Diego Wave that saw her win NWSL Rookie of the Year and Defender of the Year honours, the Californian has been equally rock-solid for country whether paired alongside Alana Cook or Sauerbrunn. \u201c[She\u2019s not just] making five-yard passes to the person next to her,\u201d former US star Carli Lloyd said. \u201cShe\u2019s threading balls through the centre of the park, picking out forwards\u2019 feet.\u201d Did you know? Rose Lavelle, the breakout midfield star of the last World Cup whose left-footed strike in the final was hailed as an instant classic, has a 10-year-old English bulldog named Wilma Jean Wrinkles (who is closing in on 13,000 followers on Instagram) that she FaceTimes from the road. Standing of women\u2019s football in the US? The 1972 passage of the federal legislation known as Title IX \u2013 the law that makes it illegal for government-funded institutions to discriminate on the basis of sex \u2013 mandated equal funding for women\u2019s sports programs that gave the United States a crucial head start on the international scene and generated a player pool that remains the envy of the world even as the gap is narrowing. Additionally, soccer\u2019s modest popularity in the United States among men\u2019s sports has given the women\u2019s game ample space to flourish. Realistic aim at the World Cup? The United States have won four World Cups and never finished worse than third in the tournament, adding four Olympic gold medals along the way. Anything short of a fifth would be a disappointment. But the historic feat of winning a third straight \u2013 so far from home, so compromised by injury, the once-yawning gap with their rivals never slimmer \u2013 promises their stiffest test to date."

            "date": "2023-07-14T19:36:12Z",
            "content": "Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has paid tribute to a young firefighter who was killed while battling a forest blaze in British Columbia, as wildfires continue to rage across the country and the western province requested an extra 1,000 international firefighters. Devyn Gale, 19, was part of a team that was tackling a fire outside the town of Revelstoke, about 310 miles (500km) north-east of Vancouver. Revelstoke Royal Canadian Mounted Police said she had been clearing brush in a remote area where a small fire had started. She lost contact with her team and was discovered caught under a fallen tree. \u201cYesterday, while working a fire, my sister Devyn was struck by a tree and killed,\u201d Gale\u2019s brother Nolan Gale posted on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for everything she\u2019s done for me and others, completely out of kindness with no expectation for reciprocation. She truly didn\u2019t deserve this. \u201cDevyn was an amazing sister. She was so kind and thoughtful. She had the best head on her shoulders between herself, my other sister ... and I. She was careful, considerate, hardworking. She was smarter and better at what she did than she gave herself credit for,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to have grown up beside her. I\u2019m grateful for everything she\u2019s done for me and others, completely out of kindness with no expectation for reciprocation.\u201d The firefighter was airlifted to hospital but succumbed to her injuries, the police statement said. In a tweet on Friday, Trudeau wrote: \u201cThe news from British Columbia \u2013 that one of the firefighters bravely battling wildfires has lost her life \u2013 is heartbreaking. At this incredibly difficult time, I\u2019m sending my deepest condolences to her family, her friends and her fellow firefighters.\u201d The British Columbia premier, David Eby, said in a statement the death was a \u201ctremendous loss for everyone involved with the BC Wildfire Service at an already challenging time\u201d. Fatalities are relatively rare among Canadian wildfire fighters. The last such death in British Columbia was in 2015, when firefighter John Phare was killed after being struck by a falling tree during a blaze on the province\u2019s Sunshine Coast. Five years earlier, Tim Whiting and Brian Tilley, two air tanker pilots, died in a plane crash near the town of Lytton. Canada\u2019s minister of emergency preparedness, Bill Blair, said Gale\u2019s death \u201cis a tragic reminder of the risks our firefighters are facing\u201d. Canada is on track for its worst-ever wildfire season with fires also raging in large swaths of eastern Canada, while wildfire emissions have hit record highs. In Quebec, the Canadian military is being deployed to help with emergency evacuations in the north of the province, the federal emergency preparedness minister, Bill Blair, said on Friday. In British Columbia, some 2,000 firefighters are battling more than 350 fires. Authorities have requested an extra 1,000 international firefighters to help tackle blazes that have burned 1.2m hectares of forest in the province so far this year, far above the 10-year average of 76,000 hectares. Lack of rain in recent months has left much British Columbia parched, in what officials say is an \u201cunprecedented\u201d level of drought for this early in the year. Hot weather is forecast to persist across much of the province and thunderstorms are likely to bring more lightning strikes that will spark more fires, Cliff Chapman, director of provincial operations for BC Wildfire, said in a media briefing on Thursday. \u201cWe have seen more fire on the landscape in terms of number of starts than in previous years at this point in time,\u201d Chapman said, adding there have been 51,000 lightning strikes in the last week alone."

            "content": "As the writers\u2019 strike moves towards its fourth month and the actors\u2019 strike ends its first, the future is looking increasingly shaky for Hollywood. Yet box-office takings have rarely been healthier, with strong second weekends for both Barbie and Oppenheimer meaning sold-out screenings and unprecedented post-pandemic buzz. Greta Gerwig\u2019s feminist comedy was again the weekend leader, taking $93m globally from Friday to Sunday, a drop of 43% from its opening weekend: the seventh-biggest second weekend in history. Overall, Barbie has so far made $775m globally and is already the third best-performing film of the year. Meanwhile Christopher Nolan\u2019s atomic bomb epic took $46.6m on its second weekend, making it the first R-rated film in the US to make more than $10m over 10 consecutive days. Its global total stands at $400m, already more than Nolan\u2019s previous film, Tenet. One victim of this combined success is the seventh Mission: Impossible film, currently on $448m globally. Although more than its production budget of $291m, it still marks a disappointing falloff for the well-reviewed Tom Cruise blockbuster, whose momentum has taken a hit from the Barbenheimer juggernaut. July was up 1.4% from pre-Covid levels, but the overall box office for 2023 is still down roughly 20% \u2013 in part because of the considerable uplift Cruise\u2019s previous movie, Top Gun: Maverick, had on 2022 takings. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 July 2023. An earlier version said that Oppenheimer had already made \u201cmore than Nolan\u2019s previous two films, Tenet and Batman Begins\u201d. The latter was not one of the director\u2019s previous two films."

De Niro\u2019s eldest daughter, Drena, posted on Instagram to say her son had died. She said the family had lost a \u201csweet angel\u201d. The 51-year-old mother wrote: \u201cMy beautiful sweet angel. I have loved you beyond words or description from the moment I felt you in my belly. You have been my joy my heart and all that was ever pure and real in my life. I wish I was with you right now. I wish I was with you.\u201d The post further said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to live without you but I\u2019ll try to go on and spread the love and light that you so made me feel in getting to be your mama. You were so deeply loved and appreciated and I wish that love alone could have saved you.\u201d She closed by adding that she was sorry and urged her son to rest in peace and eternal paradise. Drena De Niro is the oldest of Robert De Niro\u2019s seven children. Her son acted alongside her in three projects, including the 2018 hit A Star Is Born. In Bradley Cooper\u2019s remake, the mother and son played mother and son, wife and child to Dave Chappelle\u2019s character. Robert De Niro said in a statement on Monday that he was \u201cdeeply distressed by the passing of my beloved grandson Leo. We\u2019re greatly appreciative of the condolences from everyone. We ask that we please be given privacy to grieve our loss of Leo.\u201d Messages to a representative for Drena De Niro was not immediately returned. Later on Monday, a publicist shared another statement from Drena De Niro. \u201cIt is with immeasurable shock and and sadness that we say goodbye to our beloved son Leo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thank you for the outpouring of love and support and ask that we are given privacy at this time to process this inconsolable grief.\u201d In response to a request to confirm a TMZ report that Leandro was found in a New York apartment, New York City police wrote that \u201can 18-year-old male was found unconscious, unresponsive and was pronounced deceased by EMS on scene\u201d at a Wall Street address that houses the Cipriani Club Residences. Leandro only recently turned 19, news outlets report. The medical examiner\u2019s office will determine the cause of death. Drena De Niro has had roles in Joy, The Intern and Mozart in the Jungle, among a long list of credits. Leandro had acting credits to his name, with roles in 2005\u2019s The Collection, and 2018\u2019s Cabaret Maxime, also alongside his mother. Drena De Niro had previously made joyous posts on sharing Mothers Day with Leandro last month. The family has not released any details about the cause of death. Leandro\u2019s father, Carlos Mare, had not made any comment by Monday afternoon, although he posted an image of a black square on Instagram, without adding any words.

            "content": "At the age of two, babies born during the pandemic have similar behaviour and development compared with children who were born before Covid-19 arrived \u2013 with one exception. Their communication skills lag behind those of their predecessors. These are the intriguing findings of a study \u2013 carried out by researchers based at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) \u2013 which examined what life was like for babies born during the pandemic, and the implications for their health and development. The study \u2013 carried out by a team led by Susan Byrne, senior lecturer at the RCSI, and Jonathan Hourihane, the RCSI\u2019s professor of paediatrics \u2013 focused on babies born in the first three months of lockdown and compared them with a similar group of babies born before the pandemic. A total of 354 families and their babies were involved in the study. \u201cWe wanted to understand what life was like for babies born during the pandemic, and what it might mean for their general health and development,\u201d Byrne told the Observer. The team\u2019s discoveries were striking. They found that, at six months, an average of only three people had kissed babies, including their parents \u2013 indicating babies had met very few relatives or family friends. One in four babies had not met another child their own age by their first birthday, it was also revealed. Byrne added that when parents were asked what it felt like to raise a child during lockdown they frequently used words such as \u201clonely\u201d and \u201cisolating\u201d. On the other hand, it was also found that family time and bonding expanded. Babies born during the pandemic probably heard fewer words because they were not getting out of their houses, and this may have led to their slightly lower communication scores compared with those of children born earlier. However, for other attributes \u2013 such as motor skills and problem-solving ability \u2013 no overall drop in performance was recorded. In addition, questionnaires filled in by parents revealed no differences in their children\u2019s behaviour with regard to sleep problems, anxiety or social withdrawal. Now the group is hoping to extend the study and follow babies until they start school at the age of five. \u201cThat is going to be really important,\u201d Byrne told the Observer. \u201cCovid restrictions ended quite a while ago, and babies have been out and about doing normal activities, meeting other people, going to play groups. And you\u2019d hope that the findings would settle by the age of five \u2013 but we need to find out conclusively if that is really the case.\u201d The relatively encouraging conclusions of the Irish study contrast with the academic performances of older children. Last week it was revealed that primary school pupils in England were still doing worse in mathematics and writing compared with standards that were established before the pandemic forced school closures. Reading performance was also found to have stalled. Standard assessment tests (Sats), taken in England at the end of primary school, showed a slight improvement on last year but results remained far behind 2019, according to figures released last week. Tests were not taken in 2020 and 2021 because of Covid disruption. Fewer than three-fifths of pupils are reaching the expected standard in the key subjects of reading, writing and maths, it was found. This year\u2019s figure of 59% is down from 65% before lockdown and is considerably lower than the government\u2019s target of 90% of pupils meeting the expected standard in all three disciplines at key stage 2 by 2030. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cThe results confirm the point made by teachers and researchers: primary schools are still deeply affected by the pandemic, and Sats worsen this already difficult situation. Funding is inadequate. \u201cClass sizes are growing. The jobs of support staff have been cut. There is no substantial programme to support educational recovery.\u201d \u2018In lockdown they didn\u2019t hear me chatting with other mums\u2019 Alex Thomas, mother of Jacob, three, and Maddie, four, lives in Waltham Forest. \u201cBoth of my children have been referred for speech and language therapy. Jacob was born in April 2020, right at the beginning of the pandemic, when my daughter was 18 months old. Her nursery closed, so she stopped going. \u201cDuring lockdown, my children did not have the daily exposure to play groups and friends and family they would otherwise naturally have had. Like everyone else, we rarely met up with other people so they didn\u2019t often hear me chatting with other mums and their kids, for example. \u201cI noticed Maddie\u2019s language wasn\u2019t developing. At two, she still wasn\u2019t saying any words, so I asked my health visitor to refer her to a speech therapist. The sessions took place over Zoom and the therapist only interacted with me, not my daughter. I don\u2019t believe they helped her in the slightest. \u201cEven in September 2022, when she was nearly four, she wasn\u2019t really talking. Since then, we\u2019ve been paying \u00a380 an hour for private speech therapy. \u201cJacob has also been on a waiting list for speech therapy since February. When he started nursery, he wasn\u2019t saying any distinguishable words. At that point, I went on an eight-week course called Tots Talking, run by the charity Speech and Language UK, which was really good. \u201cThey explained ways I could improve my communication with my children \u2013 for example by narrating what we were doing and seeing when we were alone together. \u201cI learned I had to be really present, look at what they were looking at and talk about it. \u201cJacob is three now and he\u2019s still behind his peers. I think that\u2019s at least partly due to the isolation we endured during the pandemic. Many people struggle to understand what he\u2019s saying, and he shies away from talking to other children sometimes as a result. \u201cHe\u2019ll get frustrated when he tries to tell us something and we don\u2019t understand him. It makes him sad, and eventually he stops trying. He goes quiet. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d Donna Ferguson"

About one in 20 schools in England are thought to have closed completely and many more restricted access to certain year groups, with some having to cancel sports events or transition days for incoming pupils. \u201cThis disruption is undermining the stability we have been working so hard to recover after the pandemic,\u201d Keegan told the Local Government Association annual conference on Wednesday, while teachers protested outside the centre where the event was being held. Pressed by Laura Wright, the deputy leader of Exeter city council and a former teacher, to meet union leaders to discuss pay and funding, Keegan hinted there could be an announcement soon on the 2023-24 pay round. She said: \u201cI think I\u2019ve done pretty well actually in terms of getting money from the Treasury, but all of it has not stopped a single strike so it\u2019s very disappointing. I\u2019m hoping that we can be in a different place, let\u2019s say soon, but it is very disappointing.\u201d Keegan is said to have received the report of the School Teachers Review Body (STRB), the independent group that advises the government on teachers pay rates in England. Reports suggest the STRB has recommended teachers receive a 6.5% pay increase from September, above the 4.3% plus \u00a31,000 bonus offered by the government that was decisively rejected by all four main teaching and headteachers unions this year. School leaders have been calling for Keegan to publish the report and the government\u2019s response to allow them to finalise budgets from the coming school year. All four unions \u2013 the NEU, NASUWT, National Association of Head Teachers and Association of School and College Leaders \u2013 are balloting their members in England over potential strike action from September. If theballots pass the legal thresholds required, combined industrial action would close almost all state schools in England, in unprecedented coordinated strikes. Daniel Kebede, the NEU\u2019s general secretary-elect, told a rally of thousands of members at Parliament Square in London: \u201cIf this government doesn\u2019t deliver there will be a general strike in education, get ready now. It\u2019s not going to be easy, and it will get harder, but we will win because we have justice on our side.\u201d"

            "title": "The Other Pandemic by James Ball review: QAnon as post-truth pathogen",
            "date": "2023-07-19T08:00:00Z",
            "content": "Most people made aware of a plot to kidnap and murder children on an industrial scale would want to do something about it. It is hardly surprising that Edgar Maddison Welch, learning of such a wicked scheme, and outraged that law enforcement agencies were doing nothing, took matters into his own hands. On 4 December 2016, Welch brought an assault rifle and handgun down to Comet Ping Pong, a pizzeria in Washington DC, to liberate the children held captive there in the basement. But he found no children and no basement. That setback didn\u2019t put a stop to \u201cPizzagate\u201d, a deranged fantasy among online sleuths who had identified Comet Ping Pong as the hub for a satanic paedophile ring based around Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential election campaign. As with so many conspiracy theories, the absence of supporting evidence could be folded back into the original narrative as proof of a cover-up. That self-replicating mechanism is deftly unpacked by James Ball in The Other Pandemic: How QAnon Contaminated the World. It is a disturbing study of the origins and resilience of an exceptionally versatile and pernicious network of paranoid digital malcontents. Pizzagate is just one subplot in the sprawling edifice of QAnon belief. Adherents are lured into the faith down any number of channels \u2013 Donald Trump fandom; vaccine hesitancy; self-pitying adolescent video-gamer virginity recast as militant misogyny. Followers are then radicalised by cultish solidarity, the thrill of belonging to a crusading gang, and by social media algorithms that reinforce prejudice and exclude dissent. In some respects, QAnon is a rehash of old conspiracy theories, drawing on established tropes from the analogue age: a vast secret world government; antisemitic \u201cblood libels\u201d about ritual child murder that date back centuries. But the 21st-century version is also indigenous to the internet, emerging from a roiling soup of nerdy chatrooms, then evolving to thrive across a range of digital ecosystems. Ball, a former Guardian journalist, was once an habitu\u00e9 of 4chan, the platform where the anonymous \u201cQ\u201d first posted tantalising clues about an unfolding plot at the apex of power. That experience equips him well for the task of sequencing the movement\u2019s cultural and social DNA. He is especially insightful on the influence of online role-playing games and the cultivated ambiguity around what is meant to be taken seriously and what comes draped in irony. The original trolling ethos was steeped in nihilistic mischief, breaking taboos for the sake of it, transgressing for thrills. That slippery joking-not-joking idiom made it hard for mainstream politics to get a purchase on QAnon before it found its real-life incarnation in Donald Trump. The full scale of the cult, and the threat it posed to a democratic society, only registered for many people when its digital fingerprints turned up all over the capitol insurrection that tried to thwart Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration as Trump\u2019s successor. The insurgents\u2019 failure provoked premature forecasts of QAnon\u2019s demise. Instead, the virus mutated and spread. For Ball, that is not a biological metaphor. He argues from Darwinian principles, via Richard Dawkins\u2019s original coinage of the word \u201cmeme\u201d for a self-replicating unit of cultural evolution, that QAnon is best understood as a literal pathogen. It is a pandemic ravaging democratic discourse in the same way that Covid-19 assaulted respiratory tracts. That raises a teasing question, unanswered in the book, about the equivalent pathological status of longer established irrational belief systems. Should the world\u2019s major religions, all of which have inspired crazed acts of violence throughout history, also be treated as social diseases? Ball can hardly be blamed for swerving that digression when the task of charting one multi-faceted digital cult is complex enough. No less tricky is the question of a remedy. The most common treatments are factchecking and ridicule, which succeed only in driving devotees deeper into social segregation. Old fashioned refutation with evidence can\u2019t achieve much without wider reform of the digital infrastructure that creates nesting grounds for the malignant info-disease. Besides, mistrust in politics has been debilitating democratic immune systems since before social media incubated this new strain of conspiracy theory. That, Ball concludes, is a chronic condition for which there is no quick technological fix. \u2022 The Other Pandemic: How QAnon Contaminated the World is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a320).

            "date": "2023-07-07T05:00:22Z",
            "content": "Half of older adults who left the UK workforce amid mass redundancies in the first year of the Covid pandemic ended up falling into relative poverty, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Britain\u2019s foremost economics thinktank said job losses during the early stages of the crisis, coupled with the additional health risks faced by older workers, were likely to have forced many people into early retirement. Contradicting the assumption that rising numbers taking early retirement were being driven by wealthier individuals who no longer needed to work, it said that as many as 48% of 50- to 70-year-olds who left their jobs in 2020-21 had since experienced relative poverty. Relative poverty is defined as living in households with income below 60% of the median. The study comes amid growing concern over worker shortages, after an exodus from the workforce since the Covid pandemic driven by early retirement and record levels of long-term sickness among working-age adults. Economists have identified the UK as an international outlier for a weak employment recovery, contributing to persistent inflationary pressures as employers respond to near-record numbers of vacancies by pushing up starting pay. According to the IFS, many workers were likely to have been forced into early retirement even if they did not have significant sums of state or private pension income to support them, worsening their living standards and wellbeing. It found those who stopped working cut their food expenditure by about \u00a360 a week on average \u2013 much more than those who had stopped working in previous years, who on average did not substantially change their spending habits after leaving the workforce. Older people who stopped working were less likely to receive pension incomes compared with those who stopped working in previous years, with about half having no access to either private or state pensions in 2020-21, compared with 43% a year earlier. Xiaowei Xu, a senior research economist at the IFS, said some of the older workers who had left their jobs in the pandemic could return to the workforce with the right job opportunities, and there were signs some were returning already. However, she said government policies to support older workers \u2013 such as the Department for Work and Pensions \u201cmid life MOT\u201d \u2013 would be \u201ccritical\u201d if ministers wanted more older workers to return. \u201cIt is often assumed that older people who left the workforce during the pandemic were wealthy individuals retiring in comfort. Our analysis shows that those who left in the first year of the pandemic experienced a sharp rise in poverty, despite overall poverty rates falling that year, and also suffered large falls in wellbeing,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2023-07-04T07:00:55Z",
            "content": "When he bought the pretty little striped field mouse on the internet for $8 to give to his daughter for her sixth birthday, the businessman from S\u00e3o Paulo was told it was free of infection and had been bred by a registered dealer. In fact, it had been sourced from the vast sugar cane fields planted in Brazil to grow biofuels to reduce the use of fossil fuels \u2013 and which were swarming with rodents after yet another heatwave. It nipped his daughter on the finger, but no one thought much of it \u2013 and six days later, he left on a trip to Europe. By the time he reached Amsterdam, she had started suffering fevers, muscle aches and breathing problems and had been rushed to hospital, and he too felt unwell. It was the start of one of the worst pandemics in human history, killing more people than Covid-19, Sars or the 1918 flu pandemic put together. In one week 300 people had been infected, a month later 300,000 people around the world were gasping for breath. After 8 months, possibly 20 million people had died and 1 billion people were infected. It was Covid on steroids. Whereas Covid killed 1% of people infected, this novel hantavirus mutated as fast as the Omicron variant and killed one in three people it infected. It was Disease X, the name adopted in 2018 by World Health Organization disease experts to an as yet unknown, hyper-virulent disease for which no drug or vaccine was available, but which could kill hundreds of millions of people. That much is fiction. Disease X is hypothetical. But the consensus is that something like it is coming. It may not be a hantavirus. It could well be a flu, a coronavirus like Covid-19, or a returning, souped-up ancient killer like typhoid, tuberculosis or plague. It may spill over to humans through a hamster, a bat, a chicken, or a tick. It could come out of a fur farm in Norway or a pig farm in Mexico. It could incubate in a disturbed forest, a US weapons lab or a farmers\u2019 market in the UK. It may not arrive for many decades but with climate change, new global ecological conditions, hyper-mobility and ever denser human and animal populations, another great pandemic is inevitable. Pandemics kill far more people and cost economies more than war, but no government or global body at present plans to address the underlying cause of Covid-19 or the question of why outbreaks of major new infectious diseases like HIV/Aids, Ebola, Marburg, avian flu, Sars, Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), mpox and Nipah have all emerged in the past 50 years. The priority of government and industry is to find better ways to treat symptoms with better vaccines and technology, rather than address the causes of disease. But we are not helpless. We know enough to strongly expect the next great pandemic will be \u201czoonotic\u201d (or linked to animals), be ecologically driven and connected to the way humanity manipulates, changes and degrades the global environment. Intensive deforestation, the draining of wetland, climate change, the degradation of soil, the collapse of biodiversity, and the growth of vast, impoverished cities have together helped create the perfect conditions for new viruses to evolve faster, emerge more easily and cross from one species to another. Covid has taught us that we cannot stop the evolution of microbes or escape from them. There are at least six things we can do, however, to not only reduce the risk of pandemics emerging but also reduce their severity. Rethink human relationships with animals. Animals have played a major part in nearly every major disease outbreak since 1970. In that short time, about 500 new zoonotic, or animal-born diseases have emerged, including Mers, avian influenza, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Nipah, Zika, Covid-19 and HIV/Aids. Humans have never been closer to the pathogens of other species. Reform farming. We have never farmed so many animals so intensively: over 70 billion of them a year are slaughtered for meat. Global food production now relies on vast flocks and herds of genetically identical poultry, cattle and pigs being reared in high-intensity, overcrowded, confined, entirely unnatural conditions. The growing danger is that industrial farms are becoming disease factories, incubating and enhancing pathogens like flu, and enabling hyper-virulent pathogens to spread within flocks or cross to humans. Restore ecosystems. The past 30 years have seen an astonishingly fast transformation of the world\u2019s forests, wetlands and soils to provide food; the greatest mining and extraction of fossil fuels for energy, power and minerals in human history; and the biggest increase ever known in trade and human travel. Logging, urbanisation and human population growth have all fragmented ecosystems and helped create the condition for diseases to emerge and spread. We must minimise the disturbance of nature and reduce the interactions between ourselves and the pathogens of other species. Control greenhouse emissions. Global heating increases the threat of diseases emerging \u2013 and changes where and when they emerge and spread. When temperatures rise, rains are heavier or droughts and heatwaves last longer, then the conditions for life change \u2013 and the insects, bats, ticks and other wildlife that mostly carry pathogens or diseases like malaria, Rift Valley fever, cholera and dengue are likely to geographically spread. The changing climate is already driving wildlife into new areas, destroying habitat and forcing it to survive in new ecological conditions in which previously isolated species may mix and exchange pathogens. Unless climate heating is brought under control, not only will humanity suffer, but there are likely to be many new diseases emerging, and in unexpected places. Control lab experiments. There is no consensus on the origin of Covid-19, but the risk of a pandemic starting in a laboratory is real, and grows every year. Medical and military research uses the world\u2019s most dangerous bacteria, viruses and pathogens and is now conducted in thousands of state, corporate and academic laboratories around the world. New ways to find vaccines and control dangerous pathogens are now a multibillion-dollar global industry. The risk of future pandemics originating from controversial \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research that aims to increase a pathogen\u2019s virulence for possible military or medical use is high. Improve disease surveillance. Infectious diseases will continue to break out, mutate and haunt us. But who they affect and where they strike now depends on us. Strong public health systems, especially in the world\u2019s great urban centres, are best placed to monitor new disease outbreaks, to identify what strains may be spreading and to test and stop them in their tracks. But that requires commitments by all countries to invest heavily in eradicating global poverty. This may be the global north\u2019s best insurance policy against future pandemics. Eliminating the risk of infectious disease is as impossible now as it was 20 years ago, but if we only try to treat the symptoms of disease with vaccines and technology, we are in danger of not preventing them occurring in the first place. The only way to ensure good long-term human and planetary health is to minimise the disturbance of nature \u2013 and avoid interactions between ourselves and the pathogens of other species.

            "date": "2023-07-04T16:33:09Z",
            "content": "The regulator charged with upholding professional standards in UK medical practice is being sued by a junior doctor over its refusal to investigate a cardiologist for spreading allegedly \u201charmful misinformation\u201d about Covid vaccines. Dr Matt Kneale brought the case against the General Medical Council after it failed to investigate Dr Aseem Malhotra at the ROC Private Clinic in London \u2013 who linked Covid vaccines to frequent, severe heart problems and deaths, despite substantial evidence for their safety. In documents filed in the high court, Kneale alleges that the cardiologist peddled \u201cunscientific and dangerous misinformation\u201d about Covid vaccines on social media and elsewhere as the pandemic unfolded. On one occasion, in October 2022, Malhotra tweeted that mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna were a \u201clikely contributory factor\u201d in all unexpected cardiac arrests, heart attacks, strokes, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failures since 2021. He went on to suggest that one in 1,000 Americans might have been killed by Covid jabs and branded the vaccination programme \u201cthe greatest miscarriage of medical science we will witness in our lifetime\u201d. Malhotra, who believes a Covid booster contributed to the death of his father in July 2021, has more than half a million followers on Twitter. Malhotra\u2019s comments prompted Kneale to complain to the GMC, but the council chose not to investigate on the grounds that the statements were not sufficiently egregious to warrant action. Research by the UK Health Security Agency has found that the Covid vaccination programme, which used Pfizer and Moderna shots along with the adenovirus-based vaccine from Oxford/AstraZeneca, saved more than 100,000 lives in England alone by September 2021. \u201cWe want the GMC to open an investigation,\u201d Kneale said. \u201cNot just to fully and dispassionately investigate this one doctor, but also to engage generally with the issue of doctors who may potentially cause harm to the public by their postings on social media.\u201d The decision not to investigate risked creating a \u201cwild west\u201d where any doctor could say almost anything without consequence, Kneale added. The case comes after the British Medical Association passed a vote of no confidence in the GMC at its annual meeting in Liverpool on Tuesday. The vote follows concerns over disproportionate sanctions against some doctors for minor mistakes and a failure to act against doctors who spread dangerous misinformation. Early in the pandemic, Malhotra defended Covid vaccines on Good Morning Britain and criticised misinformation on social media that deterred people from having the shots. But he said on Tuesday that he had changed his view on their safety after reading new research. \u201cThe Covid mRNA vaccines have not uncommon and serious adverse consequences including death and should likely never have been approved in the first place,\u201d he said. A major study into Covid jabs found that mRNA vaccines marginally raised the risk of myocarditis, or heart inflammation, leading to an extra one to six cases for every million people who receive a first dose, and up to 10 extra cases for every million people who had a second shot. Covid infection itself causes an estimated 40 extra cases of myocarditis for every million infected. The vast majority of myocarditis is mild, according to the British Heart Foundation. A GMC spokesperson said the council was aware of the concerns over Malhotra\u2019s comments but could not comment on individual cases. \u201cWe take action where there is evidence of a risk to patients or public confidence or a serious breach of proper professional standards or conduct,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe do not take this responsibility lightly and realise that our decisions can sometimes be disappointing for complainants.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-10T15:22:41Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s medicines regulator has approved the first vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in older adults. The virus typically causes cold-like symptoms, but is a leading cause of pneumonia in infants and elderly people, with infections in older adults accounting for about 8,000 deaths, 14,000 hospitalisations and 175,000 GP appointments in the UK each year \u2013 more than influenza during a typical winter season. People with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes and chronic heart or lung disease, are at greatest risk of severe illness. There are no specific treatments for RSV but those with severe infections may be supported with supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, or mechanical ventilation until they get better. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has authorised the vaccine, Arexvy, for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in adults 60 years and older \u2013 the first time an RSV vaccine for older adults has been authorised for use in the UK. A study of 24,966 older adults published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February suggested vaccine efficacy against LRTD was 82.6%, while efficacy against serious disease was 94.1%. The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with mild to moderate injection site pain, fatigue, muscle and joint aches or pain and headache the most commonly reported side events. The rate of serious adverse effects was similar between those receiving the vaccine or a placebo jab. The vaccine, produced by GlaxoSmithKline, has already been approved for use in the US and Europe. Further adult RSV vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer are expected to be considered in the coming months. On 22 June, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK governments on matters of immunisation, issued a short statement to the Department of Health and Social Care advising that a cost-effective RSV immunisation programme should be developed for infants and older adults. The JCVI cited modelling by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and other academic groups suggesting that a vaccination programme for older adults could be cost-effective. It currently favours a \u201cone-off vaccination campaign targeting several age cohorts and then a routine programme for those turning 75 years old\u201d, the statement said. A final statement to inform a policy decision about potential RSV immunisation programmes is expected later this summer. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, the chair of the JCVI said: \u201cThere is a substantial burden of RSV infection in older adults, which contributes to the seasonal winter pressures for the NHS. \u201cClinical trials of several products have shown that vaccination can boost immunity and reduce the risk of infection and hospitalisation with the potential to improve population health.\u201d The JCVI is closely monitoring the development of products to protect newborns and infants against RSV, which is the leading cause of hospitalisation in infants worldwide. Maternal vaccines, which are designed to be given during pregnancy, are now in late-stage clinical trials, while an antibody-based drug called nirsevimab was licensed by the MHRA in November 2022. It is designed to protect babies during their first RSV season, when they are most vulnerable."

            "date": "2023-07-19T06:00:43Z",
            "content": "Malawi is investigating at least 17 suspected polio cases just as a vaccination campaign is completed with more than 90% of the country\u2019s children inoculated against the virus. Health authorities fear Cyclone Freddy \u2013 the world\u2019s longest-lasting tropical cyclone \u2013 which made landfall in March in the southern African nation and led to hundreds of deaths and thousands of displacements \u2013 could be a contributing factor. Arnold Mdalira, a spokesperson for the Zomba district health office in southern Malawi, said on Monday that the results of the investigation will come out in a fortnight. \u201cZomba is one of the districts affected by Cyclone Freddy, and it destroyed toilets and other sanitation facilities,\u201d he said in a radio interview. The development could pose danger to children, especially newborns, he added. Malawi has been vaccinating children since last year following a recorded first case of the wild polio in 30 years, and the first in Africa since the region was certified free of indigenous wild polio in 2020. There are three variants of wild or naturally occurring virus, which is the most common type of polio. Two types have been eradicated (WPV2 and WPV3), while WPV1 remains endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan. There is also a very rare vaccine-derived poliovirus, which is a variant of the weakened poliovirus initially included in the oral polio vaccine. A ministry of health spokesperson, Adrian Chikumbe, could not confirm the new cases but said \u201cwe do surveillance from time to time\u201d and the \u201cconditions could be due to other factors\u201d. He added: \u201cPossibly it could be acute flaccid paralysis \u2013 after further investigations or laboratory tests we can determine if it\u2019s polio or not, but we have not received those reports.\u201d He said the ministry has monitored 316 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) so far this year. AFP is a clinical syndrome covering a collection of symptoms and defined by the acute onset of weakness or paralysis with reduced muscle tone in children. Polio is one of many infectious and non-infectious causes of AFP. \u201cAny child presenting with acute flaccid paralysis, which could be due to polio or other factors, is picked out and investigated,\u201d said Chikumbe. He said that a vaccination campaign, which ended last weekend, reached more than 8 million children, representing 90.7% of the country\u2019s under-15s. Adamson Muula, a professor of public health and epidemiology at Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, said a prompt investigation of the new cases will be vital. \u201cOne key issue is to find whether they received the vaccine or not, and that will unlock what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the samples have been taken, it will take some days. [But] until the ministry has findings, they can\u2019t say [whether it is polio or not]. \u201cI would not be surprised [if the cases were polio] because \u2013 just like cholera \u2013 it passes through contaminated water or food. Now, with Cyclone Freddy, the sanitations have been compromised and other areas have also remained for days without water. If one person had polio, it\u2019s very easy to spread. Earlier this year, Malawi \u2013 with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the WHO, Unicef and TyVAC \u2013 launched a nationwide integrated vaccination campaign targeting children from nine months to 14 years old. Vaccines for typhoid fever, measles, rubella and polio, as well as a vitamin A supplement, were available at mobile and fixed sites, including clinics, mobile outreach teams and schools. Malawi has also become the third African country to introduce the typhoid conjugate vaccine in its routine vaccination programme."

            "content": "A long-awaited vaccine for malaria has been announced for rollout across 12 African countries over the next two years, potentially saving tens of thousands of lives. An initial 18m doses of the world\u2019s first malaria vaccine have been assigned to the countries where the risk of children falling ill and dying from malaria is highest, according to a statement from the global vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Unicef. \u201cThis vaccine has the potential to be very impactful in the fight against malaria, and when broadly deployed alongside other interventions, it can prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year,\u201d said Thabani Maphosa, the managing director of country programmes delivery at Gavi. Another 16 African countries have asked for access to the vaccine and will be hoping for supplies when production has been scaled up. The vaccine, named RTS,S/AS01, was declared \u201csafe and effective\u201d in reducing deaths and severe illness after being given to 1.7 million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi since 2019. It will now be given to Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda, with doses expected to arrive in the final quarter of this year. Unicef\u2019s associate director of immunisation, Ephrem T Lemango, said the vaccine will help fight a disease that kills almost half a million children under five in Africa every year. \u201cFor a long time, these deaths have been preventable and treatable; but the rollout of this vaccine will give children, especially in Africa, an even better chance at surviving. As supply increases, we hope even more children can benefit from this life-saving advancement,\u201d he said. The vaccine is being produced by GlaxoSmithKline but with an expected 60m doses needed each year by 2026, the Indian company Bharat Biotech will soon also be involved in supply. Dr Kate O\u2019Brien, the director of immunisation, vaccines and biologicals at the WHO, said the vaccine is a breakthrough for malaria-affected communities. \u201cThe high demand for the vaccine and the strong reach of childhood immunisation will increase equity in access to malaria prevention and save many young lives. We will work tirelessly to increase supply until all children at risk have access,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. Another vaccine, the R21, developed at Oxford University, will also be manufactured by an Indian company, the Serum Institute, and is awaiting WHO pre-qualification."

They detail nine deaths in children ranging from five to 17 years old following Covid vaccination in Australia but the TGA emphasises that it is not certain the deaths were caused by vaccination. Meanwhile, a prominent BBC presenter has been suspended over claims he solicited explicit pictures from a teenager, and England keep their Ashes hopes alive with a Test three win. Australia Robodebt report | At least seven public servants were criticised in the robodebt royal commission report released last week, for conduct including misleading cabinet and the commonwealth ombudsman, but it is not yet clear what the consequences will be. Covid-19 | A report made to Australia\u2019s drug regulator in January 2022 that a seven-year-old boy died from \u201can adverse event after immunisation\u201d with an unspecified brand of Covid vaccine was found to be a hoax. So was a separate report about a six-year-old\u2019s death. Misinformation | Facebook and Instagram want to avoid exacerbating harms around the Indigenous voice referendum, said the company\u2019s Australian policy head, as the social media giant beefs up protections on misinformation, abuse and mental health ahead of the national vote. Plastic | The plastics consumed yearly by Australians have a greenhouse emissions impact equivalent to 5.7m cars \u2013 more than a third of the cars on Australia\u2019s roads, new analysis suggests. Gambling | Australians will soon be able to ban themselves from all online gambling companies in every state and territory using just one form, almost five years after legislation was introduced to parliament. World BBC | The BBC has suspended a prominent male presenter and reported them to the police over allegations that he paid a teenager for sexually explicit images. The star has not been named. France | A brutal arrest during a peaceful march against police violence put French law and order under the spotlight again. It came as the government banned fireworks outside authorised displays during the Bastille Day holiday weekend, fearing further unrest. Secret interests | Several dozen British MPs currently own stakes in publicly listed companies, the Guardian can reveal \u2013 shareholdings that until now have been in effect secret. The investigation raises questions about possible conflicts of interest.

Reporters Chris Knaus and Luke Henriques-Gomes explain what we now know about what went wrong with robodebt, including the harm it caused and who was responsible. In-depth Rice, Japan\u2019s traditional staple, is losing the battle with more convenient and cheaper alternative foods \u2013 especially bread, the Observer reports. Annual consumption of rice in Japan peaked in 1962; by 2020, per-capita consumption had more than halved. \u201cThe quality of bread and an increasing number of bakeries make it easier to choose bread over rice,\u201d says Yukari Sakamoto, a food writer. \u201cAnd rice isn\u2019t cheap, so having bread or noodles is more affordable for a lot of people.\u201d Not the news Often dismissed by the medical establishment, people with complex illnesses such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME) and long Covid \u2013 where research is moving at a snail\u2019s pace \u2013 are taking the hunt for treatments into their own hands. For two women who suffer from CFS, experiencing short-term remissions from their debilitating symptoms \u2013 which happened by chance when they took probiotic supplements \u2013 has prompted their own investigation of whether the gut microbiome holds the key to their conditions.

            "content": "USWNT players Sophia Smith and Naomi Girma say they will be thinking of their late college teammate, Katie Meyer, as they kick off their World Cup campaign in New Zealand later this week. Meyer played alongside Smith and Girma on the Stanford team that won a national college title in 2019. She took her own life last year at the age of 22. On Tuesday, Girma wrote a tribute to Meyer in The Players Tribune. She described Meyer as the \u201ctruest friend I ever had. The most unapologetic, positive, caring person in the world.\u201d Girma added that she and her teammates have partnered with the charity Common Goal to highlight mental health during the World Cup. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to end simply at awareness,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe want to make sure that young people have the tools to cope with depression, anxiety, stress, and the very bad days, when it feels like the weight of the world is on their shoulders, and it can never get better.\u201d Smith spoke to reporters on Wednesday and said she is still affected by Meyer\u2019s death. \u201cAnytime I talk about Katie, it\u2019s obviously emotional, and then just with everything coming out today, it kind of brings all those feelings back to the surface,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m in a place where I can talk about it and talk about Katie in a really positive light, and it brings me more happiness. \u201cBut obviously, yeah, anytime it\u2019s all over social media, it\u2019s tough to see, and it kind of just reminds you. But I think what we put out and The Players Tribune by Naomi, it was really cool and really good to read, and everything that we do is now for Katie, so it means a lot. But yeah, obviously, it\u2019s a tough thing to talk about.\u201d The forward added that she has taken steps in her own life to improve her mental health. \u201cFor me, deleting Twitter, the best thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNo idea what\u2019s happening. But I think just kind of balancing; we did all these shoots and partnerships and stuff months ago, and it\u2019s all coming out now, and it\u2019s a lot and it\u2019s like something new every day. So trying to just push that aside and focus on what we are here to do, and that\u2019s to play soccer in one World Cup, and just finding that balance I think is super important.\u201d In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

            "date": "2023-07-16T23:01:13Z",
            "content": "A fifth of young women who have sought help for their mental health say they were told they were being \u201cdramatic\u201d, research shows. The survey also found that 27% of those who had spoken up about a mental health crisis over the past five years were told their issues could be hormonal. Recent ONS statistics showed suicide rates among women under the age of 25 in the UK are increasing and stand at one every two days. Mental health charities and campaigners say this is in part because stereotypes about women mean that when they seek help, their feelings and symptoms are often not seen or are dismissed. The YouGov survey, commissioned by the suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm), asked more than 2,000 women about their experiences when speaking up about a mental health crisis such as panic attacks or an episode of psychosis. It found that many women did not feel they were taken seriously when they attempted to seek help. A third said they were asked if they were \u201coverthinking things\u201d and 20% were asked if they were on their period. The survey found that 22% of the women feared being seen as \u201cattention-seeking\u201d. Simon Gunning, Calm\u2019s chief executive, said of the suicide statistics for young women: \u201cThese are shocking and serve as a stark reminder that we need to do more to protect young people and make suicide prevention a national priority. \u201cOur research shows that even when they do speak up, young women\u2019s feelings and symptoms are frequently dismissed and ignored \u2013 often disregarded as over-emotional, hormonal or attention-seeking. These damaging preconceptions are leaving young women unheard and unsupported and lives are at risk like never before.\u201d He added: \u201cWe must take immediate action and strive to overcome the stigma that hinders women from receiving the recognition they deserve during times of crisis. By providing them with the necessary support, we can ensure that no woman has to face her struggles alone.\u201d The charity cited some of the leading factors of mental health crises in women aged 18-34 as body image, loneliness, relationship issues, money worries and comparing themselves to others on social media. Prof Louis Appleby, a government adviser on suicide prevention, said: \u201cSuicide in young women is a national priority. Although the rate is not high compared to other groups, there has been a marked rise over the last decade or so. The causes are likely to be complex \u2013 including mental ill-health, abuse, online experience \u2013 and prevention too has to be wide-ranging. It\u2019s a reminder that suicide is constantly changing and we must be vigilant.\u201d To highlight the rising rates of female suicide in the UK, Calm teamed up with the England footballer Fran Kirby who stars in a short film that aims to highlight how women can feel invisible when they seek help. Kirby said she wanted to help shine a light on the issue of suicide. \u201cLike any team, we all have our part to play in making sure young women feel seen when they reach out,\u201d she said. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "date": "2023-07-12T00:00:01Z",
            "content": "Victoria\u2019s mental health complaints body is fighting an order by the state\u2019s information watchdog to release secret recommendations about improving mental health services. The state\u2019s Mental Health Complaints Commissioner has argued releasing the recommendations could indirectly identify consumers. But mental health advocates and consumers say the recommendations can help improve service\u2019s care and shine a light on human rights breaches that a landmark royal commission found were systemic in the sector. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Nicole Lee, who submitted a complaint to the MHCC in 2021 over her treatment in a public mental health facility, said releasing the recommendations would benefit consumers. \u201cHaving them released gives us a sense of transparency and is a way of rebuilding trust in a service that has to date not worked for us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact they\u2019re fighting to not release it makes us more concerned about what those recommendations actually are and [whether they will] actually solve the problem. It\u2019s concerning.\u201d Last year, Simon Katterl, a human rights and mental health advocate, applied to the MHCC under freedom of information laws seeking the recommendations made to mental health services between 2015 and 2020. The MHCC would not release those recommendations due to privacy provisions in the state\u2019s mental health and freedom of information legislation, in a decision rejected by the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner (Ovic) in May. The MHCC had argued the information could indirectly identify a consumer, including through the circumstances of their complaint. \u201cIf the fullness, accuracy and quality of information provided is impaired, it could have an adverse impact in the administration of the [Mental Health] Act,\u201d the MHCC said, according to the OVIC decision. \u201cIt may impede the MHCC in properly performing its statutory functions, including to endeavour to resolve complaints in a timely manner using formal and informal dispute resolution\u201d It also said health agencies provide information to the commissioner in confidence. But the Ovic said the documents should be partially released under FoI laws. Joanne Kummrow, the public access deputy commissioner at Ovic, found \u201cpublic interest weighs in favour of disclosure as it demonstrates how the agency is carrying out its functions\u201d. The MHCC is appealing against the decision, with the matter to come before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal next month.. Katterl said the recommendations would help the public understand where further improvements were needed in the mental health sector, and where work was already under way. \u201cThis information is essential to enhance human rights in the mental health system, eliminate seclusion and restraint, and reduce compulsory treatment,\u201d he said. The opposition\u2019s mental health spokesperson, Emma Kealy, said the MHCC\u2019s decision did not align with the recommendations of a Victorian royal commission into the sector, made in 2021, to increase transparency. \u201cMental health workers are doing their best to deliver the care that Victorians need and deserve, but Labor is failing these workers by ignoring the royal commission\u2019s priority recommendations around workforce and increased transparency around Victoria\u2019s mental health crisis,\u201d she said. The royal commission recommended that a new mental health and wellbeing commission (MHWC) be established. That body, which will absorb the MHCC, is due to begin work in earnest on 1 September. The inquiry recommended that the body\u2019s handling of complaints \u201cmeet[s] the needs of consumers, families, carers and supporters\u201d. It said it should record, report and publish service-level complaints and \u201cother relevant data and information.\u201d The Victorian Greens\u2019 mental health spokesperson, Dr Tim Read, said disclosing issues identified in the mental health sector demonstrated the government\u2019s commitment to improvement. \u201cTrying to suppress this stuff doesn\u2019t fill anyone with confidence that effort is being made to fix the problem,\u201d he said. Read said confidentiality was vital but it should be possible to report recommendations in a way that does not breach privacy. \u201cIf they say it can\u2019t be done, then they\u2019re not trying hard enough.\u201d The MHWC\u2019s chair, Treasure Jennings, said transparency was a core value. \u201cWe considered the need for transparency against the need to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the complaint-handling process and released the majority of the data requested under this application with some redactions,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen consumers and carers make a confidential complaint to us, often about very sensitive matters, they have an expectation to privacy which we have a duty to protect.\u201d Jennings said even with identifying details removed, an individual may be able to recognise their own case or be identified by others, which could have \u201cunintended consequences\u201d."

            "date": "2023-07-14T18:18:35Z",
            "content": "The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association has been urged to do more to prevent addictions and mental health problems from escalating after Dele Alli, the Everton midfielder, spoke out about his addiction to sleeping pills. Clarke Carlisle, a former chairman of the PFA who now works as a mental health consultant, said: \u201cPFA intervention only comes on request. It\u2019s a reactive measure. So invariably, they only get involved when players are having problems. And they\u2019re in like crisis mode or disaster recovery.\u201d Carlisle, a former Burnley defender who faced his own mental health struggles as a player, said prescription addiction was a \u201cgrowing issue\u201d and added: \u201cThere\u2019s a responsibility on the clubs because they are the employers.\u201d He said a team of PFA representatives should be available daily at professional clubs to respond to players\u2019 wellbeing and mental health needs and be separate from their coaching team. \u201cThe PFA is the players\u2019 union, they need to ensure that they can increase their capacity to be proactive on these issues. \u201cI think their relationship with clubs and with the leagues needs to be on a far more interactive level, where they can be present on a daily basis so that they can identify the various signs and signals that players are entering into any kind of behaviours that are going to be detrimental to them.\u201d Carlisle said increasing numbers of late matches made it harder for footballers to rest between games. \u201cTrying to fit in with the media schedule means there are a lot of evening fixtures and that exacerbates the problem,\u201d Carlisle said. He also said that the narrowing margin for success at elite level encouraged players to maximise sleep. \u201cIf you can find anything that gives you that extra 0.1% when it comes to recuperating and being able to apply yourself to your training, then it will be utilised because the benefits to [you and your club] professionally and financially are so huge. And that exacerbates issues like this.\u201d Dele revealed his addiction to sleeping pills as an adult as part of a raw interview about the impact of his traumatic childhood. Speaking to Gary Neville on The Overlap, the 27-year-old said he spent six weeks in a rehab facility in the USA for his mental health. Dele said: \u201cI got addicted to sleeping tablets and it\u2019s probably a problem that not only I have. I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s going around more than people realise in football.\u201d The PFA said it is growing its wellbeing team, which works with players every day and proactively goes into clubs to provide mental health workshops. The union is understood to consider having representatives within all clubs impractical, since it would require an enormous amount of very specialist staff as well as easy access to clubs. It said players had increasingly been coming forward with concerns about addiction to prescription medication, typically painkillers and sleeping pills. Dr Michael Bennett, head of player wellbeing at the PFA, said the organisation regularly supported members who requested help for drug dependency, including sleeping pills.\u201cWe know there are many reasons why a player may begin to use sleeping tablets. It is common for players to struggle to sleep after night games as they find that it often takes time, both mentally and physically, to \u2018come down\u2019.\u201d Bennett said frequent travel across time zones and personal stress could also be a factor, adding: \u201cEven administered in small doses, prescription medications can be habit-forming. If players are using sleeping tablets or any other prescription medication and are concerned that they may have developed a dependency, we encourage them to speak confidentially with the PFA and access the support we offer. Help is available.\u201d Jon Holmes, the sports agent who has represented many Premier League players, including Gary Lineker, said footballers were under greater pressure mentally than previous generations, which could feed into trouble sleeping. \u201cThe attention and the social media builds up that pressure, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect they are subjected to much greater attention.\u201d Gary Bloom, the Oxford United psychotherapist, said: \u201cAddiction to sleeping tablets is widespread, much more than people realise.\u201d Bloom told the BBC World Service: \u201cThere is also widespread use of caffeine stimulants for matches. Players are pretty wired during games because they want to give themselves a legal buzz for when they are playing \u2013 but then they cannot get to sleep at night. They are therefore prescribed sleeping tablets and the cycle goes on.\u201d"

            "title": "The downfall of Kiri Allan: New Zealand wrestles with mental health debate ",
            "date": "2023-07-28T20:00:19Z",
            "content": "It was an abrupt end to the political career of a rising star: Kiri Allan \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s justice minister and tipped by many to one day lead the country \u2013 first quit as a minister then said she would not seek re-election, after she was charged with careless driving following a car crash and amid weeks of news reports about her mental health. Her sudden departure has prompted questions in New Zealand about the toll of working at parliament on politicians\u2019 wellbeing. It also provoked fraught and uncertain debate about how to discuss the mental health struggles of public figures \u2013 particularly those of a senior cabinet minister, three months before a national election. Allan allegedly crashed her car into a parked vehicle in Wellington, New Zealand\u2019s capital, on Sunday night, and also failed a breath alcohol test \u2013 but not at the level of a criminal charge, receiving instead an infringement notice. She had recently returned to work after divulging she had briefly taken leave for mental health reasons. News of the episode was first met with concern and well-wishes, including from Allan\u2019s political opponents, in a country that prides itself on social progressivism across the political spectrum and where the public has traditionally declared a disinterest in politicians\u2019 private lives. \u201cI\u2019ve found what has gone on over the last few days for her really distressing,\u201d said Todd Muller, a National party lawmaker, on Monday. Muller quit as leader of his party in 2020 after 53 days in the job, later explaining he had experienced panic attacks \u2013 a revelation that was praised on both sides of the aisle. Chlo\u00eb Swarbrick, of the Green party \u2013 who has spoken publicly about having depression and ADHD \u2013 cited multiple reviews of parliament\u2019s culture that had concluded the \u201cenvironment doesn\u2019t get the best out of people\u201d. \u201cParliament is not an easy or forgiving place, and sadly it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Gareth Hughes, a former Green party lawmaker, wrote in the Post this week. Hughes said he had been \u201cdepressed, stressed\u201d and lonely during his last term in office. He added: \u201cPoliticians are generously rewarded but there\u2019s a real mental health cost to pay.\u201d On Tuesday, Allan wrote on Instagram that she would not contest her seat at October\u2019s election, although she did not rule out a return to politics. \u201cI am so, so sorry,\u201d she said, referring to the \u201canger towards myself\u201d and \u201cremorse\u201d she felt. \u2018I believed she was OK\u2019 Allan\u2019s resignation followed a recent reversal of fortunes for a lawmaker who swiftly attained a high public profile with down-to-earth remarks and a quick wit after she entered parliament in 2017. In March 2021, Allan \u2013 as civil defence minister \u2013 drew praise for her management of a nationwide tsunami threat, and later revealed she had received a diagnosis of stage 3 cervical cancer on the same day. Then prime minister Jacinda Ardern referred to her as \u201cremarkable\u201d. Allan declared she was cancer-free in December 2021. The tone of headlines had changed recently. In April, Allan was forced to apologise after a speech she made at the farewell function for her then-fianc\u00e9e \u2013 a reporter at New Zealand\u2019s national public broadcaster, which is government-funded \u2013 in which she was critical that her partner had been passed over for promotion. In June, Allan wrote on Instagram that she had been \u201creally struggling with mental health and wellness\u201d and had taken time off work. \u201cAfter taking some time out I believed she was OK and was assured by her she was,\u201d Hipkins said on Monday. In a statement, he highlighted Allan\u2019s \u201cextreme emotional distress\u201d at the time of the car crash \u2013 while also calling her actions \u201cindefensible\u201d. The incident was \u201cevidence there are not always quick fixes when it comes to mental health.\u201d Personal v political Allan\u2019s stature and the proximity of October\u2019s election appeared to present a dilemma for lawmakers about how they should respond to her downfall. It culminated in extraordinary scenes in parliament on Tuesday as lawmakers debated the resignation in speeches that were at times deeply personal about Allan \u2013 and at others highly partisan about the perceived failures of her government. After a volatile year in politics, polls show a tight contest between the two major parties ahead of October\u2019s election, and it is not clear how the former justice minister\u2019s departure might affect it. Christopher Luxon, the leader of the opposition and centre-right National party, decried Hipkins\u2019 management of the situation. \u201cWe want support for Kiri, that\u2019s absolutely important,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut we also need to say look, this is a government, that again, yet again, we\u2019re having another set of conversations for the rest of the week when the New Zealand people want us focused on them, not focused on themselves which is what this government is doing.\u201d By Tuesday, the lure of making Allan\u2019s predicament a point of politics appeared to have grown and David Seymour, the leader of the libertarian ACT party, requested an urgent debate on her resignation in parliament. \u201cWhile it is a human tragedy, it is also the case that it comes after a cascade of missteps and administrative bungles by this government,\u201d Seymour told lawmakers. Allan\u2019s political colleagues on the left derided the discussion. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a workplace anywhere else in the country where someone clearly makes a mistake, they acknowledge their mental health challenges and then there is a discussion and a debate that is televised on TV for the whole country to see,\u201d said Megan Woods, a Labour cabinet minister. Rawiri Waititi, the co-leader of Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, was scornful of his opponents\u2019 approach to the episode, listing names of M\u0101ori female lawmakers \u2013 Allan among them \u2013 who he said had received disproportionate criticism for their actions. \u201cInstead what we should be debating is the institution of parliament that continues to uphold a misogynistic culture that was imposed by British men,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone sitting in this house is responsible for upholding that culture.\u201d The Green party\u2019s Swarbrick told 1News she hoped the Allan incident \u201cspurs some greater and broader reflections on how to build an environment that\u2019s more sustainable and conducive to humanity\u201d."

The earlier release had said the economy shrank in the last quarter of 2022 and in the first of this year, but the revised figures showed 0% growth in January to March instead of a contraction. Financial markets rose on the back of the positive figures, which showed the eurozone\u2019s consumers and firms had been more resilient in dealing with rising interest rates than many policymakers had forecast. The German stock market continued a streak of gains that pushed values to an all-time high, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.5% to touch fresh 15-year highs, lifted by the state-controlled defence and aerospace group Leonardo. However, analysts warned that the better-than-expected recovery across the single currency bloc meant the European Central Bank (ECB) was likely to increase interest rates further in the autumn. Claus Vistesen, the chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThis won\u2019t be welcome news in Frankfurt, and will help the hawks\u2019 cause. \u201cCoupled with scary-looking second-quarter wage data, we still think that the ECB hawks will successfully push for one final hike in September, before the data turn decisively against them. This is a close call.\u201d The ECB has sought to calm economic growth and reduce inflation with a series of interest rate rises, following in the footsteps of the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England. Last week, the ECB governor, Christine Lagarde, said further increases were possible after she announced a further 0.25 percentage point increase, adding that the central bank would be \u201cdata dependent\u201d as it considered its next policy move. Pushpin Singh, a senior economist at the consultancy CEBR, said: \u201cAn upward revision to past data means that the eurozone avoided a technical recession across the final quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023.\u201d He added that a big bounce in growth was unlikely, while the currency bloc \u201ccontinues to be affected by elevated inflation and the ECB\u2019s response of higher interest rates\u201d which would \u201cdrag on growth in the near-term\u201d, he said, forecasting a modest expansion in eurozone GDP this year of 0.8%, down from 3.5% in 2022. Marc de Muizon, a senior European analyst at Deutsche Bank Research, said the underlying picture was less rosy and the ECB was likely to be more circumspect before raising borrowing costs again. Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING, said the differences between countries were large in terms of performance, adding to the difficulties for the ECB. \u201cThe German and Italian economies continue to suffer, in part because their manufacturing sectors are larger and demand for goods remains in contraction. Germany saw flat GDP growth quarter on quarter after two quarters of negative growth, while Italy dipped back to -0.3%,\u201d Colijn said. \u201cOn the other hand, France and Spain continued to perform well. French GDP growth accelerated from 0.1 to 0.5%. Spain saw growth decelerate from 0.5 to 0.4%.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-18T07:00:48Z",
            "content": "\u2018I speak as a healthcare CEO, but also as a nature lover and as a grandfather,\u201d Pascal Soriot, chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker, AstraZeneca, told King Charles III and a select audience during London Climate Week at an event in the gothic grandeur of Guildhall. While the Covid-19 pandemic led to the loss of 7 million lives globally, Soriot says that the climate crisis and pollution \u201ccost us 7 million to 9 million lives every year\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting us all through respiratory diseases, cancers, health conditions, infectious diseases \u2026 This crisis is actually a health crisis.\u201d The 64-year-old Frenchman, who has made Australia his home, says the 2019 bushfires there showed him the devastating effects of global heating and spurred him into action: \u201cEven though the bushfires were a fair distance from Sydney, the city was engulfed in smoke.\u201d He has brought together healthcare leaders and pharmaceutical executives in a taskforce for the Sustainable Markets Initiative, initially convened by the king, to speed up the private sector\u2019s zero carbon efforts. Soriot is better known for bringing the first not-for-profit Covid vaccine to the world in late 2020, after AstraZeneca \u2013 until then not a leading vaccine maker \u2013 teamed up with Oxford University to develop one of the first jabs against the virus. \u201cWhen [AstraZeneca\u2019s R&amp;D chief] Mene Pangalos and I said \u2018Let\u2019s do this vaccine at no profit,\u2019 a lot of people in the company could have told me and Mene: \u2018We don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s too risky, it\u2019s complicated\u2019,\u201d Soriot says. \u201cI didn\u2019t get that comment a single time. It\u2019s been a massive effort. A few people suffered personally from working hard \u2026 We\u2019ve got a great culture, a great team. It\u2019s probably what I\u2019m most happy with.\u201d He was knighted last year for his and the company\u2019s work during the pandemic. AstraZeneca suffered bad publicity about side-effects and production delays, and chose not to re-engineer its jab as a booster against new virus strains, unlike rivals. A study by health data firm Airfinity estimates vaccine saved 6.3 million lives, versus 5.9 million for the higher-priced Pfizer/BioNTech jab. As the use of its Covid jab declines, there have been suggestions that AstraZeneca may sell its vaccines and immune therapies business. Soriot says this will depend on \u201cwhether the technologies [we] work on are successful or not\u201d. Its Covid antibody treatment for people with weak immune systems, Evusheld, was a success initially but, like rival drugs, was found not to work against new virus variants in January. It has since been tweaked, and Soriot is confident that the new version works against all known variants of concern. It could be made available by the end of the year. He reveals that the firm is also working on an antibody for microbial infections, at a time when superbugs \u2013 drug-resistant infections \u2013 are on the rise. Born in the Paris suburbs \u2013 where he has said he got into street fights and learned about loyalty \u2013 Soriot trained and worked as a horse vet. \u201cI love horses, always have since I was a child, and decided I would be a vet when I was five years old,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother tried to convince me to be a doctor.\u201d He later decided to combine his interests in biology and business, and began a career in the pharmaceutical industry in Australia in 1986, at the French firm Roussel Uclaf. He also worked in New Zealand, Japan, America and Switzerland, with senior roles at Aventis, Genentech and Roche. AstraZeneca is reportedly drafting plans to spin off its sizeable China business and list it in Hong Kong or Shanghai to shield the company from worsening geopolitical tensions. Soriot refuses to comment on \u201crumours\u201d but says: \u201cOver the years we\u2019ve always looked at all sorts of things \u2026 but 90%, 95% of what we study never happens.\u201d \u201cI know our industry is not affected by these tensions today,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe our industry would be directly affected unless the tensions become really, really very bad. But medicines are never under sanction.\u201d He rejects the idea that a separately listed Chinese business would get new drugs approved more quickly. When Soriot joined from Roche in 2012 and took over as chief executive from David Brennan \u2013 who was ousted over AstraZeneca\u2019s thin pipeline of new medicines \u2013 the firm was the \u201csick man\u201d of the industry. Little over a year later, its bigger US rival, Pfizer, ambushed the firm with a hostile takeover bid. In the battle to keep AstraZeneca independent \u2013 which was waged in public \u2013 Soriot claimed that executing a merger with cost savings could delay life-saving cancer medicines and ultimately cost lives. He had been through a major integration himself, as chief executive of Genentech, after the US biotech firm was bought by Swiss giant Roche for $46.8bn in 2009, bringing together \u201ctwo companies [that] had very different cultures\u201d. Pfizer walked away from its \u00a369bn takeover bid in May 2014, but Soriot then had to deliver on an ambitious revenue pledge. It has been a decade of hard graft since \u2013 with Soriot earning nearly \u00a3120m in the process \u2013 and the company has doubled in size in the last five years. AstraZeneca made a series of smart bets on cancer treatments and other medicines, including Lynparza. Work on the ovarian and prostate cancer drug, now a $2.6bn-a-year sales blockbuster, had been suspended amid doubts from the commercial team, but Soriot decided to \u201ctake a risk\u201d and revive it after consulting leading oncologist, Jos\u00e9 Baselga, who would later join the firm. Under Soriot, the firm ramped up research spending, to $9.8bn (\u00a37.4bn) last year, and restructured R&amp;D into smaller, more autonomous teams akin to healthcare startups. The firm aims to deliver at least 15 new medicines by 2030. He took the decision to close the renowned research centre in Alderley Park in Cheshire, cut a tenth of the workforce and build a new \u00a31bn HQ in Cambridge to bring all scientists under one roof, as part of Europe\u2019s biggest life sciences cluster. AstraZeneca is now the UK\u2019s biggest listed company, with a market value of \u00a3163bn \u2013 which also puts it ahead of New York-listed Pfizer at $203.6bn (\u00a3155bn) \u2013 even after nearly \u00a314bn was wiped off Astra\u2019s value over concerns that a new lung cancer drug may not be as successful as hoped. After almost jumping ship to Israel-based Teva in 2017, Soriot is often asked how long he will stay. \u201cI can keep doing this job for many years,\u201d he said last summer. Today, he says: \u201cThe exciting aspect of our industry is that, not only do we help people by bringing them medicines that can either cure them or help them live with their disease, but the other exciting piece is that technology and science are evolving constantly. So there\u2019s always something new happening, so you never get bored. I\u2019m not bored.\u201d CV Age 64 Family Married with two children and one grandson.

            "date": "2023-07-09T23:01:01Z",
            "content": "British businesses are slowing down hiring just as the number of people looking for work rises, according to data that suggested \u201clingering uncertainty\u201d over the economic outlook. The availability of candidates for new jobs rose in June at the sharpest rate since the height of the UK\u2019s coronavirus restrictions in December 2020, according to the latest report on jobs by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and KPMG. The number of people placed in permanent jobs by recruitment agencies also fell, and wage growth dropped to its weakest rate in more than two years in June. It comes before UK labour market data on Tuesday, which is forecast by economists to show unemployment remaining at 3.8%, still near four-decade lows. However, economists are watching keenly for signs of weakening growth. The Bank of England has raised interest rates rapidly from 0.1% in late 2021 to 5%. Financial markets have priced in further rises in the coming months as the Bank attempts to drive down inflation, which has remained stubbornly high. Claire Warnes, a partner at KPMG UK, said: \u201cThe sharp upturn in candidate availability this month \u2013 the highest for two and a half years \u2013 is a big concern for the economy, reflecting the effects of a sustained slowdown in recruitment along with increasing job losses across many sectors. She said it appeared that employers were favouring temporary hiring over permanent jobs because of \u201clingering economic uncertainty\u201d.\u201d Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, whose members were polled, said it was likely that more people were looking for new jobs in reaction to rising inflation, as well as a higher number of job losses. He said it was \u201cno surprise, therefore, that the rate at which wages are rising has dropped again\u201d. Yet Carberry added that it was a mixed picture, given continued low unemployment. \u201cDespite these trends, the labour market remains very tight,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still broad skills shortages, with accountancy, construction, teaching and nursing among those sectors struggling to find and retain workers. \u201cThe growth in vacancies for temps and permanent staff in hotels and catering and blue-collar jobs, and for temp positions in retail, suggest businesses anticipate that people are still prepared to spend their wages on goods and services despite the fall in their purchasing power and the wider cost of living crisis.\u201d The cost of living crisis has added to pressures on households\u2019 spending power. Rest Less, a provider of jobs listings and advice to over-50s, said the hit to incomes may have increased the number of women planning to work beyond retirement age. Its analysis of UK government statistics found that 44% of women aged between 50 and 65 planned to either stay in work on their existing hours or reduced hours. Stuart Lewis, chief executive of Rest Less, said: \u201cNearly half of women aged 50-65 said they planned to continue working in some capacity after reaching state pension age \u2013 a number that is likely to have risen even further given the subsequent cost of living crisis.\u201d"

            "content": "Global oil demand will reach an all-time high this year, but \u201cpersistent macroeconomic headwinds\u201d mean it will not grow as quickly as had previously been expected, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said. The Paris-based global energy watchdog said that demand was expected to rise by 2.2m barrels a day in 2023, leading to an average of 102.1m barrels a day. But that prediction is 220,000 barrels a day lower than its previous expectations \u2013 the first time the agency has lowered its forecast for growth this year. China, boosted by surging petrochemical use, will account for 70% of global gains after it reopened its economy post-pandemic, the IEA\u2019s monthly oil market report said. However, the country\u2019s recovery has got off to a slow start and so far \u201cfailed to extend beyond travel and services, with its economic recovery losing steam after the bounce earlier in the year\u201d, the report added. The IEA said that consumption in developed countries and wider Europe remains anaemic, and imports to African countries had declined due to high domestic fuel prices after subsidies were removed. \u201cPersistent macroeconomic headwinds, apparent in a deepening manufacturing slump, have led us to revise our 2023 growth estimate lower for the first time this year\u201d, the report said. It added: \u201cWorld oil demand is coming under pressure from the challenging economic environment, not least because of the dramatic tightening of monetary policy in many advanced and developing countries over the past 12 months.\u201d The IEA said that global oil inventories looked \u201crelatively comfortable\u201d and had recovered to their highest level since September 2021. China had its largest monthly increase in crude stocks in a year, fuelled by a significant rise in oil imports, which included heavily discounted barrels from Russian and Iran. The IEA said that oil demand growth was likely to halve next year to 1.1m barrels a day. Last month, the IEA said that the declining global economy and push for green energy meant that the peak for demand in oil was \u201cin sight\u201d and could come before the end of the decade. The IEA\u2019s executive director, Fatih Birol, said: \u201cThe shift to a clean energy economy is picking up pace, with a peak in global oil demand in sight before the end of this decade as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-29T17:00:00Z",
            "content": "This summer has been defined by two crises: the continuing, painful cost of living crisis afflicting millions in our country and the climate crisis, which is playing out in horrifying ways across the world. The Conservative party is saying we can\u2019t tackle both these crises together \u2013 and is, in fact, tackling neither. The Conservatives are wrong. Tackling both these crises goes hand in hand. That\u2019s what Labour\u2019s green prosperity plan will do \u2013 cutting energy bills, creating good jobs, delivering energy security and providing climate leadership for our country. To listen to the Conservatives, you might think the status quo is serving us well. It isn\u2019t. Putin\u2019s strangulation of international fossil fuel markets has sent energy bills soaring, plunged countries like ours into the deepest cost of living crisis in memory and stoked inflation to further pile the pain on to families and businesses. The UK has been the worst affected country in western Europe. We have been so exposed because 13 years of failed Conservative energy policy has left us so dependent on fossil fuel markets. The Conservatives\u2019 failure is made worse by the fact that there is a clear answer staring us in the face: clean, cheap, low-carbon power, made in Britain. Over the last decade, the costs of solar energy have fallen 89% and wind energy has dropped by 60%. As a result, renewables are significantly cheaper than fossil fuels \u2013 last summer they were nine times cheaper. That\u2019s why the Tories\u2019 nonsensical ban on onshore wind in England, in place since 2015, means energy bills are now \u00a3180 higher for every family in the country, because that onshore wind has been substituted by expensive gas. The fact that a managed transition away from fossil fuels is also crucial to tackling the climate crisis means we can cut costs for families while also taking the urgent action we need to drive to net zero. For the scientists at the UN, who have warned this week that the \u201cera of global boiling\u201d has arrived, and the economists at the Office for Budget Responsibility, who say delaying action by a decade doubles its costs, acting now is the economic, rational and blindingly obvious choice. That\u2019s why the centrepiece of Labour\u2019s mission on climate and energy is to provide all of our power from zero carbon sources by 2030. It will cut bills by \u00a393bn over the coming years \u2013 or an average of \u00a3400 a year for every household in the country. The Tory plan to stay on fossil fuels as long as possible is a recipe for higher bills, energy insecurity and deepening climate disaster. Why would we possibly choose this path? It is not just in energy where taking action will lower costs. The lifetime costs of an electric car are already lower than those of a petrol or diesel vehicle. And by 2027, the forecasts are that the upfront cost of an electric car will be lower than the fossil fuel equivalent. So it\u2019s right to stick with the 2030 phase-out date for new petrol and diesel cars \u2013 for the environment and for lowering costs. Of course, in some areas, unleashing the benefits of moving away from fossil fuels does require investment. As we make the transition to cleaner, cheaper alternatives, the vital principle is that individuals or sectors should not be left to bear the transition costs on their own. This is one of the purposes of our green prosperity plan, the investment ramping up to \u00a328bn a year in the second half of the parliament. Take energy efficiency. We do need to invest. Instead of leaving families to waste money on cold, draughty homes, as the Conservatives have, our warm homes plan will bring up to a good standard the 19m homes that need it. This is as close to a policy no-brainer as you can get; cutting energy bills for families across the country, creating thousands of good jobs for construction workers and electricians, tackling fuel poverty and providing climate leadership. A Labour government will act to make the transition work to the benefit of all, in particular lower- and middle-income families. We will not leave workers on their own either, but will protect them through this period of change. This is where the Conservatives\u2019 negligence is most acute. They won\u2019t invest to make this transition work for working people, in areas such as energy efficiency or helping to fund a car scrappage scheme in London, and they are content to sit on the sidelines as investment in green industries pours into the US and Europe. But there is no solution to the cost of living crisis without improving the number of well-paid, good jobs in our economy. That\u2019s why our national wealth fund will invest in boosting our ports, automotive and steel industries and GB Energy, our publicly owned energy-generation company will drive jobs in the UK. While Labour focuses on lower bills and good jobs, the Tories have decided to double down on their disastrous mistakes \u2013 lurching desperately towards a culture war on climate, seeking to upend the climate consensus of the last 15 years. This will not work; as poll after poll reiterates, the vast majority of the British people, in towns and cities across the country, are united in their desire for action on the climate crisis and action on the cost of living. The stakes at the next election could not be higher. Together, Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves and I have spent three years painstakingly devising an ambitious plan to tackle the climate and cost of living crisis that is equal to the scale of the twin crises we face. It will mean lower bills, more jobs, energy security and climate leadership once again. That is what we will offer at the next general election. Ed Miliband is shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero"

            "date": "2023-07-05T05:58:58Z",
            "content": "As we wait for Thames Water\u2019s crew of international investors to decide if they want to inject more capital into their ailing and over-borrowed asset, it is hard to escape the thought that a recapitalisation \u2013 if it\u2019s doable \u2013 would have happened by now if only the company were listed on the stock market. In essence, what\u2019s needed at Thames, if the owners wish to save it, is a large rights issue or debt-for-equity swap. The stock market tends to be good at such exercises. It cuts to the chase. Recall the crisis in the outsourcing sector a decade ago, which has parallels with water in terms of scandal (with overcharging, rather than the sewage) and loss of confidence on the part of government and the outside world. The stock market was admirably brutal with companies such as Serco: it whacked the share price down 90%, thereby inflicting necessary pain on owners; it forced management change; then it became possible to raise funds. By contrast, everything moves in slow motion in the murky world of non-quoted water companies. At Thames, the current dance started in June last year when the company said its owners \u2013 led by Omers, a Canadian pension fund, and the UK\u2019s Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) \u2013 would put in an extra \u00a31.5bn of capital. Except it was only a plan to put in more money. The first \u00a3500m arrived only in March this year. The other \u00a31bn was billed as \u201csubject to certain conditions\u201d, and the process grinds on as the likely numbers get bigger. Thus we have the spectacle of USS telling the FT that it backs a turnaround plan subject to \u201can appropriate regulatory environment\u201d, whatever that means, while other members of the consortium say nothing. It is ownership by investment committee. Or, rather, ownership by several investment committees scattered around the globe with different risk appetites. It doesn\u2019t work. Yes, the financial engineers of Macquarie, who \u201chollowed out\u201d Thames and exited in 2017, are mostly to blame. But indecision seems to reign supreme among the infrastructure investors who supposedly signed up to haul Thames out of the gutter. Regulator Ofwat\u2019s ability to force events seems extremely limited. But leisurely timeframes are par for the course. Extracting these companies from the lobster pot of over-leverage \u2013 the product of the absurd buyout boom of 2006-2008 that should never have been allowed \u2013 has been a regulatory mission for about a decade. Southern Water had to be threatened with \u201cvirtual special administration\u201d, as rating agency Moody\u2019s put it, before its disengaged financial owners, led by funds advised by JP Morgan and UBS, could be forced to accept a loss and sell to a new owner with new capital in 2021 (which, grimly, turned out to be Macquarie). Or look at Yorkshire Water. Last October, Ofwat ruled the company was in breach of its licence obligations because \u00a3940m-worth of inter-company loans (approved by the regulator in 2008 and 2009) had subsequently been shuffled within the capital structure of the broader Kelda group. But Yorkshire was given until 2027 \u2013 almost half a decade \u2013 to get itself into compliance in stages. The first \u00a3400m unwind happened only last week. Once again, this column concludes that the current privatised water system, if it is to survive, would work better if the companies had to have a stock market listing. Accountability and transparency are better. Is it a coincidence that Southern and Thames, the duo that have copped the heaviest fines for environmental offences over the years, were also the most financially over-extended? Nobody thinks that. And one strongly suspects that Severn Trent and United Utilities have got themselves to the top of the environment performance tables because they are members of the FTSE 100 index and their boards of directors cannot play \u201cround-tripping\u201d games with debt. They are obliged to comply with regulatory norms of gearing of 60%-ish. The correlation isn\u2019t perfect because South West Water (Pennon), the only other member of the quoted club, has had a terrible pollution record recently. But it\u2019s close enough. In his book about his regulatory years, Sir Ian Byatt, chairman of Ofwat from privatisation to 2000 (so before the buyout excesses), noted that he appealed as early as 1996 for the licensed companies, as opposed to holding companies, to retain a listing of some form on the stock exchange. His intention was to prevent the leakage of dividends to non-regulated activities. \u201cMy plea went unheeded,\u201d he wrote. Or note last year\u2019s comments from Jonson Cox, chairman of Ofwat from 2012 until last year (and so the inheritor of the buyout madness). \u201cI regret there aren\u2019t more publicly listed companies because it gives real visibility,\u201d he told a House of Lords committee. Investment banks created skewed incentives and created \u201cthe predisposition of thinking of water companies as financial assets\u201d, he argued. None of which excuses past regulatory failures, but it ought to give the Labour party, which has ruled out renationalisation, a direction for a policy. Here\u2019s one idea: force the private owners to list at least 25% of the shares in their water companies on the London Stock Exchange, as advocated by voices as varied as Jonathan Ford, former FT leader writer and podcaster, and Will Hutton, advocate of \u201cpurposeful\u201d companies. It wouldn\u2019t be a cure-all, but it would be a step towards saner financing models and greater accountability, which is a bare-minimum requirement if customers are to be told to shoulder bigger bills. It would also give Labour something to say. Its current policy silence on water is embarrassing."

It reveals that Kwarteng went ahead with a package of tax cuts despite being told by the OBR that the economy was on course for a yearlong recession and that higher interest rates were pushing up the cost of servicing the UK\u2019s debts. The decision to withhold the OBR forecast contributed to the financial market jitters before an event that subsequently led to a run on the pound, sharply higher borrowing costs and a crisis in the UK pensions industry. Kwarteng was sacked by the prime minister, Liz Truss, three weeks after the mini-budget and after only 38 days as chancellor. \u201cThe economic outlook has worsened significantly since we last produced a forecast in March,\u201d the note says. \u201cHistorically high gas prices have already driven inflation to its highest level in 40 years and we expect inflation to rise even further over the next few months.\u201d Based on the assumption that there were no tax cuts or spending increases, the OBR report, obtained after the SNP MP Stuart McDonald put in a freedom of information request, predicted the sharpest fall in living standards in modern times. \u201cThe resulting sharp drop in real consumer spending in this forecast pushes the economy into a yearlong recession, with GDP falling from the fourth quarter of 2022 until the third quarter of 2023.\u201d The report also said borrowing in the five years from 2022-23 to 2026-27 was on course to be cumulatively \u00a3109bn higher than the OBR had predicted at the time of the March 2022 budget. In a letter to McDonald, the OBR\u2019s director, Richard Hughes, said the note was produced 18 days before Kwarteng\u2019s growth plan, hailed by the then chancellor as the biggest package of tax cuts in generations. The economic and fiscal forecasts did not reflect any of the measures in Kwarteng\u2019s statement or from Truss\u2019s energy support package. The OBR made its forecasts before the sharp fall in wholesale gas prices, on a lower peak for interest rates, and before the increase in taxes announced by Kwarteng\u2019s successor Jeremy Hunt in November last year. \u201cSo, relative to what has transpired, the draft forecasts described in the note are conditioned on more challenging wholesale gas prices, more favourable market interest rates, and less supportive near-term fiscal policy,\u201d Hughes said in his letter to the MP. In the six months following Kwarteng\u2019s mini-budget, the OBR has produced two separate economic and fiscal assessments for Kwarteng\u2019s successor, Jeremy Hunt, in which it has become less gloomy about the state of the economy. Its report in November 2022 predicted a 1.4% growth contraction in 2023, and by March it was forecasting a fall in output of 0.2%. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe document published reflects the OBR\u2019s preparatory work sent to the then chancellor on his first day in office. The draft forecast did not include any policies ultimately announced in the growth plan.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-11T15:00:38Z",
            "content": "A Conservative MP and former minister is listed in shareholder registers as personally owning stakes in companies worth nearly \u00a3500,000, raising questions about the effectiveness of the controversial parliamentary \u201cblind trust\u201d system used to buy the shares. Jonathan Djanogly, the MP for Huntingdon, holds shares in Lloyds Bank worth more than \u00a3180,000, has an investment worth \u00a3120,000 in the housebuilding company Persimmon and a stake worth almost \u00a380,000 in Sainsbury\u2019s. He has smaller stakes in six other companies including the energy supplier Centrica. The investments have come to light as part of a Guardian investigation into what are in effect secret shareholdings of MPs. Djanogly\u2019s current shareholdings have not been publicly declared in parliamentary registers because, he says, they are held in a blind trust, a key mechanism used by ministers to distance themselves from their financial interests. Blind trusts are used by nine ministers including by Rishi Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. They involve moving shares owned prior to ministerial office into a trust run by an independent fund manager, who handles the investments on behalf of the beneficiary. MPs do not have to declare shares held in blind trusts, and Djanogly said he had made \u201call appropriate declarations\u201d. He said he created the blind trust after he became a justice minister in 2010, and as a result none of the shares identified by the Guardian \u201cwere bought by me. Nor was the purchase nor my continued holding of them discussed between me and my managers.\u201d But the fact that Djanogly\u2019s holdings are listed in shareholder registers under his own name and at an address owned jointly with his father suggests the trust cannot be truly \u201cblind\u201d. Companies regularly correspond with their shareholders to provide information about shareholder meetings, dividend payments and performance updates. Djanogly did not dispute that the shares were in his name but said he did not pick up post from the property to which information about the shareholdings would have been sent. The findings raise questions about much-criticised blind trust arrangements and whether they truly protect ministers with personal assets and wealth from real and perceived conflicts of interest. There are no specific parliamentary or ministerial rules governing how a blind trust is set up and how one should be managed. The lack of clear guidelines means it is left to individual interpretation. Transparency campaigners have pointed out that a key flaw with blind trusts is that the beneficiaries have a degree of awareness about the assets that are in the trusts. At the very least they will be aware of what has gone into the trust at its creation. When an MP or minister holds shares in a blind trust, they do not need to publicly disclose their existence, even if they are over the \u00a370,000 threshold after which an MP is normally obliged to register them. Campaigners say this creates a transparency black hole. Richard Murphy, a professor of accounting practice at Sheffield University management school, told the Guardian: \u201cThe difficulties with the blind trust is it isn\u2019t publicly registered. We don\u2019t know who created it, who the trustee is, how the accountability works. \u201cTo exist as a blind trust we have to know it is properly functioning with appropriate Chinese walls between the beneficiary/settlor and the manager \u2026 But without that full disclosure of who is doing what, for who, how and when, we can\u2019t be sure the blind trust is effective. Knowing these things is critical if blind trusts are to continue to be a part of our political system.\u201d Djanogly registered shareholdings in FTSE 100 companies in the past including Barclays, Lloyds, Shell and Tesco in 2002. He kept his shares on his register of interests until 2010 when he became a minister and moved them into a blind trust. Dr Daniel Beizsley, a Spotlight on Corruption policy consultant, said: \u201cBlind trusts can only work if MPs are truly \u2018blind\u2019 to their contents. If MPs are able to track the performance of their financial interests from company disclosures then this is clearly not the case.\u201d Since last October, Djanogly has been on the public accounts committee. Any awareness by Djanogly of his shareholdings could risk a conflict of interest given that the committee scrutinises government expenditure and regularly deals with matters concerning commercial companies. For example, the committee is currently reviewing progress on the emergency services network, which is using network infrastructure from EE, part of BT Group. Djanogly has questioned officials working on the project. He has shares worth more than \u00a340,000 in the company. \u201cI maintain that I have made all appropriate declarations to the register of members\u2019 interests and the public accounts committee,\u201d he said. He added that he was \u201ctaking advice on what I do or do not need to declare\u201d now that he had been made aware of the fuller details of his financial interests."

            "date": "2023-07-31T13:02:25Z",
            "content": "The eurozone\u2019s economy has returned to growth after a long period of stagnation as inflation in the 20-member currency area continues to fall from last year\u2019s peak. Activity expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, while the inflation rate declined from 5.5% to 5.3% in July, said the EU statistics agency Eurostat. There was also an improvement to previous gross domestic product (GDP) data, revealing that a recession announced in June based on previous estimates had in fact been narrowly avoided. The earlier release had said the economy shrank in the last quarter of 2022 and in the first of this year, but the revised figures showed 0% growth in January to March instead of a contraction. Financial markets rose on the back of the positive figures, which showed the eurozone\u2019s consumers and firms had been more resilient in dealing with rising interest rates than many policymakers had forecast. The German stock market continued a streak of gains that pushed values to an all-time high, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.5% to touch fresh 15-year highs, lifted by the state-controlled defence and aerospace group Leonardo. However, analysts warned that the better-than-expected recovery across the single currency bloc meant the European Central Bank (ECB) was likely to increase interest rates further in the autumn. Claus Vistesen, the chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThis won\u2019t be welcome news in Frankfurt, and will help the hawks\u2019 cause. \u201cCoupled with scary-looking second-quarter wage data, we still think that the ECB hawks will successfully push for one final hike in September, before the data turn decisively against them. This is a close call.\u201d The ECB has sought to calm economic growth and reduce inflation with a series of interest rate rises, following in the footsteps of the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England. Last week, the ECB governor, Christine Lagarde, said further increases were possible after she announced a further 0.25 percentage point increase, adding that the central bank would be \u201cdata dependent\u201d as it considered its next policy move. Pushpin Singh, a senior economist at the consultancy CEBR, said: \u201cAn upward revision to past data means that the eurozone avoided a technical recession across the final quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023.\u201d He added that a big bounce in growth was unlikely, while the currency bloc \u201ccontinues to be affected by elevated inflation and the ECB\u2019s response of higher interest rates\u201d which would \u201cdrag on growth in the near-term\u201d, he said, forecasting a modest expansion in eurozone GDP this year of 0.8%, down from 3.5% in 2022. Marc de Muizon, a senior European analyst at Deutsche Bank Research, said the underlying picture was less rosy and the ECB was likely to be more circumspect before raising borrowing costs again. Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING, said the differences between countries were large in terms of performance, adding to the difficulties for the ECB. \u201cThe German and Italian economies continue to suffer, in part because their manufacturing sectors are larger and demand for goods remains in contraction. Germany saw flat GDP growth quarter on quarter after two quarters of negative growth, while Italy dipped back to -0.3%,\u201d Colijn said. \u201cOn the other hand, France and Spain continued to perform well. French GDP growth accelerated from 0.1 to 0.5%. Spain saw growth decelerate from 0.5 to 0.4%.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-26T01:32:08Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s inflation rate fell more than expected in the June quarter, increasing the likelihood the Reserve Bank will extend its interest rate pause next week. However, rents rose at their fastest quarterly pace in 35 years. The headline consumer price index for the April-June period was 6% higher than a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That compared with the 6.2% pace expected by economists and was down from 7% in the March quarter. Prices rose 0.8% for the June quarter alone, easing from 1.4% in the previous three months. The quarterly increase was the lowest since the September quarter of 2021. \u201cWhile prices continued to rise for most goods and services, there were some offsetting price falls this quarter including for domestic holiday travel and accommodation and automotive fuel,\u201d Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics, said. The trimmed mean, or underlying inflation rate that strips out more volatile price movements, came in at an annual pace of 5.9% and 0.9% for the quarter, the ABS said. Deloitte Access economics partner Stephen Smith said the latest inflation numbers were \u201cfurther evidence that the Reserve Bank has increased interest rates too far\u201d. \u201cThe Australian economy is softening dramatically, the pace of inflation has peaked and is moderating quickly, wage growth is not excessive and medium-term inflation expectations are not rising,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIn that context, there should be no further interest rate increases in Australia.\u201d The RBA wants inflation to continue to moderate towards is 2-3% annual rate by mid-2025 and has said it will keep increasing its cash rate until it is confident that trajectory will be maintained. The economy is sending mixed signals, with consumer and business confidence low or falling. Employers, though, were still adding jobs at a strong clip in June, leaving the jobless rate hovering near half-century lows. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s inflation numbers, the ASX\u2019s rates tracker indicated there was a slightly less than 50-50 chance the RBA would raise its interest rate 25 basis points when its board gathers on 1 August. Investors, though, dumped the Australian dollar and snapped up stocks in the immediate aftermath of the CPI data release. The dollar shed about a third of a US cent to trade at 67.38 US cents, while share prices jumped about 0.5% to be 0.7% higher for the day. If Australia\u2019s interest rates don\u2019t have to go higher, yield hunters will head elsewhere, while companies\u2019 profits will be buoyed if their borrowing costs don\u2019t rise further. Rents continued to be a major propellant for inflation, though, with rentals up 2.5% for the quarter alone and 6.7% for the year. International holiday travel and accommodation were also pricier, up 6.2%, with financial services 2.5% more costly. \u201cRents recorded the strongest quarterly rise since 1988, reflecting low vacancy rates amid a tight rental market,\u201d Marquardt said. \u201cRental price growth for flats continued to outpace the growth for houses.\u201d Food prices rose 1.6% for the quarter, matching the pace in the March quarter. Within that tally, meals out and takeaway foods were 1.7% more expensive, with fruit and vegetables up 2.4% and bread and cereal products gaining 2.9%. \u201cA shortage of potatoes due to wet weather in key growing regions late last year has continued to place pressure on prices for potato products, including takeaway hot chips, potato crisps and frozen potato products,\u201d Marquardt said. Trimming the inflation rate included a 7.2% decline in the cost of domestic holiday travel and accommodation, while clothing accessories were 2.2% cheaper and automotive fuel 0.7%. Electricity prices were down 1.8% for the quarter but will likely soar when the September quarter numbers are released in three months\u2019 time after bill increases of as much as a third kicked in from 1 July. For June alone, CPI came in at 5.4%, down from 5.6% in May. With other seasonal prices kicking in this month, such as insurance, the July monthly number will probably show an uptick. The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, welcomed the drop in inflation, noting the quarterly pace was now less than half the 2.1% rate posted during the March quarter of 2021 \u2013 just prior to the election of the Albanese government. \u201cWe know people are still doing it tough\u201d, the treasurer said, adding \u201cinflation remains our number one challenge\u201d. Chalmers said more cost-of-living relief was on the way, including the biggest increase in commonwealth rental assistance in 30 years that would kick in from September. His opposition counterpart, Angus Taylor, said real incomes were still going backward as \u201cprices were going up faster than wages\u201d. Taylor said the government had to do more to boost productivity and recent industrial relations were countering that. Australia\u2019s CPI rate remains twice that of the US, which posted a 3% annual increase in prices in the year to June. Canada\u2019s prices were rising 2.8% last month from a year earlier, while New Zealand\u2019s inflation matched Australia at 6%, with the UK an outlier among rich nations at 7.9%."

            "date": "2023-07-18T07:00:49Z",
            "content": "Inflation in the UK is expected to fall back after industry figures showed the rising price of groceries eased in July, as more shoppers turned to supermarket loyalty cards amid the cost of living crisis. The annual pace of grocery price growth cooled to 14.9% over the four weeks to 9 July, down from 16.5% a month earlier, according to the retail industry data provider Kantar, dropping to the slowest annual rate of growth since Christmas. Raising hopes for a broader easing of pressure on households, the snapshot comes ahead of official figures on Wednesday that are expected to show the UK\u2019s headline rate of inflation resumed a downward path in June after remaining unchanged at 8.7% in May. City economists are predicting inflation as measured by the consumer price index fell to 8.2% last month, helped by lower petrol prices and a slowdown in the pace of growth for food, drink and other basic essentials. However, prices remain high and are still rising at a much faster pace than they have done historically. The Bank of England is widely expected to increase interest rates for a 14th consecutive time at its next policymaking meeting in August, adding to the headache for mortgage holders, amid concerns over UK inflation sticking at the highest rates in the G7. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, suggested the latest Kantar figures showed grocery price inflation should continue to decline over the coming months. \u201cFood inflation was driven by the global cost of energy rocketing and supply chains being hit. Yet consumers should share the upside as both issues unwind, and we\u2019re watching closely to make sure they do. Hopefully that\u2019s what we\u2019re starting to see.\u201d Hunt has held meetings in Downing Street with supermarket bosses in recent months amid efforts to apply pressure on the retail industry to pass on lower wholesale costs to consumers, while opposition MPs and unions have accused retailers of profiteering. Hopes are rising that inflation could cool in the coming months, helped by falling energy prices and a slowdown in the rate of food price growth. After a dramatic rise in borrowing costs in recent months, figures from the data provider Moneyfacts show average two-year and five-year fixed-rate mortgage costs remained unchanged for a second day in a row. Tim Steiner, the boss of the online grocer Ocado, said \u201cwe are definitely over the worst\u201d on inflation and the supermarket industry was \u201cworking hard to keep price rises to a minimum\u201d. However, prices remain high after the sharpest annual rise in food and drink costs since the late 1970s, and are likely to continue rising, albeit at a slower pace. Steiner warned that wages, energy bills and interest rates would continue to push up costs for his business. Ocado said shoppers had been putting fewer items in their baskets and shifting to cheaper options to offset inflation, leading to just 5% growth in sales revenue at its retail arm in the six months to 26 May, well behind the industry-wide rate of inflation during that period, say analysts at Kantar. Shares in Ocado rose by 16% \u2013 making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 \u2013 as the company fared better than expected, despite half-year losses widening to nearly \u00a3290m, with the retail arm falling \u00a32.5m into the red compared with a \u00a331m profit a year before. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cGrocery price inflation has now been falling for four months in a row. That will be good news for many households although, of course, the rate is still incredibly high. \u201cThe change comes as spending on promotions has gone up for the first time in two years, now accounting for just over a quarter of the total market \u2026 One of the biggest shifts we\u2019ve seen in this area is retailers ramping up loyalty card deals such as Tesco\u2019s Clubcard prices and Sainsbury\u2019s Nectar prices.\u201d Overall sales of groceries for consumption at home rose by 10.7%, behind the level of inflation, indicating that fewer items were put in baskets. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that shoppers have dramatically changed their behaviour to combat inflation, whether by trading down to cheaper products or visiting different grocers,\u201d McKevitt said. The discount chains Aldi and Lidl have been the main beneficiaries of changing behaviour. Aldi is the fastest-growing grocer, with sales up by 24% in the 12 weeks to 9 July. It holds 10.2% of the market, up from 9.1% a year ago. Lidl increased its market share, up by 0.7 percentage points to 7.7% after sales increased by 22.3%. Sainsbury\u2019s was the fastest growing of the traditional supermarket chains with sales up 10.7%, in line with the total market. Morrisons and Ocado trailed the pack but the former recorded growth of 2.5%, its best showing since April 2021 and its eighth month in a row of improved performance."

            "title": "What does the UK\u2019s falling inflation rate mean for you?",
            "date": "2023-07-19T14:43:47Z",
            "content": "The UK inflation rate fell back to 7.9% in June. That meant it was lower than economists expected, but it was the 23rd month running that the main consumer prices index (CPI) has overshot the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Although down from its recent peak of 11.1% in October, it still means the cost of living is rising rapidly. What does the inflation rate mean? The monthly inflation rates reported by the Office for National Statistics capture the change in the cost of living in the UK. There are several different rates recorded by the economists: CPI, the retail prices index (RPI), and CPIH (CPI including owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs). It is CPI that was 7.9% last month. CPIH was 7.3%, while RPI was at 10.7%. The indices measure changes in the cost of a huge number of products \u2013 from shampoo to secondhand cars, and services including insurance and air travel. The rates are different because of the various goods and services included in the price tables, and also because of the way the figures are calculated. It is the annual CPI rate that influences Bank of England interest rate decisions. Is it good that CPI has fallen? Yes \u2013 but it\u2019s still too high. Households are still having to pay 17.4% more for groceries than they were early last summer (a pint of milk is up by 21.7% year-on-year) and gas and electricity prices are up by 36.2% and 17.3%, respectively, putting a strain on household budgets. And on top of that some face rising mortgage costs \u2013 these are included in the CPIH, not CPI. This week, figures from the Insolvency Service showed year-on-year increases in the number of people taking out debt relief orders and new breathing space registrations that allow people to freeze their debts for 60 days \u2013 a sign that people are struggling with high living costs. What does it mean for borrowers? The fact that inflation has dropped back a little is potentially good news for borrowers. If the rate had stayed above 8% then some economists had suggested the Bank may have gone for another half-point increase in interest rates next month. Instead, they are now betting that a quarter-point rise is more likely. But with inflation still almost four times the Bank\u2019s target there are likely to be further interest rate rises that will in turn lead to higher borrowing costs. Mortgage rates linked to the base rate will go up if it is increased again. However, the latest inflation figures may mean that fixed-rate deals, which are tied to expectations of future rate rises, start to drop slightly. Personal loans and credit cards have already become more expensive as a result of rising base rates and will get costlier if this month\u2019s inflation figure persuades the Bank to vote for another increase in August. What does it mean for savers? Laura Suter from advice firm AJ Bell says a saver who put \u00a31,000 in an average easy-access account a year will find it\u2019s now worth \u00a3938 in real terms, having earned 1.18% interest over that period. \u201cThe top rate easy-access accounts would have paid more over that time, but nowhere near current inflation of 7.9%,\u201d she says. Competition in the savings market, combined with recent base rate hikes and pressure from the finance regulator have pushed best-buy savings rates to over 6% in recent weeks, which in normal times would sound fantastic. However, while inflation remains higher the value of any money you keep in an account is still effectively falling. If you believe that inflation will eventually come down, then locking into an account paying that rate for three years could mean you will happily beat inflation before the end of the term. Who is losing out? Anyone whose income growth has not kept up with inflation will be suffering, but some people will be harder hit than others. A campaign group called the Deprived Pensioners Association says there are 60,000 members aged over 80 of now-defunct retirement schemes whose payouts are not linked to inflation who are at risk of \u201cserious financial hardship\u201d. State benefits did rise by 10.1% in April, offering some relief to those on the lowest incomes, however, there are clearly people struggling to keep up with rising living costs. Last week, the ONS published research showing that one in 20 adults had run out of food and been unable to buy more at some point in the spring. What does this mean for pay and benefits? Wages have been increasing, with recent figures showing that annual earnings growth hit 7.3% in the three months to May. However, a higher rate of inflation means that workers are still out of pocket despite that growth so employers may come under pressure to consider further increases. June\u2019s inflation figure is not used to set any government-backed payments or prices. Typically, July\u2019s data determined the next year\u2019s regulated rail fares. This year, a different figure was used but it will be worth keeping an eye on next month\u2019s inflation report in case the government goes back to the usual formula. The government uses September\u2019s figure to set state benefit rises for the following financial year, so if inflation stays high it could lead to discussions in government about whether to stick with the pensions triple lock. Last year, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was reported to be considering dropping the promise to use inflation for the calculation if it was the highest of the three measures."

            "date": "2023-07-04T10:02:42Z",
            "content": "Food inflation is starting to fall, according to the boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, who said shoppers were putting more items in their baskets as it began to cut prices on some basics. Simon Roberts, the chief executive, said the supermarket was \u201cputting all our energy and focus into battling inflation\u201d as household budgets were \u201cunder more pressure than ever\u201d. \u201cWe have zero complacency on this issue,\u201d he said, pointing to the chain\u2019s Aldi price-matching tactic and introduction of special price cuts for its Nectar loyalty-scheme members. \u201cInflation is still going to be a challenge and customers need to be assured we are really on their side.\u201d Grocery prices are still rising rapidly: Office for National Statistics figures showed the rate of food and drink price rises has slowed, to 18.3% in May from 19% in April \u2013 still among the fastest rates in decades. Roberts agreed with recent comments by the boss of Tesco, that food prices would not return to levels seen before the start of the cost of living crisis. He said \u201cthe cost of producing food was clearly elevated\u201d as higher wages were \u201clocked in\u201d for both retailers and their suppliers, while energy prices remained stubbornly high. \u201cWe all want energy costs to come down quicker but that is taking some time,\u201d he said. Roberts said relatively high food price inflation would continue until at least the end of the year with inflation on packaged goods taking longer to reduce than on fresh foods. The UK\u2019s second largest supermarket chain, which also owns Argos, reported that like-for-like sales \u2013 those in stores open for more than a year \u2013 excluding fuel rose by a better than expected 9.8% in the 16 weeks to 24 June, partly thanks to an increase in the number of items sold, reversing a trend of shoppers cutting back. Grocery sales jumped 11% while general merchandise such as household goods grew by 4%, including a 5.1% rise at Argos, helped by the warmer weather towards the end of the period and the string of bank holidays. Clothing sales fell 3.7%, held back by the cool start to the spring. Sainsbury\u2019s said it had put more than \u00a360m into cutting the prices of basics including bread, milk, pasta, chicken and toilet roll since March in a market where prices continued to rise. Roberts said Sainsbury\u2019s shoppers were only experiencing about half the rate of inflation indicated by government figures as they were sticking to budgets by buying \u201cwhat they need rather than what they might want\u201d and swapping to cheaper brands, including own-label ranges. He said the chain was also increasing prices at a slower rate than its rivals. The retailer has increased the size of its cheapest range \u2013 now called Stamford Street \u2013 by 10%, or 20 products. Roberts indicated that sales of the range had increased by far more than that, making it the group\u2019s fastest growing line, as shoppers looked for ways to save cash. Supermarkets have come under public pressure to do more to alleviate the cost of living crisis amid accusations of \u201cgreedflation\u201d \u2013 using high inflation as an excuse to raise prices further. The competition watchdog is investigating whether supermarkets are keeping prices higher than they need to be, with a separate investigation into fuel reporting this week that supermarkets had increased profit margins during the pandemic. Roberts would not comment on Sainsbury\u2019s profit margins on fuel, but indicated that any gains made there were being passed on to shoppers by keeping food prices down with overall profit margins at their lowest level ever. The retail boss refused to point the finger at food producers for keeping prices high, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is much value to be gained from blaming different parts of the system. The only way we are going to solve [inflation] is to work together.\u201d Roberts said: \u201cFood inflation is starting to fall and we are fully committed to passing on savings to our customers.\u201d"

            "title": "ECB urged to pause interest rate rises amid recession fears",
            "date": "2023-07-27T15:31:02Z",
            "content": "The European Central Bank has been urged to pause further interest rate rises amid growing recession fears after lifting them by 0.25 percentage points to a joint record high. Concerns that European property prices have slumped were cited by analysts among reasons for the central bank to freeze the cost of borrowing on its three key interest rates. The latest increase pushes the ECB\u2019s deposit rate, which is paid on commercial bank deposits left overnight with the central bank, to 3.75%, matching the previous record set in 2000-01. The ECB president, Christine Lagarde, left the door open for further rate rises after she said the governing board would be \u201cdata dependent\u201d about its next steps. Speaking in Frankfurt after the US Federal Reserve also raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, Lagarde said the ECB will keep interest rates at \u201csufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary\u201d to bring inflation down to its 2% target. She said: \u201cWe want to break the back of inflation and will get there, come what may.\u201d Its main refinancing operations, the rate banks pay when they borrow money from the ECB, rose to 4.25% \u2013 the highest in more than two decades. Eurozone inflation has fallen from 10.6% last year to 5.5% in June, though the level of prices growth varies from 1.9% in Spain to 9.7% in the Czech Republic. German inflation was 6.7% in June, fuelled by a 13.4% increase in the cost of food. At the moment, the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the eurozone remains highly uncertain, according to the ECB. Lagarde said there were downside risks to growth from Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, or the possibility of a wider increase in geopolitical tensions that could hit trade and push prices higher over the coming months. She said further impetus to the rising costs of energy and food could follow Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the Black Sea grain initiative. However, economic growth across many eurozone countries, and especially its largest economy, Germany, is slowing, raising concerns of higher unemployment. Moritz Schularick, president of the Kiel Institute, a leading German economic thinktank, said: \u201cThe ECB has effectively shown its teeth in the fight against inflation, with the inflation rate roughly halved from its peak. \u201cFrom a risk management perspective, after such sharp interest rate hikes, there is much to be said for now waiting for the effects on the real economy and taking a pause to be able to validly assess the impact of the rate hikes.\u201d Eurozone blue-chip company shares rallied to their highest in more than 15 years on the expectation that further increases may not be needed to bring inflation down to 2%. Alex Livingstone, the head of foreign exchange trading at Titan Asset Management, said: \u201cThe ECB decided to follow in the Fed\u2019s footsteps today hiking rates by 25bps to 4.25%. However, the language in the statement struck a more dovish tone than markets anticipated as the ECB gestured to clearer signs of inflation easing and admission of tightening financial conditions weighing on demand. \u201cThis is a clear nod to economic growth becoming a more important topic of focus down the line as inflation dissipates.\u201d Daniela Hathorn, the senior market analyst at Capital.com, said: \u201cThey (ECB) have hiked as expected. But if you look at some of the keywords, they have actually started to take some of the most aggressive messaging out. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a little bit of a shift here in the potential that we may see another rate hike and that may be it.\u201d The Bank of England is expected to raise its base rate to 5.25% next week."

            "date": "2023-07-27T15:21:24Z",
            "content": "ITV has warned it is in the midst of the worst advertising downturn since the 2008 financial crisis. The broadcaster, which is behind hit shows including Love Island and I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here!, said earnings more than halved in the first six months of the year as it came up against a \u201cvery tough\u201d advertising market and as it invested in its ITVX online streaming service. \u201cThis is the worst advertising recession since the global financial crisis,\u201d said the ITV chief executive, Dame Carolyn McCall. Earnings fell 52% to \u00a3152m and total advertising revenues fell 11% to \u00a3811m in the first half of the year compared with the same period a year earlier. However, McCall said while advertisers were cautious against the current backdrop of high inflation and high interest rates, ITV had not had any difficulty in attracting sponsors for its programmes. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re already talking to advertisers about the Christmas campaign and I think that shows there is no change in the way they view what they\u2019re going to do over Christmas, all conversations about advertising are positive and quite constructive, they haven\u2019t got their head in their hands. \u201cThey\u2019re being cautious because the outlook has been cautious \u2026 We\u2019ve had no problems sponsoring any of our shows \u2026 every single one of the shows in the autumn has got a sponsor.\u201d The director of ITV Studios, Julian Bellamy, said the actor and writer strikes in the US could begin to affect the production of ITV shows. The broadcaster\u2019s US scripted shows include Franklin, starring the British actor Eddie Marsan, Good Witch with James Denton and Snowpiercer with Jennifer Connelly. He said: \u201cJust to be clear, we are talking about our US scripted business, not the rest of the UK studio distribution. Saying that, if the strike goes into the autumn, it will potentially start impacting when we start production. \u201cIn that context, it is one of the great strengths of the studio, we\u2019re very diversified in terms of genre and geography, so we are in a good position to manage it.\u201d Strike action in the US by members of Sag-Aftra \u2013 the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists \u2013 has caused an industry-wide shutdown. Despite weaker earnings in the first half, ITV said it was looking for an improved performance in the final six months of 2023 because of a number of large sporting events such as the Women\u2019s World Cup, which is under way, and the Rugby World Cup, which kicks off in the autumn. ITV Studios, the production arm, performed more strongly, with an 8% rise in revenue while online advertising increased 24%. McCall said: \u201cThe continued momentum behind ITV\u2019s strategic transformation delivered strong growth in Studios and digital revenues in the first half of the year, largely offsetting the expected weakness in the UK advertising market \u2013 with total revenue declining just 1% in the first half, even in a very tough advertising market.\u201d The company said it was too early to give a forecast for September, but \u201cearly signs are positive and we expect to see growth in total advertising revenues in the third quarter, with continued strong growth in digital advertising revenues\u201d. Sophie Lund-Yates, the lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWith economic uncertainty mounting and marketers clutching purses tightly to their chest, this was always going to be a difficult time. Away from the short-term bumps, there\u2019s a structural decline happening in the TV space \u2013 broadcast ads simply don\u2019t pack the same punch they used to, thanks to the rise of streaming and the fact many of us spend our evenings glued to our phones too. \u201cTo that end, it\u2019s encouraging to see the Studios business picking up the pace \u2013 making content for the new binge-watching culture is a good place to be. ITV are up against stiff competition here too though and we\u2019re still some way off from ITV being solely reliant on this more lucrative revenue stream.\u201d ITV recently abandoned potential plans to buy All3Media \u2013 the group behind The Traitors and Fleabag \u2013 less than a month after expressing interest in a deal. ITV shares were up more than 4% on Thursday."

            "title": "Bank of England risks recession with interest rate rises, Mervyn King says",
            "date": "2023-07-20T14:04:58Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England could plunge the UK into a recession by raising rates too far, the former governor Mervyn King has said. In a broadside a fortnight before Bank officials are due to meet to decide the next step for interest rates, Lord King said the signals from the credit markets in 2021 that indicated inflation was about to rocket were now showing that price growth was about to drop sharply. Financial markets expect the Bank to increase the base rate from the current level of 5% on 3 August. In an interview with Merryn Somerset Webb on the Bloomberg podcast Merryn Talks Money, King said officials on the monetary policy committee could tighten monetary policy too far if they pushed for further rate increases, triggering a recession. He said the central bank had ignored signals from money supply data, which pointed to higher inflation coming out of the pandemic. The Bank has defended its position, saying it delayed acting to calm inflation, believing the economy would go through a period of weak growth and higher unemployment after the furlough scheme ended. The former governor\u2019s comments add to concerns about the Bank\u2019s most aggressive series of rate rises in three decades and the impact it is having on the economy. Mortgage rates have risen sharply and some economists have predicted unemployment could increase next year as corporate bankruptcies rise and job vacancies fall. Money supply economists claim to have predicted the steep rise in inflation before it jumped to more than 10% in 2022. They have warned that a contraction in the supply of money to consumers and businesses after 13 consecutive increases in interest rates will mean inflation reverses quickly without the need for further action. King said: \u201cThe risk is that having ignored money when inflation was rising, they\u2019re now ignoring money when inflation is actually about to fall. What we could see, therefore, is a mistake in both directions over a period of three or four years. \u201cIf they carry on for the next six months or so tightening monetary policy, it could well be that they generate both a recession as well as a sharp fall in inflation.\u201d The Bank for International Settlements, which advises central bankers from its headquarters in Basel, and the International Monetary Fund have urged the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to increase interest rates and maintain them at high levels until they can safely claim that inflation has dropped to the target rate of 2%. After sharply increasing during 2020 and early 2021, money supply growth in the UK has slumped and was flat in May, the latest available data shows. For monetarists, growth and inflation are a function of the quantity of money in circulation and its velocity \u2013 the number of times it changes hands. Even so, the Bank increased its base rate by half a percentage point to 5% last month after signs that price and wage pressures were proving much stickier than expected. Data on Wednesday showed that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, is finally slowing, to 7.9% in June from 8.7% in May. King\u2019s criticism follows similar comments by the Bank of England\u2019s former chief economist Andy Haldane, who argued for a sharp increase in borrowing costs in 2021, before saying in April that the central bank had gone far enough."

            "date": "2023-07-09T09:49:58Z",
            "content": "First it was the pandemic. Then it was the war in Ukraine. Next it could be the climate crisis. On Monday last week the world registered its hottest-ever day but the record lasted only 24 hours before it was beaten by an even more sizzling Tuesday. And while the temperature continues to warm up the global economy continues to cool down. Germany is already in recession and plenty of other developed countries \u2013 including the UK \u2013 seem to be heading in that direction. China\u2019s post-lockdown recovery has petered out, the US jobs market seems to be cooling in response to higher interest rates. The combination of weak activity and the increasing number of extreme weather events is worrying. Normally, pressure on the environment intensifies during booms, which is why there were big surges in support for the green movement in the early 1970s, the late 1980s and the period immediately before the global financial crisis of 2008. If, as seems likely, there will be no letup in global heating despite slower growth, that\u2019s a real concern. The US economy may technically avoid falling into recession, but the fact that the recent Canadian forest fires led to New York City being choked in a noxious orange smog speaks of a planet heading for a catastrophic slump. In a sense, the real recession is the ecological one. Generally, governments focus on the future of the planet when they feel they have nothing much else to worry about. That, at least, has been the record until now. Recessions \u2013 and even the threat of recessions \u2013 have the effect of making policymakers focus on the short term. Stretched public finances coupled with the desire to remain popular engenders a growth at all costs mentality. Fears are now surfacing about the costs of the transition to a cleaner, less carbon-intensive economy, particularly on those least able to bear them. Make no mistake, some of these concerns are legitimate. Heat pumps are expensive. Electric cars are seen only in the driveways of the better off. Fossil fuels make up three-quarters of the UK\u2019s energy mix and ending that dependency will be neither quick nor easy. In the current circumstances, politicians think they have more pressing matters to deal with than hitting net zero goals. Action to tackle the climate emergency can be put off to another day when, fingers crossed, science and market forces will come up with a solution that will allow us all to consume as much as we like without destroying the planet. This may be shortsighted. It may be dumb thinking. It no doubt infuriates the Just Stop Oil protesters who have made their presence felt at Lord\u2019s and Wimbledon in recent days. But for those in positions of power, the temptation to delay action remains strong. Rishi Sunak\u2019s plan to renege on the government\u2019s \u00a311.6bn pledge to help poor countries deal with climate change is a case in point. It would be an act of betrayal but one sadly in keeping with the prime minister\u2019s lack of interest in the net zero agenda. It would be wrong to assume it is only the politicians who are at fault. Our political masters respond to the signals they get from voters, and the message is by no means as clearcut as those urging more drastic action on the climate emergency would hope. In part, that\u2019s due to the cost-of-living crisis, but it goes deeper than that. Many support football teams sponsored by fossil fuel interests and the fans really don\u2019t care if the new star striker is being bought with dirty Middle East oil money so long as he scores plenty of goals. People worry more about the future of the planet than they did when Fritz Schumacher wrote Small is Beautiful half a century ago, but what they really want is a painless transition that doesn\u2019t force them to stop doing the things they like, such as driving to see friends and relatives or jetting off for a holiday abroad. There is still time to step back from the edge of the abyss. For a start, the green movement needs to heal the divide between those backing no growth and those favouring sustainable growth, and focus on the real enemy: a form of capitalism that is eating itself. Next, there is low-hanging fruit to be picked. Andrew Simms, co-director of the New Weather Institute campaign group, says sport sponsorship was a key battleground in the successful struggle to end tobacco advertising and that fossil fuels have become the new tobacco. From football to cycling\u2019s Tour de France, from the forthcoming rugby World Cup to athletics, Simms notes sport has long been dependent on the largesse of high-carbon promoters. Some problems will be tougher to crack. The green transition would be easier were the UK a less unequal country. What\u2019s more, Britain\u2019s energy infrastructure is in a poor state and needs a lot of sustained investment if it is to be ready for the new power sources being developed, such as floating windfarms and hydrogen. The IPPR, a left leaning thinktank, is proposing a \u00a330bn a year public investment package, including in clean energy, which it says would improve the supply side of the economy, boost growth potential and be good for the public finances. There are other suggestions for how the government might speed up the green transition, all of which meet with the same riposte: that the plans are unaffordable, irresponsible and the stuff of fantasy. In truth, the real fantasists are those who cling to the belief that we can continue to exploit the natural world to satisfy our desires. If that\u2019s what economics is about, we badly need a new economics."

            "content": "That\u2019s all for another week \u2013 here are today\u2019s main stories: And do check out our investigation into addiction in the gaming industry: Have a lovely weekend. GW Despite an underwhelming day\u2019s trading today, Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index has just posted its best week since the spring. The FTSE 100 index has gained 2.45% this week, or 177 points, to close at 7,434 points tonight. Today it lost 5 points, in a rather dreary session. But its weekly gain is the best since the last week of March. Stocks have been lifted by optimism that America is winning in its battle against inflation, after the CPI index rose by 3% in the year to June. That raised the hope that \u201cthe Federal Reserve is near to the end of its interest rate hike cycle,\u201d says Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. More than 850 people have been referred to a clinic for video gaming addicts, as experts warn the UK is not doing enough to tackle gambling-style features in games on mobile phones and consoles, my colleague Rob Davies writes. The National Centre for Gaming Disorders (NCGD), which had its first patient in 2020, was originally given NHS funding based on seeing just 50 people a year. But the specialist London clinic has been treating 30 people a month since the end of March this year \u2013 more than seven times anticipated demand \u2013 taking the total to 855. As Rob explains here, there is no national self-exclusion scheme to bar addicts from computer gaming, as there is gambling, despite the various techniques used to hook gamers and encourage them to spend. Professor Henrietta Bowden-Jones, director of the National Centre for Gaming Disorders, writes that she has frequently been contacted by relatives of young gamers who were desperate for help. She explains: We have now been operating for just over three years and have had about 800 referrals to a clinic that was expected to see no more than 50 patients a year and was funded accordingly by the NHS. The desperation of the families trying to address the disruption that gaming harms have had on their children is extreme. I was not prepared for what we came across, with violence within the home and refusal to go to school being prominent. Professor Bowden-Jones adds that the most important lesson is that early intervention, by seeking help before children retreat to their bedrooms and refuse to attend school, is vital to the wellbeing of the family. Some of the companies whose Gatwick workers will strike later this month and in August have said they will continue to work towards a pay deal. Phil Lloyd, senior vice-president UK, Menzies Aviation, said: \u201cSadly, Unite has rejected our earlier pay increase of 11% for our ground services employees at Gatwick Airport. \u201cThis pay award relates to our 2023 pay review and is in addition to the 10% increase awarded in 2022. \u201cWe are in continued discussions with our airline partners and remain committed to seeking a resolution. \u201cWe have invited Unite to return to the table to continue discussions and hope to be able to reach an agreement which is workable for both the business and our employees.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to work to pursue an agreeable solution to protect service to our airline and airport partners and their customers.\u201d A spokesperson from DHL Supply Chain said: \u201cWe are disappointed to hear that Unite and its members have voted in favour of industrial action at our Gatwick ground handling operation. \u201cHowever, we continue to work closely with Unite to reach a satisfactory conclusion for all parties.\u201d Subsiding inflation has helped to push US consumer sentiment to the highest level in nearly two years this month. The University of Michigan\u2019s index of consumer morale has jumped 72.6 this month, the highest reading since September 2021, compared to 64.4 in June. Consumers grew more optimistic about current economic conditions, and the outlook for the economy, although poorer Americans didn\u2019t share the uptick in morale. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu says: All components of the index improved considerably, led by a 19% surge in long-term business conditions and 16% increase in short-run business conditions. Overall, sentiment climbed for all demographic groups except for lower-income consumers. The US dollar has weakened this week, on expectations that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates in 2024, after a series of hikes in 2022 and 2023. Analysts at MUFG Bank explain: The US dollar suffered significant losses this week as weak CPI and PPI data underline expectations that the Fed\u2019s battle to bring inflation back under control is nearly won. While expectations remain high that the FOMC will hike this month that hike is likely the last and market participants have increased positioning for rate cuts in 2024. Expectations that interest rates will rise faster in the UK than the US in the coming months have put the pound on track for its best week of the year. Sterling has gained around three cents this week, rising from $1.2836 to a 15-month high over $1.314 earlier today. That\u2019s the strongest week since November 2022, and a gain of 2.2% against the US dollar since Monday morning. The dollar has weakened against other major currencies this week. US inflation dropped to just 3% on Wednesday, lower than most other advanced economies, leading to speculation that the US Federal Reserve may raise interest rates for the final time in the current cycle later this month. But with UK inflation expected to remain over 8% in June, the Bank of England is forecast to raise Bank Rate to 6% by December, from 5% today. This week\u2019s rally has come despite concerns that the UK economy could have contracted in the second quarter of 2023, after GDP fell by 0.1% in May. This morning\u2019s warning of a sharp drop in the number of advertised job openings in England (see earlier post) has not, yet, caused wobbles in the market. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is up 0.3% today, on track to gain around 2.8% this week after a strong rally on Wednesday. That would be its best week since March. After the Guardian revealed yesterday that swinging job cuts were underway at GSK spin-off Haleon, its CEO Brian McNamara emailed all staff this afternoon about the layoffs. He notes that the hundreds of job cuts are just \u201cthe first\u201d of a \u201cseries of changes\u201d (insiders expect thousands of workers to be made redundant worldwide). McNamara wrote: All, Earlier this year, we announced a three-year productivity programme to transform our ways of working, reduce complexity and make us more cost conscious. In an ever-changing world, we can\u2019t stand still. We know we need to go beyond and constantly adapt and evolve, so we stay ahead of our competitors and continue to be a leader in consumer health. When we created Haleon, we did what mattered most and prioritised business continuity so we could deliver for our consumers and customers. But today, we know that life at Haleon can feel complicated and slow. We need to make changes to our organisation so we can operate with speed and agility. This week, we began to make changes to how we are organised. Colleagues who are impacted have already been informed and you\u2019ll hear more from leaders in the coming weeks, allowing for consultation periods in some markets. We know that change is unsettling, particularly when accompanied by media coverage which can create more anxiety and raise more questions. The changes we are proposing have not been made lightly. I do believe, however, that they are critical for our company to set us up for success for years to come. I can assure you that all changes have been well considered and will be thoughtfully implemented. They are the first of a series of changes across our business that we will make to improve how we perform and enable more growth. Thank you. Brian. Over in Westminster, the government is trying to avoid being drawn into the pay row between Unite and the four Gatwick service providers that has led to the strikes announced today, my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reports. Rishi Sunak\u2019s spokesperson told reporters it was \u201cnot for me to dictate to private companies what pay they set their staff\u201d and added it was up to the businesses involved to decide \u201cwhat is appropriate\u201d. They pointed out that private sector wages had risen by between 5-7% over the past year - in line with the offers made to public sector workers on Thursday. The strikes scheduled at Gatwick later this month, and in August, are just one of several possible causes of disruption this summer. At Birmingham Airport, for example, around 100 security officers and terminal technicians will begin continuous strike action from July 18. That could lead to flight delays, the Unite union has said, There is also industrial action planned or already underway across Europe, as this factbox from Reuters shows: EUROCONTROL One of the Eurocontrol trade unions has announced a six-month period when industrial action could take place in the Network Manager Operations Centre, which oversees traffic across the European airspace, the pan-European organisation said on July 7. The union has not set specific dates for a strike. BELGIUM Ryanair pilots in Belgium will strike on July 15-16 in demand of higher wages and better working conditions, their union said on July 7. The strike could affect around 140 flights from Charleroi airport, but it is yet unclear how many pilots will join and how many flights will need to be cancelled. FRANCE Repeated air traffic control (ATC) strikes in France, related to President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plan to raise pension age, have led to delays and limited flights across the country, causing more air space congestion in Europe. Ryanair, which has asked the European Commission to protect overflights from strike disruption, cancelled more than 900 flights in June mainly due to French ATC strikes. ITALY Multiple unions have called a nationwide airport staff strike on July 15 related to talks for a new collective contract. Air traffic controllers, baggage handlers and check-in personnel along with Italian pilots of Vueling will walk out between 10 a.m and 6 p.m. local time. Malta Air pilots and flight attendants will join them from noon for four hours. Talking to Italian media, Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said the companies and workers would meet the following week to continue negotiations. Air traffic control company ENAV has confirmed there will be no strikes in the Italian air transport sector between July 27 and Sept. 5 due to a summer exemption provided for in the industry regulations. PORTUGAL Easyjet cancelled 350 flights arriving to or departing from Portugal ahead of a cabin staff strike on July 21-25, the SNPVAC union of civil aviation flight personnel said. It will be the union\u2019s third strike since the beginning of the year. SPAIN Pilots at Iberia Regional Air Nostrum, who had been striking every Monday and Friday since Feb. 27, went on a daily indefinite strike from June 6 amid a pay dispute. As of July 14, Iberia said on its website some flight routes could be affected. Back at Gatwick, easyJet has said further talks between its ground handler DHL and Unite were taking place next week. With eight days of strike action looming, EasyJet says: \u201cWe urge them to reach an agreement as soon as possible.\u201d Another US bank, Wells Fargo, has also benefited from the rise in interest rates hitting consumers. Wells Fargo has reported a 57% rise in second quarter profits, as it earned more from customer interest payments. The bank has also raised its annual forecast for net interest income (NII). Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf explains: \u201cWe reported solid results in the second quarter, with net income of $4.9 billion and revenue of $20.5 billion. Our strong net interest income continued to benefit from higher interest rates, and we remained focused on controlling expenses. But, like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo has set aside more money to cover bad debts. Its allowance for credit losses has risen by $949m, primarily for commercial real estate office loans, as well as for higher credit card loan balances. The jump in profits at JP Morgan in the last quarter highlights how higher interest rates are good for bank profitability. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, explains: JPMorgan\u2019s numbers have demonstrated the overwhelming strength of big banks over their smaller competitors, after it unveiled a 67% surge in profits for Q2. Higher interest rates will continue to drive strong performance, it added. This looks like a very healthy set of numbers, and will boost hopes that earnings have begun to recover, something that might drive further stock gains in the second half of the year. Just in: Wall Street giant JP Morgan has set aside more funds to cover potential losses from customers defaulting on their debts as high inflation and interest rates hit consumers. In its second-quarter financial results, just released, JP Morgan has increased its provision for credit losses to almost $2.9bn, up from $1.1bn in the second quarter of 2022. The increase is partly due to JP Morgan having rescued regional lender First Republic earlier this year. It set aside $1.2bn to cover credit losses at First Republic \u2013 so exclude that, and the provision was $1.7bn. JP Morgan also reported a $2.7bn \u201cbargain purchase gain\u201d on its takeover of First Republic at the start of May, after the second-biggest bank failure in US history. Overall, net income rose to $14.4bn in the quarter, or 67% higher than a year ago. CEO Jamie Dimon said the US economy continues to be resilient, but warns of several risks: Consumers are slowly using up their cash buffers, core inflation has been stubbornly high (increasing the risk that interest rates go higher, and stay higher for longer), quantitative tightening of this scale has never occurred, fiscal deficits are large, and the war in Ukraine continues, which in addition to the huge humanitarian crisis for Ukrainians, has large potential effects on geopolitics and the global economy. A sharp drop in the number of advertised job openings in England is raising fears that the UK will slip into recession this year. Bloomberg are reporting that the number of jobs listed with Reed Recruitment in the April-June quarter are down 24.4% year on year, and over 26% lower than before the pandemic in 2019. Chairman James Reed in the prospects for the UK. \u201cThe alarm bell is sounding a lot louder now than it was, as the labor market is beginning to loosen. This continued contraction in job postings, which have been falling since this time last year, therefore suggests that a recession may well be imminent.\u201d Vacancies are a good gauge of corporate confidence, and whether firms feel demand is strong enough to justify taking on more staff. On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics reported that vacancies fell by 85,000 on the quarter to 1,034,000 \u2013 just as the cost of living squeeze pressed more people back into the labour market. Reed\u2019s data is more timely, and \u201cthe picture isn\u2019t pretty\u201d, says Bloomberg, adding: Vacancies on Reed\u2019s platform, adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations, fell by 16,127 between the first and second quarters of this year \u2014 a 10% plunge. A decline of that scale, if mirrored in the official statistics, historically has been associated with a 0.6% contraction in GDP in the same quarter, said Dan Hanson at Bloomberg Economics. In this case, that would mean a sharp contraction in the quarter that ended on June 30. More here: England\u2019s Falling Job Advertisements Ring a Recession Alarm There could be additional strike action at Gatwick this summer too, on top of what\u2019s just been announced. That\u2019s because Unite is also balloting its members at DHL Gatwick Direct, Red Handling and Wilson James who are employed at Gatwick. All three ballots will close at the end of the month \u2013 if workers vote for industrial action, then strikes in these companies could begin by mid-August. The airlines affected by the strikes at Gatwick will include British Airways, Easyjet, Ryanair, TUI, Westjet and Wizz, Unite say. Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis is forcing more people to eat into their savings, according to official data which also shows that renters are at greatest risk of financial vulnerability. The Office for National Statistics reports that around three in 10 people are using their savings because of the rise in cost of living, up from 25% when previously polled in April. The ONS also reports that renters are 4.7 times more likely to experience financial vulnerability compared with those who own their home outright, while mortgage holders are twice as likely. That difference may be because, on average, renters spend 21% of their disposable income on rent (21%), while mortgage holders spend on averare 16% of their disposable income on their mortgage, ONS research shows. Today\u2019s report shows that over 4 in 10 renters are finding it difficult to afford their rent payments, compared with almost 3 in 10 (28%) mortgage holders. And around 1 in 20 of adults reported that in the past two weeks they had ran out of food and had been unable to afford more. Gatwick Airport is already suffering major disruption due to air traffic control (ATC) restrictions, PA Media points out. Strikes, staff shortages and air space closures related to the war in Ukraine mean ATC providers are limiting flight numbers across Europe. Gatwick is the busiest single-runway airport in the world, but its flight numbers are currently capped at peak times due to the ATC issue. The problem recently forced easyJet to cancel 1,700 summer flights, mostly from Gatwick. A Gatwick spokesperson says: \u201cWe are aware of the recent ballot result and will support our airlines with their contingency plans to ensure that flights operate as scheduled.\u201d Unite says the majority of the 950 Gatwick staff who will strike this summe are paid below \u00a312.00 an hour, despite undertaking highly demanding and safety critical roles. It says it has been negotiating on pay with ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services Ltd since January, but the firms have not made offers that meets the workers\u2019 expectations. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \u201cOur members at Gatwick Airport undertake incredibly demanding roles and are essential to keeping the airport and airlines working, yet their employers somehow think it is acceptable to pay them a pittance. \u201cAs part of Unite\u2019s unyielding focus on the jobs, pay and condition of its members the union has drawn a line in the sand and is committed to eradicating the scourge of low pay at the airport.\u201d Nearly a thousand workers are set to take eight days of strike action at Gatwick Airport in July and August in a dispute over pay, which unions say will disupt the summer holiday getaway. The Unite union has announced that 950 staff working for ASC, Menzies Aviation, GGS and DHL Services Ltd will take part in a four-day strike from Friday 28 July to Tuesday 1 August, and a second four-day strike from Friday 4 August to Tuesday 8 August. All four companies conduct outsourced operations for major airlines, including ground handling, baggage handling and check in agents roles. Given the scale of the industrial action, disruption, delays and cancellations are inevitable across the airport, Unite says. Unite regional officer Dominic Rothwell said: \u201cStrike action will inevitably cause severe delays, disruption and cancellations across Gatwick\u2019s operations but this dispute is entirely of the companies own making. They have had every opportunity to make our members\u2019 a fair pay offer but have chosen not to do so.\u201d Finnish telecommunications firm Nokia has cut its sales and profit outlook for the year, warning that rising interest rates are hitting its business. Nokia cut its sales forecast for this year to between \u20ac23.2bn and \u20ac24.6bn, down from between \u20ac24.6bn-\u20ac26.2bn It also cut its profit margin range to 11.5%-13%, from 11.5%-14% before. Nokia, which sells telecoms network hardware, software and related services, says the macro-economic environment is leading to weaker demand, saying: Customer spending plans are increasingly impacted by high inflation and rising interest rates along with some projects now slipping to 2024 \u2013 notably in North America. Some customers are also \u2018normalising\u2019 their inventories, following the supply chain disrupion of the past two years, which led to stockpiling. Shares in Nokia have fallen around 8% in early trading. Turning from the poverty crisis to luxury goods\u2026. Burberry has reported a bounce in sales in China following its pandemic reopening. Sales in mainland China jumped 46% in the first quarter of the financial year (the 13 weeks to 1 July). That helped Burberry to grow its comparable store sales by 18%, with strong sales of \u2018heritage rainwear\u2019 (ie raincoats) and leather goods (such as handbags). It told shareholders: The Group benefitted from strong underlying growth in EMEIA [Europe, the Middle East, India and and Africa.], South Asia Pacific and Japan as well as the recovery in Mainland China from COVID-19 related lockdowns last year. But, sales in the America fell by 8%, as consumers cut back. Burbery says: Globally, the Americas customer decreased mid-single digit with the decline in locals partially offset by outbound tourist spend. Finance ministers from G20 nations are meeting in India next week, where they should discuss measures to tackle poverty, along with reforming the world\u2019s top multilateral institutions and the international debt architecture. Achim Steiner, UNDP administrator, called the surge in poverty alarming, Reuters reports. He told journalists. \u201cWhat this means is a government that can no longer pay its teachers; a government that can no longer employ doctors and nurses in hospitals, that cannot provide the medicines for rural health centers.\u201d The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has calculated it would cost around $14bn to lift back out of poverty the extra 165m people since 2020 who are living on less than $3.65 a day. The solution \u201cis not out of reach for the multilateral system\u201d, they say. UNDP chief economist George Gray Molina argues that a \u201cDebt-Poverty Pause\u201d would be triggered automatically when a country suffers an economic shock, so it can redirect debt repayment towards financing social expenditures. Molina says: \u201cThis systemic addition to the international financial architecture should be triggered automatically, to stabilize free-falls when exogenous shocks shrink developing countries\u2019 fiscal space, bloat their debt servicing and throw households into poverty. This is the beginning of a new adaptive social protection architecture to prepare for a future prone to shocks.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Global finance ministers are being urged to give poor countries debt repayment breaks, to cushion the developing world from the impact of high interest rates. In a new report, the United Nations is calling for a \u201cDebt-Poverty Pause\u201d, so developing countries can redirect debt repayments toward critical social expenditures. Such a pause would mitigate poverty, they argue, until the multilateral system can address debt restructuring \u201cat speed and scale\u201d. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports that poverty rates in poor countries have surged over the last three years, with another 165 million people now living on less than $3.65-a-day. These additional poor all live in low and lower-middle-income economies, UNDP says, with the poorest 20% in low-income countries still suffering incomes below their pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Rising debt servicing costs are making it increasingly harder for countries to support their populations through investments in health, education and social protection, warns Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. Steiner explains: \u201cCountries that could invest in safety nets over the last three years have prevented a significant number of people from falling into poverty. In highly indebted countries, there is a correlation between high levels of debt, insufficient social spending, and an alarming increase in poverty rates. Today, 46 countries pay more than 10 percent of their general government revenue on net interest payments. Steiner warns there is \u201ca human cost\u201d in not acting to restructure developing countries\u2019 sovereign debt, adding: \u201cWe need new mechanisms to anticipate and absorb shocks and make the financial architecture work for the most vulnerable.\u201d The increase in interest rates over the last year or so has hit developing nations hard, the UNDP explains. Those escalating borrowing costs, and the stronger dollar, make repaying loans and raising money significantly more expensive for dozens of developing nations. The average low-income country devotes between twice and three times as much, as a share of their revenue, on servicing interest payments compared with the average high-income country, UNDP say. Highly indebted developing countries have run out of fiscal space for continued debt-financing, which forces them to cut spending on social protection, says UNDP chief economist George Gray Molina, adding: In the absence of credible debt relief, these countries are not able to deliver this \u2018temporal and targeted\u2019 support.\u201d Late last month, the World Bank proposed that poor countries should be able to pause their debt repayments if hit by climate disaster. Yesterday, Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog warned that the UK\u2019s public finances are in a \u201cvery risky\u201d period after a series of shocks, including the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said national debt could surge to more than 300% of gross domestic product by the 2070s.

            "date": "2023-07-27T18:20:28Z",
            "content": "The US Department of Justice has announced an investigation into the city of Memphis and the Memphis police department (MPD) over its policing practices to examine if they are discriminatory. The civil pattern or practice investigation will determine if Memphis police violated federal laws or the US constitution. The announcement comes after the police department came under scrutiny for its use of force, stops, searches and arrests that often targeted people of color. One of these instances involved Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who died on 10 January, three days after an encounter with Memphis police during a traffic stop in which he was violently beaten. Nichols\u2019s death caused headlines across the US and around the world and triggered yet another bout of national soul searching around brutality and racism in American law enforcement. In a statement, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, said: \u201cThe tragic death of Tyre Nichols created enormous pain in the Memphis community and across the country.\u201d He added: \u201cThe justice department is launching this investigation to examine serious allegations that the city of Memphis and the Memphis police department engage in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct and discriminatory policing based on race, including a dangerously aggressive approach to traffic enforcement.\u201d The five officers involved \u2013 Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr and Justin Smith \u2013 were part of a crime-suppression team known as Scorpion and have pleaded not guilty to criminal charges including second-degree murder. After Nichols\u2019s death, Scorpion was disbanded by the police chief. The five officers charged in the case are also Black, underscoring the complicated relationship between law enforcement and the communities they represent and are meant to protect. Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the justice department\u2019s civil rights division, said: \u201cWe have reviewed information that indicates that the Memphis police department may be using an approach to street enforcement that can result in violations of federal law, including racially discriminatory stops of Black people for minor violations.\u201d In addition to the five officers charged with murder, one officer involved was fired and another retired. Additionally, two Shelby county sheriff\u2019s deputies who went to the location after the beating were suspended for five days for policy violations and three Memphis fire department emergency medical technicians were fired for failing to render aid to Nichols. In recent years, the justice department has launched similar investigations around the country involving police brutality. In June, an investigation alleged Minneapolis police were systematically discriminating against racial minorities, violating constitutional rights and disregarding the safety of people in custody for years before George Floyd was killed. And in March, the department found Louisville police engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community following an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor. The justice department said this Memphis civil investigation is separate and independent from the federal criminal civil rights investigation of MPD officers related to the death of Nichols. Depending on the findings of the investigation, it is possible reforms of the police department overseen by an independent monitor and approved by a federal judge could be required."

            "date": "2023-07-21T16:36:33Z",
            "content": "Marina Hyde\u2019s article on the Post Office scandal (After 20 years, here\u2019s why the Post Office scandal is special: the cover-up is happening in plain sight, 18 July) provided an excellent explanation of its appalling history and consequences. However, it did not highlight one major aspect that requires full investigation and the production of recommendations. How could it happen that such a large-scale miscarriage of justice could occur without the criminal courts and its judges discovering it through the trial process? What mechanism, if any, existed for judges dealing with such cases to raise concerns outside the trial process itself? This was a miscarriage of justice that involved many of the same features that were present in the infamous miscarriages of justice of the past \u2013 non\u2011disclosure, a failure to understand or facilitate the investigation of scientific evidence, a casual assumption of guilt, and racism. Had these things been forgotten? An emphatic restatement of the principle that a key function of the criminal process is to ensure that the innocent are not convicted seems overdue. Hopefully Sir William Blackstone\u2019s ratio, \u201cIt is better that 10 guilty persons escape than that one innocent person suffer\u201d, has not been eliminated from the collective memory by a tide of penal populism. If the current inquiry does not address the failings of the courts in this scandal, then that needs to be independently addressed elsewhere. Nicholas Cooke KC Newport \u2022 I was a subpostmaster for eight years, from 2006 to 2014, and lived in dread of every Wednesday\u2019s \u201cbalance\u201d. Despite my daily cash-up always balancing, doing the weekly balance invariably showed a shortfall \u2013 usually running to a few hundred pounds, which I was always lucky enough to be able to pay out of the minuscule profits from my village shop. Whenever I called the helpline about this, I was told it was my mistake and that \u201ceveryone else balances\u201d. So I stopped querying and just kept paying, in humiliation about being a qualified bookkeeper and being unable to balance my post office. I didn\u2019t keep records of how much money I paid Post Office Ltd \u2013 I just paid what the Horizon system claimed that I owed. I am incandescent with rage at the scandal \u2013 and that\u2019s not the only way that Post Office Ltd abused its subpostmasters. It has absolutely zero regard for us and the way it treated us should raise red flags on any number of issues. Ingrid Jones Cambridge \u2022 The appalling treatment of our subpostmasters by the Post Office as a result of the failure of its own IT systems does not just shame the executives who blamed their employees rather than admit their own errors. The prosecution of hundreds of people whose only common connection was to work for the same employer should have rung alarm bells somewhere in our system of justice. The scandal highlights the inherent failings of a judicial system where each case involving these similar offences was brought to court and considered by judges and juries in isolation. Equally, consideration might also have been given to such a heavy reliance on the same source of evidence, ie a single IT system. What\u2019s more, this \u201cwitness\u201d, being a system rather than a person, seems to have been ineffectively interrogated to establish its reliability. Like so many systems, what our legal system is most blind to are the systemic failings, not only of other systems, but of itself. Timothy Craven Dorchester, Dorset \u2022 Well done for keeping this scandal alive when so many want it swept under the carpet. I share Marina\u2019s hope that the Post Office executives responsible will soon find themselves in prison, to be joined there by water company bosses for the criminal neglect of our water supply infrastructure. Elizabeth Wardle New Barnet, London \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section."

            "date": "2023-07-23T10:00:37Z",
            "content": "As a Republican congressman, Ron DeSantis was a supporter of legislation that made moderate reforms to the federal prison system intended to reduce recidivism and mass incarceration \u2013 a cause that was also championed by then president Donald Trump and his deputy, Mike Pence. Five years later, DeSantis, now Florida\u2019s governor, and Pence are struggling to overtake Trump\u2019s lead among Republicans as they vie for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, and have turned against the criminal justice measure they both supported in an effort to win over conservative voters. \u201cUnder the Trump administration, he enacted a bill, basically a jailbreak bill. It\u2019s called the First Step Act. It has allowed dangerous people out of prison, who have now reoffended and really, really hurt a number of people,\u201d DeSantis told the rightwing pundit Ben Shapiro in a May interview, vowing that \u201cone of the things I want to do as president is go to Congress and seek the repeal of the First Step Act.\u201d Pence echoed a similar message, telling the Washington Examiner that as president he would \u201ctake a step back from\u201d the law. Their comments were the latest instances of Republicans wooing voters with promises to crack down on crime, a time-tested tactic for the GOP that last year helped the party win back control of the House. But conservatives who supported the First Step Act in 2018 say there\u2019s no reason to repeal it, nor do they believe attacking it will help Pence and DeSantis overtake Trump\u2019s substantial popularity advantage among Republican voters. \u201cYou\u2019re in a political, what I call, silly season, and crime is a concern, public safety is a concern across the country,\u201d said Doug Collins, a former Republican congressman from Georgia who introduced an early version of the act. He said the law was \u201cnot an issue until it was brought up, and it\u2019s not an issue that seems to be gaining a lot of traction out there, especially when the facts of the bill were put out there for Republican voters\u201d. One of the biggest pieces of criminal justice reform legislation Congress has passed in years, the First Step Act reduced mandatory minimum sentences for some drug-related crimes, created new rehabilitation programs for released inmates, banned the shackling of pregnant women and expanded time-served credit for most federal prisoners. Only a minority of America\u2019s prison population, the largest in the world, is incarcerated in the federal system, but one of the act\u2019s chief goals was to create programs that helped people released under the act keep out of prison for good. According to justice department data, the recidivism rate for those released under the law is just over 12%, as compared with the 45% rate the Government Accountability Office says is the baseline for federal prisoners overall. \u201cWhen we see policymakers talking about the First Step Act, and trying to make some sort of misguided connection with crime, we have to be really realistic that the research and the evidence doesn\u2019t point that way,\u201d said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, a senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive non-profit. The act\u2019s passage represented one of the few instances in which Trump and his Republican allies in Congress joined together with Democrats, and their legislative push was endorsed by outside groups as diverse as the American Civil Liberties Union and the conservative benefactors Koch Industries. The version of the act Collins introduced mostly dealt with ways to reduce recidivism, and DeSantis voted for the bill before resigning later in 2018 to mount his successful campaign for Florida governor. The Senate then added provisions dealing with sentencing reform, and as he signed it, Trump said the legislation \u201cbrings much-needed hope to many families during the holiday season\u201d. Two years later, Covid-19 broke out and crime spiked nationwide, a phenomenon that appears to be relaxing but which has had an enduring impact on American politics. The former president currently leads the polls among Republican presidential candidates, but doesn\u2019t say much about the First Step Act, having now shifted his demands to calling for Congress to slash the FBI and justice department\u2019s funding over their investigations against him. DeSantis, meanwhile, has made an about-face on criminal justice policy since announcing his presidential run in May. While he signed a major criminal justice reform bill in 2019, he last month vetoed two measures dealing with expungements and probation violations, despite them passing with overwhelming support in Florida\u2019s GOP-dominated legislature. Writing in RealClearPolitics, Steve Cortes, a spokesman for the DeSantis-aligned Never Back Down Pac, said that as a congressman, the governor only supported the initial \u201claw-and-order version\u201d of the First Step Act, and not the one that Trump enacted. \u201cThis obfuscation on Trump\u2019s jailbreak points to an even more serious problem for the 45th president as he seeks re-election: he remains unable or unwilling to admit policy mistakes and to propose appropriate reversals or reforms,\u201d Cortes wrote. Arthur Rizer, a conservative advocate for the act who co-founded ARrow Center for Justice Reform, remembers DeSantis as a supporter of the law during his time in Congress. Pence, meanwhile, at one point went to the Capitol to personally negotiate with GOP senators on getting the bill passed. The former vice-president is currently polling in the single digits among Republican candidates, while DeSantis is in a distant second place to Trump. \u201cI think that they sense that there is a potential to create another wedge issue. And they are taking this opportunity to distinguish themselves from Trump. They can\u2019t go out for Trump for the indictment stuff, so they\u2019re looking for ways to pick at him,\u201d Rizer said of the attacks on the First Step Act. \u201cIt actually breaks my heart to see people turning on something that\u2019s done a lot of good for people who were in prison for relatively minor stuff. And now that they\u2019re out with their families, and we\u2019re using it as a political football, to score points and to dunk on the other side.\u201d"

            "content": "The brother of a man who died after being assaulted in his own home has said he has been \u201cexcluded from justice\u201d after magistrates barred him from court on the grounds that his presence would put the teenage attacker under \u201cundue stress\u201d. Tom Quigley called on the Ministry of Justice to ensure bereaved relatives are not excluded from the court process after he was prevented from reading out a victim impact statement detailing his devastation at the lonely death of his older brother, David. David, 69, had a bleed on the brain after he was attacked with his walking stick in his Birkenhead home by a drunken 15-year-old boy last October. Three weeks later, after an eight-day stay in hospital, he was found dead by his brother on the kitchen floor. \u201cHe\u2019d died alone and, judging from the expression on his face, in pain. And I hadn\u2019t been there to comfort him,\u201d said Quigley, 67. He wanted the boy to understand the hurt he had caused and said he was told by police and prosecutors that he could read the statement out at the boy\u2019s sentencing hearing, which took place this month. The statement described David\u2019s kindness, including how he would buy joints of meat for those who couldn\u2019t afford a Sunday roast. \u201cHe was lovable, a character, a gentle man, a one-off,\u201d Quigley wrote.

Your true punishment is that you\u2019ll have to live with the guilt of this for the rest of your life.\u201d He planned to say that if David were in court, \u201che\u2019d have told you he forgave you. His strong Christian beliefs would have led him to that decision\u201d. But on the sentencing day, Quigley was told that the youth court magistrates had decided not to allow him to attend. His statement was read out by the prosecutor instead. Members of the public are not normally allowed into youth courts, but magistrates can use their discretion to permit victims and their loved ones to attend. Quigley was distraught that the boy\u2019s welfare had been placed above his own. \u201cIt was to be part of my healing process, my closure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was disregarded because the offender\u2019s welfare was given priority, not mine. Who was thinking of me?\u201d He believes he should have been the one to decide if he was strong enough to confront the boy, not the other way around. Ultimately, he said, \u201cthe offender was shielded. And I was excluded. Who\u2019s the one being punished here?\u201d The boy was charged with murder but this was downgraded to grievous bodily harm after a disagreement between medical experts on what had caused David\u2019s death. The pathologist who carried out the postmortem recorded three causes of death: bronchopneumonia, chronic subdural haematoma and blunt force head injury. But defence experts disagreed, saying it was not certain that the boy\u2019s violence had killed David. Quigley was left to learn about the boy\u2019s sentencing via media reports. He found it hard to read the defence dismissing the boy\u2019s actions \u2013 which began as a drunken garden-hopping incident \u2013 as him being \u201ca typical teenage tearaway\u201d. It was reported that Quigley had been banned from attending the hearing after magistrates ruled his presence would \u201cput the defendant under undue stress\u201d, with his \u201cwelfare being paramount\u201d. The defence lawyer told the magistrates that the boy was doing \u201creally well\u201d after serving 123 days on remand in youth custody. The phrase stuck in Quigley\u2019s throat. \u201cDid anyone ask how I was doing? Am I doing well?\u201d he said. \u201cMy voice went unheard. I was totally excluded from the process of justice. This just cannot be right or fair.\u201d The boy, a first-time offender, was given a 12-month youth referral order, to be served in the community, and fines totalling \u00a3146. Quigley has asked to be kept updated of the boy\u2019s progress. \u201cSome good has to come from this episode. And if it does, surely I could be told?\u201d he said. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cThis was an awful crime and our thoughts are with the family of David Quigley. While restrictions are in place to prevent the identification of young offenders, these can be removed at the discretion of the judge.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-27T03:00:24Z",
            "content": "Lawsuits challenging government and corporate inaction on the climate breakdown have become an important driver of change, according to a UN body. A report by the UN Environment Programme (Unep) and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University says litigation is setting precedents for climate action all over the world, even beyond the jurisdictions in which cases are filed. But it warns of a growing legal backlash as cases are filed that could delay climate action and criminalise activists. There have been 2,365 lawsuits relating to the climate crisis around the world, of which nearly 200 were filed in the past 12 months. The cases have covered a wide range of ground from government carbon reduction targets and strategies to corporate inaction and misinformation and claims for climate-related damages. With extreme heat gripping parts of the planet from Europe to China, and disasters likely to increase, people are increasingly turning to the courts for answers, said Andy Raine, the head of international environmental law at Unep. \u201cClimate litigation \u2026 has become an undeniably significant trend in how stakeholders are seeking to advance climate action and accountability.\u201d The majority of cases are still in the US, where a landmark constitutional trial brought by a group of young people against Montana recently drew to a close. It was one of dozens of cases filed against federal and state governments. Over the past year, Switzerland and France have been in the dock at the European court of human rights, accused of breaching the rights of their citizens, and Australia had to defend itself from allegations that it had failed to protect a group of Torres Strait Islanders from climate breakdown, which threatens to destroy their homes. The UK government was forced to redraw its net zero strategy after a successful challenge by climate campaigners. They have applied to go back to court, arguing that the revised version is still not good enough. Action is also increasingly being taken against major corporations. While there have not been any major successes in the US yet, a recent supreme court decision to keep a series of lawsuits against oil and gas firms in state court bodes well for plaintiffs. Fossil fuels are not the only polluting industry being targeted. In February, formal legal action was launched by four residents of the Indonesian island of Pari against the Swiss cement firm Holcim, demanding compensation for damages, a financial contribution to flood protection measures and the swift reduction of Holcim\u2019s CO2 emissions. Over the past year in particular, there has been an explosion in climate-related greenwashing cases, according to the LSE\u2019s latest annual review of climate litigation, including challenges to corporate climate commitments, dubious product claims, overstated investments or support for climate action, and failure to disclose climate risks. Examples include a complaint against Glencore for expanding coal production despite net zero commitments, and challenges to the EU\u2019s green investments guide. There have been some notable success stories over the past year, particularly around marketing claims. The Dutch airline KLM said it would scrap an advertising campaign in the Netherlands telling customers to \u201cfly responsibly\u201d after a lawsuit by environmental groups. And the European dairy company Arla Foods, which makes Lurpak butter, was banned by a court from using the term \u201cnet zero climate footprint\u201d when selling its products in Sweden. The LSE found that about 55% of the 549 cases where courts had made a decision had a climate-positive outcome. Although the impact of these rulings can be tricky to untangle, academics say litigation seems to be viewed as a serious issue by many businesses and financial institutions. A study recently found litigation posed a financial risk to fossil fuel firms because it lowered their share prices. Even unsuccessful litigation \u201ccan shape narratives around climate action, encouraging decision-makers to change their approach\u201d, the LSE report said. The Unep report says that as climate litigation increases in frequency and volume, the body of legal precedent will grow, \u201cforming an increasingly well-defined field of law\u201d. It notes that courts are increasingly having to handle questions of state responsibility beyond national borders and are looking at other jurisdictions for guidance in how to handle climate cases. In the future, Unep expects a rise in the number of cases related to migrants, internally displaced people and asylum seekers trying to relocate from their home countries or regions at least in part due to climate change. Indigenous communities and other groups disproportionately vulnerable to climate change are likely to bring more cases seeking policy changes or redress for climate damages. Unep also anticipates a growing number of lawsuits before and after extreme weather disasters. It warns of a growing legal backlash too, with some lawsuits seeking to delay rather than further climate action. A number of companies have sought compensation for government climate policies through secretive court systems embedded within trade treaties, while vulnerable workers and communities are challenging rules that they say disproportionately harm them and are not part of a \u201cjust transition\u201d. Climate activists around the world are also increasingly subject to criminal charges."

            "date": "2023-07-24T05:00:02Z",
            "content": "Labour will overhaul an \u201coutdated\u201d law to make it easier for transgender people to transition while maintaining protections for single-sex spaces, the party\u2019s chair and shadow equalities secretary has said. Writing in the Guardian, Anneliese Dodds accused the Conservative party of seeking to stoke \u201cculture wars\u201d by pinning its hopes for electoral success on \u201cdemonising vulnerable LGBT+ people\u201d. She set out Labour\u2019s commitment to trans people and women in the aftermath of the party\u2019s national policy forum in Nottingham, which saw delegates back a platform to be put before activists and members at the autumn conference in October. Dodds accused Lee Anderson, the Conservatives\u2019 deputy chair, of trying to \u201cstoke division\u201d when he suggested in an interview prior to his appointment that the Tories should focus on \u201ca mix of culture wars and trans debate\u201d to hold on to power. \u201cChanging gender is not a decision anyone makes lightly,\u201d wrote Dodds. \u201cThe process is intrusive, outdated and humiliating. So we will modernise, simplify and reform the gender recognition law to a new process. We will remove invasive bureaucracy and simplify the process.\u201d The Gender Recognition Act was passed by Labour in 2004 but Dodds said that \u201cnow, in 2023, we have a much better understanding of the barriers trans people face\u201d. She pointed to the legislation passed by Tony Blair\u2019s government, and the 2010 Equality Act under Gordon Brown, as among Labour\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements\u201d. Dodds accused the Scottish National party of a \u201ccavalier approach\u201d to reforming gender recognition laws, following the Scottish government\u2019s drive to support a system of self-identification that was endorsed by Holyrood but blocked by the UK government. The move \u201cseemed to be more about picking a fight with Westminster than bringing about meaningful change\u201d, claimed Dodds, adding: \u201cThe safeguards that were proposed to protect women and girls from predators who might abuse the system were simply not up to scratch.\u201d Labour would not make the same mistakes, she vowed. Dodds wrote: \u201cThe requirement to obtain a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria remains an important part of accessing a gender recognition certificate. That\u2019s especially the case now that gender dysphoria is no longer classified \u2013 and stigmatised \u2013 as a psychiatric disorder.\u201d She said that requiring a diagnosis \u201cupholds legitimacy of applications and confidence in the system\u201d. Dodds said the current process meant that \u201ca panel of anonymous doctors\u201d got to decide something of momentous significance, \u201cbased on reams of intrusive medical paperwork and evidence of any surgery\u201d. She added: \u201cThis is demeaning for trans people and meaningless in practice. A diagnosis provided by one doctor, with a registrar instead of a panel, should be enough.\u201d In a nod to the different views among some in Labour on the topic of gender and sex, Dodds said: \u201cWe need to recognise that sex and gender are different \u2013 as the Equality Act does. We will make sure that nothing in our modernised gender recognition process would override the single-sex exemptions in the Equality Act. \u201cPut simply, this means that there will always be places where it is reasonable for biological women only to have access. Labour will defend those spaces, providing legal clarity for the providers of single-sex services.\u201d Dodds acknowledged there was unlikely to be universal support for the move, suggesting \u201cthese policies will not please everyone\u201d \u2013 and attacked by those acting both \u201cin good faith and bad\u201d. She added: \u201cResponsible politics is not about doing what is easy, it\u2019s about doing what is right \u2026 Everyone deserves to be accepted, without exception and treated with respect and dignity in society.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-11T17:00:45Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt is getting it in the neck in some quarters for being insufficiently radical in his plan to \u201cunlock\u201d capital from the UK\u2019s \u00a32.5tn pot of pension savings and encourage funds to do patriotic work in boosting UK startups and UK infrastructure schemes. In truth, we should give thanks for the low-octane nature of the chancellor\u2019s \u201cMansion House reforms\u201d as they relate to pensions. Anything resembling a command from the Treasury to \u201cbuy British\u201d would have backfired. Incrementalism, in the form of a nudge to direct a few more million quid towards promising UK companies, was the only viable strategy. Of course the flagship voluntary \u201ccompact\u201d with nine of the UK\u2019s largest pension providers \u2013 the likes of Aviva, Legal &amp; General and Phoenix \u2013 sounds weak. We\u2019re talking only about defined contribution (DC) schemes, meaning those in which savers bear the investment risk, and the objective of the compact is merely to allocate at least 5% of default weightings in funds to unlisted equities by 2030. Thus one should treat with caution Hunt\u2019s boast that \u00a350bn of investment into high-growth companies \u201ccould\u201d be unlocked by the end of the decade if the rest of the DC market also steps up. But consider the dangers in alternative approaches. Compelling funds to allocate any fixed percentage would rightly have caused a riot among pension fund trustees whose first duty is towards scheme members. Trustees must be free to dodge obvious risks that come when pools of money, potentially, slosh in a new direction. One of those risks is that the era of easy pickings for infrastructure investors is over. The owners of Thames Water, for instance, are discovering that the game is sometimes more complicated than plugging numbers into a spreadsheet and watching returns compound for a couple of decades. There is also a finite number of infrastructure schemes to be funded. If too much money chases too few opportunities, returns for savers will fall. Meanwhile, the idea that access to startups represents a golden ticket is not quite accurate: picking early-stage winners is hard. Thus an aspirational 5% allocation sounds a pragmatic outcome. Younger savers, further away from retirement, should have a greater exposure to such higher-risk assets; and, since DC schemes already invest overwhelmingly in equities, it\u2019s hard to grumble about a shift towards the unlisted variety. The reform is really a case of removing restraints, such as daily pricing liquidity, that have been an artificial barrier against DC funds investing in private assets. In that regard, it is sensible. On the defined benefit (DB), or final salary, side of the pensions market, Hunt is right to think there\u2019s potential in combining local authority schemes in the interests of scale and ability to take on a wider spectrum of risk assets. But the \u201ccall for evidence\u201d on an expanded role for the pension protection fund, the pensions lifeboat, suggests the chancellor has heard the warnings from some big DB providers that a bad outcome would be one that wrecks the \u201cbuy out\u201d market that enables corporate sponsors of pension schemes to offload both assets and liabilities. Quite: the job of DB schemes is to fill the coffers to meet contractual pension obligations. If that means the safety of gilts and bonds, as it usually does, so be it. In the round, then, Hunt has produced a workable plan that carries wide support in the pensions industry and thus has a fair chance of generating a slug of extra capital for startups and productive assets. Just don\u2019t expect miracles. Real growth requires a real economic plan."

            "date": "2023-07-09T11:00:43Z",
            "content": "The supreme court has concluded another term that upended Americans\u2019 lives. Last week, the court\u2019s conservative supermajority ruled against race-conscious decisions in college admissions, overturning decades of precedent supporting affirmative action. A day later, the six conservative justices both struck down Joe Biden\u2019s student debt forgiveness plan and sided with a Colorado-based business owner who wanted to refuse service to same-sex couples. As the conservative justices\u2019 decisions attracted criticism, their behavior away from the bench also sparked alarm. Reports emerged that conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito had accepted previously undisclosed gifts and trips from wealthy stakeholders whose business interests at times clashed with cases before the supreme court. The outcry unleashed over the justices\u2019 ethics scandals, combined with the widespread disapproval of their opinions, has intensified calls to reform the supreme court. And although court reform efforts have previously been denounced as radical overreach, more Americans are warming to the idea in the face of a six-three conservative supermajority issuing decisions viewed as largely out of step with the country\u2019s principles and priorities. \u201cDemocracy is at risk,\u201d Congressman Hank Johnson, a Democrat in Georgia, said. \u201cWe must save this supreme court from itself, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we do court reform now.\u201d Confidence in supreme court plummets The combination of contentious rulings and dubious ethical behavior has culminated in plummeting ratings in that other all-powerful court: the court of public opinion. Gallup has yet to release its latest poll in the wake of the slew of recent ethics scandals and aggressive decisions released in the final days of the 2022-23 term. But the historical trend of its surveys gives a clear picture. In 2001, under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 62% of Americans approved of the way the supreme court handled its job, according to Gallup; by last September that had fallen to just 40%. Such a profound dip in popularity has ushered in a proportionate rise in demands for reform, ranging from calls for ethical guardrails for the justices to proposals for a radical makeover of the court\u2019s structure and size. One Economist/YouGov poll taken in April found that 69% of Americans support an ethics code for supreme court justices. Another AP-NORC poll taken last year showed 67% of Americans back term limits for the justices, and a Marquette Law school survey released last September found that 51% of Americans agree with calls to expand the court. Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a non-partisan group which advocates for reform, said that a growing perception that the conservative justices are acting more as politicians than as judges was driving the calls for change. \u201cI\u2019ve been beating this drum for almost 10 years, and it is definitely getting louder. The series of recent events have left no doubt today that the supreme court is a political body, and it is only rational to want the justices to have to follow the same ethical rules that politicians follow.\u201d As things currently stand, the nine supreme court justices are the only judges in the country \u2013 including both state and federal \u2013 who are not bound by any formal ethics code. The justices remain essentially unbeholden to any higher power. In April, the current chief justice, John Roberts, refused to appear before the Senate judiciary committee to discuss the ProPublica revelations about Thomas\u2019s luxury holidays courtesy of the billionaire Republican donor Harlan Crow. Roberts insisted that he and his fellow justices \u201cconsult a wide variety of authorities to address specific ethical issues\u201d \u2013 without addressing the main problem with that argument: that such consultations are entirely voluntary and self-policing. Ethics groups like Fix the Court have despaired of Roberts taking a lead on ethics reform, and are now pleading with Congress to force the issue. Roth said the current malaise was so profound it had gone beyond merely extending the existing code of ethics that, since 1973, has applied to all other federal judges. Now, he said, it had to be enforceable, with \u201ca mechanism for reprimand when there are violations\u201d. \u201cThere needs to be a more strict rubric telling justices what they can and cannot do when it comes to flying around on billionaires\u2019 planes or staying in their luxury resorts,\u201d he added. Requiring the justices to abide by clear ethical boundaries might clean up some of the grubbier optics but it would not get to the substantive problem that progressive critics have levelled at the court \u2013 its ultra-conservative rulings. \u201cRight now we have nine kings, who can set policy for eternity \u2013 their rulings cannot be undone in constitutional cases by the president or Congress,\u201d said Caroline Fredrickson, a law professor at Georgetown University. Like Roth, Fredrickson has observed a sea change in attitudes towards reforming the nation\u2019s most powerful court. \u201cFive years ago, this was a discussion more for academics than for activists. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true any more \u2013 we\u2019ve had a series of decisions that have finally brought the American public to recognise that the court is out of control.\u201d Fredrickson was one of a bipartisan group of 36 legal and other scholars who Joe Biden invited in April 2021 to form a presidential commission on supreme court reform. One of the key proposals that the commissioners analysed was the idea of expanding the court from its current nine members in order to rebalance the court in tune with the will of most Americans. The commission\u2019s final report points out that Congress has made changes to the size of the court since as early as 1801. The current nine has been set since 1869, but there is no reason that Congress could not change that number through simple statute. Commissioners were divided on the subject of expansion. Some argued that adding seats was essential to make the court relevant again and prevent the erosion of democracy, while others feared it would undermine the supreme court\u2019s independence and legitimacy. Fredrickson comes firmly down on the side of expansion. \u201cThe only realistic option for protecting our democracy is to expand the number of justices, which would allow the appointment of justices with a firmer grasp of the need to be properly deferential to the elected branches,\u201d she said. Aligned to the question of how many justices sit on the court is the issue of their longevity in the position. The US constitution says that federal judges should hold their office \u201cduring good behavior\u201d \u2013 a phrase that has been interpreted as meaning for their lifetimes. A new report from the Brennan Center spells out how life tenure has led to increasingly long terms, and with it an increasingly undemocratic court. For the first 180 years of US history, the average service for supreme court justices was 15 years; today that has risen to 26 years and the current crop could serve on average 35 years. With long terms has come a democratically skewed judicial panel. Since the presidency of George HW Bush, Republicans have won four out of nine presidential elections \u2013 only two prevailing in the popular vote \u2013 yet they have appointed six out of today\u2019s nine justices. The Brennan Center recommends a new interpretation of \u201cduring good behavior\u201d. Justices continue to serve for life, but after 18 years of actively judging cases they step back into a more supporting role \u2013 a \u201csenior\u201d status that has been applied to lower court judges for more than 100 years. Under Brennan\u2019s formula, that would be coupled with regular appointments to the bench made every two years, so that each president would have two appointments per four-year term. That could instantly put an end to the ugly hyper-partisan infighting and obstructionism that saw the Republican Senate block Merrick Garland\u2019s appointment by Barack Obama in 2016. But many progressive activists argue term limits alone will not provide an immediate remedy to their concerns. They accuse Republicans of having \u201cstolen\u201d the court by refusing to consider Garland\u2019s nomination and then fast-tracking the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett days before Biden won the 2020 election. One academic study concluded that, barring congressional intervention, the supreme court may not see a liberal majority until 2065. \u201cEven if you passed a term limits bill with a code of ethics, it wouldn\u2019t do much to put a dent into what is right now a Republican supermajority,\u201d said Brian Fallon, executive director of the progressive group Demand Justice. \u201cIf you want to restore balance to the court, if you believe that the Republicans arrived at this six-three supermajority through illicit means, then court expansion becomes necessary to achieve balance anytime soon.\u201d Political momentum builds for court reform As Americans continue to reel from the court\u2019s decision last year to overturn Roe v Wade, terminating federal protections for abortion access, the reproductive rights groups Naral Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood have both come out in favour of court expansion. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that reproductive rights and freedom are completely intertwined with the supreme court,\u201d Naral\u2019s president, Mini Timmaraju, nsaid. \u201cWe\u2019ve become really clear-eyed that it\u2019s not responsible for us to be an organisation that promotes and advocates for advancement of reproductive freedom without engaging seriously in discussions around the court.\u201d Naral was one of dozens of groups to sign on to the \u201cJust Majority\u201d project, which held events across the country this spring to advocate for court reform. The campaign included a diverse array of leaders from across the progressive movement, including racial justice organisations such as Color of Change and gun safety groups like Newtown Action Alliance. \u201cWe have to start coming to terms with just how much of a democracy we still don\u2019t have,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change. \u201cWe have an unelected, unaccountable, corrupt body of people that stand in the way of democracy, stand in the way of justice and stand in the way of the will of the people.\u201d To advance their court reform efforts, groups like Demand Justice followed the playbook of activists who lobbied against the Senate filibuster. By convincing more progressive groups to sign on to the campaign, court reform advocates have been able to persuade more Democratic lawmakers as well. Russ Feingold, a former Democratic senator of Wisconsin who served on the judiciary committee, counts himself among the converted. Feingold, now the president of the American Constitution Society, said he was uncomfortable with the idea of term limits or court expansion as recently as a couple of years ago. He said: \u201cPeople who have been much more cautious about this in the past have come to the conclusion that, if you simply allow this kind of a situation to continue for the next 20 years or so, with justices who are very ideological, very political and also in some cases unethical, then you are allowing a whole generation or more to be locked away from having a legitimate impact on the law.\u201d Some of Feingold\u2019s former congressional colleagues have adopted the same mindset. In the House, Johnson has introduced a suite of bills aimed at overhauling the court through adopting a robust code of ethics, establishing term limits and adding four justices to the bench. One of Johnson\u2019s progressive colleagues, congressman Ro Khanna of California, reintroduced his own term limit proposal last week in response to the dismantling of Biden\u2019s student debt relief programme. Asked about the possibility of expanding the court, Khanna told the Guardian: \u201cI think everything has to be on the table, but I think the supreme court term limits is the most likely and where we should focus our energy.\u201d But Johnson, like Fallon, takes an \u201call of the above\u201d approach to reforming the court. \u201cWe need to do both,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe need to unpack this court, and we need to expand this court because that will help us right now.\u201d Even as more Democratic lawmakers have endorsed court reform, the leader of their party has remained notably quiet. During the 2020 campaign, Biden shied away from backing court expansion, and progressive activists viewed his formation of the commission to study reform proposals as a \u201cpunt\u201d. Still, even a longtime institutionalist like Biden has had his faith in the court tested. After the conservative majority issued its decision ending affirmative action, Biden described the current court as \u201cnot normal\u201d. He later told MSNBC that this court has \u201cdone more to unravel basic rights and basic decisions than any court in recent history\u201d. However, he added that expanding the court would be \u201ca mistake\u201d. Fallon believes the president will be \u201cthe last domino to fall\u201d in backing court reform. But Fallon predicted Biden\u2019s endorsement of court reform will become \u201cinevitable\u201d in response to growing public outrage \u201cYou can\u2019t hide your head in the sand,\u201d Feingold said. \u201cWhen the court\u2019s been stolen, when it\u2019s been politicised, when it has the worst ethics reputation it\u2019s had in memory, then unusual measures have to be taken \u2013 not to recapture the court for the other side of the political agenda, but to restore the legitimacy of the court.\u201d"

In the past nine months alone, we have seen defenestrations from cabinet of a deputy prime minister, a party chair who had previously been chancellor and a home secretary. This unmagnificent trio is made up of Dominic Raab, Nadhim Zahawi and Suella Braverman. After the latter was forced to quit because she committed a security breach, she wrote: \u201cI have made a mistake; I take responsibility; I resign.\u201d Her supposed remorsefulness lasted less than a week. She was resurrected as home secretary just six days later because Rishi Sunak thought he needed her support to secure the premiership, making ridiculous his pieties about upholding \u201cintegrity, professionalism and accountability\u201d in public life. \u201cSir\u201d Gavin Williamson takes the palm by being ejected from the cabinet not once, not twice, but thrice. Theresa May sacked him as defence secretary because she didn\u2019t believe his denials of responsibility for leaking a discussion inside the National Security Council. Mr Johnson brought him back as education secretary only for him to perform so woefully that he was sacked again. He was recklessly restored to the top table by Mr Sunak only to be forced to quit soon afterwards pursued by complaints of bullying and accusations from a former deputy he employed of \u201cunethical and immoral\u201d methods when he was chief whip. It is not just cabinet names who have brought our politics into disrepute. The rollcall of shame also includes an alarmingly high number of junior ministers and backbenchers. It is a startling fact that more MPs have been sanctioned by the Commons and/or resigned their seats in disgrace in this parliament than in any other in history. The fallen Tories include Owen Paterson for a lobbying scandal and Neil Parish who quit as an MP after admitting to watching porn in the Commons. Imran Ahmad Khan resigned from parliament after he was sentenced to 18 months in jail for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. It hasn\u2019t been all Tories. Several Labour MPs have been sanctioned for bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct, and the SNP\u2019s Margaret Ferrier was given a 30-day suspension from the Commons for busting Covid rules. The number of MPs who have been suspended by their respective parties as a result of, or pending, misconduct investigations has at times been larger than all the Lib Dems in the Commons put together. It was a good idea to introduce the Recall of MPs Act, which puts any member penalised with a suspension of 10 or more days in peril of being booted out by their constituents at a special byelection. But this clearly has not been the deterrent against unethical or even illegal behaviour that its authors anticipated. So is this \u201cthe worst parliament in our history\u201d? An answer in the affirmative comes from the Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant in a forthcoming book entitled Code of Conduct. He delivers a lively, forensic, engrossing, sometimes entertaining, often disturbing and always unflinching interrogation of what\u2019s gone wrong with our legislature. Sir Chris is the chairman of the committees on standards and privileges, and his previous works include a masterly biography of parliament. So he knows his way around its pinnacles and its sewers. He also has firsthand experience of how grotesquely some fellow MPs can behave. First elected in 2001, when Labour was in power, he reports: \u201cI remember very clearly in my first few weeks seeing the look on a young female colleague\u2019s face when a drunken cabinet minister lunged at her, hugged her tight and felt her bottom in the division lobby against her will. She looked sickened \u2013 and frightened.\u201d He continues: \u201cThings were little better for gay men. Over the years five male MPs have felt my bottom uninvited. One of them, who was not out, did so repeatedly. Another, who is still in the House and still does not accept that he is gay, pushed me against a wall and felt my crotch. Another rubbed himself behind me in the queue to vote.\u201d There\u2019s scope to quarrel with his verdict that this parliament is the worst of all time. There were plenty of sexual predators, liars, crooks, bullies and other malefactors in previous eras and rogue politicians had a better chance of getting away with it then. If you want to be optimistic, you can argue that the record number of members who have been sanctioned in this parliament is at least in part due to the Commons becoming less tolerant of misconduct and more effective at investigating and punishing it. That said, there\u2019s no disputing Sir Chris\u2019s overarching thesis, which is that there\u2019s something rotten about the state of parliament and it needs fixing. No political era is without scandal. The distinguishing characteristic of this one is that there has been such a deluge of them. A first, vital step is for political parties to radically improve the quality control of their candidate selection processes. This year, Jared O\u2019Mara, the former Labour MP for Sheffield Hallam, was sentenced to four years in prison after abusing his position in parliament to makefraudulent expense claims to fund his consumption of cocaine and alcohol. Charlie Elphicke, the former Conservative MP for Dover, was sentenced to two years after being found guilty of three counts of sexual assault. The parties clearly need to make more strenuous efforts to scrutinise the characters of the people they put up for parliament. Even with that done, it will be sensible to assume that some bad actors will always make their way into the Palace of Westminster. So another thing we must do is consign to oblivion the \u201cgood chap\u201d theory which holds that we don\u2019t need hard and fast rules governing the conduct of politicians because we can presume that they are all decent people who will behave honourably. Even supposing that has ever really been true, that theory has now been tested to destruction. When it comes to the behaviour of politicians, we can hope for the best, but we need to guard against the worst. That means establishing truly robust rules and strict policing of them. There\u2019s a long list of things to be done. One is to deal with gaping loopholes in the controls on lobbying. The limp-wristed changes proposed by Mr Sunak\u2019s government in the wake of the Greensill scandal are deeply inadequate. We need a lot more transparency about which vested interests are getting privileged access to ministers and for what purposes. Eric Pickles, the former Conservative cabinet minister and chair of one of the watchdogs, is right to demand heavier sanctions on those who flout the rules when former ministers and civil servants land lucrative roles with commercial entities hoping to profit from their insider knowledge and networks. The \u201cindependent adviser\u201d who is supposed to invigilate ministerial behaviour will never be properly independent for so long as their ability to investigate rule-breaking is entirely dependent on the say-so of the prime minister. The role needs to be empowered with the right to initiate investigations and determine breaches of the ministerial code. I agree with Sir Chris when he says that politicians are not all \u201cequally dire\u201d and depicting the lot of them as scumbags threatens to \u201csubvert democracy itself\u201d. The decent types should be alarmed that the rotten ones are poisoning the collective reputation of politicians. Polling suggests that a big majority of the public have become deeply cynical about their elected representatives. MPs as a body desperately need to restore public respect and trust. The voters do not expect parliament to be a communion of saints, but it is extremely toxic for our democracy when they think of it as a cesspit of sin.

He states that \u201cour electoral law is outdated, with loopholes so large they could be seen from space\u201d. Therein lies the real problem: our whole system was designed before anyone could look down from above. Political parties and institutions were mostly established in previous centuries. Limited reforms have been corrupted. Now, most in power adopt protectionist approaches to suit themselves rather than new needs. Why, for example, should we even still accept that it is right to pay an individual subscription to be a member of any party seeking to legislate, then argue over who is expelled if views do not absolutely coincide with current leaderships? But much can be changed. Solutions can be taken out of the grip of those with most vested interests. We have the independent Electoral Commission. Its constant tracker of public attitudes shows a majority think political funding should be reformed and regulated. That will sadly not happen in this turbulent pre-election year. But 2030 would be a good target, coinciding with UN sustainable development goals, for the Electoral Commission to bring forward root and branch reforms of the way we run our political system, considering the best 21st-century global examples and thinking.

            "date": "2023-07-17T14:56:57Z",
            "content": "Scientists say \u201cturbo-charged\u201d climate change is driving the prolonged period of record temperatures currently baking much of the planet. As the planet has heated, hotter-than-usual spells have become more intense and now last on average about 24 hours longer than 60 years ago, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Noaa data from the 50 most populous cities in the US shows the heatwave season is 49 days longer now compared with the 1960s. The effects of heat on health are cumulative, and the body only starts to recover when the temperature drops below 27C (80F). Even small temperature rises can result in increased deaths and illness. \u201cExtreme heat is killer heat, and multiple-day heatwaves \u2013 and early-season ones \u2013 are the biggest threat, because people can\u2019t get a break and the body can only sustain it for so long,\u201d said Brenda Ekwurzel, the director of climate science for the climate and energy programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US. \u201cThese are not isolated heat events; this is what the turbo-charged climate change world looks like.\u201d In Phoenix, Arizona, the National Weather Service has issued a \u201cvery dangerous long-duration heat\u201d alert for the second consecutive week, with daily temperatures expected to fluctuate between 29C (85F) and 47C (118F). Temperatures in Europe are about 10-15C hotter than usual, and the heatwave is lasting a long time, as an established high-pressure system across the region is causing temperatures to climb every day. Clouds of Saharan dust are also making conditions worse. The sun has heated the sea, too, which is causing a feedback loop, prolonging the heatwave on land. Usually cool air blowing off the Mediterranean brings some relief. \u201cUnusually high sea surface temperatures are also occurring across the region, with many parts of the Mediterranean seeing surface temperatures as high as 25-28C,\u201d said Rebekah Sherwin, a meteorologist from the Met Office\u2019s global forecasting team. \u201cThis will exacerbate the effects of the heat over surrounding land areas, as even in coastal regions overnight temperatures are unlikely to drop much below the mid-20s celsius.\u201d Even though in the UK we may feel relief that we have escaped the deadly temperatures of mainland Europe, the effects can still be expected to reach us. Gareth Redmond-King, the head of the international programme at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cEven as Britain experiences a gloomy and relatively cool July, the extreme heat and droughts, torrential rains and flooding around the world have a direct hit for us too. We import half our food \u2013 half of that comes from climate-vulnerable countries. As harvests are hit by climate disasters, supplies are constrained and prices rise.\u201d While the current heatwaves are not solely caused by global heating \u2013 El Ni\u00f1o has a part to play \u2013 scientists say they have certainly been made worse, and more likely, by climate breakdown and fossil fuel emissions. \u201cWe can be in absolutely no doubt that a critical driver behind this warming trend is carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels,\u201d said Dr Leslie Mabon, a lecturer in environmental systems at the Open University. \u201cUntil we rapidly reduce emissions from fossil fuels, extremes like the heatwave we are seeing in Europe at the moment are going to become more and more likely. \u201cThe differences that we are seeing in the extent of warming both globally and between regions of Europe are also a stark reminder that the Earth\u2019s climate is a complex system. As we get to higher degrees of warming, the danger of feedback loops or unexpected events occurring becomes greater.\u201d And when will it end? In Europe, some areas will cool down a little by the middle of this week, but this will not be the case for the entire continent. Some parts are still being forecast to have potentially record-breaking temperatures by the weekend. According to the Met Office, the heatwave could last another week and probably longer in some areas. \u201cThere are no signs of any major changes in weather type the next couple of weeks at present,\u201d Nicola Maxey, a Met Office spokesperson, said. Prof Julienne Stroeve, a professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London, said this was because a heat dome stretching from north-west Africa to southern Europe \u201cappears to be stuck in place\u201d."

            "date": "2023-07-09T12:00:45Z",
            "content": "Science fiction has always dealt with worst-case scenarios when imagining our possible futures, and the climate has often formed the backdrop of the human struggles. Some of the biggest names writing in the genre have tackled the climate crisis and its apocalyptic or dystopian consequences \u2013 Margaret Atwood\u2019s Oryx and Crake, Cormac McCarthy\u2019s The Road, Bruce Sterling\u2019s Heavy Weather. But a new generation of writers now believes it is impossible to write \u201cnear future\u201d sci-fi without putting the climate emergency at the forefront of their speculative fiction. For many, this is because they are living through the crisis and can imagine all too easily what may happen if real-life behaviour doesn\u2019t change. \u201cMy writing has always been drawn from my own worries and fears, so it was perhaps inevitable that I would choose to write about the climate emergency,\u201d says Rachelle Atalla, a Glasgow-based Scottish-Egyptian author whose second novel, Thirsty Animals, came out this year. \u201cI have long been interested in water \u2013 all life [is] dependent upon it, yet we are also happy to exploit it as a commodity. Particularly in the UK, we behave with the assumption that there will always be an abundance of drinking water.\u201d Atalla\u2019s book follows a young woman and her mother living on a farm in the Scottish borders during a devastating drought. Enticed by visions of almost bottomless lochs of cool water in Scotland, there is a flood of immigrants from England \u2013 until the Scottish government closes the border, huge refugee camps build up and desperate English families who cross are shot. Atalla says: \u201cWriting Thirsty Animals was an opportunity to bring the realities of climate change and its displacement closer to home. I wanted to really interrogate human behaviour and ask: as our natural resources begin to dwindle, do we take a community-based approach in pursuit of active change? Or do we turn inwards and focus on our individualistic desire to survive?\u201d Climate change is becoming so prevalent in fiction that there have been attempts to label it \u2013 not entirely successfully \u2013 with its own sub-genre classification \u2013 cli-fi. But just as Atwood said of her MaddAddam trilogy, \u201cIt\u2019s not climate change, it\u2019s everything change\u201d, so many of the current crop of science fiction authors feel you can\u2019t actually write about the future without mentioning the threat to the planet. \u201cI think it would be hard to write near future SF that feels plausible without acknowledging climate breakdown in some way, even if it\u2019s implicit rather than explicit in how it touches people\u2019s lives,\u201d says EJ Swift. Her novel The Coral Bones, published last year, centres on the Great Barrier Reef in a David Mitchell-esque narrative split between three women \u2013 one in the 19th century, one in the present day and one in a future ravaged by global warming. \u201cSeeing images of corals bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, I kept thinking about how it would feel to be on the frontline, having to witness the devastation to these extraordinary ecosystems,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to write about how our relationship with the more-than-human world has led us to this crisis, and how we might change. \u201cClimate breakdown is escalating so rapidly that events which 10 years ago might have seemed like the distant future are happening now. Everything is filtered through that lens \u2013 even when it\u2019s not the main focus, climate anxiety is there in the periphery.\u201d Other recent books dealing with the devastation to the climate include Kate Sawyer\u2019s The Stranding, which begins with the striking image of two strangers sheltering in the mouth of a dead, beached whale as a calamitous extinction event hits the world, Susannah Wise\u2019s This Fragile Earth, in which the complete failure of all technology brings into focus our uneasy relationship with nature, and Sarah K Jackson\u2019s Not Alone, about a mother and son surviving in the aftermath of a microplastics storm that has decimated the population. The science fiction writer Adrian Tchaikovsky, known for his huge, widescreen space opera novels set in distant galaxies, is turning his attention to the climate crisis next year with a horror novella called Saturation Point. \u201cWith the very real science and facts of climate change becoming ever more present and felt in our here and now, is it any wonder that more science fiction writers are using their stories to write cautionary tales of a future where humanity will be forced to adapt and change in order to survive?\u201d says Julie Crisp, a literary agent working mainly with science fiction and fantasy. Science fiction has always sounded a warning about human behaviour and its possible consequences, she adds. \u201cIt deals with a futuristic imagining based on the scientific, moral and social principles of the \u2018now\u2019 \u2013 and the author taking them a step further, into the \u2018then\u2019. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the imaginings of George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four and a dystopian future cowed by mass surveillance and regimentation of its people or Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, with its patriarchal and white supremacist control over women\u2019s bodies \u2013 science fiction has shown readers what can happen should the worst actions of society follow an upward trajectory and become a dystopian style-future.\u201d She cites Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s The Ministry for the Future and Imbolo Mbue\u2019s How Beautiful We Were as examples of authors using climate change \u201cto paint a grim picture of where, should the inertia of humanity to change their destructive actions continue, it will lead to a future that none of us want\u201d."

            "date": "2023-07-06T10:00:03Z",
            "content": "Although locally acquired malaria cases were recently discovered in the United States for the first time in 20 years, infectious disease experts say they do not signal imminent danger but instead are an indicator that the number of cases of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes to humans will likely increase in the coming decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning sign for ensuring that there are good public health interventions in place, good mosquito surveillance in place, and that people are just aware that this could be a growing problem,\u201d said Jackie Cook, associate professor of malaria epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. Earlier this month, a handful of malaria cases cropped up in Florida and Texas. The Florida department of health reported that there were two locally acquired malaria cases in Sarasota county, following two other locally acquired malaria cases that were reported in the state earlier this year. In Texas, a single resident \u201cwho spent time working outdoors in Cameron county\u201d was diagnosed with malaria. These cases are particularly significant because the patients were infected with the disease locally, rather than becoming sick after traveling to places where the disease is endemic, such as sub-Saharan Africa. The last time there were cases identified in the United States in which people acquired malaria locally was in 2003. Now, experts project an increase in mosquito-borne disease cases because of warming global temperatures. Malaria is a potentially fatal disease transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms include fever, shaking, chills, headache, muscle aches and tiredness, according to the CDC. People who traveled to an area where malaria occurred and are experiencing such symptoms should seek medical care and tell the healthcare provider where they traveled. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory on Monday stating that the Florida and Texas cases could mean a rise in imported malaria cases due to international summer travel. There are effective treatments against malaria \u2013 \u201cas long as you get them promptly\u201d, Cook said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get treated, that\u2019s when you get the much more severe symptoms. That\u2019s when you can end up with respiratory failure, kidney failure and coma.\u201d It\u2019s also important that people take measures to protect themselves from mosquitoes, Cook said. Precautions include wearing insect repellent, lighting citronella candles and installing window screens to prevent mosquitoes flying indoors. \u201cPublic health officials need to get everyone attuned to the reality that they should be using mosquito control, which means that if they are going to be outdoors,\u201d especially at dawn and dusk, because the mosquitoes that can transmit malaria tend to bite then, \u201cthey absolutely need to be wearing mosquito repellent\u201d, said Dr Aileen Marty, an infectious disease expert at Florida International University. The public can also expect mosquitoes to transmit malaria more easily in the future for the same reason that wildfires are worsening across the United States: the climate crisis, according to climate and disease experts. The warming temperatures and increased rainfall mean that there will be more mosquito breeding sites, Cook said. Mosquitoes will also be able to breed faster and feed more, \u201cso they bite more people\u201d and have \u201cmore chances to spread the infection\u201d. \u201cThe prediction from climate change scientists is that we are going to see this greater spread of vector-borne diseases in places where we have previously eliminated [them],\u201d Cook said. She suggested that public health officials take steps such as fogging (spraying small amounts of insecticide into the air to kill mosquitoes), draining standing water and educating people on how they can protect themselves from mosquitoes. In spite of the projected increase in malaria cases, Marty and Cook both said the Texas and Florida cases are not cause for panic. \u201cIt\u2019s cause for knowledge,\u201d Marty said. \u201cIt\u2019s cause for appropriate behavior to reduce risk.\u201d"

US expected to include cluster bombs in aid package to Kyiv The US is expected to announce a new weapons aid package to Kyiv on Friday, and Reuters is reporting that cluster bombs will be among the weapons included. Human Rights Watch has called on Russia and Ukraine to stop using these controversial weapons, which break apart in the air and release large numbers of smaller bomblets across a wide area. Cluster bombs pose great risk to civilians long after their use: while the bomblets are designed to detonate on hitting the ground, seriously injuring or killing anyone in the area, up to 40% of bomblets have failed to explode in some recent conflicts, essentially becoming undetonated landmines. The indiscriminate destruction of cluster bombs has human rights groups saying that the use of them in populated areas is a violation of international humanitarian law. More than 120 countries have signed the convention on cluster munitions, prohibiting the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of the weapons \u2013 but Russia, Ukraine and the US have all declined to sign the treaty.

            "content": "In an effort to slash carbon emissions and provide relief from extreme heat, governments across the nation and globally have pledged to plant trees. But the US is not equipped with the tree seedlings to furnish its own plans, according to a new study. US tree nurseries do not grow nearly enough trees to bring ambitious planting schemes to fruition, and they also lack the plant species diversity those plans require, according to research published in the journal Bioscience on Monday, For the study, 13 scientists examined 605 plant nurseries across 20 northern states. Only 56 of them \u2013 or less than 10% \u2013 grow and sell seedlings in the volumes needed for conservation and reforestation. The team, led by two scientists at the University of Vermont\u2019s Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, also found that forest nurseries tend to maintain a limited inventory of a select few species of trees, with priority placed on trees valued for commercial timber production. As a result, nurseries suffer from an \u201coverwhelming scarcity of seedlings\u201d that are well-suited for climate plans, the authors write. \u201cDespite the excitement and novelty of that idea in many policy and philanthropy circles \u2013 when push comes to shove, it\u2019s very challenging on the ground to actually find either the species or the seed sources needed,\u201d said Peter Clark, a forest ecologist at the University of Vermont, who led the new study. The research comes as swaths of the US face relentless heatwaves. Phoenix, which has experienced record-shattering heat this summer, has said it intends to plant 200 trees a mile in select areas, and has invested $1.5m into the plan. Many US municipalities have made similar tree planting pledges. On the federal level, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided money for the US Forest Service to plant more than 1bn trees in the next nine years. And the World Economic Forum also aims to help plant 1tn trees around the world by 2030. But trees that can thrive amid local ecological and climate conditions are crucial to meeting such plans, and many nurseries the researchers examined had no stock available of seedlings that have adapted to local conditions. The researchers also found a dearth of \u201cfuture-climate-suitable\u201d varieties, or varieties that will survive amid worsening heat and extreme weather conditions. Trees that play key roles in local ecosystems were also scarce, the study found. The red spruce, for instance, is highly carbon-sequestering and serves as a habitat for many species, but has been threatened in recent decades by development and acid rain. \u201cEfforts are in the works to restore the species, [but] in our investigation, we found only two nurseries that sold the species,\u201d said Clark. Many factors led to the dearth of crucial seedlings, said Clark. Among them: the decline of government nurseries. \u201cIn recent years, many states have elected to close their publicly funded nurseries because of budgetary concerns and the economics haven\u2019t supported maintaining it in the eyes of those writing the checks,\u201d said Clark. The decline of nurseries has also resulted in a loss of knowledge about seeds. And skilled seed collectors are also becoming rarer, meaning diverse seeds are becoming harder for nurseries to obtain, Clark added. The researchers argue that dramatic increases in both seedling production and diversity at many regional nurseries will be central to any successful campaign to address climate crisis with tree planting. The research calls for expanded federal and state investment into government owned and operated tree nurseries, as well as public seed collection efforts. \u201cThis strategy may stimulate production from private nurseries once a stable demand is apparent,\u201d they write."

            "content": "Emissions from materials and vehicles used in infrastructure construction will soon be measured consistently across Australia so governments can consider pollution, as well as cost, speed of completion and build quality of construction firms\u2019 competing bids. The commonwealth and states and territories have endorsed a plan from the New South Wales government to decarbonise infrastructure projects, a key part of which is measuring and valuing embodied emissions. In construction, embodied emissions refers to the carbon emitted through the production and transportation of materials such as concrete and steel, as well as from a project\u2019s eventual decommissioning. Unlike emissions generated directly by a project\u2019s function \u2013 on a railway line, for example, the diesel or electricity used to power the rolling stock \u2013 embodied emissions have been notoriously difficult to measure and have largely not been factored into the bidding process. Industry and climate advocates have warned that construction companies have had little incentive to innovate their supply chain and design choices to minimise indirect emissions. These emissions are thought to account for up to 10% of Australia\u2019s total emissions, according to government estimates, and are considered important to address for the country and states to meet net zero commitments. NSW has been a frontrunner in planning to tackle embodied emissions, with the infrastructure minister in the former Coalition government, Rob Stokes, outlining a plan last year to reduce the emissions inpublic works by 2027. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The plan has been continued by the Labor government and transport minister, Jo Haylen. At a transport and infrastructure ministers\u2019 meeting in Perth last month, the commonwealth and states and territories endorsed NSW\u2019s model. NSW\u2019s now nationally backed framework will develop a consistent metric to quantify emissions, which will be brought to the ministers\u2019 meeting in mid-2024 for agreement. Haylen said it was time for governments both in NSW and around Australia \u201cto reassert their role as leaders in emissions reduction\u201d. \u201cAfter a decade in the slow lane, Australian governments are now on the fast track to greener infrastructure, with NSW leading the nation on this critical work,\u201d Haylen said. \u201cIndustry is crying out for certainty to allow them to make smart investment and procurement decisions, drive down costs and reduce environmental impacts,\u201d she said. The CEO of the Climateworks Centre, Anna Skarbek, welcomed the NSW model. \u201cThis recognises the life cycle of emissions has many steps in it,\u201d she said, suggesting that cost-benefit analysis decisions for governments to fund certain infrastructure projects may not stack up under the new model.\u201d The project manager of infrastructure at Climateworks Centre, Rebecca Powell, said Australia was \u201cbehind the ball\u201d on embodied emissions compared with Europe. She said the approach to value carbon was also significant. \u201cThe valuing question is, if you have measured the emissions, what value do you place on removing them? \u201cThere might be a situation where when you consider the lifecycle emissions to build a new road, the answer might be to build public transport instead,\u201d Powell said. The CEO of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, Adrian Dwyer, said that under the model, governments could set thresholds for projects to encourage better industry practices. Dwyer said this was important because there are no clear technology to improve concrete and steel production to be less emissions intensive \u2013 both materials which are \u201cubiquitous\u201d and difficult to replace in construction. \u201cIf you\u2019re measuring consistently you can compare across projects, so for example, a government could say we will only accept proposals of 700 units of carbon, and that might mean one bid changes its design to use a higher-strength concrete but less overall, or electric vehicles to be used more in production.\u201d"

            "content": "Driving an electric car on a single charge from London to Milan sounds like an impossible dream. Yet Japanese carmaker Toyota claims that by 2027 motorists will be able to buy such a vehicle. Running the air conditioner at full blast might reduce such an impressive range, but Toyota says drivers will be able to recharge in 10 minutes before they are back on the road. If this all sounds too good to be true, that\u2019s because it probably is. What Toyota says it has found is nothing less than the holy grail of battery technology \u2013 the so-called solid state solution \u2013 which has long eluded the industry. Instead of a liquid core, the new battery has a solid one between electrodes. This means it is smaller and can store more energy \u2013 delivering a bigger range for the same weight. The heavy flammable liquid cores can also overheat and explode. Since 2017, UK emergency services have attended hundreds of electric vehicle fires. Rapid technological advances have historically been the norm in capitalism. Rich-world governments have rightly come to see electric cars as an essential way to reduce air pollution and crack down on climate-warming emissions, while satisfying an individual\u2019s desire for personal transportation. Compared with combustion-engine cars, they have significant environmental benefits. But the climate crisis should be a chance to question whether the motorcar itself has become too embedded in our everyday lives. The future of \u201cmobility\u201d must involve much more than private cars. It would be churlish not to recognise that the Japanese carmaker\u2019s announcement is a form of progress. There should be a sensible place for cars as part of an integrated transport plan in the years to come. As Toyota has been a sceptical voice about electric vehicles, a change of heart, if sincere, is to be welcomed. The company had previously staked its future on its range of hybrid-engine cars, powered by both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, arguing that shortages of key battery materials and insufficient charging infrastructure would prevent a universal switch to electric vehicles in the short term. Whether Toyota will be able to leapfrog its rivals remains to be seen, however, as mass production requires a far more stringent level of quality control and reliability. But even a low-carbon-emitting car remains a low-capacity mode of transportation. Doubling down on its near-monopoly over the surface transportation system would lead to a future of ever-worsening congestion and road accidents, which currently cost 30 lives in the UK every week. Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, allegedly tried to kill the California high-speed rail project in 2013. A decade later the electric bullet train has announced it will be solar-powered. Industry lobbying in the 1930s helped pave the way for a US lifestyle dependent on cars and oil. That must not be replicated for electric vehicles today. The global north cannot just bet on a Toyota- or Tesla-style decarbonisation. The volume of critical minerals needed for decarbonising the rich world on its current growth path would leave nothing for poorer nations. Sunsetting undesirable technologies and infrastructures (such as carbon-intensive motoring) must be accompanied by a recognition that we all have to live within the world\u2019s material constraints. In the richer world that must mean prioritising mass transportation and rethinking urban planning, not vesting so much hope in our current pattern of living continuing unchanged."

            "date": "2023-07-24T11:00:08Z",
            "content": "New oil and gas licences for the North Sea that the UK government has approved in the past two years will produce as much carbon dioxide as the annual emissions of nearly 14m cars, or the entire yearly emissions of Denmark, analysis has shown. This amount \u2013 about 28m tonnes of carbon dioxide over the lifetimes of the fields \u2013 will be increased more than eightfold, if potential licences under consideration are also granted, according to data from public sources analysed by Greenpeace. Three large oil and gasfields have been approved since the International Energy Agency warned in May 2021 that no new developments of fossil fuels could be constructed if the world was to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The IEA report was conducted at the behest of the UK government, which was preparing to host the Cop26 climate summit. Since then, the government has put in place a \u201cclimate checkpoint\u201d, assessing potential new licences before drilling can take place. But the checks focus on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with exploring and operating new fields, rather than taking into account the emissions \u2013 known in climate jargon as \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions \u2013 that are generated from burning the fossil fuels produced from the fields. Greenpeace argues that failing to take these emissions into account in official impact assessments makes a mockery of the UK\u2019s climate goals. In a court case expected to be heard on Tuesday, the group will seek to establish that the government\u2019s actions are unlawful. Philip Evans, a campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \u201cAs large parts of Europe, North America and Asia are gripped by a hellish heatwave, we can see that the climate crisis is spiralling out of control, yet the government is insisting on massively expanding oil and gas drilling that will only make it worse. \u201cAs if that wasn\u2019t scandalous enough, when making these decisions ministers deliberately ignore the emissions from burning all these new fossil fuels. That\u2019s grossly irresponsible.\u201d Government ministers face a fresh assault on green issues. The byelection held in Boris Johnson\u2019s former seat, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, was judged to have been lost by Labour, which keenly targeted the seat but was defeated by a margin of 495 votes, because of voter concern over the expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez). Ulez, which was originated by Johnson and stipulated by the Conservative energy secretary, Grant Shapps, in an agreement with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, will affect only one in 10 motorists. However, many people in the highly car-dependent constituency raised concerns before its rollout, scheduled for the end of August. The byelection result has revived a culture war in the media in which rightwing Conservatives and elements within the Labour party have pushed for rolling back green measures. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, stoked fears for the party\u2019s green commitments at the weekend, saying the party was \u201cdoing something very wrong\u201d. A Tory party source told the Guardian there would \u201cdefinitely\u201d be more to come from Shapps, who has repeatedly called Labour \u201cthe political wing of Just Stop Oil\u201d. Before the byelection result, the climate minister Graham Stuart said there was cross-party agreement on the need to achieve net zero but told the Guardian the Labour party was \u201cthe lunatic fringe\u201d. Khan is understood to want to push ahead with Ulez, with local campaigners arguing that the Uxbridge campaign was characterised by \u201cdirty tricks\u201d that misrepresented the scheme, and the mayor believes the reality would reassure voters. Sources within the Labour party told the Guardian Starmer was not feeling pressure to change his stance on green issues. Greenpeace will argue in the judicial review hearing that the government is reneging on its climate commitments by giving the green light to new oil and gasfields in the North Sea. The three largest approved since the IEA report are Jackdaw, Abigail and Talbot, the emissions from which are the equivalent of seven coal-fired power stations, according to Greenpeace. If Rosebank and Cambo, two other large fields under review, are approved the total will rise to about 240m tonnes of CO2, equivalent to running 64 coal-fired power plants for a year, or the annual emissions of Spain. Evans said: \u201cRishi Sunak\u2019s government seems to have stopped listening to the experts on climate. Instead, they are bending over backwards to promote the interests of the fossil fuel industry, at the expense of bill-payers and the climate.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cDevelopment proposals for oilfields under existing licences are a matter for the regulators, with the environmental impact of proposed developments subject to rigorous regulatory assessment, including a full environmental impact assessment and public consultation. \u201cThe transition to non-fossil forms of energy cannot happen overnight and even when we\u2019re net zero, we will still need some oil and gas, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee. Sourcing gas domestically is also better for the environment as it has a lower carbon footprint than importing from abroad.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-10T15:00:19Z",
            "content": "Companies should drop offsetting-based environmental claims and adopt a \u201cclimate contribution\u201d model instead, according to a new quality standard. In a new code of practice, the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) has published guidance on how companies should use carbon credits as part of high-quality corporate action. It recommends that firms should disclose their emissions every year, show they are successfully meeting a science-based target aligned with the Paris agreement, and only use carbon credits to contribute to climate mitigation, moving away from claims that they have \u201ccancelled out\u201d their emissions by purchasing offsets. The rules, which are limited to voluntary corporate action on the climate, were the result of consultation with civil society, the private sector, Indigenous communities and governments. They aim to introduce a standardised method for assessing the quality of corporate claims amid accusations of greenwashing and intense scrutiny of the carbon offsetting industry. The VCMI recommends firms should buy high-quality credits from a separate standards body, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), which will release its recommendations on what counts as a \u201cgood\u201d carbon credit later this summer. \u201cWe frame the use of carbon credits our companies might make as contributions above and beyond what they should be doing to decarbonise themselves,\u201d said Mark Kenber, executive director of the VCMI. \u201c[Claims of carbon neutrality using offsets] were understandably contentious. We\u2019ve taken them off the table for now. We will reconsider them. A lot of companies would like to make them as they see it as a differentiator but it\u2019s probably the area that causes most confusion. Of course, there are both lawsuits and emerging bits of regulation in the UK and EU. It would be foolish to pre-empt any of that,\u201d he said. The Nestl\u00e9 chocolate bar KitKat, fast-food chain Leon, and Albert, the UK film and TV industry\u2019s sustainability certification operated under Bafta, are the latest organisations to move away from claims of \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d based on offsets. They have joined Gucci, easyJet and the US airline JetBlue in moving away from offsetting-based claims in adverts as regulators in the UK and EU crack down on climate claims in adverts. In California, Delta Air Lines is facing a lawsuit over its $1bn (\u00a3780m) carbon neutrality claim that plaintiffs say is \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d as it relies on offsets that do little to mitigate global heating. Delta has said the lawsuit is without legal merit and insisted it is a vigorous advocate for more sustainable aviation. The case in part relies on a joint Guardian investigation in January which found that more than 90% of rainforest offsets from Verra, the leading certifier, were largely worthless, often based on stopping the destruction of rainforests that were not threatened, according to independent studies. Verra strongly disputed the findings. \u201cA starting point for this was in the FT during Cop26 where every other page was a full-page ad by a company making spurious climate claims. We felt there\u2019s a need for some clarity and some consistency on this,\u201d said Kenber, who founded Verra and still sits on its board. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna solve the climate change through voluntary action. We all know that.\u201d Gilles Dufrasne, a policy officer with Carbon Market Watch, said the time for carbon neutrality claims was over. \u201cCompanies must step up their transparency game and provide real information that consumers can understand. Beyond reducing their emissions, the richest companies have a responsibility to contribute finance to climate action, even in sectors that they are not directly impacting. If the largest and richest companies do not step up to provide the finance that we urgently need, then who will?\u201d he said. In a statement, Nestl\u00e9 said it was moving away from investing in carbon offsets for its brands, such as KitKat and Nespresso, opting instead to reduce emissions in their supply chain. A spokesperson said its net zero roadmap did not rely on offsets. It is understood that Leon, which previously claimed to be selling \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d burgers using offsets, will no longer say that in adverts. The firm remains fully committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030 for its scope 1 and 2 emissions, a company spokesperson confirmed. Albert, which the BBC, Netflix, Sky and other major broadcasters all use for TV and film production, dropped its \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d stamp at the end of May and introduced a new logo. The purchase of carbon credits remains an obligatory part of the certification process although this is under review, the Guardian understands."

            "date": "2023-07-25T04:00:30Z",
            "content": "Airlines flying to Heathrow have been told to carry as much fuel as possible in their tanks because of supply problems at Britain\u2019s largest airport, in a controversial practice that can increase carbon emissions. The airport asked airlines to carry excess fuel on the way to London and to avoid carrying too much when departing, citing supply issues, in a notice sent on Sunday. The notice covered nine days from Sunday 23 July to Monday 31 July. Heathrow said there had been no impact on passengers or flights from the request. Fuel tankering is controversial because the practice significantly increases the weight of kerosene stored in the aircraft\u2019s wings. That extra weight increases the amount of fuel burned on a flight, and therefore its carbon footprint. Yet despite the extra cost and carbon emissions, it can be financially worthwhile for airlines if fuel is cheaper at one airport than at another. In Europe alone the practice produces 900,000 tonnes of unnecessary carbon emissions a year \u2013 equivalent to about 2,800 flights between Paris and New York \u2013 according to a 2019 study by Eurocontrol, an air traffic controllers\u2019 group. The main reason for tankering was to avoid higher prices at some airports, saving airlines a combined \u20ac265m (\u00a3229m), Eurocontrol said, although airlines also used it occasionally if strikes threatened to disrupt refuelling. British Airways, the UK\u2019s flag carrier airline, is among companies that have previously been accused of regular tankering. The Times last month reported that BA had regularly used fuel tankering since 2019, when it had promised to \u201creview\u201d the practice after a BBC Panorama investigation. The world\u2019s bestselling plane, the Airbus A320, has the capacity to carry upwards of 24,000 litres of fuel, weighing 19 tonnes, in tanks in its wings and the main body of the plane. For shorter routes not all of the capacity would be required. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cThe airport has sufficient fuel supplies and passengers can be reassured that their flights will continue to operate as normal.\u201d The airport declined to comment on the cause of the supply issue. Fuel arrives at the west London airport via underground pipelines and is then delivered to one of two facilities. Some fuel is also delivered by truck. Heathrow airport does not have day-to-day control over fuel supply, which is handled instead by Heathrow Hydrant Operating Company and Heathrow Airport Fuel Company, which are both owned by consortiums of oil companies. So large is the demand for fuel for Heathrow that it requires a constant supply transported via pipeline from ExxonMobil\u2019s Fawley refinery near Southampton. The UK\u2019s largest refinery, it takes in as many as 2,000 shipments of crude oil a year which are distilled into petrol and diesel for cars and lorries, as well as jet fuel and chemicals for use in industry. ExxonMobil is also building a replacement pipeline to the airport. The global aviation industry is already struggling with its reputation on the environment, as forecasters expect global demand for air travel to soar as poorer countries grow wealthier. Manufacturers have been so far unable to build a plane capable of long-range travel without emitting carbon into the atmosphere. In the absence of a zero-emissions technology, airlines and airports such as Heathrow are starting to use so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that produces net zero emissions because it is made from plants or from carbon captured from the air. However, SAF is still in short supply."

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cHWL Ebsworth has now confirmed that information relating to its work with several Victorian Government departments and agencies has been released by cyber criminals to the dark web,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe are taking this matter extremely seriously, and are working in partnership with the commonwealth government.\u201d Cullen said there was no direct breach of the government\u2019s IT systems. HWL Ebsworth has contacted departments and agencies affected by the hack to confirm what information has been exposed. On Friday night the Queensland government said HWL Ebsworth had advised that \u201cdocuments relating to a limited number of department\u2019s [sic] files were included in the breach\u201d. \u201cThe Department of Home Affairs continues to work with HWL Ebsworth and affected government agencies as it investigates the extent of the breach, including exposure of Queensland government information and related consequences arising from this exposure,\u201d a state government spokesperson said. \u201cThe Queensland government takes the privacy of its data holdings seriously and is working with HWL Ebsworth to understand what information may have been disclosed. \u201cShould our clients\u2019 personal information be affected, the individual departments will work with HWL Ebsworth to ensure affected individuals are notified as soon as possible, and offer assistance and support as required.\u201d Last month, the law firm obtained an injunction order in the NSW supreme court in a bid to prevent the hackers from disclosing its stolen information. The order was also an attempt to prevent dissemination of the published material. One outcome of the injunction is that HWL Ebsworth clients must wait for the firm to inform them if their sensitive information has been caught up in the breach. HWL Ebsworth has several hundred clients, including dozens of federal government agencies, according to Austender contracts. A recent study by cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks found Blackcat was one of the top three ransomware groups targeting Australia. On Tuesday the national cybersecurity coordinator, Darren Goldie, met with commonwealth, state and territory agencies and HWL Ebsworth about the law firm\u2019s affected clients. Goldie described the breach as an \u201cevolving incident\u201d and said there could be additional impacts that had not yet been identified. A Victorian government spokesperson said it was working with the law firm to understand the extent of the data breach. \u201cWe have been advised by HWL Ebsworth that information affected includes highly sensitive documents from legal files with state government departments and agencies,\u201d they said. \u201cWe know this could be a distressing situation for the people affected and we are working to notify all those affected as soon as possible.\u201d They said Victorian government departments and agencies will provide tailored advice and support to people affected by the breach. The law firm has partnered with Australia\u2019s national identity and cyber support community service, IDCARE, to provide assistance for people affected, the chief information security officer said."

            "date": "2023-07-13T13:05:50Z",
            "content": "There are many things wrong with the north of England\u2019s railway network: 11th-hour cancellations, dilapidated Victorian infrastructure, two-carriage trains that ought to be six. To this list, we can now add: mispronunciation of stations. It is a problem that Northern Trains has promised to remedy \u2013 with passengers\u2019 help. The operator recently had to re-record all of its onboard announcements so that they were compatible with its new fleet of trains. With 500 station names to read out, it is perhaps inevitable that its new announcers \u2013 a conductor and cybersecurity manager by day \u2013 mangled a few. Now, Northern has vowed to record again the names of any stops it has got wrong. On the Cumbrian side of the network, it has so far pledged to put the \u201ce\u201d back in Burneside (currently, wrongly, silent); put the Ass into Aspatria (currently said with too much emphasis on \u2018spa\u2019, Northern believes); and pronounce Cark &amp; Cartmel more casually, as local people do \u2013 Cark-n-Cartmel. In Northern\u2019s defence, the spelling of some placenames bears only the scantest resemblance to how they are pronounced by residents. How could any stranger know, for example, that inhabitants of Slaithwaite in West Yorkshire call it \u201cslou-wit\u201d? Or that Euxton Balshaw Lane in Lancashire should be pronounced \u201cex-ton\u201d and not \u201ceuston\u201d, like its London cousin? Irked passengers have until the end of the month to provide feedback before two Northern employees head to the studio to re-record the placenames for the network\u2019s onboard announcements. Many of the names will no doubt be hotly contested. Keen-eared passengers have already asked them to restore the \u201cs\u201d into Ashburys, a no man\u2019s land stop outside Manchester city centre. The pronunciation of Mossley Hill in Liverpool is a more complicated matter: on Monday this week, Northern was planning to change it to Mose-ley Hill, from Mozzley-Ill. A furore ensued. Many Liverpudlians were adamant Northern was still on the wrong track. It\u2019s actually Moss-ley-Ill, they insisted. The matter was deemed sufficiently important for a BBC Radio Merseyside phone-in, with one caller suggesting that Northern had gone too posh (\u201cwho did they get to record it? Hyacinth Bucket?\u201d). The fact there is another station on the Northern network called Mossley ( on the Greater Manchester/Yorkshire border) complicates matters further: most locals there think they live in Mozzley. A Northern spokesperson said that it welcomed the debate, and that the most contentious pronunciations \u2013 where to put the emphasis in Aspatria, whether Ilkeston in Derbyshire is Ilk-e-ston or Ilk-ston, as well as the battle for Mossley Hill \u2013 would be settled with the help of local station staff. \u201cIn terms of the final decision \u2013 we\u2019ll definitely be speaking to colleagues on the ground at the local stations where there has been \u2018debate\u2019,\u201d he said. Northern said residents were keen to reiterate full placenames rather than shortened versions that have been adopted over time. Barrow will be given its Sunday name of Barrow-in-Furness, with Dore, just outside Sheffield, being restored to Dore &amp; Totley. Tricia Williams, chief operating officer at Northern, said: \u201cWe manage 467 stations across our network and some of them are pronounced very differently to how they appear in writing. \u201cThat said, some corrections are, quite rightly, a request that station names be announced in full rather than shortened versions that have been adopted over time.\u201d The new onboard announcements are being recorded by Peter Corley and Laura Palmer, two of Northern\u2019s employees, who were chosen for having \u201cnice voices\u201d. Corley is a conductor based in York with a ripe Yorkshire accent. Palmer is also based in York as Northern\u2019s cybersecurity and compliance manager, but, more controversially, is actually from Essex. \u201cThat makes her a northerner by choice, which is always nice,\u201d said a Northern Trains PR person. Complaints will still follow, warned Danny Vaughan, head of Metrolink, Manchester\u2019s tram network. \u201cEveryone has an opinion. The woman who recorded ours did them all again in 2012 to correct mistakes. People now still disagree on how she pronounces Altrincham, with the c sounding more like a g, or the fact she now says Besses O\u2019Th Barn with \u2018of the\u2019 in full.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 July 2023. The rail operator is called Northern Trains, not Northern Rail."

            "title": "Apple suggests iMessage and FaceTime could be withdrawn in UK over law change",
            "date": "2023-07-20T14:50:29Z",
            "content": "Apple has said planned changes to British surveillance laws could affect iPhone users\u2019 privacy by forcing it to withdraw security features, which could ultimately lead to the closure of services such as FaceTime and iMessage in the UK. The firm has become a vocal opponent of what it views as UK government moves against online privacy, and it said last month that provisions in the forthcoming online safety bill could endanger message encryption. Apple\u2019s latest concerns centre on the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, which gives the Home Office the power to seek access to encrypted content via a technology capability notice (TCN). End-to-end encryption, which ensures only the sender and recipient of a message can see its content, is a key tech privacy feature and is a hard-fought battleground between governments and tech firms. Apple said the changes included a provision that would give the UK government oversight of security changes to its products, including regular iOS software updates. The Home Office consultation proposes \u201cmandating\u201d operators to notify the home secretary of changes to a service that could have a \u201cnegative impact on investigatory powers\u201d. Apple wrote in a submission to the government that such a move would in effect grant the home secretary control over security and encryption updates globally, when allied to further proposals strengthening requirements for non-UK companies to implement changes worldwide if \u2013 like Apple \u2013 they operate via a global platform. The proposals would \u201cmake the Home Office the de facto global arbiter of what level of data security and encryption are permissible\u201d, Apple wrote. Apple also expressed concern over a proposed amendment that it says would allow the government to immediately block implementation of a security feature while a TCN is being considered, instead of letting the feature continue to be used pending an appeal. In comments implying that encrypted products such as FaceTime and iMessage could ultimately be endangered in the UK, Apple said it never built a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into its products for a government to use, and it would withdraw security features in the UK market instead. End-to-end encryption is the core security technology for FaceTime and iMessage and is viewed by Apple as an intrinsic part of those services. \u201cTogether, these provisions could be used to force a company like Apple, that would never build a backdoor, to publicly withdraw critical security features from the UK market, depriving UK users of these protections,\u201d Apple said. The company said the proposals would \u201cresult in an impossible choice between complying with a Home Office mandate to secretly install vulnerabilities into new security technologies (which Apple would never do), or to forgo development of those technologies altogether and sit on the sidelines as threats to users\u2019 data security continue to grow.\u201d Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University who has signed an open letter warning against online safety bill proposals that could dilute encryption, said Apple\u2019s submission on the 12-week consultation represented a \u201cstake in the ground\u201d. He said: \u201cIf the government push on regardless then Apple will simply join the growing band of vendors that would leave the UK. British users could end up as one of the most isolated and insecure groups in the world. In that scenario, nobody wins.\u201d On Wednesday the House of Lords approved a government amendment on the online safety bill related to scrutiny of encrypted messaging. Under the amendment, Ofcom, the communications watchdog, would have to await a report from a \u201cskilled person\u201d before ordering a messaging service to use \u201caccredited technology\u201d \u2013 which could enable the scanning of message content \u2013 for example to identify child sexual abuse material. The provision in the bill is widely seen by privacy campaigners as a means of potentially forcing platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal to break or weaken end-to-end encryption. Dr Nathalie Moreno, a partner at the UK law firm Addleshaw Goddard specialising in data protection, cybersecurity and AI, said there was \u201calmost no information\u201d available about how detailed the report to Ofcom would be, and whether the \u201cskilled person\u201d would be a political appointment or technical expert. \u201cOnce the government has been granted powers to intercept private messaging services, that\u2019s it, there\u2019s no going back,\u201d she said. A spokesperson for the campaign group Index on Censorship, which had supported an amendment proposing judicial oversight of Ofcom\u2019s powers, said the outcome was \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the UK population\u2019s right to privacy. The NSPCC, the children\u2019s safety charity, has said the \u201cshrill\u201d debate over the online safety bill is \u201closing sight\u201d of the safety rights of child sexual abuse victims. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe Investigatory Powers Act 2016 is designed to protect the public from criminals, child sex abusers and terrorists. With strong independent oversight, the act regulates how intrusive investigatory powers by public authorities are used. \u201cWe keep all legislation under review to ensure it is as strong as it can be and this consultation is part of that process \u2013 no decisions have yet been made.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-07T13:12:20Z",
            "content": "The US added 209,000 new jobs in June as hiring slowed amid signs the economy is cooling. It was the weakest gain since December 2020, lower than the 240,000 jobs economists had expected and lower than the 309,000 jobs added in May. But the increase was also the 30th consecutive month of jobs gains, and the unemployment rate ticked down to the historically low rate of 3.6%. The US job market has remained robust despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive attempts to slow the economy and tamp down inflation with more than a year of interest rate hikes. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated that the central bank will likely raise rates again this month after announcing a pause in June. Wages rose 4.4% in June from a year earlier. At an annual rate of 4%, US inflation remains twice as high as the Fed\u2019s target and some economists have raised fears the central bank\u2019s steep rate hikes could trigger job losses and a recession. President Joe Biden hailed the latest hirings figures. \u201cWe are seeing stable and steady growth,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s Bidenomics - growing the economy by creating jobs, lowering costs for hardworking families, and making smart investments in America.\u201d But the news is unlikely to deter the Fed from raising rates again this month. In a note to investors, Capital Economics said the 209,000 rise \u201csuggests labour market conditions are finally beginning to ease more markedly. That said, it is unlikely to stop the Fed from hiking rates again later this month\u201d. The latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics come after the private sector reported a sharper than expected rise in hiring in June. Private employers added 497,000 new jobs last month, the private payroll supplier ADP reported on Thursday, well ahead of the 267,000 gain in May and much better than the 220,000 analysts had estimated. The near half-million rise was the largest monthly increase in over a year with leisure and hospitality jobs accounting for the largest volume of hires. \u201cConsumer-facing service industries had a strong June, aligning to push job creation higher than expected,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \u201cBut wage growth continues to ebb in these same industries, and hiring likely is cresting after a late-cycle surge.\u201d There are some other signs that the job market is cooling. The number of job vacancies is falling in the US, with 9.9m open positions in the US on the last day of May, 1.6 unfilled positions for each person counted as unemployed. That figure was down from the record 12m open positions in March of last yearbut is still higher than before the pandemic. ADP\u2019s report came after the latest survey from employment firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas showed layoffs in the US nearly halved in June from a month earlier. The fall came as job cuts in the technology sector waned after months of layoffs from tech giants including Amazon, Meta and Google. But the 40,709 cuts announced in June were still up 25% from the 32,517 announced in the same month one year prior, the sixth time this year when cuts were higher than the corresponding month a year earlier."

            "date": "2023-07-10T04:08:03Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s a Goldilocks economy \u2013 not too hot to spur inflation, not too cool to invite recession. On Friday, the labor department announced that the US economy added 209,000 jobs in June. It was the 30th consecutive month of job gains. The unemployment rate dipped to 3.6% Last Thursday we learned that the US economy grew at an annualized 2% rate in the first quarter of this year. That\u2019s well above economists\u2019 expectations of around 1.4%. But if you haven\u2019t received this news, you\u2019re not alone. Good economic news doesn\u2019t make it through the negative sludge of Fox News or Newsmax. It barely gets through the mainstream media. You want some additional good news? In the four years of Donald Trump\u2019s administration, total investment on manufacturing facilities grew by 5%. During the first two years of Biden\u2019s administration, manufacturing investment more than doubled. This has created about 800,000 manufacturing jobs. These remarkable results are the outcome of Biden policies \u2013 the Inflation Reduction Act and its green technology provisions, the infrastructure bill and the Chips Act. What about inflation? Yes, Biden\u2019s stimulative spending did boost prices. But the big news that\u2019s not getting through to most Americans is that inflation has been dropping. It has declined significantly from its mid-2022 highs above 9%. Consumer prices are now rising by about 4.9% annually \u2013 still a problem but not nearly the problem it was. Much of the remaining inflation is due to outsized corporate profit margins. The IMF recently found that almost half the increase in Europe\u2019s inflation over the past two years is due to rising corporate profits. I wish Biden would make an issue of those profit margins. They\u2019re enriching those at the top while imposing a big penalty on everyone else. And wages? For a while, real (adjusted for inflation) wages were falling, but now that inflation is subsiding, real wages are picking up again. So why do so many Americans continue to think the economy is awful? According to the Gallup economic confidence index, Americans haven\u2019t felt this bad about the economy since the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index is similarly downbeat. In an NBC News survey conducted a few weeks ago, at least 74% of Americans said the country is on the wrong track. Given all this, it\u2019s not surprising that Joe Biden\u2019s approval numbers have been stuck at around 43%. History shows that incumbent presidents tend not to be re-elected when about 70% of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. (They tend to win when fewer than half of Americans think that.) So, the obvious question is, why are Americans feeling so bad about an economy that\u2019s actually damned good? One reason, I think, is a general sense of dread \u2013 centering on Trump, DeSantis and Republican lawmakers in general \u2013 that seems to affect everything else. (I don\u2019t know about you, but I sometimes have difficulty getting to sleep, worried about the rise of authoritarian fascism in America.) Add in the effects of the climate crisis, and you get more gloom. (This week, the earth\u2019s average temperature reached the highest on record.) A recent study found that headlines have grown starkly more negative. Then, too, many of us are still suffering from pandemic-related PTSD. But I think the deeper reason Americans don\u2019t feel very good about the economy is that is that the vast number of working non-college grads \u2013 some two-thirds of the adult US population \u2013 are still bogged down in dead-end jobs lacking any economic security, while struggling with many costs (such as housing, childcare and education) that continue to soar. In other words, the economy is getting better overall \u2013 but overall has become a less useful gauge of wellbeing as the rich get richer, the poor grow poorer, and the working middle is under worsening siege. Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

            "date": "2023-07-13T06:08:37Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy shrank by 0.1% in May after a hit to activity from a trio of bank holidays, including for King Charles\u2019s coronation. The Office for National Statistics said that gross domestic product (GDP) fell on the month, after growth of 0.2% in April, as manufacturing, energy generation and construction all dropped as some industries were affected by one fewer working day than normal. City economists had forecast a bigger fall of 0.3%. While coronation festivities helped to provide a boost for some businesses, the UK\u2019s pubs, bars, and restaurants suffered a fall in consumer spending after a strong April, while employment agencies also struggled amid a slowdown in hiring demand. The arts, entertainment and recreation sectors benefited from the extra bank holiday, the ONS said. The figures come as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates for a 14th consecutive time amid growing concern over high inflation, adding to pressure on households and businesses in a development expected to weigh on economic growth in the months ahead. Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said the latest figures were unlikely to give the central bank reason to pause. \u201cHowever, given the long time lag between rate rises and its effect on the real economy, tightening further risks damaging our growth prospects by overcorrecting for past errors,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the economy may rebound in June, the significant squeeze on activity from high inflation, stealth tax hikes and rising interest rates means the prime minister may struggle to meet his pledge to get the economy growing.\u201d Over the broader three-month period to the end of May, the economy showed no growth as activity in the UK\u2019s dominant service sector flatlined. Construction rose by 0.2% while production \u2013 which includes manufacturing, energy production and mining \u2013 grew by 0.4%. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cGrowth is down again, families are worse off and the impact of the Tory mortgage bombshell is reaching far and wide. \u201cThis Tory government seems determined to march us down a path of low growth and economic insecurity.\u201d The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the best way to get growth going again was to ease pressure on households by bringing down inflation. \u201cWhile an extra bank holiday had an impact on growth in May, high inflation remains a drag anchor on economic growth,\u201d he said. Britain\u2019s economy has broadly performed more strongly than expected in recent months, helped by falling global energy prices, rising consumer confidence and resilience in the jobs market. Late last year, economists feared the UK would be in recession by now. The economy grew by 0.1% over the first quarter, matching the performance in the final three months of 2022. A decline in activity in May had been widely anticipated because additional bank holidays typically lead to a drop in output, with the impact from one fewer day of work in offices, factories and in construction normally failing to offset a boost from leisure activities. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said May\u2019s performance had been better than expected. \u201cOverall, the bank holiday and strikes make it hard to judge the true health of the economy. But our sense is that underlying activity is still growing, albeit at a snail\u2019s pace.\u201d"

The financial crisis did for Labour in 2010, and Rishi Sunak well knows what the highest inflation in four decades is doing to UK politics today. But can election results affect the economy? Obviously, who gets elected matters \u2013 as this column discussed last year, a change of government tends to be followed by more policy change and faster economic growth \u2013 but specifically do the results \u2013 and how surprising they are \u2013 matter? Yes, concludes new Warwick University research examining 13,600 opinion polls before 233 elections in 51 countries. It turns out that in strong democracies results that are more of a \u201csurprise\u201d relative to polls immediately pre-election are followed by lower growth. The size of the effect is itself surprisingly large: an extra percentage point surprise in vote shares is associated with 0.37 percentage points lower growth one year after the election. What\u2019s driving this result? Lower business investment (something the UK really can\u2019t afford), as firms hold off decisions in the face of higher uncertainty. This is like a mini-version of the Brexit decision causing investment to flatline post-referendum. Labour will say this shows we\u2019d better all vote for them to match the current polls, but note the growth impact of surprise election results is particularly strong when it\u2019s the left doing surprisingly well (remember in the olden days it was leftwing, not rightwing, populists winning surprise victories).

            "date": "2023-07-12T15:00:09Z",
            "content": "Philip Lowe may yet go down as one of the unluckiest central bank governors in Australian history or perhaps elsewhere. Within a few days, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will decide on whether to extend the Reserve Bank governor\u2019s seven-year contract when it concludes in mid-September. Few expect Lowe will get the nod to stay on. By September, though, we might find out that the next governor has no need to lever interest rates higher. While slowing, the economy might also avoid a contraction thanks to a burst of migrants flocking to what Lowe called this \u201cwonderful country\u201d. \u201cIt is possible that some further tightening will be required to return inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe,\u201d Lowe said in his speech in Brisbane on Wednesday. Economists zeroed-in on \u201cpossible\u201d as being notably dovish. Add in a jobless rate remaining surprisingly small, a government that is about to report a $20bn-odd surplus for the fiscal year just ended, and an inflation rate that is turning sharply south. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Could Lowe reasonably exit in better circumstances? To be sure, many will hold a grudge against the governor for forecasting \u2013 but not promising \u2013 in late 2021 interest rates were unlikely to rise until 2024. Those who took out mortgages and are battling to make repayments have grounds to gripe (although many would-be buyers might be regretting their caution as rents soar and home prices start rising). No central bank governor predicted Russia\u2019s blitzkrieg against Ukraine in February 2022 that turned a transitory post-pandemic inflation into something more insidious \u2013 not even those at banks with a separate monetary policy board, an innovation that will now be foisted on the RBA thanks to an unluckily timed review of the institution. Lowe seems unconvinced the current rates-setting method needs an overhaul. He accepted the review\u2019s recommendation to cut the number of rates meetings from 11 to eight a year, but was hardly in a position to refuse it or other changes. There\u2019s no denying many people are under financial duress. Evictions are on the increase, tenants\u2019 advocates say, and there are signs forced home sales are on the rise. But major banks appearing before the House of Representatives economics committee on Wednesday said that, at this point, they aren\u2019t picking up a jump in bad loans. One NAB executive told the committee, \u201cwe expected it to be worse that it has already played out\u201d. That said, the timing and extent of stress remain unclear. ANZ, too, was also upbeat. There has been much talk, for instance, about a \u201cmortgage cliff\u201d facing borrowers suddenly shifted from fixed loans with a 2% annual interest rate when they mature to three times that. \u201cA significant bulk\u201d of such mortgagors had already converted, the ANZ chief executive, Shayne Elliott, said. The bank boasts that its customer base may be \u201cskewed\u201d to borrowers slightly better positioned than the average. Still, just $6 of every $1,000 owed to the bank is overdue more than 90 days, a ratio lower than pre-Covid times. \u201cPeople are in a remarkably good shape\u201d, Elliott said while conceding phone calls from customers for help were \u201cup a little bit\u201d. The ANZ, though, expects at least two more 25 basis-point interest rate rises in August and September to take the cash rate to 4.6%. And by 2024, the bank predicts an unemployment rate that is now hovering at 3.6% \u2013 near the lowest rate in 50 years \u2013 will climb to 5%. If the jobless rate does begin to rise, though, it will remove more of the inflation impetus that already seems to be in the works. China sinking towards deflation may also ease global pricing pressure, as will another drop in US inflation. Lowe\u2019s successor will then have the scope to cut interest rates sooner than many people expect now. If that is what transpires, an unlucky Lowe watching on from the sidelines might justifiably feel due some of that credit."

            "date": "2023-07-30T10:00:05Z",
            "content": "The first job many people take out of college usually doesn\u2019t come with a lot of responsibility. Adam Byrnes\u2019s first job is to make sure democracy works in a critical US swing state. Before graduating with a political science degree from Emory University, Byrnes, 21, applied to be the director of elections for Swain county, a mountainous region of about 14,000 people in western North Carolina. He was offered the job before he had a diploma in hand and started at the end of May. He\u2019s currently preparing for municipal elections in the county seat of Bryson City, which take place in November, while also laying the foundations for the 2024 presidential contest. Although he\u2019d worked with an on-campus civic engagement organization and an outside group that researched voter access in Georgia, Byrnes quickly learned that those outward-facing concerns were just the tip of the electoral iceberg. \u201cAdministratively, there\u2019s a lot to learn. For instance, right now we\u2019re dealing with mid-year campaign finance reports,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a civic engagement group, that\u2019s not really something you deal with.\u201d The decentralized system of elections in the United States places a lot of responsibility on county-level officials like Byrnes. And while he may be North Carolina\u2019s youngest election director, he\u2019s far from the only one learning the ropes during a crucial period for American democracy. Over the last four years, at least 40 of North Carolina\u2019s 100 counties have had to replace their election directors due to retirements, resignations and other career moves. Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the state Board of Elections, said that\u2019s a significantly greater level of turnover than the state has seen before. Similar trends hold true across the rest of the United States. A Boston Globe analysis of data from the US Vote Foundation found that county election official turnover had spiked after the 2020 election in battleground states like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia. According to a 2022 survey by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, 20% of officials serving at the time said they planned to leave their posts before the 2024 presidential contest. Those filling the vacancies are entering a high-pressure environment, especially in North Carolina, where Donald Trump defeated Joe Biden by fewer than 75,000 votes. Over 25% of the state\u2019s county election directors have personally experienced threats, according to a March poll by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Election Data and Science Lab, and 85% say their work-related stress has grown since 2019. New election workers will help manage a voting system that\u2019s among the most complex in the world, said David Becker, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, a non-profit that works to build trust in the electoral process. That system, Becker said, includes many checks and balances to ensure the outcome reflects the will of the people. Votes are counted carefully, and rates of fraud are negligible. He said he\u2019s confident that even if those running the system have less experience than before, the candidate who gets the most votes will win. No election is perfect, however. Inexperienced officials may take longer than usual to release election results or make minor administrative missteps. And in the current political environment, Becker said, bad actors can spin those hiccups into dangerous conspiracy theories. \u201cThat could create a very volatile period of time where there are efforts to delay the counting and intimidate people who are counting ballots, delay the certification and intimidate people who are in charge of certification and perhaps delay or obstruct the meeting of the Electoral College members in each state,\u201d he added. \u201cAll of which are unlikely to stop the duly elected individual from being declared the winner of the presidency, but could create a volatile situation that\u2019s ripe for political violence.\u201d North Carolina\u2019s elections in particular are undergoing a period of rapid change, which may place extra stress on new officials trying to grasp how the system works. For example, the state\u2019s 2023 municipal elections will be first in which citizens must present identification in order to vote. The voter ID law had been struck down as racially biased by a Democratic-controlled supreme court in 2022, but after Republicans took control of the court this year, they overturned the previous ruling. Josh Jones, who in 2022 became the director of elections for Greene county, said he expects voter ID to be controversial at the polls this year. Although the state\u2019s voters backed a referendum on the requirement in 2018, many voting rights groups say the measure will harm Black and Latino residents. \u201cAs elections officials and poll workers, we have to follow the law,\u201d Jones said. \u201cMy hope is that the voting public, when they come to vote, realize that our election officials and poll workers are doing just that, following the law.\u201d Yet the rules aren\u2019t always crystal clear, and election officials are often tasked with deciding how to put them into practice. Corinne Duncan, director of elections in Buncombe county since 2020, said the role has gained more responsibility in recent years as election law has become more complicated. \u201cWe\u2019re in charge of interpreting the law, which is unique. And law in the United States is a lot about case law and application,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cThe longer that you\u2019ve been around and seen how the law plays out, the more effective of a leader you are.\u201d When veteran directors leave, that leadership capacity leaves with them. And because each type of election only comes around once every four years, Duncan pointed out, new directors need a lot of time to build up practical experience in voting law. \u201cDirectors are retiring and they\u2019re not coming back. That\u2019s a lot of knowledge lost,\u201d Duncan said. North Carolina\u2019s legislature has proposed a series of bills that would introduce even more wrinkles into how officials are required to run elections. Republicans hold a supermajority in both the state House and Senate and can pass those changes without support from Democratic lawmakers or Roy Cooper, the Democratic governor. Some elements of those bills seem likely to spark conflict, said Michella Huff, who has overseen elections in Surry county since 2019. She pointed to House Bill 772, which would allow observers appointed by county political parties to move freely around polling locations, record poll workers and stand just 5ft away as voters cast their ballots. Officials could be charged with misdemeanors if they interfere with poll observers, so new elections directors might give them freer rein than the rules allow. \u201cWhen I try to envision what that will look like, I do not see how that is not voter intimidation,\u201d Huff said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cause some disruption to the process.\u201d None of the proposed bills provide new resources or financial support for county election officials, said Gannon with the state board of elections. In fact, budget constraints have led the board to cut four of its eight security and support technicians \u2013 experts who help train new election directors and provide advice to counties \u2013 since 2020. The legislature is currently developing North Carolina\u2019s budget for 2023-25. The state board has requested more than $7.6m in new funds over that period to \u201censure the smooth implementation of\u201d the voter ID law, as well as over $13.6m to update software systems it calls \u201cantiquated, inefficient, and vulnerable to defects\u201d. Without these resources, new officials will have a harder time making sure the new rules are applied consistently and fairly. \u201cWe have been told that all those matters are being considered by budget negotiators,\u201d Gannon said, although lawmakers have yet to release a draft of the spending plan. \u201cWe will continue to work with legislators to make sure they understand potential effects on election administration of any proposed statutory changes, as we do routinely.\u201d Regardless of these headwinds, North Carolina\u2019s elections officials are trying to build trust in advance of 2024. In Swain county, Byrnes said he\u2019s worked with local media to share details about the new voter ID requirements before polling starts and is meeting with both Republican and Democratic leaders in the area to build good lines of communication. Despite being new to the job and having to run his first presidential election, he said he feels confident that he will be prepared. \u201cAt the end of the day, if we do everything right and people still don\u2019t like it, there\u2019s not anything we can do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to just control what we can.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-07-07T06:43:00Z",
            "content": "Robodebt royal commissioner Catherine Holmes\u2019 report is damning for the Coalition and former ministers, including Scott Morrison, Alan Tudge and Stuart Robert. And it is disastrous for the public service \u2013 certain individuals within it and the entity as a whole; or what some might call the bureaucracy\u2019s soul, if such a thing can exist. But there is another target of Holmes\u2019 1,000-page opus that the commissioner hopes we focus on too. It hung like a dark cloud over months of hearings and its effect is now laid bare in Holmes\u2019 report: cynical welfare politics. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Holmes makes clear that though there was individual and institutional wrongdoing (or, as she put it, \u201cvenality, incompetence and cowardice\u201d), robodebt was built upon a broader cultural failing. In the royal commission hearings, observers saw politicians take the stand to be finally challenged on a great Australian political tradition: demonising welfare recipients. Now, in her report, Holmes finds such rhetoric was not just cheap politics: it had real-world consequences that stretched from political and public service offices in Canberra to the kitchen tables of ordinary people hit with unlawful welfare debts. Holmes dedicates a section to the phrase \u201cwelfare cop\u201d. She finds Morrison\u2019s use of this phrase in several media interviews in 2015 \u2013 when robodebt was being designed \u2013 \u201cencouraged the development of proposals\u201d that \u201creflected the approach and tone of his powerful language\u201d. That is, public servants \u2013 who were being warned and warning others this was a bad idea \u2013 heard his rhetoric and carried on, too weak or cynical to stand up to their boss. Holmes is critical of ministers who, in media statements and so-called \u201cdrops\u201d to friendly newspapers and other outlets, conflated \u201cinadvertent non-compliance\u201d with fraud to spruik the program \u2013 and later defend it. \u201cThe evidence before the commission was that fraud in the welfare system was minuscule, but that is not the impression one would get from what ministers responsible for social security payments have said over the years,\u201d Holmes wrote. Tudge is criticised by Holmes for an \u201cabuse of power\u201d where his office released information about social security recipients to friendly outlets to defend robodebt. Holmes finds it is \u201creasonable to infer\u201d this \u201cmean-spirited\u201d defence of the program led to the drop in robodebt media stories from the middle of 2017. That is, fewer victims were willing to speak \u2013 and the story faded from the national headlines. One of the most important findings Holmes has made is about the effect the very idea of robodebt had on victims. Victims told the inquiry they would never access Centrelink payments again. Parents said they would tell their children to avoid social security, too. Holmes wrote that there was a \u201closs of trust in the social security system, and in government more broadly\u201d. Holmes makes sweeping recommendations about the public service, the watchdogs that are meant to \u2013 and failed to \u2013 hold politicians and bureaucrats to account, specific changes to Centrelink processes, automation in government decision-making, freedom of information laws, and more. And she has referred some individuals to other agencies for investigation as a means to hold them to account and to \u201creinforce the importance of public service officers\u2019 acting with integrity\u201d. But she warns that the \u201ceffectiveness of any recommended change\u201d is reliant on a broader cultural shift that cannot be effected by a policy change. Holmes says \u201canti-welfare rhetoric\u201d and attitudes have been set by politicians, who must now lead \u201ca change in social attitudes to people receiving welfare payments\u201d. She wants politicians to \u201clead a change in social attitudes to people receiving welfare payments\u201d and change the narrative of \u201ctaxpayer versus welfare recipient\u201d. With the assistance of advocates and brave victims, the commission hearings may have helped to change the narrative. Holmes, senior counsel assisting Justin Greggery KC and his team did significant work showing the public the the reality of life on welfare. It gave a voice to victims of the scheme, who spoke in painful detail about the effect this program had on their lives and the damaging stigma attached to their personal circumstances. It will take some time for the government to respond to the 57 recommendations that Holmes says are needed to ensure there is no repeat. But her overarching call for a new way to talk about welfare and those who rely on it can be heeded by politicians, the media and the broader public now. With the rate of jobseeker payments and the broader welfare system occupying the national debate these days, we have already seen a return of some of the cynical rhetoric about \u201cbludgers\u201d and \u201ccheats\u201d that dominated the period in politics when robodebt was born. As Holmes\u2019 report shows, it is both false and dangerous. We will soon see whether her call has been heard."

            "date": "2023-07-27T21:00:43Z",
            "content": "The powerful algorithms used by Facebook and Instagram have increasingly been blamed for amplifying misinformation and political polarization. But a series of groundbreaking studies published on Thursday suggest addressing these challenges will require more than just tweaking the platforms\u2019 software. The four research papers, published in Science and Nature also reveal the extent of political echo chambers on Facebook, where conservatives and liberals rely on divergent sources of information, interact with opposing groups and consume distinctly different amounts of misinformation. With cooperation from Meta, the researchers behind the studies analyzed data from millions of users of Facebook and Instagram related to the 2020 US presidential election, and surveyed specific users who agreed to participate. One area of investigation centered around the social media feeds\u2019 algorithms, and how they affect voters\u2019 attitudes and behavior. The algorithms suggest content for users by making assumptions based on the groups, friends, topics and headlines a user has clicked on in the past. While they excel at keeping users engaged, algorithms have been criticized for amplifying misinformation and ideological content that has worsened political divisions in the US. Proposals to regulate these systems are among the most discussed ideas for addressing social media\u2019s role in spreading misinformation and encouraging polarization. But when the researchers changed the algorithms for some users during the 2020 election, they saw little difference. \u201cWe find that algorithms are extremely influential in people\u2019s on-platform experiences and there is significant ideological segregation in political news exposure,\u201d said Talia Jomini Stroud, the director of the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the leaders of the studies. \u201cWe also find that popular proposals to change social media algorithms did not sway political attitudes.\u201d When the researchers replaced the algorithm with a simple chronological listing of posts from friends \u2013 an option Facebook recently made available to users \u2013 it had no measurable impact on polarization. When they turned off Facebook\u2019s reshare option, which allows users to quickly share viral posts, users saw significantly less news from untrustworthy sources and less political news overall, but there were no significant changes to their political attitudes. Likewise, reducing the content that Facebook users get from accounts with the same ideological alignment had no significant effect on polarization, susceptibility to misinformation or extremist views. Together, the findings suggest that Facebook users seek out content that aligns with their views and that the algorithms help by \u201cmaking it easier for people to do what they\u2019re inclined to do,\u201d according to David Lazer, a Northeastern University professor who worked on all four papers. Eliminating the algorithm altogether drastically reduced the time users spent on either Facebook or Instagram while increasing their time on TikTok, YouTube or other sites, showing just how important these systems are to Meta in the increasingly crowded social media landscape. The work also revealed the extent of the ideological differences of Facebook users and the different ways that conservatives and liberals use the platform to get news and information about politics. Conservative Facebook users are more likely to consume content that has been labeled misinformation by factcheckers. They also have more sources to choose from. The analysis found that among the websites included in political Facebook posts, far more cater to conservatives than liberals. Overall, 97% of the political news sources on Facebook identified by factcheckers as having spread misinformation were more popular with conservatives than liberals. To conduct the analysis, researchers obtained unprecedented access to Facebook and Instagram data from the 2020 election through a collaboration with Meta, the platforms\u2019 owners. The researchers say Meta exerted no control over their findings. The authors of the papers did acknowledge some limitations to their work. While they found that changing Facebook\u2019s algorithms had little impact on polarization, they note that the study only covered a few months during the 2020 election, and therefore cannot assess the long-term impact that algorithms have had. They also noted that most people get their news and information from a variety of sources \u2013 television, radio, the internet and word-of-mouth \u2013 and that those interactions could affect people\u2019s opinions, too. Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s former director of public policy, said the research showed the need for greater research on social media and challenged assumptions about the role social media plays in American democracy. Harbath was not involved in the research. \u201cPeople want a simple solution and what these studies show is that it\u2019s not simple,\u201d said Harbath, a fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and the chief executive of the tech and politics firm Anchor Change. \u201cTo me, it reinforces that when it comes to polarization, or people\u2019s political beliefs, there\u2019s a lot more that goes into this than social media.\u201d Meta\u2019s president for global affairs, Nick Clegg, argued that the findings showed \u201cthere is little evidence that key features of Meta\u2019s platforms alone cause harmful \u2018affective\u2019 polarization or has any meaningful impact on key political attitudes, beliefs or behaviors.\u201d But the reality is more complicated than that, according to critics who say the findings shouldn\u2019t let social media companies off the hook for combating misinformation. \u201cStudies that Meta endorses, which look piecemeal at small sample time periods, shouldn\u2019t serve as excuses for allowing lies to spread,\u201d Nora Benavidez, a senior counsel at the digital civil rights group Free Press, told the Washington Post. \u201cSocial media platforms should be stepping up more in advance of elections, not concocting new schemes to dodge accountability.\u201d Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee and whistleblower, was critical of the timing of the research, telling the Post it came after Meta had enacted more aggressive election protection measures to address misinformation leading up to the election. And by the time the experiment began, many users had already joined groups that would have inundated them with questionable content, she said. Lazer, the Northeastern professor, said he was at first skeptical that Meta would give the researchers the access they needed, but was pleasantly surprised. He said the conditions imposed by the company were related to reasonable legal and privacy concerns. More studies from the collaboration will be released in coming months. \u201cThere is no study like this,\u201d he said of the research published on Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of rhetoric about this, but in many ways the research has been quite limited.\u201d"

            "content": "The YouTube clip I return to most often is David Bowie being interviewed by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight in 1999. Bowie is talking about what the internet might do: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve even seen the tip of the iceberg. I think that the potential of what the internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable. I think we\u2019re on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a tool, isn\u2019t it?\u201d condescends Paxman. \u201cIt\u2019s an alien life form,\u201d insists Bowie. \u201cIs there life on Mars? Yes, and it\u2019s just landed here.\u201d At the time of that Bowie interview I was writing a university dissertation titled Freedom of Speech in Cyberspace: the Challenge the Internet Poses to the Constitution of the United States. It was a heady time. The peak of internet utopia, with tech idealists promising that the decentralising nature of the internet would radically reform power dynamics, and democracy could be reborn. Fast forward 25-odd years and we know the opposite has happened: truth and trust have been eroded, democracy has failed to reform for the digital age and the relationship between those in power and those who elect them is strained to breaking point. It\u2019s at this moment that we are seeing the proliferation of generative AI, and understandably the response has been a mixture of hysteria and hope. The hysteria about killer robots risks masking the real societal impacts that industrial revolutions inevitably have, sifting winners and losers, and disrupting ways of living in more subtle and sometimes pernicious ways. But there is hope for democracy in the AI revolution \u2013 if we put the right guardrails around it. If we make AI work for democracy, then in 10 years\u2019 time our information ecosystems could be vastly improved to support democratic decision-making. We could train AI to value verified information, and serve it in ways that make the most complex information more accessible to more people. Politicians could be more trusted to do the right thing by people, because they\u2019ve learned new ways to involve people in decision-making. AI citizens\u2019 assemblies could help people and politicians to navigate through the trade-offs required to tackle the big problems. These concepts are not entirely outlandish. Polis is one such tool, developed in the US and used to shape policies most extensively in Taiwan, including to design regulation for Uber. Deceptively simple, Polis maps people\u2019s views according to consensus, rather than division, and gives people options to suggest policy ideas. In the UK, we at Demos have worked with the Cabinet Office on Polis projects to engage experts and the public in the 2021 integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy. Andrew Gray, an independent candidate in July\u2019s Selby and Ainsty byelection, is using it to power all his policies, declaring himself the first AI-powered politician. In a decade\u2019s time we could repair the relationship between state and citizen. It could facilitate dialogue between MPs and constituents, enabling elements of direct democracy to supplement our representative system. AI could also allow for the better use of citizens\u2019 data to target public services, interventions and support people on a more human level. AI could be used to guide people to access help from the state. But this will only happen if we make it happen. Because right now the incentives to develop generative AI are all commercial, with investors steering the development of the technology in ways that threaten to further leave democracy behind \u2013 not least because the talent, expertise and infrastructure follows the money, rather than where it could be used for common good. The Labour peer Jim Knight, who has been close to the latest digital bills going through parliament, makes a startling point: there are four legislative processes regarding digital under way at the moment, if you include the AI white paper published earlier this year. None of them mention protecting or promoting democracy as an explicit aim. Instead, they are concerned with online safety, digital markets and data protection. Democracy is the elephant in the room. Without focusing explicitly on the potential for AI to improve democracy \u2013 or at least do no harm \u2013 it will most probably corrupt. Distrusted information will proliferate, further eroding trust. But without explicitly updating our democracy to encompass more participatory activities that could be facilitated through these technologies, we will increasingly be left in a system that is centuries out of date, trying to govern in a world that moves at completely different speeds and in completely different ways. We have to learn this time. \u2022 Polly Curtis is chief executive of the cross-party thinktank Demos"

Against a backdrop of record-breaking heat and floods this year, the $22m endeavor, Project 2025, was convened by the notorious rightwing, climate-denying thinktank the Heritage Foundation, which has ties to fossil fuel billionaire Charles Koch. Called the Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, it is meant to guide the first 180 days of presidency for an incoming Republican president. Climate experts and advocates criticized planning that would dismantle US climate policy. The nearly 1,000-page transition guide was written by more than 350 rightwingers and is full of sweeping recommendations to deconstruct all sectors of the federal government\u2013 \u2013 including environmental policy. \u201cHeritage is convening the conservative movement behind the policies to ensure that the next president has the right policy and personnel necessary to dismantle the administrative state and restore self-governance to the American people,\u201d the foundation\u2019s president, Kevin Roberts, said in an April statement.

The plan, which would hugely expand gas infrastructure, was authored by Bernard McNamee, a former official at the agency. McNamee was also a Trump appointee to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He previously led the far-right Texas Public Policy Foundation, which fights environmental regulation, and served as a senior adviser to the Republican senator Ted Cruz. Another chapter focuses on gutting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and moving it away from its focus on the climate crisis. It proposes cutting the agency\u2019s environmental justice and public engagement functions, while shrinking it as a whole by terminating new hires in \u201clow-value programs\u201d, E&amp;E News reported. The proposal was written Mandy Gunasekara, who was the former chief of staff at the EPA under Trump. The guide also features a chapter on the Department of the Interior written by William Perry Pendley, who controversially led the Bureau of Land Management under President Trump and worked to eliminate drilling regulations. Before his time in the Trump administration, Pendley headed the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a conservative law firm where he advocated for selling off public lands. He also authored a book, Sagebrush Rebel, praising Reagan\u2019s anti-regulatory policies. \u201cHe did a bunch of terrible things,\u201d said Kert Davies, director of special investigations at the Center for Climate Integrity, about Pendley\u2019s time at the Department of the Interior. \u201cHe worked to dismantle [the Bureau of Land Management] while he was in it.\u201d The Heritage Foundation has enjoyed a longstanding influence in GOP politics, even helping Ronald Reagan win the presidency, authors Naomi Oreskes and Erik M Conway detail in their 2023 book, The Big Myth. Many of Reagan\u2019s policy proposals were cribbed from the pages of the thinktank\u2019s first Mandate for Leadership, published in 1980, which asserted that the US was in the middle of a \u201ccrisis of overregulation\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t trouble me that any individual or institution would develop advisory plans for politicians. What troubles me is the Heritage Foundation\u2019s long history \u2026 of working to undermine environmental protection at the expense of health and wellbeing of the American people, at the expense of life on Earth,\u201d said Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard. Meanwhile, House GOP members are also continuing to attack federal climate funding in their spending bill proposals, putting governmental functions at risk. Earlier this month, the Clean Budget Coalition\u2013 \u2013 composed of more than 250 advocacy groups \u2013 warned that Republican representatives were slipping restrictions on climate spending into the government\u2019s annual spending bills, bills that must be passed before current funding expires on 30 September to avoid a government shutdown. This week, the coalition found that House Republicans had added additional \u201cpoison pills\u201d to spending bills, including ones that target environmental funding. The spending bills are currently in the House appropriations committee, which is chaired by the Texas Republican Kay Granger, who is a top recipient of campaign funding from the oil and gas industry, the Lever reported this week. They will go to a full vote in the House, and then the finalized proposals will move into negotiations with the Senate. If Biden vetoes them, a government shutdown could be on the way. \u201cRepublicans in Congress continue to show they will stop at nothing to undermine environmental protections and attack anything that would help addressing the climate crisis,\u201d said David Shadburn, a senior government affairs advocate at the League of Conservation Voters. Some of the provisions would hamstring the EPA\u2019s powers, blocking the agency from enforcing new pollution limits on power plants and tailpipe emissions or from implementing controls on mercury and other toxic air pollution, and effectively shuttering a critical program for deploying carbon-free energy. \u201cHouse appropriations Republicans are abusing the appropriations process to impose a cycle of environmental injustice,\u201d said Deanna No\u00ebl, climate campaigns director for the consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen. Other \u201cpoison pills\u201d would prohibit listing the dunes sagebrush lizard under the Endangered Species Act, remove protections for the greater Yellowstone ecosystem\u2019s population of grizzly bears, and bar the Department of the Interior from creating a working group to help restore bison populations. Still others would require the energy secretary to sell 1m barrels of refined petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and block the implementation of a rule forcing federal defense contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and create emission reductions plans. Every GOP representative can submit proposals to the House appropriations committee, and since no member is required to sign off on specific proposals, it is not clear who exactly is responsible for each \u201cpoison pill\u201d. But as the Lever reported, many Republican representatives who have effectively championed the provisions are recipients of funding from polluting industries. For instance, a proposal to halt climate-related fisheries research funding was written by a subcommittee led by Representative Hal Rogers of Kentucky, whose top campaign contributors include mining and fossil fuel interests. Another proposal would bar funding for the UN\u2019s Green Climate Fund; it was buried in a bill being overseen by major energy funding recipient Representative Mario D\u00edaz-Balart of Florida, the Lever reported. \u201cThese disgraceful poison pill riders are nothing short of corporate giveaways to the corrupt fossil fuel industry,\u201d said No\u00ebl. The proposals come as waters off the Florida coast reach levels of heat more commonly found in hot tubs, and as much of the nation continues to swelter under triple-digit temperatures."

            "content": "\u2018In France, we have no petrol, but we have ideas.\u201d So goes a popular French saying born in the 1970s during the oil crisis. Said differently, France is a champion of quirky initiatives that can feel both admirable and somewhat pointless. The latest in a series of eco-friendly measures taken by the French government is the \u201crepair bonus\u201d. Instead of throwing into the bin a pair of ripped trousers, a bag with a broken strap or a moth-eaten polo neck, the state will pay for them to be mended at your local cobbler or retoucheur (sewing workshops). From October and for the next five years, we will be able to claim back between \u20ac6-\u20ac25 of the costs of mending our clothes and shoes with artisans who have joined the scheme. The hope is to help create a virtuous circle, change habits for the planet\u2019s sake (700,000 tonnes of clothing is thrown away in France every year), sustain local artisans and even create jobs in what we now need to call the \u201crefashion\u201d sector. Three years ago, a similar scheme encouraged my compatriots to fix their old toasters or rickety washing machines, rather than dispose of them out of frustration. Legislators even obliged companies to revise their obsolescence strategy by publishing a \u201crepairability index\u201d for each item produced. Consumers can now buy new home appliances knowing in advance how easy (or difficult) they are to repair. I get it: every little helps in the race to reduce our carbon footprint, and the fashion industry is one of the most polluting. But what fresh hell! To think that we need the government to remind us of the most basic things in life, like repairing what\u2019s broken rather than throwing it away in a childish fit? Have we gone amnesic as a nation? Can\u2019t we remember our mothers/grandmothers/aunts knitting clothes, darning socks and trousers in front of the telly, sewing house linens on old Singer machines; and wearing our older siblings\u2019 clothes? I can perfectly recall the satisfaction of seeing through the fabric of a worn-out pair of jeans: it meant I could finally buy a new pair, or better still, some funky vintage denim at the Paris flea markets. So cool and so \u00e9colo, as we used to say before \u201ceco-friendly\u201d was coined. I\u2019m not that ancient that I don\u2019t also remember the beginning of fast food and fast fashion in the 1980s. I was a kid and I remember the heady feeling of a new way of life: cheap, fast and\u2026 fat-free. The euphoria didn\u2019t last long: images of children producing polyester clothes by the millions in Asia, and acres of landfill piled high with textile detritus did not feel like progress. As for the fat-free industry, what a con. So let\u2019s focus on the task and go further, please! What we need is President Macron on the phone to the Musks and Zuckerbergs of this world, enrolling an army of influencers to spread the \u201cold is cool\u201d mantra on social networks. The fashionistas under 40 will love how a patched elbow will be perceived as virtue signalling, their favourite pastime. As for us over 40, it will be the most welcome return of common sense. And if I can give one last piece of advice to the French government, instead of subsidising mending and repairing, why don\u2019t schools teach every child, girl and boy alike, please, how to sew, cut, knit and mend clothes? So the next generation remembers their grandfather and father darning socks in front of Call My Agent!. \u2022 Agn\u00e8s Poirier is a political commentator"

            "content": "Democratic divisions over Israel were on stark display on Tuesday, as lawmakers prepared to welcome Isaac \u201cBougie\u201d Herzog, the president of Israel, for an address to a joint session of Congress. Several progressive House members, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, intend to boycott Herzog\u2019s speech on Wednesday to protest against the treatment of Palestinians under the government of Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cIn solidarity with the Palestinian people and all those who have been harmed by Israel\u2019s apartheid government, I will be boycotting President Herzog\u2019s joint address to Congress,\u201d Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat of Michigan, said on Monday. \u201cI urge all members of Congress who stand for human rights for all to join me.\u201d House Democratic leaders have struck a much more conciliatory tone toward Herzog, embracing the opportunity to hear from the Israeli president. \u201cPresident Bougie Herzog has been a force for good in Israeli society,\u201d Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, said on Friday. \u201cI look forward to welcoming him with open arms when he comes to speak before Congress.\u201d The tension between House Democrats reached a boiling point over the weekend, after Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, described Israel as a \u201cracist state\u201d while speaking at a conference in Chicago. Jayapal clarified her comments on Sunday, saying: \u201cI do not believe the idea of Israel as a nation is racist. I do, however, believe that Netanyahu\u2019s extreme rightwing government has engaged in discriminatory and outright racist policies and that there are extreme racists driving that policy within the leadership of the current government.\u201d House Republicans swiftly attacked Jayapal\u2019s comments, calling on Democratic leaders to join them in rejecting the congresswoman\u2019s criticism of Israel. \u201cI think if the Democrats want to believe that they do not have a conference that continues to make antisemitic remarks, they need to do something about it,\u201d the House Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, said on Monday. Amid the backlash, more than 40 House Democrats signed on to a statement lambasting Jayapal\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d remarks and praising Israel as \u201cthe only vibrant, progressive, and inclusive democracy in the region\u201d. House Democratic leaders also issued a joint statement on Sunday denouncing the characterization of Israel as a \u201cracist state\u201d. \u201cAs House Democratic leaders, we strongly support Israel\u2019s right to exist as a homeland for the Jewish people,\u201d the leaders said. \u201cWe are also firmly committed to a robust two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinian people can live side by side in peace and prosperity.\u201d Although the joint statement did not mention Jayapal by name, progressives balked at the leaders\u2019 rejection of one of their colleagues in an effort to quiet criticism from Republicans. \u201cI am proud to call [Jayapal] a colleague, a friend and our CPC Chair,\u201d Omar said on Tuesday on Twitter. \u201cI am also deeply concerned about the shaming \u2013 often of women of color \u2013 when they speak out about human rights violations happening in Palestine and Israel, especially when similar concern is not expressed for the lives being lost and families being torn apart.\u201d House Republicans seized the opportunity to highlight the Democratic divisions over Israel. The House Republican majority leader, Steve Scalise, announced on Monday that the chamber would vote on Tuesday on a resolution asserting \u201cthe state of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state\u201d. \u201cIt should be an easy vote,\u201d Scalise said on Twitter. \u201cWill [Democrats] stand with our ally or capitulate to the anti-Semitic radicals in their party?\u201d As his congressional allies clashed over Herzog\u2019s visit, Joe Biden met with the Israeli president in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \u201cThis is a friendship, I believe, that\u2019s just simply unbreakable,\u201d Biden told Herzog. \u201cAmerica\u2019s commitment to Israel is firm, and it is ironclad.\u201d A day before his meeting with Herzog, Biden spoke to Netanyahu over the phone, and the two leaders agreed to meet in the coming months. But a spokesperson for the national security council, John Kirby, would not specify whether that meeting will take place at the White House, as Netanyahu has repeatedly requested. \u201cThey will meet probably before the end of this year,\u201d Kirby told reporters on Monday. \u201cAnd all the details of the \u2018wheres\u2019 and the \u2018whens\u2019 are still being worked out.\u201d"

Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by, the president of Chad, travelled to Niger as a diplomatic envoy to speak to the country\u2019s democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum \u2013 who is believed to be being held at the presidential residence \u2013 and the coup leaders. D\u00e9by posted the photo on his Facebook page late on Sunday, saying he made the trip to Niger, \u201cwhich is going through a major political crisis \u2026 to explore all the paths to find a peaceful exit to the crisis shaking this neighbouring country\u201d. He also posted a photo of himself with the coup leader, Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani, the head of Niger\u2019s presidential guard, who is also smiling and wearing military fatigues. Soldiers say they have removed the president from office but an intense power struggle is continuing. Neighbouring countries and international partners have refused to recognise the new leadership and demanded that Bazoum be reinstated. Bazoum has not been harmed and has continued to talk by phone to foreign governments. Landlocked Niger, a former French colony, has become a pivotal ally for western powers seeking help to fight the jihadist insurgencies that have spread across the Sahel region from Mali over the past decade. Bazoum\u2019s election in 2021 was the first democratic transition of power in a state that has witnessed four military coups since independence from France in 1960."

            "date": "2023-07-01T14:48:18Z",
            "content": "The US is set to rejoin Unesco this month after a four-year absence from the global cultural and educational body that the country abandoned during the Donald Trump presidency over what his administration called \u201canti-Israeli bias\u201d. The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization\u2019s reunion with the US came after a two-day special session held at the body\u2019s headquarters in Paris. Of Unesco\u2019s 193 member states, 142 participated in Friday\u2019s vote. Ten states voted against the US rejoining, including Russia, Belarus, Iran, North Korea and Nicaragua. China, which had become the organisation\u2019s biggest financial backer in the absence of the US, also voted against readmittance. US efforts to rejoin Unesco have been building since last year when the Joe Biden White House said within a $1.7tn spending bill that the administration would seek to rejoin the organisation in order to \u201ccounter Chinese influence\u201d. \u201cI am encouraged and grateful that Unesco members have accepted the US proposal that will allow us to continue steps toward rejoining the organisation,\u201d the American secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a statement. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, described the decision as \u201cvery good news\u201d. \u201cIf we are not engaged in international institutions, then we leave a void and lose an opportunity to advance American values and interests on the global stage,\u201d she added. Meanwhile, the UN\u2019s director for the International Crisis Group, Richard Gowan, told CBS News on Tuesday: \u201cThe Biden administration has always made it clear that it is suspicious of China\u2019s rising influence in the UN. \u201cBiden\u2019s team believes that Trump ceded a lot of ground to China with its anti-UN attitude. The decision to rejoin Unesco is just the latest example of the US deciding it can do more to counter China by actively engaging in UN institutions than sitting on the sidelines.\u201d As a condition of readmission, the US will repay around $619m in unpaid dues, meet 22% of Unesco\u2019s annual budget, and make contributions to programs supporting education access initiatives in Africa, Holocaust remembrance and journalists\u2019 safety. Beyond stepping up actions for Africa, Unesco said it would be able to increase its efforts toward gender equality, a strategic priority. \u201cWith this return, Unesco will be in an even stronger position to carry out its mandate,\u201d said Audrey Azoulay, Unesco\u2019s director general. \u201cUnesco\u2019s mandate \u2013 education, science, culture, freedom of information \u2013 is absolutely central to meeting the challenges of the 21st century. It is this centrality, as well as the easing of political tensions within the organisation and the initiatives launched in recent years, that have led the United States to initiate this return.\u201d Last month, the US acknowledged in a letter to Unesco that it noted the organisation\u2019s \u201cefforts to implement key management and administrative reforms, as well as its focus on decreasing politicized debate, especially on Middle East issues\u201d. The organisation in 2011 had voted to admit Palestine, which is not formally recognized by the US or Israel as a UN member state. The Barack Obama White House cut Unesco contributions, sending the US into owing millions in arrears to the organization. Five years later, in 2016, the Unesco World Heritage Committee adopted a decision ruling that Israeli actions related to archaeology, tourism and freedom of movement in the Old City of Jerusalem contravened cultural heritage laws and practices. US and Israeli officials complained that not including the full Jewish history in any decision about Jerusalem was equivalent to a denial of Jewish history. In 2017, a year into the Trump presidency, the US cited \u201cmounting arrears at Unesco, the need for fundamental reform in the organisation, and continuing anti-Israel bias at Unesco\u201d as reasons for the decision. The decision by Unesco to readmit the US, which has 24 properties inscribed on the world heritage list, is the second time it has left and rejoined since the organisation was founded in 1945. In 1983, Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration pulled the US out over what it saw as anti-Western bias. Unesco, it complained, \u201chas extraneously politicized virtually every subject it deals with\u201d. \u201cIt has exhibited hostility toward a free society, especially a free market and a free press, and it has demonstrated unrestrained budgetary expansion,\u201d the Reagan White House added. But beneath that expressed rationale was frustration that Unesco, with an increasing number of members, no longer acted in consort with US foreign policy objectives. \u201cThe countries which have the votes don\u2019t pay the bill, and those who pay the bill don\u2019t have the votes,\u201d the US ambassador to the UN Jeane Kirkpatrick said at the time. But in 2002, George W Bush\u2019s administration negotiated readmittance as part of an effort to foster international goodwill to counter deep misgivings over the US \u201cwar on terror\u201d in the Middle East. Reuters contributed reporting."
