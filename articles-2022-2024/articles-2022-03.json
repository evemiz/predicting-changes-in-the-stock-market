            "content": "Federal Labor has finalised its candidates in a number of crucial seats ahead of this year\u2019s election, including the controversial choice of Andrew Charlton to contest Parramatta and a consensus replacement for Kimberley Kitching in the Senate. Nominations for vacant positions closed on Monday, with only one candidate to replace each of Kitching, retiring Victorian left senator Kim Carr, MP Julie Owens and right faction MP Anthony Byrne. Jana Stewart, a Mutthi Mutthi and Wamba Wamba woman and former Victorian public servant, will take Kitching\u2019s Senate spot. Before the vacancy had been filled Kitching\u2019s death sparked factional in-fighting in the Victorian ALP. Allies of Kitching and the outgoing senator Carr have sought leave to fight the federal party\u2019s control over preselections in the high court. The Victorian corrections minister, Natalie Hutchins, who was backed by Kitching\u2019s faction, and the former Higgins candidate, Fiona McLeod, who was backed by the larger right faction of deputy leader, Richard Marles, did not contest the vacancy. Carr, who announced his retirement on Sunday, will be replaced by Linda White, a former Australian Services Union official \u2013 but only after 1 July, assuming Labor wins two Senate seats in Victoria in the upcoming May poll. Labor\u2019s right faction selected Cassandra Fernando, a Shop Distributive and Allied Employees organiser, for the safe seat of Holt in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, refusing to cede the seat to the left faction despite its superior numbers in Labor\u2019s membership. Fernando is a Sri Lankan-Australian, whose nomination will help the right redress the underrepresentation of women in its faction. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Charlton, a managing director of Accenture who worked as an economic adviser to Kevin Rudd, will contest the seat of Parramatta \u2013 a seat on the Coalition\u2019s target list held by Labor on a margin of 3.5%. Charlton was backed by the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, but his preselection is controversial as it is the second time in a year the ALP has installed a person from an Anglo-Celtic background over candidates from diverse backgrounds into a western Sydney seat. At least three candidates from Parramatta \u2013 or nearby branches \u2013 considered a run at the seat: Durga Owen, a former staffer of the retiring MP; Alan Mascarenhas, a former Sydney Morning Herald journalist; and Abha Devasia, a lawyer from Labor\u2019s hard left. But they did not contest the preselection, reflecting the view that Charlton was favoured."

            "date": "2022-03-09T19:56:51Z",
            "content": "Yoon Suk-yeol, a conservative former prosecutor, declared victory in South Korea\u2019s presidential election on Thursday after his liberal rival conceded defeat following a bitter battle in the politically divided nation. Yoon, from the main opposition People Power Party, edged out the ruling Democratic Party\u2019s Lee Jae-myung with 48.6% of the vote to 47.8%, with more than 98% of the ballots counted as of 4.20am on Thursday (7.20pm GMT on Wednesday). \u201cThis is a victory of the great South Korean people,\u201d Yoon told cheering supporters, who were chanting his name at the country\u2019s National Assembly. He later pledged to honour the constitution and parliament and work with opposition parties to heal polarised politics and foster unity, calling the election a \u201cvictory of the great people\u201d. \u201cOur competition is over for now,\u201d he told a news conference, thanking and consoling Lee and other rivals. \u201cWe have to join hands and unite into one for the people and the country.\u201d Lee conceded defeat and congratulated his opponent. \u201cI did my best, but failed to live up to your expectations,\u201d he told a news conference, blaming his \u201cshortcomings\u201d. \u201cThe president-elect, I desperately ask you to overcome divisions and conflicts and open an era of integration and unity.\u201d The White House congratulated Yoon and said President Joe Biden said he looked forward to working closely with him to expand close cooperation between the allies. \u201cThe alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea, our economies and our people is ironclad. President Biden looks forward to continue working with the new president-elect to further expand our close cooperation,\u201d a spokesperson said. The unusually bitter election campaign was marred by scandals and smears, but the policy stakes are high for the country of 52 million. About 77% of South Korea\u2019s 44 million eligible voters cast ballots to pick the leader of a nation whose global status is rising even as it has been riven by gender and generational divisions, while facing a confrontational North Korea. In echoes of the 2020 national assembly elections, voters wore masks and used hand sanitiser, casting their ballots on the same day South Korea reported a record 342,446 new Covid-19 cases. More than a million people are isolating at home after testing positive, health authorities say. The country amended its electoral laws last month to ensure they would be able to vote. Yoon, who was hoping to benefit from public anger over rising house prices in Seoul, income inequality and youth unemployment, said during the campaign that he would address mounting economic problems with a dose of fiscal conservatism, including a cut in the minimum wage and the removal of limits on working hours. As an avowed \u201canti-feminist\u201d he has pledged to abolish the ministry for gender equality, claiming South Korean women do not suffer systemic discrimination - despite voluminous evidence to the contrary. He vowed to address the housing crisis with tax relief, pledged support for small businesses and self-employed people, and encouraged the private sector to create jobs and builds millions of new homes. While North Korea\u2019s recent return to ballistic missile tests was lower down the list of voter priorities, Yoon\u2019s team has said he would restart talks with the regime in Pyongyang, while boosting South Korea\u2019s deterrent capabilities. That could include buying an additional US missile defence system, despite criticism from China that its powerful radar can penetrate its territory. South Korea\u2019s decision to deploy the system, known as Thaad, in 2017 triggered economic retaliation from Beijing."

            "date": "2022-03-28T11:39:45Z",
            "content": "The German chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s centre-left party has passed its first electoral test since entering government, after the Social Democratic party secured a rare absolute majority at Saarland state elections. Led by Anke Rehlinger, a trained lawyer and former shot putter, the SPD won 43.5% of Sunday\u2019s vote in the small state on the French border. \u201cThat\u2019s not just a narrow majority,\u201d she told the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a significant majority with 29 seats.\u201d The result could in theory mean the first single-party government in the Saarland since 1970, a rarity in Germany\u2019s increasingly fragmented political landscape. The conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which has governed in the Saarland continuously since 1999, suffered a major defeat, dropping 12 percentage points. The state\u2019s premier, Tobias Hans, signalled his resignation on Sunday night, saying there would be \u201cpersonal consequences\u201d from the result. While the CDU\u2019s polling figures have rallied at a national level after the combative Friedrich Merz took over the party following a historic defeat at federal elections last September, the Saarland result suggests there may be more to the centre-left\u2019s revival than good fortune. The SDP performed particularly strongly among usually conservative-voting over-60s, 50% of whom voted centre-left this time around, and also gained a significant number of votes from former supporters of Die Linke. Saarland was once seen as one of the few strongholds of the leftwing party in western Germany, with 21.3% of the vote being achieved as recently as 2009. However, on Sunday it secured just 2.6%, a fall of more than 10 percentage points that meant an exit from the state parliament. The election came just weeks after Oskar Lafontaine, a former SPD state premier in the region who had gone on to co-found Die Linke, rescinded his party membership, citing the new leadership\u2019s support for exporting lethal weapons to Ukraine. The Green party and the liberal Free Democratic party, which both govern in a coalition with the SPD at federal level, made minor gains in Sunday\u2019s vote but narrowly failed to reach the electoral threshold for parliamentary representation. The far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, which made small losses but won 5.7% of the vote, will be the smallest of three parties in the next state parliament. The durability of the SPD\u2019s revival will be tested more strenuously at state elections in the CDU-led Schleswig-Holstein on 8 May and the populous North-Rhine Westphalia on 15 May."

            "title": "Macron kickstarts re-election campaign as Le Pen gains ground",
            "date": "2022-03-29T18:53:25Z",
            "content": "The French president Emmanuel Macron is aiming to kickstart his re-election campaign this week with walkabouts outside Paris and a big rally in the capital, after the diplomatic pressures of the war in Ukraine limited his canvassing at home \u2013 leading to a dip in the polls and worries of a low turn-out. Macron, 44, is hoping next month to be the first French president to win re-election in 20 years, but he has recently dropped two to three points in the polls as the gap between him and the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen narrows. While he remains favourite, the next 10 days of campaigning are seen as fraught and risky amid anger over the cost of living, disillusionment with the level of campaign debate and politics in general. \u201cI adore rallies but let\u2019s be clear-headed \u2013 I can\u2019t do many!\u201d Macron recently said on TV, explaining that he had instead been at international summits and engaged in diplomacy on Ukraine. \u201cNo one would understand if I wasn\u2019t there to protect the French.\u201d Macron, after sweeping to power in 2017 promising to transform France with a new brand of politics that was neither left nor right, is polling at about 27% in the first round, followed by Le Pen on about 17%. Le Pen is gaining ground after campaigning hard on France\u2019s cost of living crisis. But if Macron faces Le Pen in the final round runoff on 24 April, the result is predicted to be much closer than when he won five years ago with 66%, with one poll this week putting Macron at 53% to Le Pen\u2019s 47%. A third candidate, the hard-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, is also steadily rising, and abstention could be as high as 30%. Of those who say they will vote, four in 10 are still not sure for whom \u2013 adding to a greater degree of unpredictability. Most French voters trust Macron to lead on the issue of war in Ukraine, which initially appeared to cement his position, and at campaign events will regularly says he\u2019s off to speak to a world leader on the phone straight afterwards. His presidential rivals on the right and left however accuse him of ducking the political debate at home. When Macron rolled up his shirtsleeves and went for his first walkabout to meet the public in Burgundy this week, he was met by complaints about fuel prices, the cost of living and shouts of \u201cWe\u2019re taxed all year round!\u201d. He said France had spent \u20ac20bn (\u00a317bn) in measures to help those who were struggling and \u201cFrance has done more than its neighbours\u201d. Macron\u2019s challenge in the coming days is to drum up enthusiasm for his election platform. Polls show that the manifesto details that have stuck in voters minds are his measures on the right \u2013 raising the retirement age to 65 and requiring unemployed people to undertake 15 to 20 hours of work or training a week. Macron\u2019s support on the centre-left \u2013 which was crucial for his election in 2017 \u2013 has dipped, while his support on the centre-right has risen. But after promising novelty and fresh ideas at the last presidential election, a recent Elabe poll found that, this time, fewer than one in five people thought Macron\u2019s programme was innovative. Analysts say Macron \u2013 whose early labour and tax reforms saw him labelled \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d \u2013 must show he is listening to people on the ground, and their concerns. On a recent local radio phone-in, one woman working in the health service told Macron she felt he \u201cwasn\u2019t there for us\u201d. Afterwards, in a behind-the-scenes video for his campaign, he lamented that she felt that way saying he\u2019d heard the same kind of comment \u201cin lots of places\u201d. Opposition figures, including Le Pen, M\u00e9lenchon and the far-right TV pundit \u00c9ric Zemmour, have attacked Macron over a senate report that French ministries have more than doubled spending on international consultancy firms, including the US firm McKinsey, between 2018 and last year. Macron\u2019s government has been accused of paying millions for advice on what was criticised as a slow rollout of Covid vaccines. The Green party candidate, Yannick Jadot, called it indecent to pay private consultants. Macron said all contracts respected the rules. Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant at the pollsters Viavoice, said Macron\u2019s current polling remained higher than his first-round score five years ago of 24%. Chau said Macron faced a challenge: \u201cThe international crisis has allowed him to rest on his presidential stature and legitimacy on the world stage. But, in the tight timeframe of the campaign, he still has to create an effect of \u2018desirability\u2019 among voters. He has to both say \u2018I\u2019m the right person for the current international context\u2019 and at the same time elicit some positive emotion from voters, with proposals seen as improving people\u2019s lives. That double situation is not easy.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-29T07:41:30Z",
            "content": "A coalition of MPs and peers from a host of different parties is using the European court of human rights to challenge an alleged failure to investigate Russian interference in UK elections. The legal action has been launched in response to the UK government\u2019s refusal to order an inquiry into the findings of the Russia report, published by the intelligence and security committee (ISC) in July 2020, which reported credible evidence of attempts by Russia to interfere with the UK\u2019s electoral processes. The parliamentary group bringing the action includes the Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, the former leader of the Green party Caroline Lucas, the SNP MP Alyn Smith, Lord Strasburger of the Lib Dems and the former Tory peer Lady Wheatcroft. The group claims the government is in breach of article 3 of the first protocol to the European convention on human rights, which requires regular, free, secret-ballot elections to \u201censure the free expression of the opinion of the people\u201d. Lucas, the MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: \u201cAs President Putin wages a war of terror on the Ukrainian people, he\u2019s been waging another war on the very principles of democracy. \u201cThe Russia report is clear that there is credible evidence of Russian interference in UK electoral process \u2013 and yet our government has consistently refused to investigate these serious conclusions.\u201d The Russia report declared Russian interference in the UK \u201cthe new normal\u201d and reported credible attempts to interfere with the UK\u2019s electoral processes from at least the time of the EU referendum in 2016. The ISC called for an investigation and an updated legal and institutional framework to protect those processes from foreign interference. When the government did not act on these recommendations, the cross-parliamentary group joined forces with the non-profit journalism organisation the Citizens to file an application for judicial review in August 2020. Permission for judicial review was refused by the high court and the group\u2019s application for permission to appeal was turned down by the court of appeal. Lucas said: \u201cWe now have no other option than to take our case to the European court of human rights, in order to try to force the government to undertake a full investigation into the evidence, or else we jeopardise the free and fair elections we hold dear and allow Putin to believe that, once again, he can get away with hostile state interference in our democratic processes.\u201d Strasburger said: \u201cFor some time it has been obvious that Putin has infiltrated the British establishment and our government. Predictably Boris Johnson delayed publication of the Russia report as long as he could and then ignored its excellent recommendations. \u201cLikewise he declined to tackle the tsunami of dirty money the Russian oligarchs have been allowed to launder in London and only moved against them when the Ukraine crisis meant he had no choice. \u201cEven then he did as little as he could get away with and gave the oligarchs ample time to spirit their assets out of the country. It\u2019s high time to deal with this vipers\u2019 nest and hopefully this legal action will lead to full exposure.\u201d The long-delayed Russia report found the British government and intelligence agencies failed to conduct any proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum. It said the government \u201chad not seen or sought evidence of successful interference in UK democratic processes\u201d at the time, and it made clear that no serious effort was made to do so. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 March 2022. Owing to an editing error, the headline and introduction of an earlier version said incorrectly that the group of MPs and peers had called on the European court of human rights to challenge the UK government\u2019s alleged failure to investigate Russian interference. It is that group who are making the challenge, through the ECHR. Also, the group claims the UK government is in breach of article 3 of the first protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, not article 3 of the convention itself."

            "date": "2022-03-27T05:45:17Z",
            "content": "A leading French political scientist has warned voters not to consider the presidential election a foregone conclusion, because anything can happen before the first round on 10 April. Dominique Reyni\u00e9, head of the influential Fondapol thinktank, suggested it was dangerous for voters to not bother turning out just because opinion polls envisage a win for Emmanuel Macron. The combination of Covid and the war in Ukraine had made the election unpredictable, he said, admitting that even experts in analysing voting patterns could not reliably call the result. \u201cThis is not an election like any other and I cannot see in any way that the result is certain. We could say one thing today and tomorrow it could be different,\u201d Reyni\u00e9, a professor at the prestigious Sciences Po university in Paris, told foreign journalists last week. \u201cWe cannot be sure of anything.\u201d Macron is enjoying a poll boost largely attributed to his role as global go-between for Moscow and Kyiv. The latest figures on voting intentions in the first round show Macron\u2019s support levelling off at around 27% \u2013 a slight drop from last week, but up from before Russia invaded Ukraine. The far right\u2019s Marine Le Pen, who used to support Vladimir Putin but has recently distanced herself, climbed to 21%. Radical left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has risen to third place with 13%, with the mainstream right candidate Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse behind him at 12% and \u00c9ric Zemmour on 10%. The Socialist candidate Anne Hidalgo is in eighth place with 2% behind sheep farmer Jean Lassalle with 3%, the Communist party\u2019s Fabien Roussel on 4% and the Greens\u2019 Yannick Jadot on 5%. This would lead to a Macron-Le Pen second-round runoff \u2013 a repeat of the 2017 presidential election \u2013 with polls forecasting a 55%-45% win for Macron. A survey for Les Echos suggested the cost of living and social protections including the welfare state remain voters\u2019 main preoccupations. The war in Ukraine was cited by just over a quarter as a factor that will influence their vote. \u201cThe advantage for Macron is that at this time of war, people rally to the president who is the head of the military and foreign policy \u2026 and there\u2019s the idea that it\u2019s not reasonable in this situation to have a new president who has no experience,\u201d Reyni\u00e9 said. However, he warned that the \u201cflag factor\u201d could backfire if the economic consequences of the war, particularly soaring fuel prices, hit French voters\u2019 wallets too hard. \u201cOf course, we cannot compare problems like the cost of living against the tragedy in Ukraine but we have to take them into consideration,\u201d Reyni\u00e9 said. \u201cThe French are shocked by Putin\u2019s aggression and are pro-Ukraine, but it\u2019s a difficult and evolving situation. Also, French voters don\u2019t think it\u2019s for them to pay for this [war] effort. In many countries, this would probably be considered a funny idea but in France people often consider that it\u2019s not for them to make an effort but \u2018the state\u2019, without understanding that \u2018the state\u2019 is the same as \u2018the French\u2019. \u201cI don\u2019t believe people will say \u2018oh, too bad for the Ukrainians\u2019 but they could say it\u2019s for the state to pay for this.\u201d Le Monde has described this presidential race as a \u201cphantom campaign\u201d \u2013 over before it had even begun \u2013 but Reyni\u00e9 said voters who failed to turn out because they believed there was no point risked a repeat of the 2002 presidential trauma, when a combination of abstention and protest votes saw the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen knock out the Socialist candidate in the first round. \u201cOn 10 April there could be strong abstention from moderate voters who are anti Marine Le Pen but hostile to Emmanuel Macron and this is the largest group in the electorate. If they don\u2019t turn out for the first round, thinking it\u2019s a foregone conclusion, we just don\u2019t know what the consequences will be. What we do know is that high abstention creates situations that are irreversible and weaken the democratic nature of the vote.\u201d Reyni\u00e9 said that if Macron does win a second term he will need a convincing score to push through controversial reforms, including a long-promised shake-up of the pensions system. \u201cWe already know how people will react to contested measures: they will say we voted for you because there was the war in Ukraine; we voted for you because you were against Marine Le Pen; we didn\u2019t vote for you to do this reform.\u201d He added: \u201cI will take a risk and say that if I was to bet I would gamble that Emmanuel Macron will be reelected but I\u2019m taking a risk because of all the things over which I have no control that could have ramifications. \u201cBased on opinion polls and intentions to vote today, we can say it\u2019s probable but it is just a probability; it would be absurd to say the reelection of Emmanuel Macron is certain.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-16T16:31:54Z",
            "content": "Paris could offer \u201cautonomy\u201d to Corsica, the French government has said, suggesting the state might be willing to loosen its historic, centralised grip on the Mediterranean island as it struggles to calm violent protests. \u201cWe are ready to go as far as autonomy \u2013 there you go, the word has been said,\u201d the interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, told the regional newspaper Corse Matin before a two-day visit, that comes after two weeks of rioting in which 100 people were injured and public buildings and police were attacked with homemade explosive devices. But Darmanin added that \u201cthere can be no dialogue while violence is going on\u201d. He said: \u201cA return to calm is an essential condition.\u201d Corsican leaders remained cautious and said there must be firm proposals for talks. The island would need \u201cstrong signals before believing\u201d change was coming, the regional parliament head, Marie-Antoinette Maupertuis, said. It is unprecedented for a French government minister to suggest offering autonomy for Corsica, an island of 330,000 people that lies closer to Italy than mainland France. The birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte has been French since the 18th century and while its status and calls for more independence has long vexed Paris, they have been brushed under the carpet by successive French presidents. The protests on the island have created a major government crisis with just weeks before April\u2019s presidential election. The 40-year Corsican \u201cnational liberation\u201d campaign of bombing and violence targeting French infrastructure, calmed in 2014 when armed separatists announced an \u201cend to military operations\u201d. Since then, Corsican nationalists seeking greater autonomy from the French state have been boosted by election successes at local and regional levels, but Emmanuel Macron is seen as having failed to move on the issue during his presidency and autonomist and nationalist Corsicans alike are frustrated that the issue of reforming the island\u2019s status has been on ice since 2018. The protests broke out two weeks ago after a savage prison attack on a key jailed nationalist, Yvan Colonna, who was being held at a mainland French prison. He is in a coma after another prisoner, who was serving a nine-year sentence for planning terrorist attacks, attempted to strangle him in an exercise area. Colonna was serving a life sentence for murder for being part of a group who assassinated Claude \u00c9rignac, the French state\u2019s top official in Corsica, in 1998. He had been arrested in 2003 after a five-year manhunt that eventually found him living as a shepherd in the Corsican mountains. The prison attack on Colonna stoked anger on the island, where some see him as a hero in a fight for independence from France. Demonstrations and riots have been continuing since the attack on Colonna on 2 March, which protesters blamed on the French government. Thousands have taken to the streets. Placards at demonstrations at the weekend said: \u201cFrench government murderers.\u201d On the edge of demonstrations, hundreds of hooded protesters have thrown projectiles, molotov cocktails and homemade explosive devices at police and public buildings. Prosecutors said 102 people were injured on Sunday during clashes in Corsica\u2019s second-largest city, Bastia. Of the injured, 77 were police. The chief prosecutor of Bastia told AFP the city had witnessed \u201cextremely violent\u201d scenes and the SG police union said officers were dealing with a \u201cquasi-insurrectional\u201d situation. The government had already tried to soothe nationalist anger by removing the special prisoner status from Colonna and two of his group \u2013 which had prevented them from being transferred to a Corsican jail. That could allow for their transfer to a prison on Corsica rather than the French mainland \u2013 a key, longstanding nationalist demand for all prisoners they see as \u201cpolitical\u201d. But it has not calmed the protests. The National Liberation Front of Corsica (FLNC), the main militant group behind 40 years of armed struggle for Corsica\u2019s separation from France, warned in a statement to Corse Matin on Wednesday that it supported the current protests over Yvan Colonna, saying the revolt could lead to \u201cinsurrection\u201d. This was understood to mean the group could resume its operations. Darmanin, who was to meet elected officials in the Corsican capital, Ajaccio, said Colonna had been attacked in prison by a jihadist fellow inmate over \u201cblasphemy\u201d in \u201ca clearly terrorist\u201d act. \u201cThis talk of a crime by the state is excessive, not to say intolerable,\u201d he told Corse Matin. Gilles Simeoni, the pro-autonomy president of Corsica\u2019s regional council, and a former lawyer for Colonna, said it was important that \u201cthe interior minister, in the name of the prime minister, and probably the president, says publicly today that the government and the state are ready to enter into a historic discussion\u201d. No details have been given by the government but a discussion could examine an autonomous status in which Corsica takes charge of certain legislative powers, such as taxation, local economic development, and housing issues on the island known for the high number of holiday homes owned by non-Corsicans. An Ifop poll published on Sunday in Corse Matin found that 53% of those questioned favoured a degree of autonomy for Corsica, with 35% favouring the island\u2019s outright independence from France. Macron\u2019s opponents in the French presidential race \u2013 which polls show he will win \u2013 said the rioting and public order crisis had led Macron to move on the Corsica issue. Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse said it showed that Macron \u201cgives in to violence\u201d. She said public order must be restored in Corsica before any negotiations take place."

            "date": "2022-03-28T13:11:14Z",
            "content": "Emmanuel Macron has said the far-right presidential candidate \u00c9ric Zemmour might need a free hearing aid if he failed to notice the chanting of \u201cMacron assassin\u201d at a rally on Sunday. The anti-immigration former TV pundit, who has insisted he did not hear the crowd, had evoked three notorious criminal attacks in France \u2013 two of them antisemitic, the third carried out by a jihadist \u2013 and accused the state of laxity when the chants calling the French president a murderer began. Video of the event, attended by thousands, shows Zemmour waiting until the crowd quietened before continuing his address. Macron \u2013 on a tour of Dijon as the presidential election campaign officially began on Monday \u2013 said Zemmour\u2019s behaviour in letting the crowd continue chanting was either \u201cundignified\u201d or that he must have hearing problems. He responded with humour, calling on him to \u201cprofit\u201d from his health reforms that meant hearing aids were now reimbursed by the health system. \u201cI invited the hard-of-hearing candidate to equip himself [with one] for nothing,\u201d Macron said. Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, the candidate for the centre-right Les R\u00e9publicains, was also among those to criticise Zemmour for letting the crowd continue chanting. \u201cI will fight the outgoing president with all my strength, but to let an opponent be called a murderer is dangerous for the republic. This is certainly not the right! This is not my France,\u201d P\u00e9cresse tweeted. Christophe Castaner, the president of the governing LREM group in the Assembl\u00e9e nationale, said Zemmour was \u201cirresponsible\u201d for letting the chanting continue. Zemmour\u2019s team said their candidate had not heard the crowd. As the official campaign opened, with rules giving all 12 candidates an equal chance to be heard by voters, the latest poll by OpinionWay for the French financial newspaper Les Echos showed Emmanuel Macron on 28% of the first-round vote, followed by the far-right Marine Le Pen on 21%. Behind them Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has risen to 14%, with P\u00e9cresse on 11% and Zemmour on 10%. Polls suggest Macron would comfortably win a run-off against Le Pen, but leading political scientists have warned voters against assuming the result is a foregone conclusion and not voting. With less than two weeks to go, Dominique Reyni\u00e9, the head of Fondapol, an influential thinktank, said anything could happen. Many of the 12 candidates have been campaigning for months but the final fortnight in the run-up to the first-round vote on 10 April sees the introduction of tighter restrictions. These include equal TV and radio airtime being given to each candidate regardless of performance in opinion polls. Since 1 January, broadcasters have been required only to ensure candidates are given airtime according to their \u201cpolitical standing\u201d, based on their recent polling and previous election results. However, from Monday, the French audiovisual authority (Arcom) will ensure each candidate \u2013 no matter how low in the polls \u2013 will be given the same prime airtime. Macron has a clear advantage with France holding the presidency of the European Union and his high-profile attempts to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. Arcom has said only his statements that relate to \u201cthe political debate\u201d in France will be counted and not those linked to his role as president of the country or EU. Candidates are also invited to send voters a profession de foi (profession of faith) explaining why they should be elected; the letters are paid for by the state. An estimated 100m of these letters are distributed during the two rounds of the election at a cost expected to top \u20ac64m (\u00a354m). The state also allocates money to each candidate to make a short political broadcast to be aired on public TV during primetime. The official start of the campaign also means election posters can be put up outside polling stations including town halls, schools and other public buildings. Each candidate has their own board. The campaign is paused at midnight on the Friday before the vote \u2013 meaning 8 April in French overseas territories and 9 April in mainland France \u2013 during which time no polls or election campaign material can be broadcast until after the first-round results are known. The cycle then continues until midnight on the Friday before the second-round vote on 24 April."

            "content": "Yoon Suk-yeol, a conservative former prosecutor, declared victory in South Korea\u2019s presidential election on Thursday after his liberal rival conceded defeat following a bitter battle in the politically divided nation. Yoon, from the main opposition People Power Party, edged out the ruling Democratic Party\u2019s Lee Jae-myung with 48.6% of the vote to 47.8%, with more than 98% of the ballots counted as of 4.20am on Thursday (7.20pm GMT on Wednesday). \u201cThis is a victory of the great South Korean people,\u201d Yoon told cheering supporters, who were chanting his name at the country\u2019s National Assembly. He later pledged to honour the constitution and parliament and work with opposition parties to heal polarised politics and foster unity, calling the election a \u201cvictory of the great people\u201d. \u201cOur competition is over for now,\u201d he told a news conference, thanking and consoling Lee and other rivals. \u201cWe have to join hands and unite into one for the people and the country.\u201d Lee conceded defeat and congratulated his opponent. \u201cI did my best, but failed to live up to your expectations,\u201d he told a news conference, blaming his \u201cshortcomings\u201d. \u201cThe president-elect, I desperately ask you to overcome divisions and conflicts and open an era of integration and unity.\u201d The White House congratulated Yoon and said President Joe Biden said he looked forward to working closely with him to expand close cooperation between the allies. \u201cThe alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea, our economies and our people is ironclad. President Biden looks forward to continue working with the new president-elect to further expand our close cooperation,\u201d a spokesperson said. The unusually bitter election campaign was marred by scandals and smears, but the policy stakes are high for the country of 52 million. About 77% of South Korea\u2019s 44 million eligible voters cast ballots to pick the leader of a nation whose global status is rising even as it has been riven by gender and generational divisions, while facing a confrontational North Korea. In echoes of the 2020 national assembly elections, voters wore masks and used hand sanitiser, casting their ballots on the same day South Korea reported a record 342,446 new Covid-19 cases. More than a million people are isolating at home after testing positive, health authorities say. The country amended its electoral laws last month to ensure they would be able to vote. Yoon, who was hoping to benefit from public anger over rising house prices in Seoul, income inequality and youth unemployment, said during the campaign that he would address mounting economic problems with a dose of fiscal conservatism, including a cut in the minimum wage and the removal of limits on working hours. As an avowed \u201canti-feminist\u201d he has pledged to abolish the ministry for gender equality, claiming South Korean women do not suffer systemic discrimination - despite voluminous evidence to the contrary. He vowed to address the housing crisis with tax relief, pledged support for small businesses and self-employed people, and encouraged the private sector to create jobs and builds millions of new homes. While North Korea\u2019s recent return to ballistic missile tests was lower down the list of voter priorities, Yoon\u2019s team has said he would restart talks with the regime in Pyongyang, while boosting South Korea\u2019s deterrent capabilities. That could include buying an additional US missile defence system, despite criticism from China that its powerful radar can penetrate its territory. South Korea\u2019s decision to deploy the system, known as Thaad, in 2017 triggered economic retaliation from Beijing."

            "content": "Federal Labor has finalised its candidates in a number of crucial seats ahead of this year\u2019s election, including the controversial choice of Andrew Charlton to contest Parramatta and a consensus replacement for Kimberley Kitching in the Senate. Nominations for vacant positions closed on Monday, with only one candidate to replace each of Kitching, retiring Victorian left senator Kim Carr, MP Julie Owens and right faction MP Anthony Byrne. Jana Stewart, a Mutthi Mutthi and Wamba Wamba woman and former Victorian public servant, will take Kitching\u2019s Senate spot. Before the vacancy had been filled Kitching\u2019s death sparked factional in-fighting in the Victorian ALP. Allies of Kitching and the outgoing senator Carr have sought leave to fight the federal party\u2019s control over preselections in the high court. The Victorian corrections minister, Natalie Hutchins, who was backed by Kitching\u2019s faction, and the former Higgins candidate, Fiona McLeod, who was backed by the larger right faction of deputy leader, Richard Marles, did not contest the vacancy. Carr, who announced his retirement on Sunday, will be replaced by Linda White, a former Australian Services Union official \u2013 but only after 1 July, assuming Labor wins two Senate seats in Victoria in the upcoming May poll. Labor\u2019s right faction selected Cassandra Fernando, a Shop Distributive and Allied Employees organiser, for the safe seat of Holt in Melbourne\u2019s south-east, refusing to cede the seat to the left faction despite its superior numbers in Labor\u2019s membership. Fernando is a Sri Lankan-Australian, whose nomination will help the right redress the underrepresentation of women in its faction. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Charlton, a managing director of Accenture who worked as an economic adviser to Kevin Rudd, will contest the seat of Parramatta \u2013 a seat on the Coalition\u2019s target list held by Labor on a margin of 3.5%. Charlton was backed by the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, but his preselection is controversial as it is the second time in a year the ALP has installed a person from an Anglo-Celtic background over candidates from diverse backgrounds into a western Sydney seat. At least three candidates from Parramatta \u2013 or nearby branches \u2013 considered a run at the seat: Durga Owen, a former staffer of the retiring MP; Alan Mascarenhas, a former Sydney Morning Herald journalist; and Abha Devasia, a lawyer from Labor\u2019s hard left. But they did not contest the preselection, reflecting the view that Charlton was favoured."

            "date": "2022-03-25T01:44:08Z",
            "content": "In the weeks after the 2020 election, the rightwing activist Ginni Thomas \u2013 who is married to the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas \u2013 repeatedly implored Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff to help overturn the results, according to text messages obtained by the Washington Post and CBS News. In one of 29 messages seen by the news outlets, Thomas wrote to Mark Meadows on 10 November: \u201cHelp This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! \u2026 You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America\u2019s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.\u201d The messages shed light on Thomas\u2019s direct line to the White House and how she used it to push the \u201cbig lie\u201d that Trump had won the election \u2013 with Meadows\u2019 apparent support, the Post reported. The exchanges are among 2,320 texts Meadows handed to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. \u201cThis is a fight of good versus evil,\u201d Meadows wrote in a 24 November message. \u201cEvil always looks like the victor until the King of Kings triumphs. Do not grow weary in well doing. The fight continues. I have staked my career on it. Well at least my time in DC on it.\u201d Meadows\u2019 lawyer, George Terwilliger III, acknowledged the messages\u2019 existence to the Post but said they did not raise \u201clegal issues\u201d. Thomas did not respond to the newspaper\u2019s requests for comment. She has previously said that she does not discuss her activist work with her husband, and the messages do not mention him or the supreme court, according to the Post. Terwilliger and Thomas did not immediately reply to requests for comment from the Guardian. Messages left for the supreme court\u2019s public information office were not immediately returned. When the supreme court rejected Trump challenges over the election in February 2021, Clarence Thomas dissented, calling the decision \u201cbaffling\u201d, the Post notes. The text messages \u2013 21 of which are from Thomas and eight from Meadows \u2013 contain references to conspiracy theories. Thomas, for instance, highlighted a claim popular among QAnon followers that the president had watermarked certain ballots as a means of identifying fraud. She also suggested the Bidens were behind supposed fraud. \u201cBiden crime family &amp; ballot fraud co-conspirators \u2026 are being arrested &amp; detained for ballot fraud right now &amp; over coming days, &amp; will be living in barges off GITMO to face military tribunals for sedition,\u201d she wrote. Thomas seemed to condemn some Republicans in Congress for being insufficiently loyal to Trump. \u201cHouse and Senate guys are pathetic too\u2026 only 4 GOP House members seen out in street rallies with grassroots,\u201d she wrote in a 10 November message, adding later that night: \u201cWhere the heck are all those who benefited by Presidents coattails?!!!\u201d Other messages refer to conservative commentators and lawyers who supported Trump\u2019s cause, including Sidney Powell, whom Thomas apparently wanted to be \u201cthe lead and the face\u201d of Trump\u2019s legal team. Powell was behind a slate of lawsuits seeking to overturn the election and faces investigation by the Texas State Bar Association over alleged false claims in court. Thomas expressed repeated support for Powell even as she became a divisive figure in pro-Trump circles, the Post notes. \u201cSidney Powell &amp; improved coordination now will help the cavalry come and Fraud exposed and America saved,\u201d she wrote on 13 November. \u201cListen to Rush. Mark Steyn, Bongino, Cleta,\u201d Thomas urged Meadows in another message, apparently referring to the commentators Rush Limbaugh, Mark Steyn and Dan Bongino, and Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who backed Trump\u2019s claims in Georgia. \u201cI will stand firm. We will fight until there is no fight left,\u201d Meadows replied. \u201cOur country is too precious to give up on. Thanks for all you do.\u201d Thomas has acknowledged attending Trump\u2019s rally before the Capitol attack on 6 January 2021, though she says she left before the then president spoke. She condemned the ensuing violence."

            "date": "2022-03-21T07:00:20Z",
            "content": "When you have faulty goods or receive poor service, it can be really hard to get redress. Companies fob you off, you don\u2019t know your rights or you get sent from pillar to post. Follow these tips to get what you deserve. Put it in writing Always put your complaint in writing. Email is easiest but you can also send it by post. The risk of being pushed from pillar to post is reduced, and you won\u2019t have to repeat yourself if you need to contact the company again because it will have the details on record. You can keep rewriting before clicking the send button on an email so the risk of losing your temper is reduced and you can make sure you haven\u2019t forgotten anything. Most importantly, though, you have a record of what has been said and when it was said. You may need to take the matter further, for instance, by going to an alternative dispute resolution provider (usually an ombudsman) or making a claim through the small claims court. Phone calls will not give you the evidence you will need if you pursue these avenues. If the company has made it difficult for you to contact it, get the email address of the chief executive; you can do this for free at ceoemail.com. The chief executive may not respond personally (although some do) but your message should escalate the matter and get your complaint noticed and dealt with. Be reasonable Before you raise a complaint, check that you are being objective and that there are grounds for a formal complaint. Complaining about a sales assistant\u2019s clothing would be subjective and inappropriate. But if the assistant threw down and damaged the item you were collecting, complaining about that would be reasonable. However frustrated you may feel, ranting to customer services will not help. You are far more likely to succeed by remaining polite and non-threatening. Know your consumer law You do not need to be able to quote lots of legalese but demonstrating that you know your rights means you are less likely to be fobbed off. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, you are entitled to goods that are free from defects, of satisfactory quality, match the description and last a reasonable length of time. When you are paying for services, they must be carried out with reasonable skill and care. If your item turns out to be in breach of any of the act within 30 days from purchase, you are entitled to a full refund. After this time you can receive a replacement or repair. Within the first 30 days you will need to prove the problem was there at the point of purchase. But in reality this is rarely questioned. You need a proof of purchase, which doesn\u2019t have to be a receipt. A bank or loyalty card statement would also work as proof. If your purchase breaches any of the CRA requirements, then if you have to send back the item the trader is liable for the postage costs. Contrary to popular belief, you are not entitled to a full refund because you changed your mind. However, the law is different for purchases bought online. Under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, you have a 14-day cooling-off period from when you receive them. Go to the right place Your contract is always with the company to which you paid the money. So, if your parcel is late or lost, do not contact the courier to complain; contact the retailer instead. For late items, you are entitled to a refund of any extra costs you paid as a result of the lateness. If the courier damages anything, including your property, it is still the retailer who is responsible for putting the matter right, so address your complaints to it. Give a deadline Give the company a timescale by which it has to respond. With an email, five working days is fine as there is no need to factor in time for your complaint to arrive. For letters, you may need to give a little longer. It may be that the company needs longer to investigate. However, it should get back to you before the deadline to tell you when you can expect to hear from it again. A good sentence to end your email with is: \u201cShould I not receive a satisfactory response I will not hesitate in taking the matter further. This will include but not be limited to \u2026\u201d This could be sharing your experience on social media and various forums or engaging with an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider or the small claims court. As soon as any deadline has passed, if you have not had a response send a follow-up email outlining further action you will be taking. Say what you want Companies often say that the most difficult thing about dealing with complaints is not knowing what the customer wants them to do to put things right. Make it easy for people to understand what you want and how to give it to you by stating what it is in your letter. Is it a full refund? A repair? An apology? An explanation for poor service? Whatever it is, be clear in your request. Thinking about this will also help you to decide whether you are satisfied with any remedy you are offered. Take the matter further If you do not receive a satisfactory response you have a couple of choices. If the company you are complaining to is a member of an ADR scheme, you can take your complaint to the relevant provider. Some schemes are mandatory for certain sectors such as telecoms (Communication Ombudsman or CISAS, the Communication &amp; Internet Services Adjudication Scheme), energy (Energy Ombudsman) and finance (Financial Ombudsman Service). Non-statutory schemes (so traders do not have to join) include the Motor Ombudsman, whose members include vehicle manufacturers, warranty product providers, franchised dealers, independent garages, networks and bodyshops. The Dispute Resolution Ombudsman runs the Furniture &amp; Home Improvement Ombudsman and the Rail Ombudsman. All the schemes are listed on the website of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. You can take your issue to the relevant body eight weeks after you first complained or once you have received a deadlock letter from the company. The company is bound by its decision, whereas you are not. If the company is not a member of an ADR scheme or you don\u2019t like the decision, then the small claims court is an option. To show the company you are serious in your intention, send a \u201cletter/email before action\u201d outlining that you intend to take it to court. List the costs, including the court fees. Go to the small claims court websites for England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, fill out everything, right up to payment, take a screenshot and attach it to an email to the chief executive."

Inside the sheds we have 60 cattle, eating the hay and silage that was made in our meadows last summer. Soon it will be time for them to be turned out to the fields or sold on to another farm. Some of last year\u2019s calves are to be sold, and so this morning we must test them for tuberculosis before they can move. We\u2019ve never had TB, but because there are farmers in our area who have, we are under restrictions. These restrictions are needed for public safety, but are a drain on our own time, money and emotional resources. It is still below freezing when the vet arrives with a hat pulled tightly over her ears, and she begins the process of disinfecting herself before handling our cattle. She fills a bucket with disinfectant and water, and brushes her wellies and waterproof trousers down carefully. I ask if any TB has been found in the area this week. \u201cNot at my jobs, no.\u201d I remark that she must be a lucky charm. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say that, I don\u2019t want to jinx things,\u201d she says. We are all a little nervous this morning. The cows are waiting in the ancient stone pens that were used by drovers in the 18th century when this was a coaching inn, sending up clouds of steamy breath as they jostle about, wondering what is going to happen next. The cattle crush \u2013 the piece of steel machinery that holds them in place \u2013 is moved in front of the gate so they can be held safely as the vet looks at the two sites on their necks where she injected TB earlier this week. She holds a pair of plier-like instruments in one hand to measure any swelling, and a clipboard in the other. I\u2019ve hardly slept this week. The consequences for the cattle and for our farm business will be huge if TB is found. First in is a steer and the crush closes around his head. I feel a little faint, and I hope that my world is not about to close in around me. \u2022 Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary \u2022 The last paragraph of this article was amended on 30 March 2022, to mention a steer, instead of a cow."

            "content": "A family trip to the theatre or an afternoon at a museum may be a fun day out, but new research suggests that such cultural outings will not actually help children secure higher grades. There have been persistent theories that wealthier children may be given an advantage in their school careers by being pressed into visits to art galleries and exhibitions. According to a new academic study, however, outings often regarded as \u201cmiddle class\u201d had no correlation with improved GCSE results. The findings emerge in a study examining the impact of \u201ccultural capital\u201d and its power to improve the life chances of children, as well as the extent to which it explains the persistent inequality experienced by children from richer or poorer backgrounds. While family cultural outings had no discernible impact, researchers did find that reading activities by both parents and their children played a role in exam grades. They measured activities such as reading for pleasure, visiting a library and discussing books at home. Such activities boosted GCSE scores by a significant amount. \u201cEngaging in two or three reading activities, on average, increases the pupil\u2019s GCSE score by between seven and nine points,\u201d they found. \u201cThe size of this effect should not be overlooked since an extra GCSE pass at grade A* is worth eight points.\u201d Researchers behind the study, due to appear in the British Journal of Sociology of Education, say it has real implications for ministers. The authors from the Universities of Sussex and Edinburgh said the concept of cultural capital \u201chas become more prominent in government education policy\u201d. They point to new guidance from Ofsted, stating that in assessing the quality of education at a school, \u201cinspectors will consider the extent to which schools are equipping pupils with the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life\u201d. \u201cIt is beguiling to believe that increasing pupils\u2019 levels of cultural capital will have a positive influence on school GCSE outcomes,\u201d the paper states. \u201cIt is tempting to theorise that visits to museums or historic venues might be helpful in igniting interests in history, and that visits to the theatre might similarly cultivate learning in drama. On deeper reflection, it is difficult to plausibly describe mechanisms by which the exposure to certain extracurricular activities would influence outcomes in other school GCSE subjects. \u201cThis study reports a set of empirical findings that do not lend any support to the view that increasing cultural capital will reduce the size of social class inequalities in school GCSE outcomes. This is not to argue that activities that have sometimes been associated with increasing cultural capital should not be part of the school experience \u2013 for example extracurricular trips may contribute to educational enjoyment.\u201d Researchers used statistical models based on data from the Understanding Society survey, which documents the lives of households across Britain. They then linked this data to educational records held in the national pupil database. They examined \u201ccultural capital\u201d activities, as well as the reading activities, of both parents and their children to examine any links. Other studies have found that visiting museums, art galleries and theatres could have much broader benefits beyond education. One study by UCL academics concluded that they could actually lead to a longer life. The 2019 study found that the more often people engage with the arts, the lower their risk of premature death. It led to calls for cultural trips to be prescribed as a way of boosting wellbeing and supported studies that found regular cultural visits could improve depression, dementia, chronic pain and frailty."

            "date": "2022-03-23T06:33:10Z",
            "content": "China Evergrande Group has blamed a \u201cdrastic change\u201d in the company\u2019s prospects for a delay to publishing its annual results but has promised investors that it will reveal how it plans to restructure its massive debts of $300bn by the end of July. Evergrande, which has been kept alive by government-run rescue operation since it defaulted on $22.7bn worth of overseas debts in December, said audit work would not be completed by the 31 March deadline. It promised to \u201cfurther enhance communications\u201d with investors. The turmoil at the stricken company was underlined when it also announced its property services unit had discovered a $2bn hole in its accounts. Evergrande said it had launched an investigation into how banks had seized the cash, which had apparently been pledged as security for third party guarantees without the property services unit\u2019s knowledge. It described the problem as a \u201cmajor incident\u201d. The seizure of the funds, which the property services unit discovered when it was preparing its annual report, underscores the turmoil at Evergrande and has baffled investors, who had seen Evergrande Property Services as one of the better-run divisions of the sprawling empire built by former steel executive Xu Jiayin. Andrew Chan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said: \u201cIt\u2019s peculiar because investors expect Evergrande management should be aware of where the cash went rather than instead setting up an investigation committee to find out.\u201d It will also increase fears among foreign creditors that they will never see their money. Tim Symes, insolvency and asset recovery partner at the international law firm Stewarts, said the seizure of the cash by local banks would have repercussions for confidence in investing in China. \u201cThis significant development will feed the concerns by international bondholders that their interests will be subordinated by domestic interests,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t help is the lack of information coming out to the international bondholders, hampering the ability to report to investors on the present situation and the likely fate of the bonds. This situation has wider consequences that may ultimately affect future decisions on investment in Chinese company bonds.\u201d Several other major property developers, including Hopson Development Holdings and Ronshine, have delayed their results or seen their auditors resign amid concern that the annual reporting season will reveal more weaknesses in China\u2019s giant real estate sector. Kaisa Group Holdings became the latest to say it would unable to publish audited earnings for 2021 by the end of March when it said late on Tuesday that a Covid lockdown in Shenzhen left audit work incomplete. Its stock price dropped 2.7% on Wednesday Other major developers including Sunac China Holdings and Shimao Group Holdings also this week said they will delay reporting audited results due to disruption caused by Covid-19. Evergrande, once China\u2019s top-selling developer and now reeling under more than $300bn in liabilities, defaulted on overseas bond payments in December and has struggled to repay suppliers and creditors, and complete projects and homes. Shares in Evergrande and other Chinese property companies soared last week thanks to an announcement by vice premier Liu He that the government in Beijing would be urging the rollout of market-friendly policies to support the economy. But the debt crisis in the industry \u2013 brought on intially by a Beijing-led crackdown on reckless lending \u2013 continues to worsen. On the same day as Liu made his speech last week, China\u2019s third-biggest property developer, Sunac, was downgraded by the credit agency S&amp;P because of concerns that it might not be able to meet its huge debt repayments of nearly $4bn due this year. Investors have been left hanging on for more information from Evergrande after it announced in January that it aimed to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place within six months. The developer set up a risk management committee in December made up mostly of members from state enterprises, as the Guangdong provincial government is leading the restructuring. \u201cWith the broad support and understanding from the majority of creditors \u2026 we strive to release the preliminary restructuring proposal by the end of July,\u201d Chen Yong, a member of the committee, told investors on Tuesday. As part of its plans to divest assets to repay some of its offshore debt, the developer is working to sell its Yuen Long land parcel in Hong Kong as well as the Evergrande Centre commercial building, said Evergrande board member Liang Senlin. Trading in shares of Evergrande, its property services unit Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd, and electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd have been suspended since Monday. Liang said on the investor call the developer was trying to draft in strategic investors in both the electric vehicle and property services units to restore value \u2013 a goal it has been pursuing for roughly a year without much success. Siu said the EV unit aimed to start mass production in June of its inaugural electric car, the Hengchi 5 sport-utility vehicle, after getting approval to start sales last week. Some of the investors who attended the call were not impressed with the assurances from management. \u201cThey mainly explained why the trading of stocks is suspended. There was no new information and the situation remained the same,\u201d said a bondholder who was on the call, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media."

            "date": "2022-03-03T22:01:19Z",
            "content": "Polls have closed in the Birmingham Erdington by-election, amid jitters among Labour campaigners that a low turnout could jeopardise the party\u2019s hold on the seat. The byelection was triggered by the death of the Labour MP Jack Dromey, who had represented the constituency since 2010. It has been held by Labour since 1974: as long as it has existed in its current form. Dromey had a majority of 3,600 at the last election. Labour poured campaigners into the local area on Thursday on a concerted get-out-the-vote drive, as wet weather risked further depressing turnout in a seat where it has previously been low in past contests \u2013 making the result harder to predict. One activist said they had run out of potential voters to rally by 6.30pm, and were anxious about the result. Two Labour MPs campaigning in the seat said they thought they would hold it, however. The Conservatives made gains in the West Midlands in the 2019 general election, winning longstanding Labour seats including Birmingham Northfield, and Tom Watson\u2019s former constituency of West Bromwich East. A Tory source said Boris Johnson\u2019s party did not expect to win in Erdington, but hoped to maintain its 2019 vote share, which was 40% to Labour\u2019s 50%. The elections expert Patrick English, of YouGov, said: \u201cAll signs point to what should be a comfortable hold for Starmer\u2019s party tonight.\u201d He highlighted the fact that when Labour lost the Hartlepool byelection to the Conservatives last May, they were trailing the Conservatives by about 10 points in the national polls, but have now been leading consistently for almost three months. The Conservatives\u2019 poll lead has been obliterated after months of debilitating headlines over lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, and there is little sign as yet that the prime minister\u2019s handling of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is helping to restore his reputation in voters\u2019 eyes. The party suffered the humiliating loss of the North Shropshire byelection to the Liberal Democrats in December, after the resignation of disgraced former MP Owen Paterson, and senior Tories are concerned they could see significant losses in forthcoming local elections. Labour\u2019s candidate in Erdington, local nurse Paulette Hamilton, was embroiled in controversy this week when comments emerged from 2015 when she attended a meeting called \u201cThe Ballot or the Bullet \u2013 Does Your Vote Count?\u201d about increasing minorities\u2019 representation in politics. Hamilton said she was not sure \u201cwe will get what we really deserve in this country using the vote\u201d. Labour said the remarks had been taken out of context. Hamilton brought up her five children in Erdington and has sat on Birmingham city council for 18 years. She returned to the NHS frontline during the pandemic. The Conservative candidate is another local councillor, Bobby Alden, the leader of the Conservative group on the council, who has contested Erdington unsuccessfully four times in the past."

            "date": "2022-03-28T10:47:13Z",
            "content": "What\u2019s the story and why is it important? France elects its next president in two rounds of voting on 10 and 24 April that will determine the course of western Europe\u2019s second-largest country for the next five years. Twelve candidates \u2013 eight men and four women \u2013 qualified for inclusion on the first round ballot paper by gathering the necessary 500 endorsements from elected officials. Only a handful, however, have any chance of progressing to the second round run-off, including the favourites Emmanuel Macron, the outgoing president, and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally. Polls suggest three others will secure more than 10% of the vote: the hard-left veteran Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon; Le Pen\u2019s far-right rival, the anti-immigrant polemicist \u00c9ric Zemmour; and Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse of the rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains party. While the split in the far-right vote and Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine favoured Macron, the result is far from a foregone conclusion: the polls have narrowed sharply, 40% of voters are still undecided, and the president\u2019s team are particularly worried about the possibility of a low turnout. The election\u2019s outcome will have an impact beyond France, to the rest of European Union (France is the EU\u2019s second largest economy) and beyond. Since Angela Merkel left office, the liberal, centrist Macron has become the bloc\u2019s most visible leader, a believer in greater \u201cEuropean sovereignty\u201d and an outspoken defender of western values with a clear desire to shape world events. A Le Pen victory would deal a heavy symbolic blow to the EU and be widely seen as a further populist, nation-first threat to the bloc\u2019s drive for greater integration. How does the system work? To qualify for the first round, each candidate had to secure the backing of at least 500 of more than 40,000 MPs, MEPs, senators, regional councillors and mayors from at least 30 different d\u00e9partements and overseas territories by 4 March. Assuming \u2013 as is virtually certain \u2013 that none wins a majority in the first round, the two highest scorers will then face off against each other two weeks later. The winner of that second round needs to score more than 50% of the vote. The two-round system, also used in parliamentary, local and regional polls, was introduced in 1962 by Charles de Gaulle and has thus far proved effective at keeping extremists from power: the French say you vote first with your heart, then your head. Where are the frontrunners on the left? Macron\u2019s victory in 2017 at the head of a centrist political startup blew up France\u2019s political landscape in spectacular fashion, plunging the combined score of traditional left and right parties of government to a historic low. The Socialist party (PS), which in 2012 controlled the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, parliament and most of France\u2019s regions, was shattered. Its presidential candidate came fifth on 6.4% of the vote, a worst-ever score, and in parliamentary elections it lost 250 of its 280 MPs. According to polls, the French left, including the Green party (EELV), should attract about 27% of the vote \u2013 more than enough to reach the second round if it was cast for a single candidate. However, the vote will be divided between six candidates. These include M\u00e9lenchon, the leader of La France Insoumise (Unbowed France) and the only leftwing candidate forecast to reach double figures; the Socialist candidate, the Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo; the Greens\u2019 Yannick Jadot; and the Communist Fabien Roussel. Christiane Taubira, a former Socialist justice minister, won a \u201cpopular primary\u201d intended to unify the left but M\u00e9lenchon, Jadot and Hidalgo refused to recognise it. She withdrew her candidacy in early March after failing to win 500 endorsements. And what about the right? The conservative Les R\u00e9publicains (LR) were also hit by the arrival of Macron and his La R\u00e9publique En Marche (LaREM), failing in 2017 to make the second round for the first time since 1981. In a France that polls suggest has shifted rightwards, LR is still a potent force: it came back strongly in regional elections last year. But squeezed on one side by Macron, whose centre-right economic policies appeal to moderate conservatives, and on the other by Le Pen and Zemmour, vying for more traditionalist and sovereignist voters, it has little room to manoeuvre. On the far right, the battle between the two rivals is fierce. Le Pen\u2019s efforts to \u201cdetoxify\u201d her 50-year-old nationalist party left her exposed to Zemmour\u2019s more virulent xenophobic rhetoric, leading to defections from the National Rally ranks \u2013 including by Le Pen\u2019s popular, more socially conservative niece, Marion Mar\u00e9chal . For the time being Le Pen appears to have come out on top, but many observers believe Zemmour\u2019s longer-term aim is the demise of the National Rally and the foundation of a new national-sovereignist movement uniting the far right with the more traditionalist right who cannot bring themselves to vote for Le Pen. Who are the main candidates and what do they want? Emmanuel Macron France\u2019s president, a former merchant banker and economy minister under his Socialist predecessor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is an economically liberal, pro-business reformist, but a progressive on most social issues. Despite his promise to be \u201cneither right nor left\u201d, in office he is widely perceived as having drifted rightwards. He has also suffered from a reputation for arrogance and aloofness that he has tried to temper. A \u201crally round the flag\u201d effect at the start of the war in Ukraine led to a polling boost that is fading, but Macron remains favourite. Marine Le Pen The leader of the National Rally wants to end immigration, slash crime, eradicate Islamism and save France from globalisation, but has rowed back on plans to pull it out of the EU. Her \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d would favour French business, while \u201cFrance-first\u201d social policies in housing, health, education and employment would favour French people. Her recent surge in the polls suggests her long drive to sanitise the party founded by her father, Jean-Marie, in 1972 has largely succeeded in softening its image and normalising its policies, while past statements expressing admiration for the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, do not appear to have done significant electoral damage. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon The outspoken leader of La France Insoumise party was a junior Socialist minister from 2000 to 2002 and has campaigned for a shorter working week, lower retirement age, higher minimum wage, benefits and top tax rate, and the end of the presidential regime of the Fifth Republic. A talented orator, he has been climbing in the polls for the past several weeks, but analysts believe he may struggle to match his performance in the 2017 campaign, when he polled almost 20%. Eric Zemmour A far-right TV polemicist who has convictions for inciting racial hatred and promotes the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory that Muslim immigrants will \u201creplace\u201d the populations of European countries, Zemmour has won a following for his violent diatribes against immigration. His book on the supposed decline of France has been a bestseller. Despite some large and enthusiastic rallies, Zemmour\u2019s support has, however, faded in recent weeks and in particular since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse The president of the greater Paris \u00cele-de-France region, the candidate of the rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains is a former budget minister and has described herself as \u201ctwo-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher\u201d. Socially conservative (she was heavily involved in anti-gay marriage protests, although has since said she will not revisit the issue), she has tacked towards the hard right on immigration but remains relatively centrist by LR standards on the economy. The need to represent all factions of her party, however, has led to some confused messaging and a campaign that has so far failed to take off. Yannick Jadot The choice of Europe Ecologie Les Verts (EELV), France\u2019s Green party, Jadot withdrew in 2017 to boost the flagging chances of the doomed Socialist candidate but is now aiming to transfer the success his party enjoyed in 2020\u2019s local elections, when it picked up several big city halls, to the national level. He is campaigning for what he has called \u201cconcrete ecology in action\u201d: green solutions for commuting, housing, food, rebuilding local economies. Anne Hidalgo The first female mayor of Paris has highlighted her working-class, Spanish-immigrant roots and promised to improve salaries, particularly for teachers. Although her green, car-free policies were popular enough to win her a second mayoral term, she may struggle to shed her image as \u201ctoo Parisian\u201d for the rest of France, and her flagging campaign is suffering from deep divisions in the Socialist camp. Who will win? Polls show Macron winning the first round ahead of Le Pen, followed by M\u00e9lenchon, Zemmour and P\u00e9cresse. In the second round, Macron is predicted to beat all potential challengers, although Le Pen would run him close. A lot, however, can still change. Voting intentions particularly for Macron and Le Pen have shifted significantly in recent weeks and French presidential election campaigns have a history of throwing up unexpected events that have sometimes dramatically influenced results. What happens after the new president is elected? France holds legislative elections, also over two rounds, on 12 and 19 June \u2013 and without a majority in parliament a French president\u2019s powers are limited. Even if Macron remains favourite for the presidential poll, his LaREM party has failed to build grassroots support and polled disappointingly in regional, local and European elections. Many analysts foresee a splintered parliament possibly requiring complex negotiations and alliance-building to secure a majority."

            "date": "2022-03-09T13:31:45Z",
            "content": "Exit polls in South Korea showed the two main contenders in the presidential election neck and neck, after a campaign overshadowed by personal attacks and the country\u2019s worst coronavirus wave of the pandemic. The People Power party\u2019s candidate, Yoon Suk-yeol, a conservative who supports a tougher stance on North Korea, has 48.4% of the vote, according to a joint exit poll by three TV networks, while his Democratic party opponent, Lee Jae-myung, was on 47.8%. But another poll by broadcaster JTBC showed Lee ahead with 48.4% to Yoon\u2019s 47.7%. With the result still too close to call, the identity of the leader of Asia\u2019s fourth biggest economy will not be made official until around midnight. A Yoon victory would end liberal hopes of securing another five years in the presidential Blue House as the successor to Moon Jae-in, a left-leaning former human rights lawyer. A record 37% of South Korea\u2019s 44 million eligible voters cast early ballots during a two-day period last week, the highest number since the system was introduced in 2013. The polls closed at 6pm for most people but polling stations remained open for another 90 minutes to enable people with Covid-19 to vote. In echoes of the 2020 national assembly elections, voters wore masks and used hand sanitiser, casting their ballots on the same day South Korea reported a record 342,446 new Covid-19 cases. More than a million people are isolating at home after testing positive, health authorities say. The country amended its electoral laws last month to ensure they would be able to vote. Yoon, who was hoping to benefit from public anger over rising house prices in Seoul, income inequality and youth unemployment, said during the campaign that he would address mounting economic problems with a dose of fiscal conservatism, including a cut in the minimum wage and the removal of limits on working hours. He vowed to address the housing crisis with tax relief, pledged support for small businesses and self-employed people, and encouraged the private sector to create jobs and builds millions of new homes. Park Ki-tae, a 38-year-old resident of the capital, said after casting his vote: \u201cI\u2019m really worried about housing prices in Seoul and I hope the new president will focus on making people\u2019s lives easier and better.\u201d While North Korea\u2019s recent return to ballistic missile tests was lower down the list of voter priorities, Yoon\u2019s team has said he would restart talks with the regime in Pyongyang, while boosting South Korea\u2019s deterrent capabilities. That could include buying an additional US missile defence system, despite criticism from China that its powerful radar can penetrate its territory. South Korea\u2019s decision to deploy the system, known as Thaad, in 2017 triggered economic retaliation from Beijing. A longtime member of Moon\u2019s Democratic party, Lee rose to prominence with an aggressive pandemic response, a populist economic agenda, and by touting his outsider image. Lee has called for an expansionary fiscal policy and universal basic income of 1m won (\u00a3600) a year to every individual, as well as cash handouts to all people to soften the financial blow dealt by Covid-19. The rest of the world will look for signs of a new approach to North Korea under South Korea\u2019s new president, after Moon\u2019s policy of engagement paved the way for summits with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, but made no progress on the key issue of nuclear weapons. Yoon has said he supports a pre-emptive strike against North Korea if an attack appears imminent, but has promised \u201csignificant and immediate\u201d benefits if the regime takes verifiable steps towards denuclearisation. Lee has said he would send special envoys to the US, China, Japan and North Korea as soon as he is elected in an attempt to revive negotiations and end the standoff over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme. Controversially, he has called for exemptions to UN sanctions so that dormant inter-Korean economic projects can be revived. Having appealed to young male voters who are unhappy about attempts under Moon to address gender inequality, Yoon could add fuel to the national debate over women\u2019s rights if, as president, he honours a campaign promise to abolish the gender equality ministry. He has claimed that South Korean women do not suffer from \u201csystemic gender discrimination\u201d, even though the country performs poorly in international comparisons of the gender pay gap and female representation in senior management. \u201cThe widespread support Yoon enjoys from young men is frankly absolutely terrifying from a woman\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Keung Yoon Bae, an academic who voted on Wednesday. Lee would keep the ministry, but in an apparent sop to anti-feminist voters he has said he would drop the word \u201cwomen\u201d from its official Korean-language title. The winner, who like other South Korean presidents can serve only a single five-year term, will take office on 9 May."

            "title": "France to lift most Covid controls as Macron rides high in polls",
            "date": "2022-03-13T16:03:50Z",
            "content": "France will lift most of its Covid restrictions on Monday, scrapping Emmanuel Macron\u2019s flagship vaccine pass and ending compulsory indoor mask-wearing in schools and many public spaces, as the government vows to ease pressure on French people\u2019s daily lives despite a rise in infections. Less than month before April\u2019s presidential vote \u2013 with polls showing the centrist Macron is favourite to win re-election \u2013 the government has brought forward its promise to ease restrictions before the summer. From Monday, schoolchildren aged six and over will not have to wear masks inside classrooms, for the first time since September 2020. Masks will no longer be mandatory in shops, public services or workplaces. But masks will remain compulsory on all public transport, as well as at hospitals and for people visiting elderly loved ones in care homes. The prime minister, Jean Castex, conceded in an interview this weekend that there had been an upturn in cases \u201clike everywhere in Europe\u201d, but he said pressure on hospital emergency wards was going down and the BA2 variant of Omicron was more contagious but \u201cseemingly less dangerous\u201d. Castex said that while the government continued its strategy of easing restrictions, he \u201cstrongly recommended people who are vulnerable because of their age or pathologies to keep wearing masks in indoor spaces\u201d. The end of the vaccine pass means that for the first time since last summer, people no longer need to show a QR code to eat out in a restaurant, go to a cafe, work out at the gym, board a long-distance train, go to the cinema or borrow a library book. Macron first introduced a \u201chealth pass\u201d in July 2021, making it compulsory to have proof of either vaccination, recovery from Covid or a negative test to enter places such as museums, restaurants and bars. Although the policy led to some street protests, it had the support of the majority of the public in polls and helped to push up vaccination levels: more than a million people made a vaccine appointment in the 24 hours after Macron announced the first health pass last summer. In January Macron hardened the health pass by turning it into a \u201cvaccine pass\u201d. This meant a negative test was no longer enough and full proof of vaccination was necessary to enter places including cafes, restaurants, cinemas, libraries and long-distance trains. Just before the vaccine pass was introduced, Macron said he wanted to dump non-vaccinated people \u201cin the shit\u201d by making their daily lives as difficult as possible \u2013 a deliberately radical statement aimed to appeal to his centrist electorate, which was overwhelmingly vaccinated and exasperated at the ongoing coronavirus crisis. But the country now has one of the highest rates of vaccination in Europe, at more than 90% of those eligible, and a vaccine pass is no longer seen as necessary by the government. From Monday France will begin giving a fourth dose of vaccines to people aged 80 and over. The health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said the government remained \u201cextremely vigilant\u201d, and contamination rates had shown a 20% rise over the course of last week. He defended the government\u2019s decision to lift restrictions but said vulnerable people \u201cmust continue to protect themselves\u201d. The easing of Covid restrictions weeks before the presidential election was seen as a deliberate move to lighten the burden on people who polls have shown are \u201cfatigued\u201d by the pandemic and now increasingly worried by the war in Ukraine. An Ifop poll for the Journal du Dimanche last month showed 71% of people were in favour of lifting the vaccine pass before the summer, including a high number of business owners. Despite difficulties such as a lack of masks at the start of the pandemic and a slow start to the vaccine programme, and anger over confusing rules in schools at the start of this year, Macron has been broadly trusted by voters to handle the Covid crisis, polls suggest, particularly in terms of protecting the economy. With the war in Ukraine, Macron\u2019s poll scores have risen \u2013 a poll for Les Echos this month found 40% of people trusted him to \u201cefficiently deal with the main problems facing the country\u201d. But voters do not want war in Ukraine to be the only subject on the table in the run-up to the elections, and many continue to worry about the state of the health system. An Ifop poll for the Hospital Federation of France on Sunday found 91% of voters were concerned there were not enough healthcare staff in France. A majority of voters felt staff should be better paid, state hospitals better organised and care for elderly people improved, as well as adding more doctors in rural areas."

            "date": "2022-03-24T17:00:26Z",
            "content": "The rightwing presidential candidate Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse has promised to rewrite the French constitution in order to fight crime and illegal immigration, as she tried to boost a flagging campaign that risks her party imploding if she fails to reach the final round next month. \u201cI want to show that I\u2019m ready to govern,\u201d P\u00e9cresse told journalists in Paris, vowing to \u201crestore order to the streets and to the public accounts\u201d. Shortly afterwards, P\u00e9cresse\u2019s team announced she had Covid and would be stepping back from public appearances for the next few days. Polls this week showed P\u00e9cresse sinking into a damaging fifth position. The mood is palpably tense in Les R\u00e9publicains, the traditional rightwing party of Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, which could break apart amid ideological in-fighting if P\u00e9cresse does not make it to the second round final on 24 April. An Ipsos poll for France Info and Le Parisien this week placed P\u00e9cresse as low as 9.5% in the 10 April first round, far behind the centrist president Emmanuel Macron, on 29.5%, and the far-right Marine Le Pen, on 18.5%, who are predicted to make the final. P\u00e9cresse has also sunk behind the hard-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, on 12.5%, as he gains ground, and the far-right TV pundit \u00c9ric Zemmour, on 11%. In Paris, P\u00e9cresse was asked about voters preferring the far-right to her programme, no matter how much she hardens her stance on immigration. She said: \u201cMy programme is more precise than theirs, it has all the fundamentals to end illegal immigration.\u201d She said the aim now was to fight against abstentionism and to win over voters by arguing for her party\u2019s experience and budgetary rigour. P\u00e9cresse said her changes to the constitution would introduce minimum prison sentences for some crimes, quotas for immigration, and limit the Muslim headscarf in some public spaces, including banning headscarves from players in sporting events. No headscarves would be worn by mothers accompanying schooltrips, she said. She referred to her own clampdown on full-body swimsuits as head of the \u00cele-de-France region, which includes Paris and the surrounding area, saying: \u201cThere will be no burkinis in the swimming pools of the Republic.\u201d P\u00e9cresse is trying to stop party sympathisers choosing Macron, whose programme covers similar ground to hers on certain issues, including raising the retirement age to 65. \u00c9ric Ciotti, a party hardliner who had run against P\u00e9cresse in Les R\u00e9publicains\u2019 internal primary race, declined to answer a question on the health of his party, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll respond to that on the day of the first round.\u201d But he added that the debate \u201cis still open\u201d in the presidential race. \u201cIt\u2019s not all wrecked for the right,\u201d Xavier Bertrand, another former rival in the primary race, told French radio this week, saying the last 10 days of the campaign would be crucial. Olivier Rouquan, of Paris University\u2019s centre for administrative and political sciences, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that if Les R\u00e9publicains don\u2019t get to the second round of the presidential election, it will be hard to avoid an implosion.\u201d He said that a number of lawmakers for the party might be tempted to jump to Macron\u2019s camp in order to secure re-election in the June parliamentary elections. \u201cThere will be a recomposition of the right and some of Les R\u00e9publicains will take part in that, but not as we know the party \u2013 another political force will emerge \u2026 The party will be weakened if Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse doesn\u2019t get to the second round.\u201d He said P\u00e9cresse\u2019s difficulties began with the fact that she won her party\u2019s primary by a narrow margin so was having to accommodate competing party views. Added to this, the far-right Le Pen was holding the centre of gravity on the right in the polls. P\u00e9cresse was also struggling to \u201cembody\u201d the campaign and place her ideas at the centre of the public debate."

            "content": "With an ever-growing number of Britons choosing to holiday in the UK, campervans and motorhomes have become much more popular, providing, as they do, a balance between freedom and home comforts. But in Scotland, in particular, the sheer number of large vehicles visiting popular rural areas has become a seasonal problem for some communities. Last summer, issues with inappropriate parking and waste management reached crisis point, causing local frustration and negative newspaper stories. Calmac, which runs ferries to the Hebrides, reports that annual motorhome crossings have risen from 16,507 in 2015 to 56,420 in 2021. The story is similar in the Highlands \u2013 Gordon Petrie from Scottish Campervan Rentals in Crieff, tells of an overwhelming increase in inquiries. Many visitors do not understand that Scotland\u2019s wild camping rules don\u2019t apply to motor vehicles, which causes additional problems. So, as campervan numbers climb, many Scottish communities are looking for ways to make their tourist season more sustainable. One successful model is on the Hebridean island of Tiree. Tiree was suffering from uncontrolled campervan arrivals long before this latest surge in popularity, and the community took uncompromising action in 2010. Visiting camping vehicles must now book an overnight pitch in advance, which will be checked by a ranger on arrival. To facilitate this, Tiree\u2019s Croft Camping scheme allows individual crofters to allocate an unserviced piece of land and host a maximum of three vehicles. There are nine sites on the island, with pitches costing \u00a312 a night and water and waste facilities in the island\u2019s main village of Scarinish. There is also a traditional campsite at Balinoe. Tiree ranger Hayley Douglas says: \u201cThe scheme was introduced to ease pressure on Tiree\u2019s fragile environment, and reduce conflict over inappropriate access. Our machair and sand dune habitat is unique, hosting protected rare species. Additionally, some crofting land is unfenced. Previously, visitors were driving on to folk\u2019s crofts and damaging their grazing, as well as our protected areas.\u201d While there was some initial pushback from visitors, the scheme has now been operating for over a decade, and Douglas says it\u2019s been a success. Crofters can make additional income, and campers are generally keen to visit responsibly, and pitch on picturesque sites. \u201cLast year, we had none of the publicised campervan problems here, despite nearly triple the usual campers. Since then, many other communities have contacted me to see how they can set up something similar,\u201d Douglas adds. Crofter Rhoda Meek says the scheme is vital to balance the number of campervans with the capacity of the island\u2019s roads and infrastructure \u2013 and the added benefit for crofters. She says: \u201cIt hopefully helps visitors understand they are not just parked in beauty spots, but that the land is someone\u2019s home and livelihood.\u201d Across the constituency, Brendan O\u2019Hara, Argyll and Bute\u2019s SNP MP, describes campervans as a welcome frustration. \u201cWe rely on tourism economically, and understand why folk want to come here: it\u2019s a beautiful part of the world. We\u2019re set up for tourism and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, the more the merrier.\u201d However, he says, the frustration comes from the failure of some campervan drivers to realise they are visiting local communities, where \u201cfolk have to get on with their daily lives\u201d. Funding is needed to establish infrastructure, and it\u2019s unlikely any one-size-fits-all approach would suit the whole Highlands and Islands region. Mull, a larger, more populous island, has recently taken similar steps to stop campervans arriving without bookings. The island has asked Calmac to display a warning message during online ferry bookings. While a small minority of visitors go against this request \u2013 pitch bookings are not checked on arrival as in Tiree \u2013 the situation has greatly improved. Anthony Robin, manager of community-owned Camping Skye, says the road and parking infrastructures on Skye are not yet good enough to cope with increasing visitor traffic. While the Highland Council and community try to address this, the campsite provides visitor information. \u201cWe point people in the right direction, making it easier for visitors to enjoy themselves, while protecting small communities from waves of tourists on wheels,\u201d says Robin. The campsite\u2019s profits are used for community projects, including new public toilets in Broadford and Elgol. Highlander John MacPherson says opinions on campervans are polarised. His family have been working in tourism since the 19th century, when his grandfather owned a stables in Fort William. They ran carriages for visitors, including Queen Victoria, and offered pony trips up Ben Nevis. Managing Highland tourism is nothing new to them. \u201cI\u2019ve worked around the Highlands and Islands for 40 years, sleeping in my van, and have seen dramatic changes recently: previously accessible pull-outs blocked off, and a huge surge in the number and size of vans,\u201d MacPherson says. He describes the popular NC500 route as \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d: it put the Highlands on the map, but too suddenly and without broad local buy-in and infrastructure development. He suggests that long-term government funding is needed to ease these pressures. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be left to locals to fill infrastructure gaps.\u201d"

            "title": "Cardiff Philharmonic removes Tchaikovsky performance over Ukraine conflict",
            "date": "2022-03-09T18:39:02Z",
            "content": "The Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra is facing ridicule after removing the Russian composer Tchaikovsky from its forthcoming programme due to the conflict in Ukraine. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\u2019s 1812 Overture, which celebrates Russia\u2019s defence against the invasion of Napoleon and is notable for featuring a volley of cannon fire, was due to be included in the orchestra\u2019s Tchaikovsky concert at St David\u2019s Hall on 18 March, but the entire programme has been abandoned due to events in Ukraine. A statement on the venue\u2019s website said: \u201cIn light of the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra, with the agreement of St David\u2019s Hall, feel the previously advertised programme including the 1812 Overture to be inappropriate at this time. The orchestra hope you will continue to support them and enjoy the revised programme.\u201d The orchestra will instead present a programme centred on Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s symphony No 8. It will also include John Williams\u2019 the Cowboys overture and a performance of Edward Elgar\u2019s Enigma variations in the second half. The Cardiff Philharmonic\u2019s moves comes after the Russian conductor Valery Gergiev was dropped by his management after he refused to condemn the regime of Vladimir Putin. The treatment of Gergiev prompted some disquiet among rightwing commentators but the decision to cancel Tchaikovsky has been more widely derided in both the UK and the US. The comedian Geoff Norcott tweeted: \u201cCancelling a Tchaikovsky concert is so daft ordinary Russians will write it off as mad Vlad overdoing the propaganda.\u201d Cellist Max Weiss, editor of Baltimore magazine, said \u201ceveryone needs to get a grip\u201d. Writing on Twitter she said: \u201cWe had our HSO concert on Saturday. We began the program, fittingly, with the Ukraine National Anthem. We then went on to play Tchaikovsky\u2019s Piano Concerto No 1.\u201d Matt Duss, the foreign policy adviser to former US presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, said that the orchestra\u2019s move was \u201cdoubly absurd because Tchaikovsky spent a lot of time in Ukraine, and incorporated a lot of Ukrainian folk music and stories into his work\u201d. Former MP turned chatshow host George Galloway described the move as the equivalent to \u201cfascistic book-burning\u201d. Many have pointed out Tchaikovsky shunned nationalism. Billy Binion, editor of the US magazine Reason, tweeted: \u201cThe irony. Tchaikovsky was one of the first (and only) composers to eschew Russian nationalism and try to integrate his music with the west. \u201cAlso, he died over a century ago. We\u2019ve lost our minds. Tchaikovsky composed some of the richest, most affecting music I\u2019ve ever heard. We need more of that in times like these, not less.\u201d Martin May, the director of the orchestra, explained the context behind the decision. In a statement he said: \u201cA member of the orchestra has family directly involved in the Ukraine situation and we are trying to respect that situation during the immediate term. There were also two military themed pieces as part of the programme that we felt were particularly inappropriate at this time.\u201d He added: \u201cWe were also made aware at the time that the title \u2018Little Russian\u2019 of Symphony No 2 was deemed offensive to Ukrainians. Whilst there are no plans to repeat the Tchaikovsky concert at the moment, we have no plans to change our summer and autumn programmes which contain pieces by Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev and Rimsky-Korsakof. So this is a one-off decision made with the best of intentions and there is no intention to exclude Tchaikovsky in particular. He is one of my favourite composers. We are aware that, whatever decision we made, it would not go down well, so we are stuck between a rock and a hard place.\u201d"

            "content": "Andy Beckett (Pacifists are being elbowed out of British politics just when we need them most, 3 March) appears to think that we have the choice either to be pacifists or to have to \u201caccept that the world is divided into two camps\u201d \u2013 the liberal west and a totalitarian Russia. This is nonsense. It is possible to recognise that Ukraine requires the imposition of sanctions on Russia by the west and a ready supply of western arms and money to defend itself, without believing that the west has suddenly transmogrified into a sainted power bloc, cleansed of all past sins. To choose pacifism in the current circumstances is to opt for a groundless idealism over realpolitik. Ukrainian self-determination needs guns and money. To stand against the demand to arm Ukraine is to stand for Ukraine\u2019s defeat. If Stop the War believes that there is nothing progressive about Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, then it should want his invasion driven back and his regime\u2019s financial lifeline choked off. Laughably, some on the left have even dragged out the old \u201cthe main enemy is at home\u201d slogan \u2013 as if the UK was actually at war with Russia rather than simply seeking to support Ukraine. Believing that it\u2019s necessary to oppose Putin\u2019s attempt to drown Ukraine\u2019s right to exist doesn\u2019t mean turning a blind eye to Boris Johnson\u2019s venality or to the proto-fascist leanings of Poland and Hungary, or to alibi the US\u2019s own history of bloody anti-democratic interventions. Right now, though, calling for no sanctions against Russia and no arms to Ukraine means calling for Putin\u2019s victory and its devastating consequences. Orwell was right in 1942 and he would say the same now. Faced with the current circumstances: \u201cPacifism is objectively pro-fascist.\u201d Nick Moss London \u2022 Andy Beckett\u2019s argument is full of contradictions. He claims that Stop the War upholds the right of the Ukrainian people to \u201cself-determination\u201d as well as Russia\u2019s security concerns. What planet is he on? Russia has invaded a peaceful sovereign democracy and is bombing indiscriminately, killing civilians as well as attacking a nuclear power station. Keir Starmer was right to threaten to expel the Labour MPs who signed a Stop the War statement. Let\u2019s hope that none of them ever become foreign secretary. We all want a just peace. June Purvis Portsmouth \u2022 It was a relief to read Andy Beckett\u2019s warning about attempts to silence voices for peace. Guns and bombs have always been the foundation of UK foreign policy, and since the country\u2019s acquisition of atom bombs, the two main parties have held the line together. It is pitiful therefore that Labour MPs who expressed their views by signing a letter should be threatened with expulsion (Report, 2 March). I long to live in a country that focuses its foreign policy on cooperation to end war and poverty, and to save our species from extinction, whether by nuclear war or climate change. Diana Francis Bath \u2022 Andy Beckett\u2019s article has some resonance for me on how we challenge oppression. War is the ultimate oppressive force and those who lead us into it are the ultimate oppressors. Pacifists are activists. We do not stand back in our opposition to oppression, we stand firmly against it. Oppression grows when violence, militarism and war are the mechanisms that we use against it. Stop the War is challenging the oppression of war actively and incisively: it is not sitting on the fence, it is not giving succour to \u201cour enemies\u201d, it is making a stand for human freedom and crying out that another way is possible. Richard Ashwell Wolverhampton \u2022 While peace is nearly always preferable to war, sometimes there is a case for a just war, as argued by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas. The best example of this was the second world war to defeat fascism. Arguably, the same applies to efforts to defeat Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. I have supported Stop the War previously, when I marched against the Iraq war. But it is misguided on Nato expansion and arming Ukraine. Nato responded to requests from former Soviet satellites to join because of their fears of Russia. Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine shows the wisdom of these requests. By arming Ukraine, Nato can at least give it a fighting chance of defending itself without being drawn into a direct conflict with Russia that would spark a war engulfing the whole of Europe. Dr Michael Herron London \u2022 Lindsey German\u2019s article (We at Stop the War condemn the invasion of Ukraine, and warmongers on all sides, 4 March) is full of the misinterpretation of history. She refers to the breakup of the Warsaw pact and says Nato should have also been dissolved. But the pact was never a partnership of equals. It was a Russian empire. Diplomacy down the barrel of a gun. Nato wasn\u2019t formed to defend against the Soviet Union. It was formed to defend against Russia and its vassals. As soon as the countries that had been invaded by Russia saw a chance for freedom they ran to Nato and the EU in the rightful belief that one day Russia would try to re-subjugate them. Stop the War restates Russian claims that Nato is a threat, but it poses no threat to Russia, only to Russian imperialist ambitions. Nobody is a \u201cwar enthusiast\u201d. But faced with a bloodthirsty invader, Ukraine has no option other than to defend itself and we have a moral responsibility to assist it. Should we sit back and allow this atrocity? Putin\u2019s stated objectives allow no room for diplomacy. No country can accept an ultimatum to become the vassal of another. Self-defence is no offence.

Polina, primary school pupil One of the first civilian victims named in the conflict was Polina, who was in her final year of primary school in Kyiv. A photo shows her smiling, her hair highlighted with pink streaks. Kyiv\u2019s deputy mayor, Volodymyr Bondarenko, said in a Facebook post that her family car was shot at by \u201cRussian saboteurs\u201d in the city. Her brother was taken for treatment at Okhmatdyt children\u2019s hospital and her sister was last known to be in intensive care at another hospital. Unnamed six-year-old girl On 27 February a six-year-old girl was caught in shelling in the port city of Mariupol. In scenes captured by an Associated Press journalist, the girl\u2019s wounded father, his head bloodied and bandaged, could be seen lifting his child, wearing pyjamas decorated with cartoon unicorns, into the back of an ambulance. As a medical team fought to save her, her mother wept outside. \u201cShow this to Putin,\u201d a medic said angrily into the journalist\u2019s camera. \u201cThe eyes of this child, and crying doctors.\u201d Unnamed six-year-old boy A boy was killed when a five-storey apartment building was shelled in Chuhuiv, a city outside Kharkiv. His 13-year-old brother is being treated at a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv, Pravda News and the BBC reported. The head of the Cherkasy regional state administration, Oleksandr Skichko, wrote about the blast on the morning of 24 February, saying on Facebook: \u201cA shell hit the central part of the city. One civilian dead, five more in hospital.\u201d Yelena Ivanova and Yelena Kudrin, secondary school teachers At the Kalininsky district cemetery, mourners were pictured grieving at the funeral of two teachers killed in a shelling attack on Gorlovka, in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, on 25 February. Yelena Kudrin, a geography teacher, and Yelena Ivanova, a deputy head, both worked at Secondary School No 50. Naveen Shekarappa Gyanagoudar, 21, medical student On the morning of 1 March, Naveen Shekarappa Gyanagoudar was killed in Kharkiv while on his way to buy groceries. He had told family that he had been sheltering in a bunker for the last few days, the Indian Express reported. The student had been advised by his family to place an Indian flag outside the building he was in, NDTV said. Gyanagoudar, 21, who moved from India to Ukraine, was a fourth-year medical student at Kharkiv National Medical University. India\u2019s external affairs ministry tweeted: \u201cWith profound sorrow we confirm that an Indian student lost his life in shelling in Kharkiv this morning. The ministry is in touch with his family. We convey our deepest condolences to the family.\u201d Mohamed Abdel-Moneim, 25, engineering graduate A recent graduate of aeronautical engineering, Mohamed Abdel-Moneim was killed in Kharkiv. Reports from the New Arab said the Algerian 25-year-old was seeking refuge in a shelter with other students when he was hit by a bullet. In a video for Al Araby TV, Abdel-Moneim\u2019s father said: \u201cMy letter to this crazy world: we want to live in peace all around the world. Enough wars. Enough killing for the sake of killing.\u201d The president of Algeria, Abdelmadjid Tabboune, sent his \u201csincere condolences and his deep feelings of compassion and sympathy\u201d to the family."

            "content": "A court in Argentina has sentenced a Roman Catholic bishop to four and a half years in prison for sexual abuse of two former seminarians in a major blow to Pope Francis, who had initially defended the bishop. Gustavo Zanchetta, 57, was convicted on Friday of \u201csimple, continued and aggravated sexual abuse\u201d, with his offense aggravated by his role as a religious minster. A court in the north-western town of Or\u00e1n, where Zanchetta, 57, was bishop from 2013 to 2017, ordered his immediate detention. The conviction in the pope\u2019s homeland hits at Francis\u2019s personal credibility since he had initially rejected accusations against Zanchetta, and created a job for him at the Vatican that got him out of Argentina. Francis has defended his handling of the case, insisting that Zanchetta \u201cdefended himself well\u201d when confronted with the first allegations that he had pornographic images on his cellphone. Francis also defended the decision to give him a job in one of the most sensitive Vatican offices, the treasury that manages the Holy See\u2019s investments and assets, saying Zanchetta had been prescribed psychological retreats each month in Spain and it didn\u2019t make sense for him to return to Argentina between each session. Following the verdict, the bishop, wearing a face mask, was removed from the court in a car, though it was not clear where he was taken. Local authorities began to investigate after the allegations emerged publicly in early 2019, when the newspaper El Tribuno de Salta reported complaints about Zanchetta\u2019s conduct as bishop in Or\u00e1n, about 1,600km (900 miles) north-west of Buenos Aires. Five priests made a formal accusation before church authorities against the bishop in 2016, accusing him of authoritarianism, financial mismanagement and sexual abuse at the Saint John XXIII Seminary. The court heard evidence from two complainants, one of whom claimed the bishop had made approaches towards him and asked for \u201cmassages\u201d. Prosecutor Mar\u00eda Soledad Filtr\u00edn Cuezzo told the court on Thursday that investigators had established the truthfulness of witnesses against the bishop, citing their internal logic, context and precise details. Zanchetta had flown back to his home country from Rome to face the charges. He has denied the charges and said he is victim of revenge by priests in Or\u00e1n with whom he had differences. The pope had ordered a church trial into the case, though the results of that are not known. Carlos Lombardi of the Network of Survivors of Ecclesiastical Abuse in Argentina \u2013 and a representative of victims in the case \u2013 said the sentence was \u201ca strong blow\u201d to the pope \u201cbecause of the public defense he has made in this case \u2026 they now have no arguments to protect these criminals in cassocks,\u201d he added."

            "content": "As expected, cost of living ruled the day. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, was spruiking the fuel excise cut, those tax offsets, and the relative strength of the economy. That excise cut will give some short-term relief at the bowser, but as with most of the other measures, it\u2019s \u201ctargeted\u201d but \u201ctemporary\u201d. It was truly a pre-election budget, with money funnelled to critical seats and cashback offers for taxpayers. National security was high on the list, and we all just hope one day we\u2019ll find out who came up with operation Redspice. And keeping the Nationals on side was obviously front-of-mind, what with that extensive regional Australia package. Debts and deficits as far as the eye can see barely make people blink these days. If too much budget is barely enough, the whole team will be back tomorrow to keep pulling the various threads of this pre-election fiscal plan. If you want to look at the yarns we\u2019ve unspooled so far, click here. More from the conga line of stakeholders and experts after the budget \u2013 the line seems to be almost running out now, with most voices having had their say. Ian Henschke, from National Seniors, was upset the government didn\u2019t do more to let pensioners get back into the workforce without their pension being affected. He called it a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d and said: I don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t listen to us. Helen Dalley-Fisher, of the Equality Alliance, claimed the budget had \u201cforgotten\u201d Australian women. She was critical that the women\u2019s budget statement had less money than it did last year, and was critical the Coalition didn\u2019t start paying superannuation on paid parental leave. Annie Butler, the secretary of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Foundation, claimed aged care workers had been \u201clet down\u201d with no word on wage increases in the sector. She noted some \u201cannouncements around the edges\u201d on training more people to go into the sector, including a $50m pledge to train 15,000 workers, but questioned how successful that program would be. She asked: What is the point of training more people to go into a sector in complete crisis until the core issues are fixed? Fix the staffing crisis. James Brown, the chief executive of the Space Industry Association of Australia, has welcomed the announcement of more than $1bn towards developing satellites. He said: This is a significant investment to develop Australia\u2019s first national civilian space mission in 40 years. It will mean we can begin to guarantee access to essential space services for weather, disaster monitoring, and science. In the next decade we will be able to design, build, test and launch satellites from Australia which is critical to protecting our space infrastructure and leveraging opportunities in the booming global space economy. Quite the gear change at the procession of stakeholders addressing reporters at Parliament House in Canberra, with the oil and gas industry giving its response before making way for the Australian Conservation Foundation. The chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association, Andrew McConville, said the sector could \u201creinvigorate Australia\u2019s economy\u201d and ensure the reliability of the energy supply. He voiced support for initiatives to support low-emissions technologies and said innovation and cost-competitiveness was important in the global \u201cwar for capital\u201d. Freya Cole, of the Australian Conservation Foundation, then stepped up to the microphones to declare that Australians were \u201cliving through a climate and extinction crisis\u201d. She criticised the projected reduction in climate spending and criticised fossil fuel subsidies. Josh Butler took a look at that big spending in regional seats, for industrial hubs in key electorates: The director of aged care at the United Workers Union, Carolyn Smith, said that despite providing some money for training there was \u201cnothing extra for staff, wages or home care packages\u201d in the budget. Teresa, a home care worker from Newcastle, noted the 22 cent cut to the fuel excise \u2013 but said her fuel allowance is just 72 cents a litre, while petrol currently costs $2 a litre. Home care workers don\u2019t take residents on shopping and other trips as a result of the cost squeeze. We\u2019ve had the spice ... now here\u2019s the sugar and all things nice, from Paul Karp: Redspice. You know you want it, and Daniel Hurst has it here for you: Uniting Care said there were \u201ca few welcome\u201d measures in the budget, backing the women\u2019s safety package and the one-off payments for pensioners. But the charity said it was disappointed there was no sign of adding superannuation to paid parental leave or wages increases for aged care workers \u2013 two reforms Uniting Care said they would be pushing both major parties to commit to before the election. Georgie Beatty, from the National Union of Students, said the $250 payments going to concession card holders \u201cwon\u2019t even make next week\u2019s rent\u201d. She said students who travel great distances to get to class would be happy at the cut to the petrol excise, but \u201cit\u2019ll need much more than that \u2026 not band aid solutions\u201d. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, slammed the government for a \u201clack of vision\u201d on healthcare. He was heavily critical that the Coalition had still not taken any action on resolving the ongoing hospital funding crisis \u201cblame game\u201d between the federal and state governments, an issue several state premiers have been livid about for years. Khorshid claimed GPs would be \u201clet down\u201d by the budget, but he was also calling on Labor to outline its health policies soon. He said he was waiting for the opposition to come to the table on health funding too, and that he was \u201cvery interested to talk to Labor and hear their vision\u201d. Oh, did I mention yet that the budget banks on another Omicron wave this winter? Anne Davies takes a look at health spending: Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says he definitely knows how important climate change is, that\u2019s why he mentioned it in his speech. Meanwhile, as Adam Morton reports: The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, says Australia needed a budget that tackled the climate crisis, the inequality crisis and the housing crisis \u2013 but tonight\u2019s document did none of those things. Addressing reporters at Parliament House, Bandt said jobseekers were being left in poverty. He said pensions needed to increase by $250 a week, \u201cnot $250 an election\u201d: This budget will not keep you safe from the climate crisis, will not put an affordable roof over your head. Bandt said the government had never correctly predicted wage growth and there was \u201cno reason to believe they\u2019ve got it right now\u201d. Ian Yates, the chief executive of the Council on the Ageing Australia, welcomed the cost-of-living relief for millions of older Australians. He said this year\u2019s budget commitments on aged care did not rate alongside last year\u2019s budget package. Yates said he was disappointed by the absence or oral and dental health programs aimed at older Australians. He hoped pledged would be forthcoming by the parties in the upcoming federal election campaign. Innes Willox, of the Australian Industry Group, said the government\u2019s budget had to \u201cwalk a high wire\u201d balancing act between dealing with short-term uncertainty and making long-term change. He welcomed a focus on skills and apprenticeships, but was critical that the number of skilled migrant places wasn\u2019t increased further \u2013 saying this was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d to business, claiming labour shortages was \u201cthe number one issue\u201d some firms have. Medicines Australia called it a \u201csteady as she goes budget\u201d, and praised \u201csome great new listings of new innovative medicines\u201d. The body also noted there needed to be continued investment in health. Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the budget was a \u201cmixed bag\u201d. ACCI backed the new national skills agreement, praising it as a \u201csignificant step forward\u201d, but said it could have been \u201cbetter designed\u201d. McKellar echoed Willox in calling for higher skilled migration figures, saying future governments must set more ambitious benchmarks. He also backed the \u201cvery positive\u201d tax deductions for training employees in digital skills. Michele O\u2019Neil, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, savaged the government for not doing more on wages growth. Nothing in this budget delivers real wages increases for working people. One off payments are not the same as wage increases,\u201d she said: That\u2019s workers\u2019 wages going backwards under the Morison government\u2026 all we have is one off payments that will be quickly eaten up. O\u2019Neil also rubbished Frydenberg\u2019s claims earlier today that the looming 3.75% unemployment rate would lead to wages growth. She said that was \u201ca theory that\u2019s been disproven\u201d: What we see now is a break between what used to be a connection between the unemployment rate and people\u2019s wages. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve got so many more people now in insecure work. The PwC chief economist, Jeremy Thorpe, told reporters in Canberra the government had provided \u201cadditional, targeted and limited support\u201d because it needed to be seen to be addressing cost of living pressures \u2013 which he said was \u201cunderstandable, and relatively restrained\u201d. Asked whether this would add to inflationary pressures, he said one benefit of the halving of petrol excise is it will have a deflationary impact that should flow through to the rest of the economy. John Falzon, from progressive thinktank Per Capita, said the budget was like the \u201clast lolly bag\u201d at a party, that \u201cpromises everything but contains next to nothing\u201d. Falzon criticised the government for \u201cone-off fixes that are no fix at all\u201d, warning that a worker earning $68,000 faces real pay cuts of $600 (due to inflation outstripping wage growth). Cassandra Goldie, from the Australian Council of Social Services, told reporters the budget is one people \u201ccan\u2019t rely on\u201d because they \u201cneeded permanent solutions but got temporary fixes\u201d. Goldie said a jobseeker living on $46 per day might benefit from a one-off $250 payment for one or two weeks, but they face rising costs like rent every week. Although parents can now divide the 20 weeks of paid parental leave between them as they like, there was \u201cno extension\u201d in the length of parental leave, and no increase in the payment level beyond the minimum wage, she said. Frydenberg is now ducking a question on his role (his budget\u2019s role) in whether or not the Coalition will be re-elected: Obviously I\u2019m focussing on winning the next election and i\u2019m very proud of the fact the Australian economy now leads the world. I\u2019m just interrupting briefly with this little look at the lockup press conference \u2013 particularly because a lot of these lines are starting to be repeated. The treasurer has a captive audience in the budget lockup and holds a press conference in the afternoon for the internet-deprived journalists. Josh Frydenberg and the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, take the podium and give short statements along similar lines to the treasurer\u2019s budget speech. \u201cThis budget demonstrates Australia\u2019s world-leading economic recovery,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cAustralia\u2019s economic reboot has been nothing short of remarkable \u2026 this budget has turned the corner.\u201d He said because of the recovery the bottom line has improved by more than $100bn, four years earlier than previously forecast. The cost of living measures are \u201ctemporary and targeted\u201d. Tell me if this is getting repetitive. Birmingham said the hard work and resilience of Australians have delivered these economic outcomes but that \u201cwe remain in very uncertain times\u201d. The first question is whether this is just a \u201cspend-a-thon\u201d budget. Frydenberg said he reckons families will quite like paying less at the bowser, because petrol is a \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d cost, and talks up those tax offsets. The next question is also about the cost of living measures, and any potential effect on inflation. Treasury has factored in everything, Frydenberg said (in short). On the cuts to the petrol excise (22 cents off a litre), Frydenberg said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had made it \u201cvery clear\u201d that they would ensure the lower costs are passed on to customers. \u201cIt will take a couple of weeks for these reductions to pass through,\u201d he said, adding it could take a bit longer in the regions. Sarah Martin asked about the funding for the regions and whether that was delivered as part of a deal with the Nationals over an agreement on net zero emissions. We all love the regions, Frydenberg said (I\u2019m paraphrasing): We are agreed Liberals and Nationals that our regions are hubs for economic growth\u2026. [we] agree this is a priority for jobs. It\u2019s a new frontier, it\u2019s where we derive our productivity and our growth. Frydenberg said people have moved to the regions because of the pandemic, and that about two thirds of Australian exports are generated from the regions. Regional Australia is a \u201cwealth generator for all Australians\u201d, he said. Isn\u2019t Covid still a risk and why is it so hard to mention climate change? This is an interesting question. The budget assumes that Covid will keep on keeping on, that there will be another Omicron wave over winter, and that there will be ongoing local waves. Frydenberg talked about all the billions they\u2019ve poured into health during Covid, setting up a surge workforce and spending more money on health and hospitals. And it isn\u2019t hard to talk about climate change, he said, he definitely talks about climate change and zero net emissions in his speech. It\u2019s an oddly lacklustre press conference, considering the import of this budget \u2013 maybe it\u2019s just because they used to be jam-packed affairs, and now they\u2019re Covid calm. Anyway, many of the important questions come after people are out of lock up and have a chance to hear reactions and properly study individual budget lines. Infrastructure announcements have been made in critical election flash points, Sales points out, or as she calls them \u201cpolitically desirable\u201d spots. The regions are the new frontiers, says Frydenberg, pushing through the saloon doors: One of the more exciting aspects of this budget is our investment into new economic frontiers. Just a coincidence, then? Pretty much, Frydenberg says: Those seats are largely held in National hands. On the plan to remove the fuel exise cut after six months, Sales asks Frydenberg if that\u2019s a \u201cdirty bomb\u201d for Labor (because the prices will shoot back up once the cut is reversed). Unsurprisingly, he does not confirm that it is, in fact, a potential dirty bomb for a potential future Labor government. The treasurer is now doing the traditional post-budget interview with the ABC. Leigh Sales is asking him about potential inflation lifts from his spending plans. And she says every budget she\u2019s ever covered has been somewhat optimistic about wage rises. He says: I wouldn\u2019t want to correct you but I have to. In last year\u2019s budget I forecast wages that were lower [than forecast]. And he points to the low unemployment rate. People will be competing for workers, he says: As more people get into work they\u2019ll see upward pressure on wages. Employers will pay what they need to get the right workers. By the way, right next to the baby blue Barnaby book (also known as the regional ministerial budget statement) is a slender tome called the women\u2019s budget statement. When journos file in to lockup they are anticipating certain information. Someone\u2019s on infrastructure, someone else on debt and deficit. Someone\u2019s searching for the elusive \u201cblack hole\u201d, while others focus on the finer details of budget paper No 2, or parse the treasurer\u2019s budget speech for their readers. And they thought we wouldn\u2019t notice when they didn\u2019t put out a women\u2019s statement a couple of years ago. Anyway, it\u2019s back, even if it does sometimes seem like someone cobbled it together from anything that could possibly affect women. The minister for women, Marise Payne, says there\u2019s a $2.1bn package focused on \u201cthree key priorities \u2013 women\u2019s safety, economic security and leadership, and health and wellbeing\u201d. She says: We know that these priorities are mutually reinforcing. When we achieve better outcomes in one area, we see positive benefits across all areas. We\u2019re about to start bringing you all the reactions to the budget, but before we do, here is the wind up from Frydenberg\u2019s speech. The election will be called quick smart, and you can bet these lines will form the spine of the talking points. Please feel free to turn it into a rap or a TikTok: Despite the challenges, our economic recovery is leading the world. This is not a time to change course. This is a time to stick to our plan. A plan that delivers cost of living relief now. A plan that creates jobs for the long\u2011term. A plan that guarantees the essential services. A plan that invests more in the defence of our nation ... this is a time to stick to our plan. A plan for a strong economy and a stronger future. We will deliver. There was an accusation that there was not a lot on climate change in the budget. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he mentions it in his speech, and he did: Australia is on the pathway to net zero emissions by 2050 and playing its part in responding to the critical global challenge of climate change. Technology, not taxes, will get us there. Already, Australia has the highest uptake of rooftop solar in the world. We are investing in clean hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, batteries and large\u2011scale solar. Tonight, we make further investments in microgrids to support regional and remote communities that don\u2019t otherwise have access to the grid with small\u2011scale renewable energy projects like solar and wind. A low\u2011emissions future with reliable and affordable power is critical to our plan for a strong economy. And some more details from treasurer Josh Frydenberg on that critical regional Australia package: Frydenberg said: Announcing an unprecedented regional investment package that includes transformational investments in agriculture, infrastructure and energy in the Hunter, the Pilbara, the Northern Territory and north and central Queensland. These long\u2011term investments will unlock new economic frontiers and grow our national economy. [Our] regional package also includes major new investments in water projects, a new regional accelerator, telecommunications and health. A new $7.4bn investment in more dams and water projects to improve vital water security and expand irrigation. A new $2bn regional accelerator program to invest in skills, education infrastructure, export market development and supply chain resilience for our regions. A new $1.3bn telecommunications package to expand mobile coverage across 8,000km of regional transport routes. It\u2019s treasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s fourth budget, and arguably his most important. He\u2019s just finished, and we\u2019ll see how Australia reacts. Meanwhile, some highlights: On the economy: By the end of the forward estimates, the Budget is $100bn better off compared to last year. More people in work, fewer on welfare. Repairing the Budget without increasing taxes. The deficit for 2022\u201123 is expected to be $78bn or 3.4% of GDP. Over the next three years, this will more than halve to 1.6%. Net debt as a share of the economy will peak at 33.1% at 30 June 2026. On the floods: Our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones, homes and businesses in the catastrophic floods across New South Wales and south\u2011east Queensland. Nothing I say can overcome the personal pain and loss of so many Australians. On that fuel excise cut: For the next 6 months, Australians will save 22 cents a litre every time they fill up their car. A family with 2 cars who fill up once a week could save around $30 a week or around $700 over the next 6 months. Whether you\u2019re dropping the kids at school, driving to and from work or visiting family and friends, it will cost less. This cut in fuel excise, which takes effect from midnight tonight, will flow through to the bowser over the next 2 weeks. The competition watchdog will monitor retailers to make sure these savings are passed on in full. Katharine Murphy again from the chamber as treasurer Josh Frydenberg continues his speech \u2013 she says Labor MPs are chatting among themselves, and: If this is lift off for the election, it\u2019s a slow jog so no one pulls a hamstring. And once you\u2019ve digested Katharine Murphy\u2019s piece, here\u2019s a brilliant interactive from Nick Evershed: Before we go any further at all (bearing in mind the treasurer is still speaking, but I linked to the full text below) ... Katharine Murphy\u2019s analysis of the 2022-23 budget is in: In lockup, we got a late delivery of the defence media statement, hand-delivered. Why the delay? It might have something to do with veterans\u2019 affairs and defence personnel minister, Andrew Gee, declaring he would quit cabinet if the backlog of veterans\u2019 claims wasn\u2019t cleared. There he is, in the release, listing a bunch of things to be done for veterans, including: An initial $22.8m will fund 90 extra Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs staff to cut the backlog of unprocessed claims, and this will be followed by a further $73.2m for additional staff and other measures to further improve the veteran claims processing system and reduce waiting times. Just a small note on that: the budget itself only includes the initial $22.8m over two years from 2022-23. The follow-up money is more of a public pledge by the government rather than a budgeted line item. Some early reactions from the other side: Treasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s whole speech is here, for those who are hanging on every word. Katharine Murphy reports a big \u201chere, here\u201d from the Nationals Barnaby Joyce and David Littleproud as he talks about the regional package. (They won\u2019t say this bit out loud but obviously to keep the Coalition coalesced, the Liberals have to keep the Nationals on side). Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, is in the chamber watching treasurer Josh Frydenberg speak. She says you\u2019d \u201cdescribe the atmosphere in the chamber as attentive but low energy, at least so far\u201d. If you need to wrap your head around the budget quickly, but also get the context, here\u2019s Guardian Australia\u2019s chief political correspondent, Sarah Martin\u2019s take: I can\u2019t stop thinking about Redspice. REDSPICE? Did the words or the acronym come first? Did they workshop the \u201cspice\u201d bit, or the \u201cred\u201d bit? Is it just because of the blandness of lockup food that I can\u2019t stop thinking about cayenne, or paprika, or a shiny haba\u00f1ero? Even before Russia invaded Ukraine (and China watched), the government was itching to make national security a key plank of its election campaign (remember the Manchurian candidate?). So it\u2019s no surprise that this budget has muscled-up. There\u2019s even a new project codenamed Redspice (definitely nothing to do with China). It\u2019s a slightly tortured acronym for resilience, effects, defence, space, intelligence, cyber and enablers. Redspice is part of a $9.9bn investment in defence and cybersecurity over 10 years. There\u2019s the ongoing funding for operations in the Middle East, $10bn over the long term towards a new submarine base, there are drones, choppers, tanks and more. And of course, warships and those planned Aukus submarines (and no, we still don\u2019t know how much they\u2019ll cost). There\u2019s a grab bag of bits and bobs that loosely come under \u201cessential services\u201d. We\u2019ve already seen the infrastructure spending bonanza. Guardian Australia revealed on Tuesday that just 15% of the promised projects were endorsed by Infrastructure Australia, and more than 50% of the projects in individual electorates were going to marginal seats. This not-quite-post-pandemic budget promises to shore up supply chains and boost manufacturing in Australia, including a promise to make mRNA vaccines in Victoria, and to make it cheaper for Australians to get patents on goods they invent. Billions have been announced for regional investments (read: keeping the Nationals and their leader onside) including dams, telecommunications, better health services and a skills package. Anyone hoping for game-changing spending on climate change, the NDIS or aged care will be disappointed. The government is promising new jobs, even with the predicted unemployment level of 3.75%. There\u2019s $2.8bn for the \u201ctake-up and completion\u201d of trade apprenticeships, $5,000 for new apprentices and $15,000 for employers who take them on. And there\u2019s a $120 tax deduction for every $100 a small business spends on training employees (up to $100,000). Frydenberg says: Australia\u2019s unemployment rate is heading towards a 50-year low. We have a historic opportunity to get young Australians into skilled, secure and well-paid jobs. The dignity of work is important for all Australians. The urgency to address cost of living pressures grew in the weeks leading up to the budget as pandemic-related issues (including house prices) crossed paths with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which saw petrol prices spike. The budget expands paid parental leave and makes it more flexible, promises cheaper medicines, and a range of other measures, including: The fuel excise will be halved \u2013 from 44 cents a litre to 22 \u2013 for six months. The government estimates a family with two cars that fills up once a week will save $700 over that time. (Chris Richardson from Deloitte Access Economics called this \u201cdumb\u201d, and others raised concerns rising inflation will gobble up any savings). Australia\u2019s 10 million low and middle income earners will get a one-off tax offset of $420 \u2013 this comes on top of the existing offset. That means up to $1,500 for singles and $3,000 for couples. A $250 one-off payment to pensioners, carers, veterans, job seekers, eligible self-funded retirees and concession card holders. An expansion of the first homebuyer grant. Frydenberg said it was \u201ca new temporary, targeted and responsible cost of living package to ease these [cost of living] pressures\u201d. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has begun his budget speech in the House of Representatives, introducing the plan the Coalition hopes will help them pick a path to another miracle victory. He says: Tonight, as we gather, war rages in Europe. The global pandemic is not over. Devastating floods have battered our communities. We live in uncertain times. But all is not lost, Frydenberg says: [Australia] remains resilient. Australians remain strong. We have overcome the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression. Our recovery leads the world. The 2022-23 budget papers \u2013 including a chunky sky blue regional Australia statement from Barnaby Joyce \u2013 have now been released. Despite the piles of paper and files of releases, much of this critically important pre-election budget had already been dropped to the press. What we have now, though, is the detail. Here\u2019s a sneak peak: The fuel excise will be halved \u2013 from 44 cents a litre to 22 \u2013 for six months. Australia\u2019s 10 million low and middle income earners will get a one-off tax offset of $420 \u2013 on top of the existing offset. There is also a one-off $250 payment to pensioners, carers, veterans, job seekers, eligible self-funded retirees and concession card holders. What used to be the headline figure \u2013 the nation\u2019s deficit \u2013 is set to hit an eye-watering $78bn. Frydenberg\u2019s message will be that it could have been worse, and that it will get better \u2013 he says it will halve as a percentage of GDP over the next three years. There is also that prediction that unemployment will dip to 3.75% next year, boosting income tax revenue and slashing the cost of welfare. Frydenberg has made it clear where this budget\u2019s focus lies: cost of living relief, jobs, jobs, jobs (and jobs), investments in essential services, and defence and national security. The Guardian Australia team has been feverishly fossicking through the budget papers, jittery with caffeine and shaky from the sugar hits. Photographer-at-large Mike Bowers is with the team in Canberra \u2013 Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst, Josh Butler, Paul Karp, Adam Morton and Greg Jericho. Joining them (virtually) in Sydney are Lenore Taylor, Anne Davies, Elias Visontay, Peter Hannam and Nick Evershed. Just five minutes to go until the budget is released. There have been a couple of last-minute revelations about the contents of the budget, which we\u2019ve covered already. They include: The budget will give a one-off increase to the low and middle income tax offset \u2013 the temporary tax offset for those earning $126,000 or less. That offset currently pays from $255 to $1,080, depending on your income. The changes would now give between $675 and $1,500, paid out from 1 July. About 10 million people will get $420 on average. An almost $9bn package to improve Australia\u2019s cybersecurity and intelligence capabilities, designed to deal with changing security threats in the Asia-Pacific, according to the ABC. A one-off payment of $250 for welfare recipients and pensioners, designed to assist with cost of living pressures. Something to bear in mind when we inevitably hear the constant refrain of \u201cworking families\u201d in tonight\u2019s proceedings: So, what will be the big takeaway from this budget? Will there be bold reforms? That\u2019s unlikely, said economics commentator Jessica Mizrahi. She said that it\u2019s a safer bet the government will be writing cheques like there\u2019s no tomorrow, a firm eye on the election. It\u2019s not likely we will see a jobkeeper or NDIS-scale program on the papers this budget night. However, it is unmistakably an election year. While the economy is growing, it\u2019s still getting back on its feet. Cost-of-living pressures are real and growing. Maybe money can\u2019t buy love, but spending can buy votes \u2013 or so politicians hope. Put these things together and it\u2019s a safe bet that the chequebook will be out. Speculation to date is focused on booze and bowsers. If the whispers are right, cheques will be made out to motorists (cutting or freezing the fuel excise) and beer drinkers (cutting the draught beer excise). We will also get an important sense of just how big the pre-election promises are likely to be. Each budget contains a line for \u201ccontingency reserves\u201d. One part of contingency reserves is \u201cdecisions taken but not yet announced\u201d. This is code for new spending that the government has decided on but does not yet want to disclose. The number is reliably largest in the period before an election. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the 2022-23 budget. We are just 30 minutes away from showtime. It\u2019s an election budget, so you can expect plenty of sweeteners dressed up as \u2018cost-of-living\u2019 measures. Here is what we know about the budget so far: The government has promised a cut to fuel excise, to reduce the high costs of petrol due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 44 cents a litre excise could be cut by up to 20 cents. The budget is reportedly going to give a one-off increase to the low and middle income tax offset \u2013 the temporary tax offset for those earning $126,000 or less. That offset currently pays from $255 to $1,080, depending on your income. The changes would now give between $675 and $1,500, paid out from 1 July, according to the ABC. About 10 million people will get $420 on average. Welfare recipients and pensioners are expected to receive a one-off $250 payment. The payment is also billed as relief to cost-of-living pressures The budget will include $16bn in new infrastructure funding. A Guardian Australia analysis of the 144 projects being funded by the government in Tuesday\u2019s budget shows that just 21 are included on Infrastructure Australia\u2019s current list of priority projects. An expansion is expected of the home guarantee scheme, which helps first home buyers get into the market by placing government as the guarantor of the loan. The government will make 35,000 guarantees each year, up from the current 10,000, from 1 July. About $365.3m will be spent on getting an extra 35,000 apprentices and trainees get into a job, through extensions to the boosting apprenticeship commencement wage subsidy. The government has also promised $480m to improve NBN infrastructure in regional, rural and remote areas."

            "content": "Australia\u2019s electronic spy agency will double in size and ramp up its ability to launch its own offensive cyber operations as part of a $10bn national security budget pledge curiously dubbed Redspice. But the funding is spread over 10 years and only $4.2bn will be spent in the first four-year budget cycle. Given the government is partly offsetting the package with savings from other parts of the defence portfolio, the cyber pledge is worth only $588.7m in new money in the first four years. The money would allow the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) to \u201ckeep pace with the rapid growth of cyber capabilities of potential adversaries\u201d, the government said. In a separate move, the government has budgeted an extra $1.2bn between now and the late 2030s towards a national space mission for Earth observation, \u201cwhich will see Australia design, build, and operate four new satellites\u201d. While the cyber package reflects advice from security agencies about the increasing threats of attacks on critical infrastructure, it also fits the Coalition\u2019s political desire to make national security a key issue in the looming election. In a move that will do nothing to diminish criticism of prime minister Scott Morrison as being unduly focused on marketing, the government has created a buzzword for the initiative, Redspice \u2013 \u201cResilience, Effects, Defence, Space, Intelligence, Cyber and Enablers\u201d. Under the package, the ASD is expected to add 1,900 jobs over the decade, including data analysts, computer programmers and software engineers. The government said it would bolster Australia\u2019s commitment to its Five-Eyes and Aukus partners \u201cwhile supporting a secure Indo-Pacific region\u201d. While ASD on the whole will double in size, it is expected to triple its offensive cyber capabilities. The agency will also bolster its efforts to fend off cyber-attacks on Australia\u2019s critical infrastructure, \u201cbeing able to counter attack and protect our most critical systems\u201d, according to Tuesday\u2019s budget papers. It will aim to \u201canticipate and deter a crisis and deliver asymmetric capabilities\u201d. Budget papers revealed the cost of Redspice would be partially offset by savings in the Defence Integrated Investment Program, but those specific cuts were not immediately clear. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told parliament it was \u201cthe biggest ever investment in Australia\u2019s cyber preparedness\u201d and the lesson of history was that \u201cweakness invites aggression\u201d. He said the world faced \u201cuncertain times\u201d \u2013 a message the government is increasingly amplifying as it warns voters against risking a change of government in May. \u201cTonight, as we gather, war rages in Europe,\u201d Frydenberg said. He used his budget speech to launch a political attack on Labor, saying \u201cthose opposite allowed defence spending to fall to its lowest level since 1938\u201d. The Gillard Labor government did outline defence cuts in the 2012 budget while under political pressure to deliver a promised surplus, but then used its 2013 defence white paper to reinstate a commitment to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence each year. In the lead-up to this year\u2019s election, Labor leader Anthony Albanese has offered bipartisan support to the 2% minimum and has said big national security, defence and strategic issues are above politics. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Coalition has previously faced accusations of talking tough on cybersecurity but failing to deliver. The Australian National Audit Office found last year that just a quarter of Australian government entities were compliant with the mandatory strategies to protect themselves against cyber threats. After the establishment last week of a space command within the Royal Australian Air Force, the government is also pledging more funding to develop Australia\u2019s space industry, to be led by the Australian Space Agency. The minister for science and technology, Melissa Price, said the government wanted \u201cmore expertise and more jobs right here in Australia in this critical industry\u201d. \u201cDeveloping and launching these first four Australian satellites will create the foundation of industry knowhow for more complex space missions next decade,\u201d Price said. The budget does not update the projected cost of Australia\u2019s planned new nuclear-propelled submarines, which are subject to a joint study with the US and the UK. Aukus is mentioned as a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d in the budget papers, because the costs of the acquisition are yet to be assessed. Nor does the budget outline the projected cost of cancelling the contract with French firm Naval Group. But the government wants to secure additional land in Adelaide to build a construction yard for nuclear-powered submarines adjacent to the existing Osborne North shipyard. It also reiterated that its plan to build a new submarine base on the east coast of Australia would be part of an estimated $10bn long-term investment in future submarine infrastructure. Earlier this month the government announced plans to recruit an extra 18,500 defence personnel by 2040 at a total cost of $38bn. The budget also confirms the $156.5m cost of Australia\u2019s support to Ukraine following its invasion by Russia in February, including $91m in \u201clethal and non-lethal military assistance\u201d. Against the backdrop of heightened concern in Canberra about a planned defence agreement between China and Solomon Islands, the government said it was delivering a record $1.85bn in Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the Pacific this year. Solomon Islands will gain $161.1m in ODA in 2022-23, up from $156.4m this year. The government also continues to pledge \u201ctemporary and targeted\u201d additional funding to help the Pacific respond to Covid. The government said it would spend $65m building and maintaining a new complex for the Australian high commission in Honiara in Solomon Islands. The government is ending the freeze on indexation of Australia\u2019s overall ODA levels, meaning it will increase from $4bn in 2021-22 to $4.089bn in 2022-23. In a sign of concerns about the personal safety of MPs and senators, the budget also includes $30m over four years to increase security at Parliament House in Canberra. That includes improving CCTV, upgrading screening equipment and expanding the security operations room."

            "content": "Children\u2019s education is being eroded by financial pressures triggering staff cuts and scaled-back curriculums, with local authority-run secondary schools among the worst hit, according to parliament\u2019s spending watchdog. The Department for Education (DfE) insists the school system in England is in good financial health overall, but a report by the public accounts committee (PAC) warned that national figures \u201cmask significant variation and challenges for individual schools\u201d. One in four secondary schools maintained by local authorities were in deficit in 2019/20, forcing them to cut staff, narrow the curriculum and reduce support for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, it said. In contrast, the report highlights the relative wealth of some academy trusts that have built up large reserves with a cumulative surplus of \u00a33.1bn \u2013 money which is therefore not being spent on current pupils\u2019 education, the report points out. More than one in five academy trusts (22%) had reserve balances equivalent to more than 20% of their annual income in the year ending 31 August 2020. Academy trusts may decide to build up their reserves to pay for capital works, but the PAC has called on the education department to investigate whether the highest reserves are justified. The PAC report said 88% of schools maintained by local authorities and 93% of academy trusts in England were in surplus. Behind those figures however, the report points out that in 26 local authorities, more than 20% of maintained schools were in deficit. The DfE said later however that the most up-to-date figures showed 95.9% of academy trusts and 91.6% of maintained schools now have balanced accounts and the percentage of maintained schools in deficit had decreased from 12% in 2019-20 to 8% in 2020-21. \u201cInvestment in schools is rising \u2013 we have confirmed an overall \u00a34.7bn increase to the core school budget by 2024-25 and will continue to deliver year on year, real terms per pupil increases, including a 5% real terms per pupil boost in 2022-23,\u201d a spokesperson said. MPs on the PAC said the DfE had little assurance that the extra \u00a34.7bn for school funding from the 2021 spending review would be enough to cover cost pressures, including the impact of the Covid pandemic. They also raised concerns about the government\u2019s national funding formula, introduced in 2018-19 to make the funding of England\u2019s schools more fair and transparent, which has resulted in rebalancing of funds away from deprived schools with a higher proportion of children eligible for free school meals. PAC chair Dame Meg Hillier said: \u201cThe DfE\u2019s airy assurances about the healthy books of academies in particular mask some cruel divides between the haves and have-nots. Rather than \u2026 blithely looking for laurels to rest on, [the DfE] must grasp that it\u2019s not OK for any group of our children to be abandoned in the system that it oversees.\u201d Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cThis report highlights problems in the education system that are longstanding and have seriously hindered the ability of schools to give every child the education they deserve.\u201d Meanwhile, colleges in England are facing their worst staffing crisis for two decades, with 6,000 job vacancies, according to a report by the Association of Colleges. There are on average 30 vacancies in each institution, while one college reported 162 vacancies. Kirsti Lord, the association\u2019s deputy chief executive, said: \u201cThe issue for colleges around recruiting and retaining staff has been building for some time. It is a symptom of the decision to freeze or reduce colleges\u2019 funding for over a decade and has left the sector struggling to keep pace on pay.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-16T09:00:26Z",
            "content": "Canada and the US have issued a rare public notice over planned military exercises in the Arctic amid growing concern over Russian aggression. The North American Aerospace Defense Command said on Tuesday that it would hold air defence exercises throughout the Canadian Arctic, adding that the drills were meant to test the ability to \u201crespond to both aircraft and cruise missiles\u201d threatening the continent. Operation Noble Defender has been a recurring event in recent years, but the drills have taken on new meaning in the weeks since Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at a defence conference before the operation, Canada\u2019s top soldier said that while the threat of a Russian incursion into Canada\u2019s Arctic was low at the moment, he would not rule it out in years to come. Gen Wayne Eyre, the chief of defence staff, said it was \u201cnot inconceivable that our sovereignty may be challenged\u201d from the Arctic region and that Canada needed to closely watch Russian action elsewhere. In recent years, Russia has increased its military presence in land bases in the Arctic, and launched a string of provocative aerial missions. Two years ago, a pair of long-range Russian bombers buzzed Canadian airspace before turning back. The TU-160 Blackjack bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, crossed the North Pole and approached Canada from western Russia. Experts agree that any overt military aggression in the Arctic would probably take the form of attacks from the air and sea, rather than the land. Russia has previously tested hypersonic missiles that would be difficult, if not impossible, to detect with much of the current technology deployed in the Arctic. Moscow\u2019s brazen attack on Ukraine three weeks ago has renewed worries the Russian president has become increasingly unpredictable \u2013 and raising tensions in other regions where Russia has shown signs of aggression. \u201cIf Putin were rational, it\u2019d be a different story,\u201d said the retired Canadian colonel Pierre Leblanc, who spent years overseeing troops in the northern reaches of the country. \u201cBut he\u2019s forcing us to destroy his country\u2019s economy. And despite all the threats, all the sanctions, he continues to bomb civilian targets, and commit war crimes.\u201d Despite the vulnerabilities of the region, Leblanc said successive Canadian governments had failed to modernize early warning systems and neglected the development of military bases and deep water ports. He pointed out a gap of 2,800km between Inuvik and Iqaluit, the two forward operating locations for Canada\u2019s F-18 planes, leaving vast swaths of land and sea exposed and difficult to patrol. At the same time, the technology behind short-range radar used to guard the region is \u201clargely obsolete\u201d and that parts used in repairs are no longer manufactured. \u201cIf you placed all of continental Europe in the Canadian Arctic, there\u2019d be room to spare. So when we sending out monitoring ships, it would be the equivalent of sending out two ships to monitor all of Europe. If you suggested that, you\u2019d be laughed out of the room.\u201d In recent years, Leblanc has become a strong advocate for developing a base and deep water port in Resolute Bay and believes greater investment in the region would create jobs for Inuit communities. Earlier this month, the Inuit-run Nasittuq Corporation was announced as the winner of a C$592m (US$464m) contract to operate the North Warning System, a 37-year-old network of dozens of remotely operated radar stations stretching more than 5,000km along the edge of the Arctic Ocean. The radar system functions as a critical set of eyes on the region\u2019s airspace but needs significant upgrades. But Michael Byers, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia who focuses on Arctic issues, argued that Russia had little incentive to show aggression in the Canadian Arctic. \u201c[It\u2019s] the largest country in the world and it has considerable Arctic resources of its own. There\u2019s nothing in Canada that Russia doesn\u2019t have,\u201d he said. He added that Moscow knew that any military interference in the Canadian Arctic could be a \u201ctripwire into a full-blown\u201d conflict with Nato. Instead, he said, Canada and allies should focus on the European Arctic, where Russia has a network of submarines capable of launching nuclear missiles. \u201cThe idea that we need to be worried about a Russian invasion strikes me as misleading, because we know where the real concern is,\u201d said Byers. \u201cThe real concern is in Europe, today.\u201d Still, Leblanc said the recent events in Ukraine had highlighted the importance of planning for future events, even if the odds of military attacks remained low. \u201cWe have very little resources to actually look after a beautiful part of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cUkrainians are dying for their land. We barely protect ours.\u201d"

            "content": "Jon Barton spent his days reading scripts, advising costuming departments and thinking through fight choreography for top military movies. The retired US marine took his expertise after four tours in the Middle East to Hollywood, consulting and providing military equipment to film sets \u2013 a mission to help the entertainment industry better depict military life. Until late February, when Russia\u2019s President Vladamir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. Duty called again, Barton said. Barton, owner of Night-Fire Media, a military consulting and rental company, is sending most of his company\u2019s tactical gear to Ukrainians fighting Russian troops \u2013 backing a David-versus-Goliath fight for democracy that has the whole world watching. \u201cThere is this inherent belief that something is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s been trained to fight wrong and to stand up in the face of evil, you inherently get drawn into it.\u201d Earlier this week, Barton hurried around the Ukrainian Orthodox church in Echo Park, balancing two cellphones and juggling boxes of rifle slings, boots and camouflage uniforms. The supplies were to be boxed and flown to the border between Ukraine and Poland and distributed by volunteers. He said he hadn\u2019t slept for two days. \u201cIt\u2019s super cold, so imagine fighting in those conditions,\u201d Alex Dubov, a professor at Loma Linda University, who has family in Ukraine, said outside the church. \u201cThe boots that Jon was just bringing in is like, sent by heaven.\u201d Barton is not sending weapons or ammo \u2013 by law, he can\u2019t \u2013 but this is crucial gear civilians often forget, he said. Many are everyday Ukrainians suddenly facing relentless shelling. He\u2019s donating about 80% of his inventory, including about 620 uniforms of various camouflage colors, 118 boots of different vintage and 300 pairs of gloves. \u201cSometimes we forget the details \u2013 the slings, the canteens, the belts, the shoelaces. All that\u2019s important,\u201d Barton said. The idea emerged after a friend asked if he had extra camouflage uniforms. Barton had already been stirred by an image of young Ukrainian men, clad in knee pads to fight Russian troops, and videos of Russians firing at the press. \u201cI said hold on, not just that, could you guys use knee pads? Could you guys use belts?\u201d he said. \u201cI have tactical gear, and I have it by the bucket-full.\u201d Barton was soon heading to Ventura county, where his company houses its inventory of gear from military base stores and third-party contractors, including phased-out colors and equipment for each branch of the military. \u201cMy neighbors kept coming by like, \u2018Are you planning for war?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m giving it to Ukraine.\u2019 They flipped out,\u201d Barton said. Bridging fantasy and reality Barton has made a living advising Hollywood since he first worked as a set extra and realized the uniforms weren\u2019t authentic. He\u2019s worked with actors including Aaron Eckhart and Chris Hemsworth, and his credits include NCIS and Criminal Minds. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a character using weapons \u2026 you want them to have adequate training, and the really important thing that Jon brings to table is that he understands it\u2019s not the military \u2013 these actors are playing a role and you can\u2019t treat each one the same way,\u201d said producer Gale Anne Hurd, who first met Barton on the set of Punisher: War Zone. It\u2019s not about putting a gun in someone\u2019s hand, he said \u2013 it\u2019s about authentically bridging fantasy and reality. \u201cYou could tune in Friday night at 9pm and watch JAG, but it didn\u2019t look like CBS News at 7. What fantasy world are you living in?\u201d he said. Now, fantasy and reality are colliding again, and the threat of world war, or nuclear fallout, usually reserved for the big screen, feels close to home, he said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t get too scared about this, but the marine in me used to sit through classified briefings and seeing satellite imagery,\u201d he said. There\u2019s a part of him, too, that wishes he were there. \u201cMy kneejerk reaction is always, let\u2019s go in there, kick some ass,\u201d Barton said. \u201cAnd then I think about it and [realize], we can\u2019t do that because this and this, and then the politics come into play and I totally get that.\u201d He also knows his involvement isn\u2019t without professional risk. Barton has noticed some clients aren\u2019t returning his phone calls. \u201cI\u2019m less desirable to be hired on to a show where they try to take an apolitical stance, even though I\u2019m not doing anything political,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help humans.\u201d Still, Barton hopes larger film studios will follow his lead and donate their fleet of gear. \u201cSome of these prop companies have acres and acres of equipment, especially just uniforms and boots, something that we wouldn\u2019t even bat an eye at in the film industry,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just costumes.\u201d They say costumes, he said. \u201cI say uniforms.\u201d"

Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Russia\u2019s pledge to drastically cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine, saying \u201cUkrainians are not naive people\u201d and vowing to continue defensive military efforts. Zelenskiy said in a video address early on Wednesday: \u201cUkrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted.\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that Moscow wanted to \u201cincrease mutual trust, create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine\u201d, and that the Kremlin would \u201cradically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv\u201d.

Records show long gap in Trump phone logs as January 6 violence unfolded The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is reportedly looking at a \u201cpossible cover-up\u201d of White House records focusing on Donald Trump\u2019s phone logs from that fateful day, which bear an unexplained gap of seven hours and 37 minutes covering the period when the violence was unfolding. Documents obtained by the Washington Post and CBS News put flesh on the bones of one of the great mysteries of January 6: why White House phone logs contain holes in the record despite evidence the then president busily made calls at the height of the insurrection. The documents reveal that Trump\u2019s diary shows an entry at 11.17am when he \u201ctalked on a phone call to an unidentified person\u201d. The next entry is not until 6.54pm \u2013 457 minutes later \u2013 when Trump asked the White House switchboard to place a call to his communications chief, Dan Scavino. Between those times Trump addressed a rally on the Ellipse, exhorting supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d; hundreds of Trump followers overran police barricades and stormed the Capitol building. What did the Washington Post journalists say? Bob Woodward (of Watergate fame) and Robert Costa reported that the long gap between call logs was of \u201cintense interest\u201d to elements of the January 6 committee. They quoted an unnamed member of the panel who said they were investigating a \u201cpossible cover-up\u201d. Joe Biden signs landmark law making lynching a hate crime The first federal legislation making lynching a hate crime, addressing a history of racist killings in the US, became law yesterday. The bill, passed by the Senate this month, is named afte Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black boy who was brutally murdered in Mississippi in 1955. Joe Biden signed the bill surrounded by Kamala Harris, members of Congress and top justice department officials. He was also joined by a descendant of Ida B Wells, a Black journalist who reported on lynchings, and Rev Wheeler Parker, a cousin of Till. The bill makes it possible to prosecute as a lynching any conspiracy to commit a hate crime that results in death or serious bodily injury. According to the bill\u2019s champion, the Illinois congressman Bobby Rush, the law lays out a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and fines. Why has it taken this long to bring in? Congress first considered anti-lynching legislation more than 120 years ago. Until March of this year, it had failed to pass such legislation nearly 200 times. What did the vice-president say? \u201cLynching is not a relic of the past. Racial acts of terror still occur in our nation. And when they do, we must all have the courage to name them and hold the perpetrators to account,\u201d she said.

            "date": "2022-03-01T19:36:28Z",
            "content": "Russian state television talkshows are describing videos of missiles striking Ukrainian cities and reports of Russian soldiers killed in action as \u201cfakes\u201d, as the country\u2019s media try to account for photos and video emerging from Ukraine that contradict official reports of the invasion. The \u201cmythbusting\u201d is one of the adjustments that TV propaganda shows have had to make as evidence of the growing destruction in cities such as Kharkiv and Kyiv makes it increasingly difficult for the government to present the fiction of a concentrated offensive in the Donbas region. On Channel One\u2019s Vremya Pokazhet (Time Will Tell), pundits and officials took on the reports that hundreds of Russian soldiers had died, in a sign that the information about casualties could no longer be kept from the public. That followed stories over the weekend of Russian relatives describing shock and anger at finding out that their husbands, brothers and sons had been sent to fight in Ukraine. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous wave of information,\u201d said the Russian MP Boris Chernyshev. \u201cPeople are showing fakes, they\u2019re showing what are allegedly our dead soldiers. All of that needs to be stopped.\u201d For the first time on Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry said it planned to strike targets in Kyiv, days after its missiles rained down around the city as part of the beginning of the invasion. Soon, Russian missiles struck a TV tower in Kyiv, a sign that bombardments of Ukrainian cities are soon going to become far more widespread. Indiscriminate attacks are growing after early Russian failures to take the cities. Earlier on Tuesday a rocket aimed at the centre of Kharkiv killed at least seven people. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called it an act of terrorism. On TV debate shows, guests have begun to speak openly about the government\u2019s desire to take Kyiv. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of time before they surrender or they are destroyed,\u201d said Igor Korotchenko, a hawkish military journalist who featured prominently on one of the marathon sessions of 60 Minutes, a talkshow. \u201cThe fall of Kyiv is also a question of the coming three, four, five days, I don\u2019t know exactly.\u201d Russian news channels originally followed Vladimir Putin\u2019s lead in calling the war a \u201cspecial operation in the Donbas\u201d, but on some state-run channels there have been references now to the beginning of a war. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed that much but they\u2019re having to admit now that it is a full-scale war and before it almost seemed like a surgical operation with no resistance,\u201d said Francis Scarr, a journalist for BBC Monitoring who has closely followed how Russian state television has presented the war. The shows have come to dominate state television programming. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual. On Channel One they don\u2019t have any entertainment shows throughout the whole day. Right from nine o\u2019clock in the morning until 9pm, it\u2019s just nonstop Vremya Pokazhet and Bolshaya Igra [The Great Game], you know, that one where they think they\u2019re sort of dividing up the world.\u201d Scarr said the shows had gone all-in on promoting \u201cdenazification\u201d, a propaganda term that Putin has used to signify that Russian authorities plan to hold some kind of purge if they achieve their goals. It has also become a kind of informal slogan for the war. Alexander Kots, a pro-Kremlin journalist, used the term as he described Tuesday evening\u2019s missile strike as part of the \u201cdenazification of Ukrainian television\u201d on his Telegram channel. And a former diplomat who sent a Guardian journalist a long report on alleged Ukrainian war crimes as Russian forces bombed Kharkiv appeared to make reference to the term as justification for strikes against residential districts. \u201cAnd what if Nazis have hidden in the population centres?\u201d he wrote."

            "content": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is already more than three weeks old, and the death toll in the bitter conflict is already likely to have exceeded 10,000. But there is also no sign of a decisive military breakthrough on either side, which could have important consequences for what is to come. On the one hand, Russia\u2019s attack on its neighbour has been so poorly coordinated that it has left many military experts baffled. Yet while Ukraine\u2019s defence has been exceptionally determined, it is also clear that it cannot force out the 150,000 invading troops from its territory. \u201cThe thing that has surprised onlookers is just how average the Russian military has been and how they have struggled with a complicated military operation,\u201d said Phil Osborn, a former air marshal and chief of British defence intelligence. \u201cIf you look at the current position, Russia is struggling to maintain the tempo.\u201d A US estimate released earlier this week suggests as many as 7,000 Russian soldiers have already died in the fighting, a tally partly confirmed by the growing number of death notices of uniformed young men appearing in Russian media. Its forces are estimated by western governments to have lost 10% of their armour. Many Russian soldiers were so poorly briefed they were surprised even to be invading Ukraine, and even more surprised to be shot at once they crossed the border. Special forces \u201cwere told it was a three-day excursion\u201d, according to one account. So naively optimistic were Russian forces that some units dashed ahead to try to drive into Kyiv and Kharkiv, only to meet unexpected resistance. Chaotic logistics led to a vast, stalled 40-mile convoy outside Kyiv and fighting vehicles stuck in the early spring mud. But it took less than a week for the Russians to change tack. That was signalled by a cruise missile strike on the government building in the heart of Kharkiv, and has since been played out brutally in Mariupol, once a city of 450,000 people, where the past week has seen Russia bomb a maternity hospital and on Wednesday, a theatre where desperate people had been taking refuge below ground. Ukrainian officials estimated earlier this week that 2,500 civilians had been killed in Mariupol. Yet despite the fearful losses, neither it nor Kharkiv have fallen. Ukraine\u2019s military has also lost between 2,000 and 4,000, according to the US, while the official UN estimate of civilian casualties is 780, a figure certain to rise. The first Russian forces arrived at the towns just north-west of Kyiv on the first day of the invasion, but since then they have become bogged down, failing to progress from Irpin and Bucha just outside the capital. Progress has also been stymied on the east side of the city, and western officials are beginning to question if Russia wants to fight its way through. \u201cI think there is a question as to whether Moscow now intends to try to assault Kyiv or not, and I don\u2019t know the answer to that,\u201d said one on Thursday. Unlike Kharkiv or Mariupol, the capital has not been subject to heavy bombardment from the air or long-range artillery; and with three weeks to prepare the city\u2019s defences any assault would be very costly \u2013 for both sides. Nato may not be willing to intervene by imposing a no-fly zone \u2013 a stance that has not shifted since fighting started \u2013 but western weapons have flooded into the country. On Wednesday night the US said it would send a further 9,000 anti-tank weapons and 800 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, after an appeal by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Congress on Wednesday. That has allowed Ukrainian forces to mount some ambushes of Russian tanks and armoured forces, in which light infantry have used shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapons to thwart the invaders\u2019 advance. But Ukraine has no real answer when Russian forces turn to relentless bombing. Russian forces have also made significant gains in the south of the country, are already enforcing a naval blockade from the Black Sea, and, according to two analysts at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, are beginning to threaten Ukraine\u2019s principal regular army formation, the Joint Forces Operation (JFO), which faces the Donbas region in the east. Sam Cranny-Evans and Sidharth Kaushal said that while Ukraine had held up the Russians in the north, the position of the JFO was \u201clooking increasingly precarious\u201d. Russian forces are continuing to push north from Crimea, to Beryslav along the Dnieper River, while other forces are bypassing Kharkiv and trying to join up with them as they head south. If Russian forces can succeed in encircling the Ukrainian army in the east it might, the authors argue, lead to a defeat of the country, as happened to France in 1940. \u201cThe destruction of armies tends to lead to a broader collapse of will that makes sieges unnecessary,\u201d they said. Others argue that the broad strength of the Ukrainian resistance, the size of the country, and the course of the fighting so far demonstrate that Russia is unable to achieve a victory of conquest and occupation. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve learned is that Russia cannot win an outright victory \u2013 and that Ukraine cannot expel the Russians either,\u201d said Peter Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser. As the fighting becomes increasingly attritional, peace talks between the two sides have gathered pace in the last 48 hours, with Zelenskiy offering to abandon Ukraine\u2019s quest to join Nato and seek a neutral status along the lines of Sweden or Austria. But, Lord Ricketts argued, that \u201cwouldn\u2019t be nearly enough for Putin to accept, given all the mayhem and suffering that has happened so far\u201d. Given Putin\u2019s political need to secure a significant victory, a more likely scenario, Ricketts said, could be an uneasy halting of combat operations, and an effective repartition of the country in Russia\u2019s favour. \u201cIt would be ceasefire on a hold-what-you-have basis, which for Russia would include the ground its forces have flattened and occupied in the south and the east. Given the military situation, I don\u2019t see diplomacy getting to any common ground,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-03-04T13:00:02Z",
            "content": "As the CIA and MI6 try to predict the next gambit of the unstable leader in the Kremlin, Britons flinch at reports of the possible use of nuclear weapons. But this is 1962; Khrushchev not Putin. ITV\u2019s new adaptation of Len Deighton\u2019s cold war novel The Ipcress File \u2013 which was a 60s-defining movie starring Michael Caine as the working-class spy Harry Palmer \u2013 was meant to be a period piece for 2022 viewers. But the Russian president\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and pointed reminders to the world about the size of his nuclear weapons, have given the Sunday night drama a new context. \u201cI thought I was writing history, but it turned out to be current affairs,\u201d says screenwriter John Hodge. \u201cWhen you pitch a script, you\u2019re always asked: \u2018What\u2019s relevant about this? Why should we make it now?\u2019 And with The Ipcress File, there was a fear that this stuff was so long ago. Our line was actually always that, in the cold war, people were very much aware of the threat of nuclear annihilation but it hasn\u2019t gone away because of the number of warheads and rogue players and so on. But it feels terrible to be proved right.\u201d As Hodge\u2019s Oscar-nominated script for Danny Boyle\u2019s 1996 movie Trainspotting was on screen within three years of Irvine Welsh\u2019s novel, and his adaptation of Alex Garland\u2019s The Beach in 2000 appeared just four years after the hardback, Deighton\u2019s 1962 novel is by far the oldest source material Hodge has ever brought to our screens \u2013 and the first that has already been a movie. His version of The Ipcress File, though, is very different from either the 1962 book or the 1965 Caine film about a kidnapped British nuclear scientist. The novel is a first-person narrative and the movie dominated by Palmer, but Hodge has \u201cgiven voices to other characters. Six hours of TV demands huge amounts of story compared to a movie. You need more central characters.\u201d The TV version spreads the action between the new Palmer, played by Joe Cole), British agent Jean (Lucy Boynton), her spymaster Dalby (Tom Hollander) and CIA agent Maddox (Ashley Thomas). The fact that an African American spy was plausible (though rare) at that time, when the English secret service was hideously white, also allows the series to achieve both historical realism and diversity: \u201cIt is a balance between being true to the era and writing something a modern audience can relate to.\u201d Cole, after a clever bit of business with the thick black-framed spectacles that were Caine\u2019s visual signature, takes the role in a new direction, helped by a new backstory featuring thrilling scenes in Berlin that Deighton never imagined. Hodge and director James Watkins (Black Mirror, McMafia) \u201cfelt we needed something to introduce Harry,\u201d says Hodge. \u201cI think in a movie you can just say here\u2019s a spy and go along with him. But TV audiences need to know a bit more about the characters \u2026 so I wrote a sequence about how Harry got involved, rather unwillingly, in espionage.\u201d In the 60s, the cockney boy confidently dining at the highest tables was seen as a symbol of England\u2019s social evolution. But now, says Hodge, we see it differently. \u201cThis is set at a time when the next five British prime ministers [Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Thatcher and Major] are going to be from state schools, and it feels, in that moment, that the Old Etonians are over. But obviously we now know that they weren\u2019t.\u201d Hodge has also done a lot of plot renovation. \u201cI think Deighton lost interest in the plot halfway through the novel, and it\u2019s a series of comic riffs after that.\u201d He sees it as a story about the emergence of a modern culture in Britain, after the still literally and metaphorically rationed 1950s: flying to Rome or Paris seems impossibly glamorous, and exotic delicatessens offer unimaginable foodstuffs such as pomegranate. The show covers 1962 to 63, and older viewers and history students will delight in trying to anticipate how Hodge might bring in what he calls \u201chigh 60s moments\u201d \u2013 the Cuban missile crisis, the Profumo sex scandal, the presidency of John F Kennedy: \u201cOne of the pleasures of writing recent historical fiction is that you can aim for these landmarks that some of the audience will be anticipating.\u201d Deighton\u2019s cheekily meritocratic spook has widely been seen as an anti-James Bond and, oddly, working on The Ipcress File was also post-007 for Hodge. He and Boyle (his director on Trainspotting, its sequel T2 and Shallow Grave) were employed on \u201cBond 25\u201d, which subsequently became last year\u2019s No Time to Die; they co-wrote a script before being sacked. \u201cI think it was me they really wanted rid of, but Danny took the bullet, too,\u201d says Hodge. Do non-disclosure agreements cover their departure? \u201cNo. Just decent British discretion!\u201d At the time Hodge and Boyle learned they would not write another day, there were suggestions they had spooked the producers by pitching an incredibly subversive storyline. But the released movie contains a twist at least as dramatic, which seems to disprove the rumour they had gone too far. \u201cMy understanding was that that twist had been decided even before we came on board because Daniel Craig wanted it. I think, with us, it was that old cliche \u201ccreative differences\u201d. It felt very dramatic at the time but it was just another bump in the road of the Bond franchise.\u201d As Hodge says he is sparing with scene directions (\u201cI don\u2019t like to tell directors what to do\u201d), I wonder about the spectacular action sequences in a Bond movie. Do you just write \u201cthe island rises into the air and explodes\u201d and let them get on with it? \u201cI kind of hoped that was the case, because in a big action movie, the action is worked out between the director and numerous departments. But for some reason, they want you to write the action. It\u2019s the thing I hate doing most: \u2018The car skids round the corner, bouncing off the kerb. Inside the car, Jack Wiley lights a cigarette\u2019 etc. And you can only get it wrong: they either tell you it\u2019s too expensive or say it\u2019s too unambitious because a plane already flew through the Deptford Tunnel in Fast and Furious 7, or whatever.\u201d Hodge still has his Bond script on a laptop. When he saw the movie, he found that \u201chalf a line\u201d of his dialogue had survived. What is it? \u201cAaaargh, I can\u2019t. It\u2019s their film. I don\u2019t want to seem like the guy who got paid and goes round telling stories about them.\u201d He didn\u2019t even tell his family what the half-line was. \u201cLook, it\u2019s the screenwriter\u2019s life. If you\u2019re lucky, you get a job, and sometimes that job doesn\u2019t end well.\u201d If this ITV show is successful, Hodge would like to adapt Deighton\u2019s 1965 novel Billion Dollar Brain (also a film with Caine), which is about viral warfare, and which may also have reached an interesting moment for a remake. He does not, though, expect Trainspotting to become a trilogy. \u201cI think that\u2019s done. In that heady atmosphere of producing T2, we talked about coming back to it. But the second film was not as exciting as the first, and to me that was a reflection of the fact that life isn\u2019t as exciting in your 40s and 50s as in your 20s. I was at peace with that. Any idea of getting the gang back together for more hijinks just feels misguided to me.\u201d He and Boyle are \u201cdeveloping an idea for a feature film, which is quite an old-fashioned idea these days. And, like most writers in the UK at the moment, we\u2019re trying to think of ideas we can pitch to a big streamer for a vast multiseason international show!\u201d The Ipcress File starts on 6 March at 9pm on ITV.

            "content": "A reply is needed to the letters (23 March) objecting to political parties supporting nuclear power. How can the chairman of the British Energy Efficiency Federation dispute the statement that \u201celectricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade\u201d? Has he not realised that, to meet the climate crisis, the necessary replacement of fossil fuels in road transport and home heating requires electric-powered engines and heat pumps, respectively? Safe underground storage of nuclear waste has been developed. This has never been an insoluble problem. By contrast, little money has been spent on other waste products such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals and plastics. In comparison with nuclear waste, the poisonous effects of heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium never decay with time. We need both nuclear power and power from renewables, the long-term storage of which is a real problem. It is sad that the UK government\u2019s abandonment of support for nuclear industry development in the 1990s has led to the import of expensive foreign reactors. Our country needs a revived nuclear industry based on smaller, much cheaper reactors that are faster to build. Opposition to nuclear power has led to much higher emissions of CO2; for the past 40 years, the emissions from France, whose electricity has been mainly nuclear-powered, have been about 30% less per head than those from Germany. The current abandonment of nuclear power in Germany has not made sense because it has led to more burning of coal and a reliance on imported Russian fuels.

            "date": "2022-03-25T06:00:20Z",
            "content": "The World Health Organization has called on governments to undertake more long-term measurements of ultrafine particles in the air. The average cubic centimetre of UK city air contains about 12,000 ultrafine particles (UFPs), and close to busy roads the average is about 30,000. Their small size \u2013 they are impossible to see \u2013 means they are missed by conventional monitoring techniques that measure the mass of particles, and therefore they are not covered by air pollution laws. The science on UFPs\u2019 health impacts has been slow to evolve. Concern about the effects of inhaling large numbers of very small particles was raised in the mid-1990s but there has been a lack of funding for research. Last year the WHO reviewed evidence on health impacts of air pollution, including more than 75 studies on UFPs, but technical differences between the studies meant it could not set a standard. Prof Anna Hansell, of the University of Leicester, said: \u201cWe are concerned about UFPs as they are so small that they can evade a lot of the body\u2019s particle capture mechanisms and get into the bloodstream. From there they can reach every part of the body. Breathing lots of UFPs over a short time (hours or less) can have impacts on the body. These include inflammation, heart functioning and increases in hospital admissions. However, studies on long-term health problems are inconclusive.\u201d Prof Gerard Hoek of Utrecht University said: \u201cNew studies have provided increasing evidence of respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological effects and foetal development effects. The Dutch Health Council has recommended that the government take additional action to control emissions of UFP from sources including road traffic, aircraft, shipping and wood burning.\u201d Some current pollution control technologies, such as those in vehicle exhausts and waste incinerators, are effective against UFPs. However, reducing UFP emissions would mean controlling some sources that are not directly regulated at the moment. These include aircraft and shipping, which stand out as large sources of burning fuel, as well as commercial cooking and home wood burning. The UK has a long-running national UFP monitoring network, and the UK Clean Air Programme is now adding to this. Some cities including Paris have also started to collect data. This needs to be supported by funding for health studies too."

            "date": "2022-03-12T16:11:28Z",
            "content": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has been described by politicians and commentators as a watershed moment in modern history, a turning point comparable in importance to the 9/11 attacks in the US in 2001, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and even the assassination of John F Kennedy in 1963. Whether this portentous view of the war turns out to be justified, only time \u2013 and future historians \u2013 will tell. But there\u2019s no doubt that in the violent, tumultuous days after 24 February, the established international order has been shaken and, in some respects, upended in extraordinary, unexpected and often unwelcome ways. Ukraine \u2013 a country at the crossroads of Europe and Asia that is little known and often ignored \u2013 has become overnight the crucible of a new world order, a catalyst and trigger for radical upheaval. It has produced a new geopolitical alphabet, spelling out a much-altered future. A Atomic weapons Vladimir Putin\u2019s ill-disguised threat to go nuclear should the west intervene to halt the invasion has come scarily close to breaking a post-1945 taboo. It has undoubtedly inhibited the US and British response, with fears expressed about a \u201cthird world war\u201d. A dangerous precedent has been set. B Joe Biden\u2019s tenure as US president may be fatally undermined by the war. He is praised for avoiding direct military confrontation with Russia. But as in Afghanistan last year, he has failed to prevent a humanitarian disaster \u2013 or stop Putin. Anger over resulting domestic energy price rises and retail inflation could be his undoing. C China stands to be the big strategic winner if, as seems likely, Ukraine becomes a protracted trial of strength between Russia and the west. Its president, Xi Jinping, appears to have given Putin a green light when they met just before the invasion. Now he\u2019s backing peace efforts. China\u2019s economy has been hurt by rising commodity costs. But it\u2019s a small price to pay for increased global dominance. D Disinformation used as a weapon of war, particularly in the form of \u201cfalse flag\u201d operations, invented social media \u201cfacts\u201d, and internet bots, has come of age in the Ukraine conflict. When coupled with cyber warfare, propaganda, media manipulation and rigid censorship, as in Russia, it\u2019s a potent means of sowing doubt, division and defeatism. E Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s unpopular authoritarian president and serial invader of Syria and Iraq, is one of several unlikely would-be peacemakers. Erdo\u011fan has bought missiles from Russia, sold drones to Ukraine, and his country belongs to Nato. Perhaps that\u2019s why no one trusts him. High-level talks last week in Turkey were a Russian time-wasting exercise. But by hosting them, Erdo\u011fan hopes for a boost before difficult elections next year. F France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron appears to have added critical impetus to his presidential re-election bid next month through his dogged efforts to keep Putin engaged in some sort of dialogue. In contrast, far-right hopefuls Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour have been forced to defend their Russian ties. G Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz shocked friends and enemies alike shortly after the invasion by suspending the highly prized Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia and creating an \u00a385bn fund to boost the country\u2019s armed forces. For the first time since the Nazi era, Germany has begun to re-arm \u2013 and Europe cheered. Extraordinary. H Hunger, and consequent political unrest, affecting poorer countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia is a growing fear as Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s wheat, grain and vegetable oil exports are cut off. In Tunisia, symbolic birthplace of the Arab spring revolts, bread prices recently hit an unsustainable 14-year high. I Israel has disappointed its friends with its invasion fence-sitting, ostensibly justified by a need to keep on terms with Russia in Syria. But its rightwing government will be happy if the war scuppers the west\u2019s proposed revived nuclear deal with Iran, to which the ever devious Putin has suddenly raised fresh objections. J Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s prime minister, was on the ropes and almost out for the count in the days before the invasion, vilified for illegal Downing Street partying in breach of Covid lockdown rules. But the war, allowing him to play international statesman, has provided a new lease of political life \u2013 for now. K Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave squeezed between Poland and Lithuania, and the three (former Soviet) Baltic republics are emerging as possible next flashpoints. Fabricated fears about the safety of ethnic Russians in Estonia, for example, have been used in the past to justify Putin\u2019s threats, just like in Ukraine. Now they are being whipped up again. L International law has taken a battering from which it may not recover. By its actions, Russia has torn up the UN charter. Yet the UN security council is powerless to act in the face of Moscow\u2019s permanent veto power \u2013 which it used to block a resolution condemning the invasion. Russia also boycotted a hearing on Ukraine at the UN\u2019s highest court, the international court of justice in The Hague. UN reform must come soon. M Emmanuel Macron\u2019s oft-mocked vision of a sovereign Europe that enjoys \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d and its own military and security capabilities independent of the US has been boosted by the war. Rattled EU leaders meeting at last week\u2019s Versailles summit agreed Europe urgently needed to be better able to defend itself. N Nato has emerged united and stronger, so far, and there is talk of Finland and Sweden joining (though not Ukraine). But the 30-country, US-led alliance is facing criticism for not doing more to help Kyiv. And the war has revived debate over whether Nato\u2019s eastward enlargement after the Soviet collapse was a blunder that contributed to the current crisis. O Oil and gas are fatal chinks in western armour when confronting Russia. The US and Britain decided last week to ban all oil imports by year\u2019s end. The heavily dependent EU needs more time. But rocketing prices, hitting businesses and consumers, have dramatised how hugely powerful a weapon energy is for Putin. A race to find badly needed \u201cgreen\u201d and nuclear alternatives has begun. P Playing and watching international sport has got a lot harder \u2013 if you are Russian. The country\u2019s athletes, footballers, and racing drivers are among sportspeople banned from European and world competitions. Boycotts have a cultural aspect, too, involving ballet, theatre, orchestras and even cat lovers. Such unprecedented \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d may backfire, by convincing ordinary Russians that they, not just their government, are being targeted. Q The quest for truth \u2013 the fundamental purpose of free, independent media \u2013 has been further set back by the war. Russia has long persecuted western correspondents. Now it is threatening them with prison if they report openly on the invasion. Facebook and Twitter have been blocked. The EU, in turn, has banned Russian state-backed RT and Sputnik, deeming them mere propaganda outlets. The concept of the freedom of the press is under siege. R Record refugee outflows, and an accompanying humanitarian crisis, may overwhelm the ability of EU governments and relief agencies to cope. More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled so far, from a population of 44 million. Europe opened its borders amid an epic outpouring of public support. But the EU\u2019s longstanding lack of an agreed, collective refugee policy, and Britain\u2019s shamefully mean-spirited response, suggest trouble ahead as the numbers grow. S Sanctions on Russia are the most sweeping and punitive ever imposed. Banks, including Russia\u2019s central bank, businesses and oligarchs have been hit hard. The rouble has plunged. Numerous western brands and companies such as Shell have pulled out. So far Putin has shrugged it off, but this looks like a bluff. If Russia defaults, or retaliates by cutting gas supplies to Europe, the result may be an all-round economic meltdown, big job losses, and a drastic fall in living standards in the UK and elsewhere. T Taiwan has been watching events in Ukraine with deep unease. The US refusal to come to Kyiv\u2019s aid with direct military support is especially chilling, given the invasion threat the island faces from Beijing. As with Ukraine, Washington has no legal or treaty obligation to fight for Taiwan. Its position is deliberately ambiguous \u2013 and inherently unreliable. China is watching, too. U The United Arab Emirates is among several western allies in the Middle East and Asia that have failed to show hoped-for solidarity. The UAE has not condemned the invasion, nor has it adopted sanctions against Russia, with which it has close financial ties. Mealy mouthed Narendra Modi\u2019s India, the \u201cworld\u2019s largest democracy\u201d, is another big disappointment, as is Egypt. These derelictions will not be forgotten, and may affect future ties. V Venezuela\u2019s hard-left government has been in America\u2019s bad books for years. But when US officials visited recently to discuss resumed oil supplies in return for an easing of sanctions, they found a receptive audience. In contrast, when Joe Biden phoned the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (a keen Putin fan), requesting increased oil production to compensate for banned Russian exports, he refused to take the president\u2019s call. US-Saudi relations have been in the toilet since Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s 2018 murder. This incident will make matters worse. W War crimes investigators face a big test as evidence mounts of multiple atrocities by Russian forces \u2013 exemplified by last week\u2019s Mariupol maternity hospital bombing. \u201cUniversal jurisdiction\u201d prosecutions are contemplated in national courts. And the international criminal court has begun investigations. But like the US and China, Russia does not recognise the ICC\u2019s authority. This situation must change if war crimes are to be justly punished, now and in the future. X Xinjiang, home to China\u2019s persecuted Uyghur Muslim minority, is one of many global troublespots whose urgent problems have been eclipsed by Ukraine. Millions of Afghans enduring a winter of hunger and fear under Taliban rule suddenly seem forgotten. The plight of civilians caught up in Ethiopia\u2019s civil war is another glaring blindspot. Y Younger generations the world over have reason to wonder what\u2019s going on. First they inherited the climate crisis, then came the pandemic, and then the resultant bans on study and travel. Now they face something older generations said would never happen again: a full-scale war in Europe. Z \u201cZ\u201d is a fascist-style pro-war motif displayed by Russian invasion forces and rightwing Putin supporters. But the \u201cZ\u201d that will be remembered with admiration around the world belongs to the name of Volodymyr Zelenskiy Ukraine\u2019s comedian president turned inspirational war leader, who embodies the fight for freedom."

If we have 25% of our electricity generated by nuclear, then on days when all our needs can be met by renewables we will have to turn off 25% of our much cheaper renewable feed while using expensive, taxpayer-subsidised nuclear generation. Second, we have no way of dealing with the mountains of dangerous high-level and intermediate-level waste that has been accruing since the 1950s. To generate more is sheer madness. Third, nuclear power stations are vulnerable to the elements and to hostile attack \u2013 cyber, terrorist, state actors etc. Recent events in the Ukraine make this very real. Fourth, the old argument about what we do when the wind isn\u2019t blowing and the skies are overcast over the whole of the UK, which doesn\u2019t stand up to much scrutiny now, falls away completely if we were to invest just a small amount of the taxpayer money that will go to the nuclear industry into research and development of electricity storage. Finally, given the nuclear industry\u2019s track record of bringing in plants well over budget, decades late, the proposed programme is not going to be realised until 2060 at the earliest. Why on earth are we contemplating it? John French Brockweir, Gloucestershire \u2022 Your report states that \u201celectricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade\u201d. The same justification was used in 2006, when the Labour government first committed to further nuclear power stations. Based on the official forecasts issued in 2006, we should by now be consuming at least 15% more electricity than we were then. But we are not. UK electricity consumption has in practice gone down by more than 15% since 2006. In the interim, no new nuclear power stations have been added to the system. It hasn\u2019t collapsed, and is far less carbon-intensive. Surely we aren\u2019t getting fooled again by the same spurious rhetoric about endless consumption growth? In that immortal phrase of the 1970s: \u201cSave it. You know it makes sense.\u201d Andrew Warren Chairman, British Energy Efficiency Federation \u2022 The dash to fossil fuels is not the environmental disaster set out by Ant\u00f3nio Guterres (Ukraine war threatens global heating goals, warns UN chief, 21 March). It is, at worst, the replacement of existing hydrocarbons purchased from Russia. In the longer term, it is clear that alternative renewable energy sources will displace fossil fuels and most countries will wish to do this as quickly as possible. The government\u2019s desire, supported by Labour, for increased nuclear power generation is bizarre. A wind turbine capable of producing 15MW can be installed offshore for \u00a310m. Sizewell C is expected to cost \u00a320bn and produce 3.2GW of electricity \u2013 this does not include decommissioning costs. To generate 3.2GW would need 214 turbines costing \u00a33.2bn, albeit some money would need to be spent on storage capacity. The government plans to invest \u00a31.7bn in Sizewell C. How is spending more than five times as much on a controversial power source that takes 10 years to build a good idea?

            "date": "2022-03-01T18:49:09Z",
            "content": "Mandatory Covid jabs for health and social care workers in England will be scrapped on 15 March, Sajid Javid has said, as he confirmed staff will no longer be required by law to get vaccinated. The rules came into force for care home staff in November, and had been due to be introduced for frontline NHS and wider social care staff in regulated settings from 1 April. The policy met fierce resistance from some workers, with warnings that sacking those who did not comply would worsen the already serious staffing crisis engulfing health and care services. Several MPs had also criticised the decision. Javid, the health secretary, said earlier this year that he believed it was \u201cno longer proportionate\u201d to require vaccination as a condition of deployment under law. On Tuesday he confirmed the regulations in health and social care would be revoked, and said the rules would end on 15 March. The development immediately raised the question of whether care workers who may have left their jobs could return. Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, said Javid\u2019s announcement had come too late to repair the \u201chuge\u201d damage done to the care sector. \u201cStaff have already left residential care services and found new jobs in the NHS and home care,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI seriously doubt we are going to see lots of them coming back.\u201d Javid said that when the original decision was taken to make it a legal requirement, Delta was the dominant variant of the virus but that had since been replaced by the less severe Omicron. However, he added that despite the change, he still considers it \u201ca professional responsibility for health and care staff, and others who work in the health and social care sectors, to be vaccinated\u201d. The government said 90% of responses to a public consultation launched last month supported the removal of the legal requirement. The consultation received more than 90,000 responses from across the health and social care sector, as well as from members of the public, Javid told MPs. He said 92% of the NHS workforce and 95% of care home staff had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 89% of home or domiciliary care staff had so far taken at least one dose. He added that the government was \u201ccommitted to working with the health and social care sectors to engage with those who are yet to make the positive choice to be vaccinated\u201d. The Guardian understands ministers are working closely with the medical royal colleges and health professional regulators to strengthen guidance on the prevention and control of infections. The decision was welcomed by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), while Unison said many staff who left care homes due to the requirement were unlikely to return to their jobs. The RCN general secretary and chief executive, Pat Cullen, said the change was the \u201cright decision\u201d, adding: \u201cHolding the threat of losing their jobs over the heads of the small minority of staff who had not been vaccinated was the wrong approach and this decision will be welcomed by those whose jobs were at risk.\u201d But she said it had come \u201ctoo late for those who have already lost their jobs\u201d. She added: \u201cMinisters must now urgently address the health and social care workforce crisis which is undermining nursing staff\u2019s ability to care safely for their patients. There are tens of thousands of nursing vacancies across those services.\u201d Gavin Edwards, the head of care at Unison, said: \u201cThere were always better ways of upping the jab rate in care. Making the vaccine mandatory meant thousands of experienced staff quit care homes. These were workers the struggling sector could ill afford to lose. \u201cMany won\u2019t go back either. They have found better paid, less stressful work elsewhere. Ministers could go some way towards making up for the distress caused by ensuring every care worker is paid at least the real living wage. That would begin to solve the current staffing crisis.\u201d \u2022 This article\u2019s headline was amended on 2 March 2022 to more accurately reflect the text."

            "content": "This is a touching if a tad treacly portrait of Ady Barkan, an inspiring American activist who has the terminal neurodegenerative disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis AKA motor neurone disease). Filmed over several years and directed by Nicholas Bruckman, it starts with Barkan, originally a lawyer, already well into his career as a protester and campaigner, particularly on issues that affect people on low incomes. When first met he seems like a loving family man, devoted to his wife Rachael, an academic, and their adorable baby son Carl. But then he\u2019s diagnosed with ALS, and naturally everything changes. The film includes a tearful, wrenching clip he shot himself in the middle of the night after he found out and couldn\u2019t sleep for worry. His health seems to deteriorate quickly \u2013 though perhaps that\u2019s partly an effect of the cinematic compression of time. Even so, as the indominable little Carl gets bigger and stronger and the Trump administration wreaks more and more havoc on the nation and the world, Barkan gradually loses the ability to walk, talk or even breathe by himself. Amazingly, that doesn\u2019t stop him from campaigning; he shifts his focus on to the threats to public healthcare and provision for people with pre-existing conditions like himself. In a famous viral clip filmed by friend and fellow activist Elizabeth Jaff, he debates the issue with Republican senator Jeff Flake on a plane. Although he doesn\u2019t manage to persuade Flake to change his vote, the encounter triggered Barkan\u2019s Be a Hero campaign which seeks, in addition to advocating for various progressive issues, to influence potentially persuadable Republicans such as Susan Collins to vote against, say, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the supreme court. The struggle ends up cornering Flake in another confrontation, this time involving Ana Maria Archila in an elevator, cheered on by Barkan. Smart, funny and endearingly sweary even when he loses the power to speak without computer assistance, Barkan is a charismatic character who\u2019s easy to like, although one wonders how much the documentary crew resisted showing anything that might dent the halo the film sets round his head. At one point, Barkan talks about his own feelings of guilt for being out on the road so much and missing his children\u2019s early years (Rachael has a second child in due course); maybe it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to probe further what price people like Barkan pay for their own heroism. \u2022 Not Going Quietly is released on 18 March in cinemas."

            "date": "2022-03-03T11:44:06Z",
            "content": "Six years ago, I was a healthy, 32-year-old lawyer at the peak of my career fighting for economic and racial justice. My wife, Rachael, and I had just brought our chubby, happy newborn home to Santa Barbara, California. We could see decades of happiness stretching out before us. And then overnight, I was handed a death sentence. I was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, which we call ALS in the US, a fatal neurological illness that destroys the nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movement. I was told I had three to four years left to live. Today I am nearly completely paralysed and am typing these words using computer technology that follows the movement of my eyes. I can no longer eat, speak, or breathe on my own, and am hooked up to a ventilator 24 hours a day. I rely on a team of caregivers that work around the clock to keep me alive. I knew that US healthcare was broken before my diagnosis, but having a serious illness clarified the cruelty of our profit-driven system. ALS is a progressive, degenerative disease that puts into perspective how time is the most valuable resource we have. And yet, so much of that early precious time was wasted on the phone with my health insurance company, navigating the infuriating bureaucracies set up to deny us care. My insurance denied me a ventilator, stating that it was experimental. Two weeks after that, they rejected access to an FDA-approved ALS drug. The years I have spent fighting for health justice since then have shown me that although my story is tragic, it is not uncommon. In 2018 the US spent 16.9% of its GDP on healthcare, nearly double what the UK spent, with significantly worse outcomes. More than 28 million Americans are uninsured, and even among those insured, many cannot afford to access their healthcare due to high out-of-pocket costs. As of June 2020, 58 million people owed more than $140bn in medical debt, with debt expected to continue to climb due to the pandemic. Eighteen million Americans struggle to pay for medically necessary prescription drugs, with one in 10 Americans skipping doses to save money. Even good health insurance, which I have, does not cover the full cost of the care I need. Paying out-of-pocket for home care would have left my family bankrupt. I am only able to afford these essential services because I successfully sued my health insurance company in federal court, and because some generous friends pay for part of my care. It shouldn\u2019t take a team of lawyers, an experienced activist, and the generosity of friends and strangers to get the healthcare you need to survive. The reliance on crowdfunding to afford healthcare is a uniquely American tragedy. Data published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that between 2010 and 2018, nearly 30% of all campaigns on the fundraising platform GoFundMe were for medical expenses, which amounts to $3.7bn dollars. Despite increasing support from the public, guaranteed healthcare has remained elusive in the US. That\u2019s because the corporations that profit from our suffering have spent dizzying amounts of money on anti-health reform campaigns and lobbying efforts to reinforce the status quo. According to reports compiled by the nonprofit consumer rights advocacy organisation, Public Citizen, since 2008, the pharmaceutical industry has spent $2.7bn on lobbying in Washington, contributing 44% to congressional Republicans and 56% to congressional Democrats. It is high time that the US joins the rest of the industrialised world to guarantee healthcare for all. The creation of the NHS was a product of visionary, postwar reforms introduced by the 1942 Beveridge report, which called for state-provided social services. Its author, the economist William Beveridge, opposed the practice of means-testing, and argued for a single-payer system, run by the government and not by insurance companies. Though the Beveridge report popularised these ideals, the NHS, established in 1948, was the result of advocacy conducted in part by doctors, agitators and elected officials over decades, led by their shared belief that healthcare should be free for all, paid for by taxes, and provided to people based on need and not an ability to pay. Healthcare is a basic human right. This fight for a more just society belongs to all of us and goes beyond borders. Being part of the movement for justice has given me purpose, a community, and the chance to nudge our society in the right direction. It\u2019s allowed me to transcend my dying body and find personal liberation. The purpose I\u2019ve found in this work is available to everyone who strives to guarantee dignity for all people. Human stories have the ability to unite people and bring new people into the movement for change. That\u2019s why I tell my story. I hope you\u2019ll join me. \u2022 Not Going Quietly, a documentary about Ady Barkan\u2019s life, will have its UK premiere at the Glasgow film festival on 9 March and open in UK cinemas on 18 March."

            "date": "2022-03-02T00:01:24Z",
            "content": "Growing numbers of Britons are paying for private medical treatment in a shift that could undermine the NHS and create a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d health system, a report has warned. Declining access to and quality of NHS care, both worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic, have begun to \u201csupercharge\u201d the trend, with one in six people prepared to go private instead of waiting. That is among the findings of a report by the left-leaning IPPR thinktank, which warns that in future getting fast, high-quality care on the NHS could become as difficult as the situation that already exists in regards to state-funded dental treatment, which has become a postcode lottery. \u201cPeople are not opting out of the NHS because they have stopped believing in it as the best and fairest model of healthcare,\u201d said Chris Thomas, the IPPR\u2019s principal research fellow and co-author of the report. \u201cRather, those who can afford it are being forced to go private by the consequences of austerity and the pandemic on NHS access and quality, and those without the funds are left to \u2018put up or shut up\u2019.\u201d The report says that unless the NHS starts performing better \u201cpeople who can and are willing to do so will supplement their entitlement to NHS care with private healthcare products\u201d. If a significant move away from public healthcare happens there will not be a sudden shift to an American-style health system. \u201cInstead \u2026 it might be comparable to dentistry in England, where poor NHS access for some, and superior but expensive access for many, has been gradually implemented and normalised since the 1950s,\u201d the report adds. \u201cWe stand at the precipice of a growing \u2018opt-out\u2019 by those who can.\u201d Such a trend could threaten the deep and widespread public support for the NHS among voters and leave millions of patients vulnerable because of their ethnicity, postcode, income or job, it says. YouGov polling for the IPPR found that 17% of people would go private if they knew they were going to have to wait longer than 18 weeks \u2013 the maximum time the NHS says anyone should have to wait before having planned hospital treatment. Another 59% would wait for NHS care \u201cbecause I cannot afford private healthcare\u201d but only 10% would do so because they are opposed to private healthcare. In the survey of 3,466 adults, the fieldwork for which was done in November 2021, YouGov found that 31% (1,095) found it hard to access healthcare during the pandemic. Of them, 12% went private and another 26% considered doing the same but ultimately did not do so. \u201cWith NHS waiting lists now at record levels, it is not surprising that more patients across the country are looking at private healthcare,\u201d said David Hare, the chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, a trade body that represents about 100 private providers across the UK. The proportion of healthcare spending from people paying for private hospital care, fertility treatment, health screening, private GP appointments and other sorts of care has risen from 0.46% in 1980 to 1.77% in 2020 \u2013 the biggest rise in the G7 \u2013 the IPPR found. The proportion of health spending emanating from those sources plus private medical insurance also rose, from 0.54% in 1980 to 2.33% in 2020. About 13% of Britons have medical insurance. Charlotte Wickens, who had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2017, paid \u00a3350 for an ultrasound scan of her neck in January after a lymph node appeared. \u201cMy GP wasn\u2019t confident on how long it would take in the community [on the NHS] but said it would likely be a while,\u201d said the 28-year-old. \u201cMy mum suggested I go private. I was seen very quickly, within a few days of being referred. And I got the positive news that it wasn\u2019t cancer again. \u201cI felt bad about going private,\u201d she added. \u201cI knew it was a privilege that not everyone would have and it felt like jumping a queue of people who were in exactly the same situation as me and needed the clarity just as much, but I could pay for it.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe have set out the biggest NHS recovery plan in history backed by unprecedented investment which \u2013 combined with record numbers of doctors and nurses working in the NHS \u2013 will reduce waiting times, give patients more control over their care, and harness technology to free up staff. \u201cThe plan will help tackle the care backlog by delivering new surgical hubs and at least 100 community diagnostic centres to help millions of patients get the surgery they need and earlier access to tests \u2013 providing an extra 9m scans, checks and procedures by 2025.\u201d"

            "content": "An alleged Islamist terrorist feigned an interest in churches and Christianity before killing the MP David Amess, a court has heard. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, denies the murder of the Southend West MP during a constituency surgery in a Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex on 15 October last year. A jury at his Old Bailey trial heard that Ali posed as a Christian who was about to move into the area in order secure a meeting with Amess. At the meeting he stabbed Sir David 21 times and waved before he was stopped by unarmed police officers, jurors were told. On Tuesday, the prosecutor, Tom Little QC, took the jury through a timeline of events leading up to the 69-year-old Tory MP\u2019s death. Little said that on 27 September, Ali, whom the jury heard was a trained radiographer, emailed Amess\u2019s office to ask about a meeting. He wrote: \u201cI will be moving to the area from a Labour-held constituency and wanted to get to know my future MP. Since I work in healthcare, I would like to know his plans, if any, for the hospital and workers. He added: \u201cAlso, as someone interested in Christianity, I have seen many churches in my area losing attendances and struggle with upkeep, eventually becoming at risk of being demolished or repurposed. I wanted to know if the situation in Southend is similar and, if so, what are the solutions.\u201d Ali concluded the email by saying: \u201cLooking forward to seeing you soon. If all appointments are taken, let me know if there\u2019s a cancellation. I\u2019ll be in the local area and will be able to drop by.\u201d Amess\u2019s assistant, Rebecca Hayton, responded to Ali\u2019s emails by requesting his address and full name to check he was a constituent. After he emailed a Southend postcode he was given an appointment on 15 October. Confirming the appointment, he said he would be brief. He emailed: \u201cI don\u2019t really know how long the appointments are but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll take too long.\u201d On Monday, Little had told the jury that Ali was a \u201cfanatical radicalised Islamist terrorist\u201d who stabbed Amess in the neck after seeing an Islamic State video on how to carry out a stabbing attack. On Tuesday, the court heard that police pieced together Ali activities before the alleged attack from hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and data from his laptop and mobile phone. The jury was told that Ali had looked up a webpage about Amess on 22 July last year and three hours later he was near the Houses of Parliament. His web history also showed searches last September relating to the housing minister Michael Gove, the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and the London MP Mike Freer, jurors heard. The jury was shown CCTV footage of Ali travelling by train from his Kentish Town home in north London to Leigh-on-Sea, wearing a long khaki jacket, a black backpack slung over his right shoulder, blue trainers and black trousers. Around the time of the alleged attack, Ali sent a message to family and friend that appeared to have been drafted days before, the court was told. In it, he said the attack was \u201cfor the sake of Allah\u201d, jurors heard. He allegedly wrote: \u201cI apologise to my family for deceiving them for so long. I would have preferred hijrah so as not to harm you, but I could not. The obligations upon me to take revenge for the blood of Muslims were too great. The shame of abiding in the very lands that carry out these horrendous acts against my brothers and sisters was too much.\u201d Ali then spent 14 minutes on the phone to his sister, ending the call when he was confronted and arrested by two plainclothes police officers arriving at the scene. The trial continues."

Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative. It\u2019s a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven\u2019t already, even as cases go down.\u201d Falling case rates in the US have triggered the relaxation of most public health measures imposed by cities, states and the federal government. There were roughly 35,000 infections on average over the past week, down sharply from mid-January when the average was closer to 800,000. According to Johns Hopkins University, the US death toll from the two-year coronavirus pandemic stood on Sunday at a little over 967,000, from nearly 79.5m cases. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 75.2% of US adults are fully vaccinated and 47.7% of the fully vaccinated have received a booster. The CDC relaxed its guidelines for indoor masking in late February, taking a more holistic approach that meant the vast majority of Americans live in areas without the recommendation for indoor masking in public. Resistance to vaccination and other public health measures against Covid is higher in Republican-run states. The Obamas have homes in Washington DC, Massachusetts and Hawaii, all with more than 70% of the eligible population considered fully protected. Last August, however, Obama was forced to drastically scale back a 60th birthday party he planned to host on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, an exclusive Massachusetts island, amid criticism for planning a large social event at a time of surging cases.

            "date": "2022-03-02T12:49:58Z",
            "content": "The Guardian offices in London and Manchester were closed to the majority of staff at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. For the Product and Engineering department as well as the wider company, this meant a rapid change in the way we worked: from the majority of colleagues working a regular week in our King\u2019s Cross headquarters to remote working at scale. Several digital tools proved vital for us \u2026 Agile development: We have a strong agile development culture at the Guardian, with a regular rhythm of different ceremonies: stand-ups, retrospectives and planning meetings. At the beginning of the pandemic, we didn\u2019t know how long the office would be closed, so we kept to our normal routines \u2013 and found new benefits in bringing people together in a structured way on a regular basis. Rupert Bates, a principal developer in our supporter revenue stream, said: \u201cOur standups became a lifeline for those working remotely, especially those living alone \u2013 my team mixed things up by rotating the host each day, and ensured we had some fun each morning\u201d. Likewise, our retrospectives were critical in ensuring we maintained the culture we have encouraged of continuous learning and improvement, and our planning meetings ensured the whole team had clarity on where we were heading and what we were focused on. Objective Key Results (OKR) framework: The product and engineering department use OKRs to measure goals and track outcomes. The quarterly schedule of planning during the pandemic was incredibly helpful, allowing teams to plan their work in collaboration with each other and identifying dependencies. This process was critical to transparency across our teams and ensured we were regularly re-evaluating our goals. Given the rapidly changing news agenda throughout 2020, many of our teams were re-prioritising product enhancements constantly \u2013 including the need for our platforms to handle new, innovative ways to tell the unfolding story of the pandemic (such as our Covid-19 data interactive). Communication across the organisation was more important than ever. Kit: Every member of the department already had their own company laptop (mainly Apple MacBook Pros and Macbook Airs). In March 2020, these laptops were taken home, and remote offices were set up around dining room tables and in bedrooms. In addition to this, to ensure home working was comfortable, monitors, chairs and other peripherals were made available to those who wanted them. Virtual tooling access: The vast majority of our tools are cloud-based, so we didn\u2019t need to be in the office to access them. For the few that are not, our VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection allowed us to access internally hosted tooling easily. Due to this, we had no lag in allowing our teams to develop and deploy products and services straight away. Tools we have built such as Riff-Raff (used to manage deployments), Janus (our AWS authentication platform), as well as third-party services and tools such as GitHub (for code version control), AWS (tools, hosting, storage etc) and Trello (workflow and organisation) were critical. Google Workspace: We use Google Workspace extensively throughout the Guardian. Google Chat, Spaces, Gmail and Meet provided the ability to communicate effectively. Products such as Docs, Slides and Sheets fueled collaboration and having these tools already in place reduced friction, allowing us to transition to working remotely with relative ease. New Workspace tools, such as Google\u2019s Jamboard helped us to run team retrospectives and brainstorming sessions. Jamboard was not a tool widely used before the pandemic but quickly became invaluable, replicating the whiteboard and Post-it note collaboration of the physical world. What\u2019s next? The pandemic quickly highlighted tools and services which could be modernised. We were fortunate that most of the tools to empower product development were already in a good place \u2013 but there is still work to be done. Within our editorial tools workstream, we have numerous tools which allow our editorial colleagues to publish. There are certainly opportunities to amalgamate and rationalise some of these systems, which involves technical and cultural change. The pandemic has taught us so much about how we deliver software and organise ourselves \u2013 and it\u2019s unquestionable that the cultural changes around remote working are seismic. At the Guardian, we have committed to hybrid working.

I remain concerned about both Covid-19 and our frequently non-evidence-based responses to it.

I always look for questioning scholars, like Prof Sridhar, to improve on them. However, I fear that isolating single sentences out of context, distorting the meaning of others and using misleading slogans (eg \u201cCovid-as-flu\u201d) can\u2019t promote scientific precision or help society. I celebrate the scientific progress made since 2020. I wasn\u2019t \u201ccynical\u201d about vaccines and treatments, but elated to see effective interventions developed faster than most scientists expected. We should promote their evidence-based use. However, my ignorance on many matters still remains large. Both before and during the pandemic, I have repeatedly discussed my own mistakes.

            "content": "People living in the UK\u2019s most deprived areas are more likely to be infected with Covid-19, but research suggests this relationship is a two-way street: becoming infected also increases people\u2019s risk of economic hardship, particularly if they develop long Covid. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that Covid has an impact on people\u2019s ability to meet their basic household requirements \u2013 something that is only going to be exacerbated by the cost of living crisis which is happening at the same time,\u201d said Adrian Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), who supervised the research. The findings have boosted calls for ministers to do more to support the growing number of working-age adults affected by the condition, which is also known as post-acute Covid syndrome (Pacs). \u201cMany long-haulers have lost their jobs, and in some instances their partners have Pacs, so two salaries have been lost,\u201d said Louise Barnes, founder of the Pacs19 support group. \u201cWhilst many have been able to get PIP [personal independence] payments, some haven\u2019t, and are no longer being supported by their employers. They are facing a financial nightmare and need financial support.\u201d According to the Office for National Statistics, about 1.3 million people, or 2% of the UK population, are living with long Covid. Those between 35 and 69 years of age are at greatest risk, and experts have expressed concerns about the impact of so many working-age people suffering from long-term symptoms and disability. To investigate the economic consequences of the illness, Martineau and colleagues analysed data from 16,910 Britons aged 16 years or over who completed monthly questionnaires about their health and household income between May 2020 and October 2021. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that testing positive for Covid was associated with a 39% increase in the odds of people reporting inadequate income to meet their basic needs, and a fivefold increase in the number of people reporting long-term term sickness absence from work, compared with those who didn\u2019t become infected. The associations were strongest where catching Covid led to hospitalisation or the development of persistent symptoms, supporting the idea that Covid was the cause of people\u2019s financial hardship. Anne Williamson, a health economist at QMUL\u2019s Blizard Institute who led the research, said: \u201cThe vicious cycle of poor health and poverty that we identify should lead policymakers to consider early, decisive interventions to break this downward spiral \u2013 including employment advice and other economic support, as well as healthcare follow-up.\u201d In January, MPs on the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus called on the government to recognise Covid-19 as an occupational disease \u2013 a move that could help to standardise support and care for those affected, and improve data collection on the problem across the country. The MPs also urged ministers to set up a compensation scheme for key workers who have suffered financially through loss of work. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, who is also chair of the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus, said: \u201cAs has been the case throughout this pandemic, the greatest burdens have fallen disproportionately on lower income and frontline workers, and we\u2019ve heard first hand how the debilitating symptoms of long Covid can impact a person\u2019s ability to work. \u201cThe ONS estimates that long Covid is impacting almost 1.3 million people in the UK and yet, the government have their heads firmly in the sand about the impact this will have on our economy and essential services. \u201cThey must urgently increase resources for research into treatment and provide compensation to the frontline workers who have sacrificed their health and wealth protecting this country.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-30T09:00:03Z",
            "content": "Three years ago, Ricardo Capuano, 32, didn\u2019t know how much a gram of marijuana cost. Now, after years of lockdown and an extended period of overwhelming anxiety, he has become something of a weed connoisseur. Capuano was never a stoner; sure, he dabbled in high school, but beer and mezcal were always his \u201cweapon of choice\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until the summer of 2020, in the pits of Covid despair, that he found himself reformed as a proud, regular toker. In fact, Capuano found himself actually proselytizing about the splendor of cannabis to his friends during their weekly online poker games. \u201cI was starting to become an advocate,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to interact with that many people,\u201d continues Capuano, who recently became engaged to his girlfriend of five years and moved from Mexico City to Houston to facilitate a career pivot. \u201cI was cooking and doing dishes, I was sitting and waiting for time to pass. Weed is enjoyable when you\u2019re doing those activities.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t see my parents or my friends,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut we did see our dealer quite often.\u201d The Covid-19 nightmare sparked a number of shake-ups to the social order \u2013 a burgeoning anti-work movement, a sharp economic swoon, and tiresome new polarities in the culture war. But as lockdown orders marched on, many weed agnostics dived in to the community with gusto, forming a new cohort of pandemic-era stoners. According to the data analytics firm Headset, legal marijuana sales increased by 120% in 2020, and 61% in 2021, and Fortune reported that Americans bought $18bn worth of cannabis in our first coronavirus year, $7bn more compared with 2019 transactional figures. There are multiple factors at play here: cannabis is increasingly accessible, with 37 states that have medical marijuana laws on the books in addition to 18 states that allow recreational use. The trend also coincides with a gradual de-stigmatization of the drug in the general populace. But clearly, something about the Covid experience sparked a cannabis renaissance in previously weed-neutral households. Overnight, in quarantined dwellings across the land, it seemed that many people were lighting up. \u201cCovid upended people\u2019s social habits. There were these surveys that college students were smoking more and drinking less. Since we don\u2019t have sanctioned places built for public consumption of marijuana, it\u2019s something that people often do in the house,\u201d says Katharine Neill Harris, a professor who studies drug policy at Rice University. \u201cI\u2019ve also seen some surveys that use has gone up in correlation with reported mental health issues. People are using it as a self-medicating thing. Those are some of the trends that we\u2019re seeing.\u201d Harris notes that there are a lot of different ways to consume cannabis in 2022. The stoner\u2019s toolbox \u2013 bongs, pipes, rolling papers \u2013 have been made ancillary in Canada or states like Colorado and California, where a sealed pack of THC gummies can be bought in broad daylight, over the counter. Harris speculates that edibles may have served as an easy entry point for the fresh pandemic stoners, which is certainly true for a 35-year-old in Toronto named Andrew Evans. He tells me that he had spent maybe $10 total on weed in his life before Covid, but now says a minor dosage has become a near-daily sacrament. The legalization efforts north of the border sanded away any apprehensions Evans had about having a bad experience; he always knew he was getting whatever was printed on the labels, which offered far more chemical transparency than a mysterious tray of homemade weed brownies. We all spent lockdown willing to try anything \u2013 anything \u2013 to feel better. What\u2019s a better time to experiment? \u201cI started dabbling with low doses, found I liked how it turned down the volume knob on my bad brain, and ramped up from there. By Christmas, I was absolutely a weed person, as I started pushing gummies on my 60-something parents,\u201d he says. \u201cWeed has significantly improved my quality of life, in a remarkably short period of time. Mentally and physically, I\u2019m in a way better place, aside from a marked increase in chip consumption.\u201d Evans says he drinks much less than he did before the pandemic, which he believes is both a symptom of extended isolation and the acute afternoon-destroying hangovers that heavy drinkers forced to contend with in their 30s and beyond. \u201cEventually the charm of drinking three local IPAs and falling asleep watching Superstore just wore off,\u201d he says. Evans\u2019 observation bears truth in the data; an increasing number of people are abstaining from alcohol, which Sarah*, a 38-year-old civil engineer and mother of three in Austin, believes is a rebound effect from early-pandemic debauchery. \u201cI think a lot of people started drinking more [during isolation] and then perhaps tried to balance that with weed for health reasons,\u201d she says. Sarah also became a daily smoker after Covid struck the country. \u201cI feel it helps me engage with the kids when I\u2019m tired. Play games, watch kid movies, and so on.\u201d Nobody knows if the pandemic stoners will keep up the habit as the world mercifully starts to turn on its axis again. Amid all these readily available vaccines, and a hopeful respite from the Omicron wave, it is no longer taboo for Ricardo Capuano to book a long, wine-soaked dinner with friends. This is a tenuous reality \u2013 we\u2019ve all learned to never underestimate Covid \u2013 but Capuano says that he no longer needs a drug to help him cope, and therefore, a newly minted weed adherent is already trying to cut down on a pattern he picked up in lockdown. \u201cIn the same way I found out that I wasn\u2019t really drinking, I found out that I was smoking every day. I\u2019m no longer sitting on my ass, waiting for this to be over. I need to get on with my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI still smoke, but now I reserve it for special occasions. And what\u2019s a special occasion? Well, that\u2019s open for interpretation.\u201d * Name has been changed"

            "date": "2022-03-18T06:20:12Z",
            "content": "Visitor numbers at Britain\u2019s museums, galleries, zoos, castles and country houses increased by 25% last year, but are still down 57% on pre-pandemic levels. Unsurprisingly, figures published on Friday showed striking rises over the year at outdoor attractions. However, those that rely mainly on overseas visitors have yet to claw back pre-2019 numbers. The Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA) said its sites had a total of 67.8m visits in 2021, up from 45.4m the previous year, but still significantly down on 2019\u2019s 156.6m. The most-visited attraction was Windsor Great Park, which drew 5.4m visitors \u2013 the first time the list was not topped by a London attraction. In second place was the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, which saw a 61% increase in visitors to 1.9m. Chester Zoo, normally the most-visited attraction in England outside London, was in third place. Other outdoor sites in the top 20 included RHS Garden Wisley, Jeskyns community woodland in Kent, Moors Valley country park in Dorset, Longleat in Wiltshire and London Zoo. Overall, sites that are primarily outdoors saw just 17% fewer visitors in 2021 than two years before. Mixed sites such as cathedrals recorded a decline of approximately 51%, and predominantly indoor sites such as museums and galleries saw numbers fall 73% from pre-pandemic levels. The most-visited indoor attraction in the UK was the Natural History Museum, which was in fourth place overall with a 21% increase to 1.5m visits, while the British Museum came sixth, with a 4% increase in visitors. Tate Modern, Britain\u2019s most visited attraction before the pandemic, fell to seventh place after a 19% fall in its annual total, though daily visitor numbers were 60% higher in 2021 than after reopening in 2020. Somerset House, which has some cultural activities in its open-air neoclassical courtyard, bucked the trend with a 36% increase, rising two places to eighth. Sites that provided a figure reported that just 4% of admissions in the past year were from overseas visitors. Bernard Donoghue, director of ALVA, said the figures showed that tourism was \u201chit first and hit hardest\u201d by Covid-19. \u201cA huge spectrum of those attractions, mostly outdoors, are recovering well, but many, mostly those which are usually heavily dependent on overseas visitors, are still just surviving.\u201d According to Donoghue, overseas visitor numbers are not likely to reach pre-pandemic levels until 2024: \u201cFor many of our most iconic attractions, this means not getting back to financial resilience four or five years after having first closed their doors.\u201d He called on the government to reverse its ruling that EU school and youth groups need passports rather than ID cards to travel to the UK. \u201cThis has meant that the school and youth market from the EU has suffered considerably.\u201d He added that the decision to end tax-free shopping should also be overturned: \u201cIt is making the UK uncompetitive in the highly lucrative retail tourism market, and the reduced level of VAT for accommodation and attractions should be retained for at least the next financial year.\u201d Since 2020, attractions in Scotland have seen a 45% increase in visitors, while London saw the weakest year-on-year rise, with visits up just 17%, compared with 26% for other areas of England. Sites in London were closed for an average of 148 days in 2021. The most-visited Scottish attraction was the National Museum of Scotland (in 20th place overall), followed by Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. ALVA said one of the highlights of 2022 would be the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee, with three special displays marking significant occasions in the queen\u2019s reign staged at the royal residences."

            "title": "How should the world respond to the next pandemic?",
            "date": "2022-03-18T12:22:05Z",
            "content": "Last November, having alerted the world to the new and highly transmissible Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, South Africa-based scientist Tulio de Oliveira saw that country hit with travel bans. Already smarting at what he saw as wealthier nations\u2019 hoarding of vaccines, antiviral drugs and test reagents, his frustration spilled over. \u201cIf the world keeps punishing Africa for the discovery of Omicron and \u2018global health scientists\u2019 keep taking the data, who will share early data again?\u201d he tweeted. Two years into this pandemic, as the World Health Organization (WHO) mulls the tricky question of when to call it over and some countries, including the UK, pre-empt that decision, the world\u2019s attention is turning to the future. How do we improve our response to the next pandemic? There are two main challenges: improving the surveillance of pathogens; and ensuring vaccine equity. And as De Oliveira intimated, these are linked. Not only morally, but for the first time in pandemic history, legally. Do we need a pandemic treaty? It used to be that living organisms, including pathogens, were considered humanity\u2019s common heritage, and sharing them for scientific purposes happened informally. That changed with the UN\u2019s 1992 convention on biological diversity (CBD), which states that countries have sovereign rights over genetic resources found on their territory. Under an annex to that convention, the Nagoya protocol, the host country can set terms for accessing those resources and for ensuring the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from them. Covid-19 is the first pandemic since Nagoya entered into force in 2014, but the spirit of the protocol has not been respected. Starting with China in January 2020, countries have shared Sars-CoV-2-related data freely, demanding nothing in return. That data has driven revolutions in vaccinology, pathogen sequencing and data collection. But the fruits of those revolutions have not been shared equitably. Just 14% of people in low-income countries have received at least one vaccine dose, compared with about 80% in high- and upper middle-income countries. The WHO is now proposing several separate initiatives to improve surveillance, including two Europe-based hubs for the international sharing of pathogen data and samples. But these proposals, too, effectively ignore Nagoya. The WHO expects countries to contribute to the hubs for the common good, possibly even on pain of sanctions. Though it has been vocal about the need for vaccine equity, none of the current proposals explicitly address benefit-sharing. \u201cWe\u2019re treating pathogen-sharing as a common good, but we\u2019re not treating vaccines and medical countermeasures as a common good,\u201d sayslegal scholar Mark Eccleston-Turner of King\u2019s College London. Eccleston-Turner says human pathogens should be excluded from Nagoya and vaccines should be similarly reclassified. Practically, he suggests, this might be enshrined in a pandemic treaty the WHO is working on, that could apportion intellectual property (IP) rights according to the ratio of public-private investment in vaccine development. The three or four leading coronavirus vaccines all took a different route to market, but one thing they have in common, according to IP law specialist Luke McDonagh of the London School of Economics, is that the public bore most of the risk and the drug companies maintained most of the IP. More of the IP should stay in the public domain, he says, reflecting taxpayers\u2019 investment. McDonagh points to research showing private-sector claims that reducing their IP dominance would dilute innovation do not hold up, and gives the example of antiretroviral drugs for HIV \u2013 the subject of an earlier IP battle. \u201cThe fact of generic production in the global south has not affected incentives for HIV research in the rich countries,\u201d he says. But changing the status quo via a new treaty may not be easy without government backing, he admits, and the UK and EU are among those whose current stance on patents suggests they might oppose it. Sharing knowhow and building up vaccine manufacturing capacity globally are also vital for achieving vaccine equity, he says, and the WHO is promoting both. \u2018Sharing is in everyone\u2019s interests\u2019 There may be a radically different solution: leave pathogens in Nagoya and respect its insistence on equitable benefit-sharing. There is a precedent, says Edward Hammond, a Texas-based consultant who has advised low- and middle-income countries on the implications of Nagoya. He points to a successful implementation of Nagoya in the WHO\u2019s own pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP) framework. Through PIP, WHO member states share samples of flu viruses that have human pandemic potential, and the WHO receives a share of the benefits. \u201cIt has generated over $250m [\u00a3190m] in cash payments from vaccine [and other] companies,\u201d Hammond says. Some have said applying Nagoya to pathogens would at best create delays in sharing and at worst give control to bad actors. \u201cIn the event of another pandemic, some country might assert its \u2018rights\u2019 over virus samples, keeping the rest of the world in the dark,\u201d Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, wrote in a blog post at Stat last November. It is not just drug companies expressing that view. It is shared by some in public health. Three years ago, Vasee Moorthy, a senior science adviser at the WHO, worked on a study into the impact of Nagoya on public health. \u201cCertain people were worried that there might be delays, but we haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Moorthy says. If anything, the study found that the protocol encourages pathogen-sharing by building trust that benefits will be fairly shared. As Moorthy says: \u201cSharing is in everyone\u2019s interests.\u201d De Oliveira agrees. With its history of fighting HIV, he says, South Africa would never withhold crucial data whose rapid release it knows could potentially save millions of lives, \u201cbut unfortunately not every country has this long-term experience or transparent government and they might withhold\u201d. To avoid that, he says, containment measures including travel bans should be balanced by financial or other support. Nagoya is not perfect, Hammond admits. For one thing, it only covers physical samples, not the digital sequence data that is increasingly all that is needed to make vaccines, tests and drugs \u2013 though he and others are lobbying to change that. But it does embrace the spirit of the era, with its accent on reciprocity. It allows for multilateral benefit sharing, as befits a pandemic. It could, he feels, have prevented or at least mitigated vaccine nationalism. And PIP could provide the model for a better instrument that covers many pathogens, including the one that causes the next pandemic."

            "content": "More than 51,000 people joined the ranks of the \u201cultra-wealthy\u201d last year as the fortunes of the already very rich benefited from rising global stock markets and increased property prices during the pandemic. The number of ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) \u2013 those with assets of more than $30m (\u00a322.4m) \u2013 rose by a record 9.3% last year to 610,569, according to a report by the property consultants Knight Frank. \u201cBy any of the measures that we track, whether luxury property prices, UHNWI populations or even private jet traffic, 2021 was a good year for those lucky enough to be the owners of property or other tangible assets,\u201d said Rory Penn, the head of Knight Frank\u2019s private office, through which he advises ultra-rich clients across the world. \u201cNotwithstanding uncertain times, we have still seen substantial wealth creation globally with the number of people with net wealth of US$30m or more increasing by almost 10% last year.\u201d The number of ultra rich people in the UK increased by 11% to 25,771 \u2013 more people than could fit in the football stadiums of Watford, Burnley or Brentford. The number of Britons with assets of more than $30m has doubled since 2016, and Knight Frank predicts the total will rise to more than 32,000 by 2026. There are more than 3 million people in the UK classed as dollar \u00a1millionaires (\u00a3750,000), a 54% increase on five years ago. The UK had the second-fastest rate of growth of ultra-rich people behind the US, where the number increased by 13% to 210,353. The ranks of the wealthy grew on every continent except Africa, where 17 people fell off the list, taking the total to 2,240. Monaco stood out as the country with the most super-rich people per capita, with 199 people holding assets of $30m or more out of a population of just 39,000 \u2013 which works out as five people in every thousand. Just under seven in 10 people living in Monaco are dollar millionaires. Monaco is home to several rich Britons, including the former Topshop boss Sir Philip Green and his wife, Tina; billionaire Brexit backer and petrochemicals tycoon Sir James Ratcliffe, property billionaires Simon and David Reuben; John Hargreaves, the founder and chairman of Matalan; John Caudwell, the billionaire founder of Phones4u; and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton. Knight Frank\u2019s report shows that on average the ultra-wealthy hold just under two-thirds of their wealth in property. Unsurprisingly, the most expensive property is found in Monaco, where homebuyers would need to spend at least $34m to join the top 1% of most expensive properties. A million dollars buys just 14.6sq m of residential space in the Mediterranean principality, compared with 30.6sq m in London, or 256 sq m in Sa\u0303o Paulo. Conscious of the lack of space available to attract more billionaires to Monaco, Prince Albert II, the reigning monarch, is overseeing a $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) scheme to reclaim six hectares (15 acres) of land from the sea. The sovereign city-state \u2013 which is only slightly bigger than Regent\u2019s Park in London \u2013 said it was embarking on the \u201coffshore urban extension project\u201d because it had run out of space for those seeking the \u201cfiscal advantages\u201d the tax haven offers. The reclaimed land will allow the creation of 120 luxury homes selling for more than $100,000 per sq metre \u2013 more expensive than One Hyde Park in London and 15 Central Park West in Manhattan. On average ultra-rich people own 2.9 homes, according to Knight Frank\u2019s survey of private bankers and wealth advisers."

Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute has recorded a total of 262,593 confirmed new cases and 269 new deaths over the past 24 hours. Experts say the true number of cases could be even higher as testing facilities have reached full capacity and those who test positive with a lateral flow test are no longer required to carry out a PCR test that would show up in the statistics. The number of people on German intensive care wards with Covid is rising but the rate of people dying of the virus is considerably lower than during the 2020-21 winter wave. Rising infections in Germany are likely to be still driven by the Omicron variant and especially its \u201cstealth\u201d subvariant, BA.2, which made up almost half of all recorded cases last week. Less than 1% of infections are now due to the Delta variant. In neighbouring France, which is also recording a month-on-month rise of infection rates, the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said on Wednesday the current rebound should peak by the end of the month. V\u00e9ran defended France\u2019s decision to lift most restrictions put in place to contain the pandemic as of this Monday. In Germany, the current set of Covid restrictions expires on 19 March and will be replaced with a more light-touch set of rules, seen as a compromise deal between the centre-left Social Democrats of the health minister, Karl Lauterbach, and the pro-business Free Democratic Party of justice minister Marco Buschmann. Mask-wearing will remain obligatory on public transport, hospitals and care homes but not in shops, restaurants and schools. The government is retaining an option to tighten rules \u2013 including by restricting access to nonessential shops to the unvaccinated \u2013 in hotspots experiencing dramatic surges of the virus. Some German states, including Berlin, Brandenburg and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, have extended the current set of rules until the end of this month. \u201cWe are still some time off a \u2018freedom day\u2019,\u201d said Berlin\u2019s mayor, Franziska Giffey, on Tuesday. From 1 April, the German capital is likely to end not just to most Covid-related restrictions but also free lateral flow testing options currently provided at various venues. \u201cWe should be prepared to see fewer test centres in the city,\u201d Giffey told the broadcaster RBB."

            "date": "2022-03-08T21:05:40Z",
            "content": "Health experts have widely denounced Florida\u2019s decision to recommend against Covid-19 vaccinations for children, describing it as \u201cirresponsible\u201d, \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d. In a pronouncement which stunned experts on Monday, Florida\u2019s controversial surgeon general Dr Joseph Ladapo said the state would be the first to \u201crecommend against\u201d Covid-19 vaccination for \u201chealthy children\u201d. The move followed two recent Covid-19 surges in which pediatric hospitalization was believed to be higher because of low vaccination rates among children. \u201cIt\u2019s very generous to call it a recommendation, because recommendations come with supporting evidence and transparency,\u201d said Saad B Omer, director of the Yale Institute of Global Health and professor of medicine in infectious diseases. \u201cTrying to interpret that is trying to create a GPS map from a dream. You don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from, what is the scientific rationale, if any,\u201d said Omer. The announcement is \u201cirresponsible \u2026 it is inappropriate and it is dangerous\u201d, he said. Ladapo made the announcement on Monday at the end of a roundtable discussion hosted by Republican governor Ron DeSantis, saying: \u201cThe Florida department of health is going to be the first state to officially recommend against the Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children.\u201d The state has not yet released a formal policy to describe exactly who would be included in the designation \u201chealthy children\u201d. The move goes against accepted advice from federal health authorities and a large majority of independent experts, who recommend vaccines as a powerful tool to protect children from the worst outcomes of Covid-19. The roundtable came as Covid-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant fall and federal health authorities seek to wind down pandemic prevention measures such as masking and social distancing. Although children face much lower risks from Covid-19 than older adults, \u201cthere is a small minority who don\u2019t do well with the infection and recent CDC data showed vaccines prevent half of urgent care and hospital visits,\u201d said Dr Kawsar Talaat, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cOur kids have lost a lot during the pandemic, and vaccines are one thing we can do to help give them a sense of normalcy.\u201d The Delta and Omicron Covid waves brought record-high levels of pediatric hospitalizations. These variants were not believed to be more dangerous to children. Instead, experts believe more children were hospitalized because they have low vaccination rates relative to the rest of the US population. \u201cCovid-19 is in the top 10 causes of deaths for every age group. That\u2019s why we\u2019re recommending the vaccines for everyone ages five and older,\u201d said Noel Brewer, a behavioral scientist and professor at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Public Health. \u201cNo one needs these folks in Florida establishing policies around vaccines \u2013 they simply lack the expertise to do this well,\u201d said Brewer, who is also a member of the Lancet Commission on Vaccine Refusal, Acceptance, and Demand in the US. \u201cPeople deliberately sowing doubt about Covid-19 vaccines undermines confidence and uptake in the vaccine,\u201d said Brewer. \u201cOne of the clear effects of anti-vaccine propaganda is it harms the public. This announcement by the state of Florida is not helping anything. It will not save lives \u2013 in fact, it will cause more people to die.\u201d Nationally, just 26% of children aged five to 11 and 57% of adolescents aged 12-17 are fully vaccinated. Comparatively, 65% of the US population is vaccinated. In Florida, 66% of people are vaccinated, though coverage varies widely throughout the state. The FDA authorized vaccines for adolescents in spring 2021 and for young children in the fall. In January, the FDA also authorized a booster dose for adolescents aged 12-15. The CDC has also recommended vaccines for these age groups, as independent expert advisory panels to both the FDA and CDC. Children younger than five are not eligible for a vaccine. \u201cThis has been looked at independently by four groups of experts and for a very good reason, because during this Delta and Omicron wave we\u2019ve seen unprecedented numbers of pediatric hospitalization,\u201d said Dr Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine. Hotez is also developing a low-cost Covid vaccine. DeSantis has attacked Covid-19 prevention measures throughout the two years of the pandemic. At the same time, regular Floridians have suffered greatly. More than 71,000 people have died in the state, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or 332 people for every 100,000 residents, far above the national average of 287 deaths per 100,000. By another metric, Florida would have the worst death rate in the world if it were a country. Hotez said many experts believe another wave of Covid, perhaps caused by a new variant, could hit the south and Florida this summer, \u201cjust like it did in 2020 and 2021\u201d. Covid-19 \u201cis a highly preventable death at this point,\u201d said Talaat. \u201cAlmost nobody should be dying of Covid, especially over the last year and yet we\u2019re almost at 1 million deaths in the US.\u201d This story was amended to correct a misspelling of the name of Florida\u2019s surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo."

            "date": "2022-03-06T10:00:49Z",
            "content": "Tyler Hollinger, owner of Festiv\u00e1l Cafe, a \u201cfarm-to-bar cocktail cafe\u201d in New York City, said he recently started learning Brazilian jiu-jitsu because of physical altercations with visitors who are unvaccinated against Covid-19. The reason for the fights isn\u2019t that Hollinger is a crusader for the city\u2019s requirement that people show proof of vaccination to sit inside at bars and restaurants. In fact, Hollinger, who is vaccinated and boosted, has opposed the mandate since it was announced in August and now welcomes the plan to lift it. The city \u201ccould have denied people access to the [Metropolitan Transportation Authority], buses and subways for not being vaccinated, but instead they put the burden on small businesses \u2026 which directly harms our bottom line and only helps the city\u201d, said Hollinger, who opened his restaurant in September 2020, meaning it has only existed during the pandemic. As New York City and other government entities begin to lift vaccination requirements, many in the hospitality industry say they welcome the moves and think they will help restaurants and bars. \u201cWe need to be smart and safe but continue to live our lives, and we can\u2019t continue such strict mandates indefinitely when there isn\u2019t as strong a justification for them anymore,\u201d said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance. But at the same time some experts worry that lifting the restrictions too soon or too fully presents a serious health risk. After all, the pandemic is not over, there are still millions of vulnerable Americans who are unvaccinated and a new variant could rapidly arise at almost any time. In New York, which has been buffeted by the virus more than perhaps any other American city, all those tensions are playing out. When then New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced workers and patrons would need to show proof of vaccination at indoor dining, gyms and entertainment venues, he said, \u201cIf you want to participate in our society fully, you\u2019ve got to get vaccinated.\u201d Since then, Covid case, hospitalization and death numbers that spiked during the Omicron wave and have plummeted. Mayor Eric Adams announced on 27 February that the city would lift the requirements on 7 March if Covid indicators remained low. New York has already in recent weeks seen a significant increase in the number of people booking hotels, and the lifting of the mandate will help that trend, said Chris Heywood, a spokesman for NYC &amp; Company, the city\u2019s tourism agency. More than 60% of the city\u2019s hotel rooms were occupied the week ending 26 February, which was an almost 20% increase from a month earlier, but still significantly below the 90% occupancy rate reached in 2019, according to the hotel-analytics firm STR. \u201cI think there is an industry-wide effort to get us back to a sense of normalcy, to lift any unnecessary restrictions because that will signal to people that it\u2019s time to return to normalcy, that the country is open for business and that it\u2019s OK to travel now,\u201d said Heywood. But Dr Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center, continues to worry about a new variant emerging that catches people by surprise like Omicron did. By waiting another month or two to lift restrictions such as the vaccine mandate, he said, we would gain \u201cperhaps more time to get more people vaccinated in other parts of the world, which would reduce the evolution of new variants\u201d. \u201cI personally would like to see us continue\u201d the proof of vaccination requirement, \u201cbut I realize how hard it is to really enforce that, how much pushback there has been\u201d, said Morse. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that it has become so politicized.\u201d Dr Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiologist at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, said she is \u201cbaffled\u201d by the decision to lift the mandate. People in bars and restaurants are often close together \u201cand obviously it\u2019s a setting where people cannot wear a mask since they are eating and drinking\u201d, El-Sadr said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an onerous requirement and as people are moving around and mixing and coming from other parts of the country, it makes the requirement for vaccination become more important.\u201d But Rigie points to the fact that New York was one of a handful of cities that implemented such a requirement \u2013 and that other American cities have also dropped their restrictions. San Francisco still has a proof of vaccine mandate. Even once the city lifts the mandates, some restaurateurs have said they still plan to ask guests for proof of vaccination to dine indoors. \u201cI think individual businesses will have to make decisions that work for themselves, their employees and their customers,\u201d Rigie said. Jeremy Wladis, president of The Restaurant Group, which operates a number of eateries on the Upper West Side, said he and his partners considered continuing to check people\u2019s vaccination status once the requirement is lifted but decided against it because of concerns that some people\u2019s response may be, \u201cHey, it\u2019s over. Stop bothering me.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be more people coming in than we have had in a couple years,\u201d said Wladis, who owns restaurants such as Nina\u2019s Great Burrito Bar and Harvest Kitchen. \u201cThere is no way to please everybody all the time.\u201d Even once the city lifts the requirement, Hollinger, the Festiv\u00e1l Cafe owner, said that will not solve all his problems at the restaurant. He said it\u2019s been hurt by the increase in crime and the number of people experiencing homelessness that has occurred during the pandemic. But if more people return to bars and restaurants, \u201cthere is no crime because there are too many people watching\u201d, said Hollinger. I hope \u201cthere is going to be a resurgence this spring and summer where people feel safe to go out and party, to have fun \u2026 That\u2019s the whole reason people live in New York City, is because of the world class food and drinks.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-16T07:49:13Z",
            "content": "Global powers have inched closer to an agreement to waive patents for Covid-19 vaccines, a move that would allow for cheaper generic versions to be manufactured and distributed among developing nations faster. A leaked document, seen by the Guardian, reveals details of a compromise struck between the United States, the European Union, India and South Africa that would end a deadlock over an intellectual property waiver, 18 months after the proposal was first taken to the World Trade Organization. The document detailing the compromise position suggests the negotiated form of the waiver has veered substantially away from the initial proposal first raised by India and South Africa in October 2020, which sought to suspend patents for successful Covid vaccines, treatments and diagnostics \u2013 invented by pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer and Moderna \u2013 for the duration of the pandemic. The document details a tentative proposal that would still need final agreement from the four negotiators, as well as from all WTO member nations, to be passed. If passed, the compromised version of the waiver will see only patents for Covid-19 vaccines suspended for either three or five years, and means that treatment and testing formulas will still be subject to intellectual property protections. It would only apply to developing WTO member countries that exported less than 10% of world exports of Covid-19 vaccine doses in 2021, and for those countries would include ingredients and processes necessary for the vaccines\u2019 manufacturing. Additionally, it does not cover technology transfer and trade secrets \u2013 something that human rights and development advocates believe will slow down developing nations\u2019 vaccine production. The leaked draft of the agreement states that, if passed at the WTO, member nations will discuss extending the intellectual property waiver to testing and treatment technologies in six months\u2019 time. Because of the WTO\u2019s consensus-based system, as opposed to a majority voting system, one dissenting vote can bring down a proposal. More than 100 mostly lower and middle income nations initially supported the proposal put by India and South Africa. The EU has been one of the last holdouts not to back the plan, while the US shifted its position in May to support waiving patents for vaccines only. Several wealthier nations that had not earlier expressed support for the waiver, including New Zealand and Australia, followed the US shift. Earlier, the US Trade Representative Office spokesperson, Adam Hodge, said that informal discussions between the US, EU, India and South Africa had led to the compromise. \u201cThe difficult and protracted process has resulted in a compromise outcome that offers the most promising path toward achieving a concrete and meaningful outcome,\u201d Hodge said. Human rights groups have cautiously welcomed news of the compromise but have expressed disappointment that the negotiated position does not include treatments and diagnostic technologies. Australian Fair Trade &amp; Investment Network convener, Dr Patricia Ranald, welcomed \u201cthe admission that WTO rules need to change\u201d. \u201cBut these are baby steps which still protect the interests of pharmaceutical companies rather than saving lives. Three million have died since the Omicron variant, and millions more will die unless the Australian and other governments insist on a full waiver for vaccines, tests and treatments,\u201d Ranald said. Amnesty International Australia\u2019s Ry Atkinson said \u201cthis compromise is an acknowledgment that business as usual isn\u2019t going to get us out of this crisis\u201d. However, Atkinson said \u201cthe reality is that it [the negotiated proposal] doesn\u2019t go far enough\u201d. \u201cWe need a waiver that includes technology transfers and treatments, as the co-sponsors of the original waiver intended. Governments advocating for anything less are selling the world short,\u201d he said. Last week, an open letter signed by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the actor Charlize Theron and the former British prime minister Gordon Brown singled out the UK, EU and Switzerland for continuing to block the waiver on lifting intellectual property rules. About 4% of people in low-income countries have had two vaccine doses, according to Amnesty International. The World Health Organization director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has previously labelled vaccine licensing rules and distribution limits a \u201ccatastrophic moral failure\u201d. Several pharmaceutical companies across the world which have expressed an interest in making Covid-19 vaccines have cited production permission as a barrier."

            "date": "2022-03-23T01:05:50Z",
            "content": "New Zealand will do away with vaccine passes and vaccine mandates for some of the workforce in early April, in a major loosening of the country\u2019s tough Covid-19 restrictions. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced the changes on Wednesday morning, citing high vaccination rates, better data to identify which environments are high risk, and modelling that suggests the country\u2019s Omicron outbreak would peak in early April. The country reported 20,087 new cases on Wednesday, 960 people in hospital and a further 11 deaths, bringing the total number of Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic to 210. New Zealand has officially recorded more than 500,000 cases of Covid-19 \u2013 nearly all of them during the Omicron wave \u2013 but modellers expect the true figure could now could be as high as 1.7 million. Modelling suggests Auckland has now reached peak cases, with numbers slowly dropping, and the rest of the country is expected to reach its peak by 5 April. \u201cWe\u2019ve been signalling for some time that when we come off the peak, that would be the time to be able to ease the use of things like vaccine passes and mandates,\u201d Ardern said. The changes include scrapping all gathering limits in outdoor settings and removing requirements for people to use the Covid-19 tracer app to scan in when entering businesses. Hospitality and other venues can increase their indoor gathering limit from 100 to 200 from Friday. From 4 April, vaccine passes will no longer be needed to get into shops and venues, and vaccine mandates will be dropped for workers in education, police and the defence force. Those working in health, corrections, aged care and at the border will still need to be vaccinated to work. Ardern said she was initially not in favour of vaccine passes and mandates, but following the Delta outbreak that lead to a three-month lockdown in Auckland, it became clear mandates were needed to boost vaccination levels required for safe reopening. The mandates were \u201cundoubtedly\u201d one of the reasons New Zealand reached a 95% vaccination rate for the eligible population and achieved the near-elimination of Delta over summer, she said. Today\u2019s decision to loosen the mandates were not because of a weeks-long protest outside parliament, \u201cbut because it was safe to do so,\u201d Ardern said. The Covid protection framework, known as the traffic-light system, will stay in place but will remain flexible to change, including if new variants of the virus emerge. Mask-use will also remain to keep vulnerable communities safe, she said. \u201cThis is not the end, but in some ways it is also a new beginning. \u201cCovid is still with us and it will be for some time to come, that\u2019s why we are keeping in place our Covid protection framework.\u201d Ardern thanked New Zealanders for the sacrifices they made in past two years and reminded the country of how far it has come since the first tough restrictions were imposed, including lockdowns, gathering limits and closing the border. \u201cThose defences were blunt, they were hard and they were always intended to be temporary. New Zealand is now known for our successful Covid response. \u201cBut while we\u2019ve been successful it has also been bloody hard. Everyone has had to give up something to make this work. Some more than others.\u201d \u2018We still have a difficult journey ahead\u2019 Leading health professionals and modellers have cautiously welcomed the announcement, saying that while vaccine passes made sense with Delta, Omicron has changed the game. \u201cVaccines are still hugely effective at preventing severe illness, but less effective at stopping people catching and spreading the virus,\u201d said Covid-19 modeller Michael Plank, from Te P\u016bnaha Matatini and the University of Canterbury. \u201cAt the same time, we now have increasing levels of infection-acquired immunity in the population. This means that allowing unvaccinated people into places like cafes and bars doesn\u2019t substantially alter the risk of catching Covid there.\u201d While Omicron may be nearing its peak, there is still \u201ca difficult journey ahead\u201d, he said. \u201cAt least as many people will be infected on the way down the mountain as on the way up, and pressure on our healthcare system is likely to remain high. Keeping mask rules is crucial to limit transmission.\u201d Immunologist Dr Dianne Sika-Paotonu from the University of Otago said vaccination inequities remain for M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples, particularly in booster uptake and for children between 5-11 years old. \u201cCare and caution is still needed especially for vulnerable communities\u201d."

            "date": "2022-03-01T16:30:17Z",
            "content": "Australian anti-vaxxer groups are awash with conspiracy theories praising Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as an attack on the \u201cdeep state\u201d, with some followers of the Covid-sceptic movement expressing admiration for Vladimir Putin. Separately, just days after the United Australia party disendorsed a candidate in Melbourne for his pro-Putin views, the party is now facing questions about another candidate apparently defending the Russian president. Sean Ambrose, a UAP Senate candidate for New South Wales, appeared to defend Putin in a tweet on Saturday, in response to another post critical of the Russian leader being a member of the World Economic Forum. The global organisation has been a key focus of online conspiracy theories, particularly those about a supposed \u201cgreat reset\u201d plot against humanity. \u201cI was initially of the same opinion but let us not forget that he [Putin] expelled the Rothschild Banking families from Russia and is now shutting down the child sex and human trafficking and the U.S. biological weapons facilities in the Ukraine,\u201d Ambrose tweeted. The Poynter Institute has debunked widespread claims on social media regarding US biological weapon facilities operating in Ukraine. The cover image on Ambrose\u2019s Twitter profile carries the slogans \u201cNo mandatory vaccinations\u201d and \u201cNo vaccine passports\u201d. He tweeted on Sunday that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, \u201cis a stooge for Klaus Schwab\u201d, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. He also wrote \u201cMedia telling lies again\u201d when retweeting a post stating that an Australian news story on the invasion had used a fake photograph of an injured Ukrainian. But the woman, Olena Kurilo, was interviewed by the Daily Mail about the attack on her home, and an image of her was widely published. Last week the UAP disendorsed its Macnamara candidate, Jefferson Earl, for his pro-Putin views, with the party leader, Craig Kelly, saying: \u201cIt is very important that the entire world is united in condemning Putin\u2019s conduct to the Ukraine.\u201d Kelly and Ambrose were contacted for comment. The UAP did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s request for comment. A global challenge Separately, and speaking generally, academics researching conspiracy movements say the harnessing of the Russian cause by some anti-vaxxer groups is a sign these groups may continue to be active after the Covid pandemic has passed, warning that the malleable belief systems of the anti-lockdown crowds may attach to other anti-government causes in future. \u201cThere\u2019s an authoritarian undertone to the organising logic, vocabulary and actions of these protest movements,\u201d said a senior research fellow at Deakin University, Dr Josh Roose. \u201cThat won\u2019t go away just because conditions might change.\u201d The messaging app Telegram, which allows users to post content in the equivalent of chatrooms or message boards, is favoured by some far-right and conspiracy groups. Telegram channels previously dedicated to anti-vaxx sentiment or organising anti-vaccine mandate protests have been flooded with content praising the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Video clips are being shared as well as comments from the former US president Donald Trump, who appeared to praise Putin\u2019s actions. Many shared memes or claims from international anti-vaxx channels, spreading baseless claims that Russia\u2019s invasion was variously about attacking US bioweapons facilities in Ukraine, that Putin was fighting the \u201cdeep state\u201d or that the US government was secretly promoting the conflict as a \u201cdistraction\u201d from domestic political issues. \u201cIs Putin really taking on the deep state to drain the swamp?\u201d asked one Australian anti-lockdown voice on his channel with 67,000 subscribers. Roose, who studies violent extremism and populist leaders, claimed some protesters viewed the issue through the same lens as Trump due to their correlating belief systems \u2013 a mistrust of authority, disdain for institutions and criticism of mainstream media. \u201cWhat struck me is the pivot of message boards into that emphasis on Ukraine, which broadly coincides with Trump calling Putin a genius,\u201d Roose told Guardian Australia. \u201cAlso, the agenda that Trump had been laying out in painting the foreign policy community, the career bureaucrats and diplomats, as part of a deep state plot. \u201cThey\u2019re taking their lead directly from Trump and his supporters in the US \u2026 it\u2019s not at the level of conspiracy, necessarily, because this is what mainstream politicians and news figures are talking about.\u201d Dr Kaz Ross, a researcher studying conspiracy movements, said a distrust of the media was driving the movements. \u201cThe deep underlying belief structure of these movements is like Qanon, in that they believe there\u2019s secret stuff going on that we don\u2019t know about and the media is lying to you, so whenever you see a simple explanation for something, that\u2019s not right,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cSo if it looks like Russia is invading because they\u2019re evil bullies, these groups would say, \u2018No, look for the counter narrative\u2019\u2026 they\u2019d say, \u2018We can see through the lies of mainstream media, so whatever they say, we have to say the opposite.\u2019\u201d Countless posts inside the groups poured scorn on media coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what is happening without an honest and fair media,\u201d one supporter of a large anti-vaccine group posted. Another said: \u201cOne way to find the truth is turn on the TV and whatever they report go with the opposite.\u201d That such conspiracy-minded groups transfer their ideology on to news events of the day is not new. But what Ross and Roose noted was the Ukraine invasion was one of the first times the anti-lockdown or Covid-sceptic movement \u2013 a broad church variously consisting of anti-vaxxers, sovereign citizens, evangelicals, civil libertarians, members of the far right and anti-government groups \u2013 had pivoted strongly to a topic outside of Covid. Roose and Ross said it suggested the groups may have longevity beyond the pandemic. \u201cPeople think the groups will settle down when Covid returns to normal, but this Putin issue shows the movement still has life in it,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWho knows where it goes? \u201cSome people have made it their identity, they\u2019ve made it their life to be a \u2018freedom fighter\u2019.\u201d Roose suggested the groups would be fertile ground for cultivation by far-right populist politicians or movements. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll go away,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fluidity and diversity of the movement, common emotional and political strands of a deep sense of anxiety about the future. \u201cSome will go back to work after Covid, but there\u2019s that sense of alienation and disenfranchisement. That deep distrust of government, science and politicians doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d"

            "content": "Schools and teachers are \u201cbuckling under the strain\u201d of supporting the fast-growing number of schoolchildren developing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, experts say. Despite being the people pupils turn to most often when in distress, teachers are hampered in their desire to help by the profession\u2019s widespread lack of training in tackling mental ill-health. The huge barriers many families in England face getting help for their son or daughter from NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) put pressure on schools, according to a group of education and health experts writing in the journal of the Royal Society of Medicine. \u201cChildren\u2019s burgeoning health needs are not currently being met by the health sector. Schools and teachers provide vital support but they are buckling under the strain of the demands placed on them,\u201d they say. \u201cThe mental health of children and young people in England, and the services designed to support them, are in a dire state,\u201d they add. While rates of mental illness in under-18s have risen by half in the last three years, \u201cprovision is nowhere near sufficient to meet need.\u201d Only one in four of the 500,000 children and young people referred to CAMHS every year receive help as services are stretched, and many are refused care because they are deemed not ill enough. The authors include Chloe Lowry of the UCL Institute of Education in London, Lisa-Maria M\u00fcller and Alison Peacock from the Chartered College of Teaching and Anant Jani of Heidelberg university\u2019s Institute of Global Health in Germany. Schools should receive funding from the NHS to help them train teachers to cope with rising need, they argue. Teachers\u2019 detailed knowledge of and regular interaction with their pupils means they are \u201cnot only the first port of call when concerns arise, but for many the only port of call\u201d. Children and young people seek help from them more often than from their own family, surveys show. Teachers are regarded, alongside GPs and social workers, as part of the first tier of support in CAMHS. \u201cIt is therefore both astonishing and alarming that teachers in England are not adequately trained for these roles,\u201d the authors write. Only one teacher a school in England receives mental health awareness training. Despite being tier 1 CAMHS professionals, just 40% of classroom teachers feel equipped to teach children in their class with mental health needs and only 32% knew which organisations outside the school could help pupils, according to a report for the government in 2016. \u201cWhile schools and colleges do all they can for pupils, it remains the case that the lack of support and provision of mental health services for children and young people has been an ongoing problem for many years,\u201d said Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the NEU, the main teaching union. Covid has made the situation worse, she added. \u201cWorkload, lack of external support, inadequate numbers of staff to work on pastoral issues and training are all huge barriers to pupils getting the support they need and should expect.\u201d Dr Nihara Krause, a consultant clinical psychologist, said teachers need to have specialist mental health services they can refer pupils on to because pupils are displaying ever more complex problems. \u201cSchools should offer basic mental health training to all staff, have specialist trained teachers, have support for staff to share the challenges they may be facing in their students and themselves, [and] have clear school policies and procedures on steps to take with students presenting with different mental health conditions,\u201d added Krause. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are supporting teachers to help children and young people to recover from the emotional impact of the pandemic, including by offering training to senior mental health leads in every state school and college by 2025. \u201cTo support pupils with more complex needs, we have also invested an additional \u00a379m to expand children\u2019s mental health services and accelerate the rollout of mental health support teams, which will give nearly three million children in England access to health experts through school or college by April 2024.\u201d \u2022 This article was updated on 19 July 2022 to include a link to the study."

His death is one of the 1,500 deaths of mental health patients being investigated by the Essex mental health independent inquiry. Here is her statement to the inquiry. \u201cRocky was a loving son, brother, uncle, boyfriend and brother-in-law who was always there to protect us all. Rocky taught himself to cage fight, which helped a lot with his anxiety and depression. At 14 Rocky had to deal with the worst thing imaginable, losing our dad to suicide. He really struggled with losing our dad and missed him so much. \u201cI\u2019ve given evidence to this inquiry because my brother had several admissions to Basildon mental health [services] throughout the last four years of his life. This resulted in a psychiatrist, who did not take the time to get to know him at all, saying that he was fit to stand trial, which he was clearly not, as he had voiced ideas of suicide. I had even written a letter to the judge expressing my concerns over Rocky hurting himself in prison. Nobody listened. \u201cRocky\u2019s death could have been prevented. His original psychiatrist told us he was not fit for court. A different doctor, who did not know Rocky, just read his file, went against this and told them he was fit to stand trial. Also, the prison had plenty of opportunity to open an assessment, care in custody and teamwork [a plan for prisoners judged at risk of self-harm or suicide] and no one did, even though he had a history of mental health issues, had attempted suicide before and had come straight from the hospital. \u201cFrom the beginning of Rocky\u2019s last stay in hospital to his time in prison before he died, every single person failed him \u2013 the doctors, the judge, the prison staff. All it would have taken is one person to stand up and get Rocky the help he needed and we wouldn\u2019t be here today. \u201cRocky is not a one-off case. This happened before him and it\u2019s happened after him. They have not learned anything from the inquest into my brother\u2019s death. They still do not take mental health issues seriously. They are still failing more people.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-27T23:01:38Z",
            "content": "The first inquiry of its kind held in England is investigating the deaths of 1,500 people who died while being cared for as patients of NHS mental health services in Essex. They died in circumstances that were \u201cunexpected, unexplained or self-inflicted\u201d between 2000 and 2020 and while they were receiving treatment from NHS mental health trusts that for years had faced persistent complaints of providing poor care. The 1,500 cases include children and young people as well as adults. All 1,500 were highly vulnerable after experiencing a serious deterioration in their mental health and died either while they were an inpatient in a mental health facility or within three months of being discharged. Dr Geraldine Strathdee, who is leading the inquiry, said some of the evidence she and her team had collected so far was distressing and included \u201cunacceptable examples of dispassionate behaviours that families believe contributed to the death of their loved ones\u201d. Unveiling initial findings from her inquiries so far, Strathdee said families had suffered \u201cunimaginable pain and heartache\u201d and major changes were needed. She has so far identified three recurring failings at the now-defunct North Essex and South Essex mental health trusts and at Essex Partnership University NHS trust. This was formed in 2017 by a merger of the previous trusts and supplied the details of the 1,500 cases now being looked into. They are: Serious concerns about patients\u2019 physical, mental and sexual safety while on a ward, including claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Big differences in the quality of care patients received, \u201cboth in staff attitudes and in the use of effective treatments\u201d. Patients and their families being given too little information about their treatment, likely length of stay and chances of recovery. Strathdee, a leading psychiatrist and former national clinical director of mental health care at NHS England, is looking into 21 key areas of care. They include trusts\u2019 management of patients\u2019 risk of self-harm and suicide, use of restraint, deployment of drugs and management of drug regimes, and how well they dealt with patients\u2019 physical health needs. The inquiry was established in January 2021 by Nadine Dorries, the then minister for mental health, as a non-statutory independent inquiry. She acted amid ongoing concern about the quality and safety of mental health in Essex and after an investigation in 2019 by Rob Behrens, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman, which found numerous failings in the events surrounding the deaths of 20-year-old Matthew Leahy and another young man named only as Mr R. Inquest, which investigates deaths in custody and residential mental health care, said the deaths amounted to \u201ca national scandal\u201d. Selen Cavcav, a senior caseworker at the charity, said: \u201cSadly we are not shocked by the findings because we have long known how unsafe these services are, and the huge number of people who have been impacted by that. \u201cThe scale of this problem and the details of many deaths of people under the care of Essex mental health services are nothing short of a national scandal.\u201d Some families with a relative who died while or after receiving mental health care in Essex have refused to participate in Strathdee\u2019s inquiry because it is not a full public inquiry. Cavcav said: \u201cWe continue to believe that only an inquiry with more teeth, namely a statutory public inquiry, will restore trust and ensure the broad-ranging scrutiny needed to tackle the unacceptable death toll of people under the care of Essex mental health services.\u201d But, she added: \u201cEssex is not alone in having high numbers of preventable deaths of mental health patients, in a country whose mental health system has long been failing countless people in need.\u201d In a brief statement, Paul Scott, the chief executive of the merged Essex trust, did not apologise for failings or lives lost. He said only that \u201cwe continue to support the ongoing inquiry and encourage service users, family, carers and staff to share their experiences with the inquiry team so they have a full picture to draw on to make their recommendations.\u201d Strathdee is appealing for former patients and for relatives of those who died to talk to the inquiry, which has set up a Twitter account to encourage people to share their experiences. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

            "content": "Civilians fleeing conflict in Ukraine must be given immediate access to mental health support when they reach the UK, experts have said, adding there is an urgent need for more investment in such services. Jonathan Bisson, professor in psychiatry at Cardiff University and director of Traumatic Stress Wales, said many people remaining in Ukraine would be experiencing uncertainty, anxiety and fear and some were likely develop mental health problems. \u201cDepending on where you are in Ukraine, at the moment you may be experiencing, absolutely catastrophic, direct, traumatic events occurring: loss of homes, having no electricity, no water, deaths of people around you, being injured yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s not happening to you, or your town, or where you live at the moment, then clearly there must be a major fear that that will happen in the near future.\u201d While Bisson stressed such feelings were normal, and should not be pathologised, he said some people were likely go on to develop mental health problems. An important approach to reduce this risk, he added, was ensuring people felt supported during the crisis. But Bisson said short-, medium- and long-term mental health services were also crucial for those who had fled Ukraine, noting many refugees would require emotional support straight away once they arrived in countries like the UK. \u201cAny response right from the word go, needs to be trauma informed,\u201d he said. But Bisson said that in the first instance that meant ensuring people fleeing conflict had safety and stability. \u201cEstablishing people in communities, getting community support, establishing good social networks for people and with people \u2013 these are absolutely fundamental to people\u2019s longer term prospects in terms of their mental health and wellbeing,\u201d he said. Bisson said therapy for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder was usually best offered once individuals were settled and had stability, meaning provision may be needed months or years after their arrival. Dr Noreen Tehrani, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society and a member of its crisis, disaster and trauma section, also stressed the importance of ensuring refugees felt safe, adding that placing them in families, rather than refugee camps, would hopefully make this easier. But Tehrani raised concerns about a lack of specialist support. \u201cThere is the concern that lots of well-meaning but untrained counsellors and other kind people will want to help, but for refugees with a high level of trauma it is possible to do more harm when you don\u2019t understand exactly what is needed,\u201d she said, adding there was also a need for safeguarding and an awareness of the risks to women and children. Tehrani said it would also be helpful for information to be provided to services including schools, GPs, youth organisations and people who were offering homes to the refugees so they knew what to expect. Kama Petruczenko, policy and research officer at the Refugee Council, also pointed to the need for support both for refugees and for those who want to help them. \u201cThere is an urgent need for more investment in mental health support for refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo-thirds of people seeking asylum experience serious mental distress, and they are five times more likely to have mental health needs than the UK population.\u201d She added: \u201cThe extremely traumatised women and children who arrive from Ukraine will need significant professional support to come to terms with all they have endured. The government needs to ensure sponsors are able to access appropriate levels of support and training to support the complex needs of Ukrainian families who have lost so much.\u201d Petruczenko said it was hugely important that immediate help and also longer-term support were available. \u201cThe government says additional resources will be made available, but it\u2019s important this funding is at the right level to meet needs as soon as people start to arrive,\u201d she said. Dr Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, also called for action. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical that we help refugees to recover from the trauma they\u2019ve experienced, and that we identify those in need of additional specialist mental health support. The government must also urgently focus on improving conditions for refugees, including increasing access to mental health support.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cUkrainians fleeing their home country will be guaranteed free access to NHS healthcare, including mental health care services and registration with a GP. \u201cArrivals will be signposted to services including 24/7 mental health helplines available in every area, and information on accessing NHS services including talking therapies.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-21T06:57:00Z",
            "content": "Younger Australians are more likely to be anxious and depressed and also to binge drink and vape than older people, the latest health survey from the bureau of statistics suggests. Almost 19% of people aged 15 to 24 had anxiety and 14% had depression in 2020-21, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 latest National Health Survey released on Monday. Those figures steadily declined as people got older, and by the time Australians hit 75, just over 7% had anxiety and the same percentage had depression. Patrick McGorry, the executive director of youth mental health organisation Orygen and professor of youth mental health at the University of Melbourne, said a \u201cperfect storm\u201d hit people when they were young. \u201cEvery disorder\u201d from anxiety and depression to eating disorders surged from puberty to peak when people were in their 20s, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of biology and socioeconomic factors.\u201d People were becoming adults, dealing with moving out of home, finding their identities, trying to start a career and finding an intimate partner. \u201cThere\u2019s huge developmental stress, and the body and brain are still developing in a physical sense,\u201d McGorry said. \u201cAnd [there are] headwinds like pandemics, climate change, world wars, and the wealth transfer \u2026 from young people to baby boomers. They can\u2019t buy houses and they\u2019re under a lot of financial stress.\u201d On top of all that, McGorry said, younger people were \u201ctoo grown up for the child services and too early stage for the adult services\u201d. He said Headspace \u2013 where he is a founding board member \u2013 had developed a blueprint to overcome that issue but it needed funding to be expanded. He is hopeful that whoever wins the May election will come up with the money. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m pushing on an open door,\u201d he said. The ABS found 10.7% of adults were daily smokers; for those aged 18 to 24 it was 8.3%. While 83.3% of the younger age group had never smoked, 21.7% had tried vaping compared to just under 10% of adults overall. It was the first time the ABS surveyed people\u2019s vaping habits. Laura Bajurny, an Alcohol and Drug Foundation spokesperson, said young people could easily get both nicotine and non-nicotine vapes online, that both were harmful, and that they were being aggressively marketed. \u201cSocial media marketing around vaping has been really aggressive and targeted at young people,\u201d she said. The ABS survey also found one in four Australians drinks too much. About one in three men drinks more than 10 standard drinks a week, compared to about one in five women. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning People in the 18 to 24 age bracket were less likely than the average to have consumed more than ten drinks in the past week, but more likely to have consumed five or more on any day at least once a month. That\u2019s consistent with \u201cheavy episodic drinking\u201d, Bajurny said. \u201cThe tragedy is that kind of heavy alcohol consumption is connected to some of the most common causes of death for young people \u2013 accidents and injuries including drownings, motor vehicle crashes. \u201cWe know that alcohol consumption is the second leading modifiable risk factor for suicide and self-harm in men.\u201d It also found almost eight in 10 Australians have a long-term health condition. The conditions listed include cancer, diabetes and asthma, as well as short or longsightedness, hay fever and allergies. Of the 78.6% of people reporting a condition in 2020-21, about half had a chronic condition. The data was collected differently for the 2020-21 year, and cannot be compared to previous years, the ABS said. Youth mental health help is available from Headspace.

Rocketing global food prices as a result of the war in Ukraine could trigger riots from those going hungry in poor countries, the head of the World Trade Organization has said. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned food-producing countries against hoarding supplies and said it was vital to avoid a repeat of the Covid pandemic, when rich countries were able to secure for themselves the bulk of vaccines. In an interview with the Guardian, the WTO director general expressed concern about the knock-on effects of Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 stressing the dependence of many African countries on food supplies from the Black Sea region. \u201cI think we should be very worried. The impact on food prices and hunger this year and next could be substantial. Food and energy are the two biggest items in the consumption baskets of poor people all over the world,\u201d Okonjo-Iweala said. \u201cIt is poor countries and poor people within poor countries that will suffer the most.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: European stock market had a mixed session. The FTSE 100 index has closed 7 points high at 7,467, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 dipped by 0.2%. Retail group Next was the top faller on the FTSE 100, down 3.25%, after trimming its sales guidance this morning due to closing its websites in Ukraine and Russia, and slower growth expectations in other overseas markets. Other retailers also dipped, along with airline group IAG (-2.2%), plumbing business Ferguson (-3.2% after going ex-dividend) and miner Glencore (-2.1%). As things stand, the markets have largely recovered from their plunge in the early days of the Ukraine war began. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, says: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been a month since Russia first began its invasion of Ukraine. Watching western leaders gather together in a show of strength today might have delivered a great photo opportunity but behind the picture is action. Sanctions have been imposed, business after business has cut ties with Russia and aid has flooded into the region. There is more that must be done and more that will be agreed in the hours and days that follow. Russia\u2019s economy has been hobbled but there has been a price and one that already cash-strapped consumers across Europe and in the US will pay. \u201cBut despite the surge in commodity prices and the volatility which has dogged financial markets over the last four weeks comparing markets today with where they were before the invasion, investors might well let out a sigh of relief. France\u2019s CAC 40 and Germany\u2019s DAX are down by 3.2 and 2.4% respectively but London\u2019s FTSE 100 has only dipped by 0.3% and Wall Street\u2019s fared even better. Distance is certainly a factor, but energy is the x-factor and once again Europe\u2019s reliance on Russia for oil and gas has been right at the top of the list of talking points in Brussels. Larry Fink,the chief executive of BlackRock, has warned that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has put an end to the last 30 years of globalisation. In his annual letter to shareholders, Fink explained that the conflict will drive up inflation (as we\u2019ve seen already signs of today) and rehape the global economy as firms pull back from global supply chains. Fink explained that such changes will \u2018inherently\u2019 be inflationary. Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and its subsequent decoupling from the global economy is going to prompt companies and governments worldwide to re-evaluate their dependencies and re-analyze their manufacturing and assembly footprints \u2013 something that Covid had already spurred many to start doing. And while dependence on Russian energy is in the spotlight, companies and governments will also be looking more broadly at their dependencies on other nations. This may lead companies to onshore or nearshore more of their operations, resulting in a faster pull back from some countries. Others \u2013 like Mexico, Brazil, the United States, or manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia \u2013 could stand to benefit. This decoupling will inevitably create challenges for companies, including higher costs and margin pressures. While companies\u2019 and consumers\u2019 balance sheets are strong today, giving them more of a cushion to weather these difficulties, a large-scale reorientation of supply chains will inherently be inflationary. Here\u2019s an excellent chart showing how different income groups have fared in each UK parliament since the 1960s, in real terms, from the Resolution Foundation. As you can see -- the current parliament is going to be grim, with living standards heading for a historic fall. But there\u2019s some fascinating detail too, including how the rich really did so much better than the poor during the Thatcher years, and how incomes rose across the board in the first Blair term. Economics writer Duncan Weldon explains: Germany\u2019s ruling coalition today agreed a package worth around \u20ac15bn to help businesses and households with soaring energy costs. The package is meant to help individuals and companies handle skyrocketing prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, including a temporary reduction in fuel prices. Bloomberg has more details: Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s government will cut the tax on fuel for three months by 30 euro cents (25p) for gasoline and 14 cents for diesel, Finance Minister Christian Lindner told reporters in Berlin. Officials from the three-party ruling alliance negotiated through the night to reach a deal after initially disagreeing on what measures to adopt. Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats, the Greens and Lindner\u2019s pro-business FDP also agreed that taxpayers will receive a one-time payment of \u20ac300, as well as a one-off boost to child support of \u20ac100. To promote the use of public transport, the government will introduce a monthly ticket costing 9 euros. The overall package is worth about the same as an initial set of measures agreed last month, Lindner said, without specifying the amount. Scholz has indicated those could cost about \u20ac15bn, including subsidies for low-income households, an increase in an allowance for commuters and a cut in a levy to finance the expansion of renewables, bringing the total cost of both packages to around \u20ac30bn. Rishi Sunak\u2019s petrol duty cut was only worth 5p per litre, taking price back to last week\u2019s levels, but it should last for a year. Growth at eurozone companies is also being weakened by the Ukraine conflict. This morning\u2019s PMI survey found that business activity growth slowed this month as exports fell. Business sentiment and optimism fell to their lowest since autumn 2020, as firms braced for weaker economic growth and grew more worried about the economic outlook. Firms also reported a record surge in input prices, as the war worsened existing supply chain constraints and shortages. The prices they charged also rose at a record pace, which will add to inflation in the euro area. The overall composite PMI dipped to 54.5 from 55.5, which only shows a slight slowdown. However, the manufacturing PMI hit a 14-month low. Bert Colijn of ING says the underlying picture is worrying: It is the underlying insights from the survey that show more concern about the health of the economy. Most importantly: businesses have clearly been impacted by the surge in energy prices seen since the war started. Both input and output prices surged at a record pace in March. This suggests a broadening of inflation as even higher energy prices are causing passthrough effects to happen more quickly than expected. We already expect inflation to soar above 7% in March and think that prices are set to increase further in April. The International Energy Agency has said it would consider any attempts by Russia to make European countries pay for their gas supplies in roubles a \u201csecurity threat\u201d. The IEA\u2019s executive director Fatih Birol told journalists after the organisation\u2019s annual meeting in Paris that: \u201cIf this is true I would consider it another security threat made by Russia,\u201d Birol was speaking a day after Vladimir Putin said \u2018unfriendly\u2019 countries would have to pay for gas in roubles; comments which pushed up wholesale prices. The FT have more details. Disruption to Ukraine\u2019s sunflower oil shipments mean some food suppliers are turning to rapeseed oil instead. The urgency of the move means some food products labelled as containing sunflower oil may instead contain refined rapeseed oil, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS) said today. Ukraine and Russia are the world\u2019s top two sunflower oil exporters. Disruption to supplies, and the planting of this year\u2019s crops, have driven up sunflower oil prices. Emily Miles, FSA chief executive, said the agency is working with the industry to make labels accurate, ASAP. \u201cFSA and FSS have been working hard to understand the recent pressures on our food supply chain and the interim measures needed to make sure certain foods \u2013 like crisps, breaded fish, frozen vegetables and chips \u2013 remain on sale here. \u201cWe have looked at the immediate food safety risk of substituting sunflower oil with refined rapeseed oil - particularly to people with a food allergy - and it is very low. We know allergic reactions to rapeseed oil are very rare and - if they do occur - are mild. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has dented business optimism at companies in the United States. Soaring input costs, and the Ukraine conflict, knocked business confidence to a five-month low this month, the latest flash survey of US purchasing managers found. Services sector companies were less upbeat, worried about the impact of reduced disposable incomes as the cost of living rises. The survey also found that US business activity increased to an eight-month high in March, fueled by strong demand for both goods and services. New orders rose, leading to a pick-up in employment. But as in the UK, input costs soared, meaning firms continued to lift their own prices. Russia\u2019s stock market rallied by over 4% today, in its first trading session since being suspended almost a month ago. The MOEX index of blue-chip shares initally surging 11% and closed higher, helped by a ban on short-selling, and restrictions on foreigners selling up. Energy companies and commodity producers were among the risers. It was the first session since trading was halted on 25 February, the second day of the invasion, as stocks plummeted. But.... investors have pointed out that various restrictions meant Moscow\u2019s market is no longer functioning properly, while the US dismissed it as a \u2018Potemkin\u2019 opening. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, said the market wasn\u2019t normal, functional, or sustainable right now. Authorities are going to great lengths to manipulate the market and prevent another devastating plunge and their efforts are working, for now. Here\u2019s the full story: G7 leaders are cracking down on Russia\u2019s ability to sell its gold reserves to support its currency and fund the war in Ukraine. The move will restrict Moscow\u2019s ability to dodge Western sanctions, and was announced as leaders met at Nato headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss the Ukraine conflict. The White House announced that G7 leaders and the European Union will continue to work jointly to blunt Russia\u2019s ability to deploy its international reserves to prop up Russia\u2019s economy and fund Putin\u2019s war, including by making clear that any transaction involving gold related to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is covered by existing sanctions. Last month, Western allies froze around half of Russia\u2019s $630bn of foreign exchange reserves, which were held at other central banks. Moscow reportedly holds around 21%, or $130bn, of its reserves in gold. Phil Mattingly of CNN reports that US officials have picked up that Russia\u2019s central bank was seeking to use those bullion reserves to \u201cprop up\u201d the rouble, and want to shut that ability down. Boris Johnson suggested this morning that stopping Vladimir Putin using his gold reserves would apply more pressure, and help shorten the war. The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week fell to its lowest level in 52 years as the US job market continues to show strength in the midst of rising costs and the pandemic. Jobless claims fell by 28,000 to 187,000 for the week ending 19 March, the lowest since September of 1969, the labor department reported on Thursday. First-time applications for jobless aid generally track the pace of layoffs. The four-week average for claims, which compensates for weekly volatility, fell to 211,750 from the previous week\u2019s 223,250. In total, 1,350,000 Americans \u2013 a more than 50-year low \u2013 were collecting jobless aid the week that ended 12 March. The Bank of England has warned that the Ukraine invasion is increasing economic uncertainty and will increase pressure on UK borrowers. Policymakers on the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee warned in a new report today that household incomes and business earnings will come under pressure from the sustained increases in energy prices since the war began. They also point out that poorer families will struggle most from the cost of living squeeze. It\u2019s a timely reminder, as the spring statement pushes more people into poverty this year, and firms lifted prices at a record pace. The FPC, which monitors risks to financial stability, says: An increase in the cost of living, partly due to rising energy and other import prices, is likely to affect household resilience across the income distribution, with a larger impact on lower income households that spend a greater share of their income on energy and other essential items. Although these price rises are unlikely to significantly affect the ability of mortgagors to make debt repayments, they will increase the pressure on household balance sheets, particularly if there is a larger than expected impact on growth. In its latest report, the FPC also warned that the global economic outlook has deteriorated significantly since Russia invaded Ukraine, and that some financial markets have been volatile, with energy and some commodity prices rising sharply. The impact is likely to be especially felt in Europe where, for example, some countries are particularly reliant on Russian energy. Disruptions to global supply chains could also affect a wide range of countries given the significant role of Russia and Ukraine in the production of commodities including metals and wheat. Although risks remain, there has been little sign of financial market contagion to other emerging markets outside of Europe so far. There is also a risk that global financial conditions could tighten further and that further volatility could affect core financial markets, the report warns. But, UK banks remain resilient, they believe. The UK banking sector is resilient to a wide range of severe scenarios. It remains highly capitalised and liquidity ratios are strong. UK banks also have low direct exposures to Russia. UK retail chain Next has also sounded the alarm over price rises today, saying shortages of staff and disruption caused by the Ukraine war will push up prices by 8%. this autumn. Next said its homeware prices were now expected to rise by up to 13% and fashion by 6.5% in the second half of this year, a significant step up from an overall 3.7% increase in prices in the first part of the year. Simon Wolfson, its chief executive and a prominent pro-Brexit business voice, said it should be easier for workers to come to the UK, calling on the government to: \u201creverse the self-defeating barriers it has placed on overseas workers supporting our economy and accelerate, simplify and reform the planning process to increase the supply of desperately needed housing\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: Lloyd\u2019s of London has said it is working with the UK government to implement sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine as fast as possible, including cancelling Russian firms\u2019 insurance cover. Announcing a swing back to an annual profit as it recovers from the pandemic, the world\u2019s biggest insurance market warned that the war will present a \u201cmajor claim\u201d for the insurance market this year, but said it was \u201cmanageable\u201d. It said aviation, marine, trade credit and political risk were the lines of business most affected. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the Lloyd\u2019s chairman, said unrecoverable planes were likely to cause the biggest insurance losses. Moscow has passed laws to impound $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) of jets leased to Aeroflot and other Russian airlines by western organisations. He said the next biggest losses were expected from claims related to ships trapped in the Black Sea, and to disrupted exports of cereals and agricultural products from Ukraine and Russia. Some insurance policies also cover state-sponsored cyberterrorism. Carnegie-Brown said it would take three to four weeks to work out the claims. He told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonably complex because there are lots of different lines of insurance that operate here and in fact some lines of insurance get kicked out by war, there are war exclusions, and some get kicked in because there are war covers,\u201d \u201cOn top of that, you\u2019ve got to overlay the sanctions regime so governments themselves are causing the cancellation of insurance as part of the sanctions package against the Russian state.\u201d P&amp;O Ferries chose to sack 800 workers without consultation because \u201cno union could accept our proposals\u201d, the firm\u2019s boss has admitted. Peter Hebblethwaite told a Commons hearing today into last week\u2019s firings that the firm was halving its costs under a \u201cnew operating model\u201d, where international seafarers would be paid less than minimum wage. The P&amp;O chief executive said: \u201cThere is absolutely no doubt we were required to consult with the unions. We chose not to \u2026 and we will compensate every one in full for that. \u201cIt was our assessment that the change was of such magnitude that no union could accept our proposals.\u201d Earlier, legal experts said P&amp;O should have notified their ships\u2019 flag states in Cyprus, Bermuda and the Bahamas between 30 and 45 days in advance \u2013 rather than on the day. Hebblethwaite said the average sacked seafarer on the previous Jersey contracts was paid \u00a336,000 per year. The replacement crew will receive an hourly rate starting at \u00a35.15. He insisted he was \u201csaving the business\u201d, adding: \u201cI would make this decision again, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s warning that 1.3 million people will fall into poverty this year because Rishi Sunak isn\u2019t giving struggling families more help: British retailers suffered a fall in sales this month, as the cost of living squeeze forced customers to cut back. A majority of retailers said sales were poor for the time of year in March, according to the latest poll by the Confederation of British Industry survey. Taking are expected to remain below seasonal norms in April too, as retailers brace for a slide in spending. Martin Sartorius, Principal Economist at the CBI, says government needs to further to support the economy: \u201cRetailers had a mediocre March, with sales reported as being below seasonal norms. The cost-of-living crisis is looming large across the sector, as households\u2019 wallets are being hit by the fastest rate of inflation in decades. \u201cThe Chancellor\u2019s Spring Statement outlined new support for those on low incomes amid these financial challenges. But further action will be needed to galvanise consumer confidence, shore up incomes, and support spending on UK high streets in the tough months to come.\u201d The CBI\u2019s sales-for-the-time-of-year sank to -23 from February\u2019s +16, showing a deterioration in trading. The overall retail sales balance fell to +9 from +14 in February, a little lower than forecast. Internet sales, year-on-year, fell at the fastest rate since the survey began in 2009 -- but that comparison is distorted by the Covid-19 lockdown in 2021 when some shops were closed. P&amp;O\u2019s Ferries CEO Peter Hebblethwaite also freely admitted to MPs that the company was required to consult with trade unions before sacking 800 staff, but chose not too. The P&amp;O Ferries boss told today\u2019s committee grilling: \u201cThere is absolutely no doubt we were required to consult with the unions. We chose not to do that..... and we are, and will, compensate everybody in full for that. The committee are aghast, and furious. Labour MP Andy McDonald compared Hebblethwaite\u2019s attitude to driving down the motorway at 90 miles an hour because the speed limit doesn\u2019t apply to him. McDonald also questions how P&amp;O can justify paying its new agency staff so little (a move that will halve its costs). More here. In parliament, Peter Hebblethewaite, chief executive of P&amp;O Ferries, is giving evidence to a Commons committee investigating his companies decision to sack 800 seafarers last week with no notice. Darren Jones (Lab), chair of the Commons business committee, started by saying he had looked at Hebblethewaite\u2019s CV. He asks if the company is in this mess because Hebblethewaite does not know what he is doing. \u201cOr are you just a shameless criminal? Hebblethewaite starts with an apology. He says he wants to start with an apology to the seafarers affected by last week\u2019s decision, to their families and to other employees. He says the company was losing \u201can unsustainable amount of money\u201d. If the firm had not acted, it would have had to close, he says. He disputes claims heard by the committee earlier that the firm was in breach of its obligations to give sufficient notice of the sackings to the authorities where the ships are registered. Hebblethewaite says he is paid \u00a3325,000. Q: Would you take a performance related bonus if offered? Hebblethewaite says that is not something he has considered. He claims some of the dismissed staff could receive as much as \u00a3170,000 as a pay-off [P&amp;O announced a \u00a336.5m compensation package this week]. When pressed, Hebblethewaite admits that very few people are in this category. But he says 40 people could get more than \u00a3100,000. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Liveblog has all the action: The sharp drop in businesses optimism about the future, and the surge in prices charged by firms, are a clear sign that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is hitting the UK economy. Growth is likely to slow sharply over the next few months, explains Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK: The biggest shock in the manufacturing PMI was the slump in the future output balance from 80.0 to 75.8, its lowest level in more than a year. This probably reflects concerns about the war in Ukraine dampening demand. \u2018Overall, the PMI suggests the war in Ukraine hasn\u2019t had a large impact on UK businesses yet, but the huge rise in prices will mean there is likely to be very little growth in GDP in the second half of the year.\u2019 Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds Bank, agrees that inflationary pressures, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, will hit growth. \u201cThe economic outlook continues to be uncertain and mixed. While the reduction in pandemic-related restrictions is bolstering many sectors, inflationary pressures, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, are causing a drag on the economy. \u201cThe price of commodities such as oil, nickel, zinc, and wheat have soared since the beginning of the conflict and are now impacting some businesses\u2019 balance sheets. This seems bound to push inflation higher, which will reduce the spending power of companies and consumers alike, potentially causing orders and output to falter in the near term. \u201cThe ongoing crisis in Ukraine and apparent lack of progress in reaching a peaceful settlement will prolong the period of uncertainty that firms have to contend with.\u201d S&amp;P Global\u2019s Chris Williamson says the outlook darkened this month: Concerns over Russia\u2019s invasion exacerbated existing worries over soaring prices, supply chains and slowing economic growth. Business expectations are now at their lowest for almost one and a half years, pointing to a marked slowing in the pace of economic growth in coming months. The jump in prices charged by UK firms will intensify the squeeze on households\u2019 real incomes, and paint a bleak picture of the months ahead. So says Nicholas Farr, assistant economist at Capital Economics, who predicts it will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates again, in May: Unsurprisingly given the surge in commodity prices since the war in Ukraine began, the input prices balance of the composite PMI rose a bit further, from 81.6 to 81.7, and firms reported passing these costs on, with the output price balance reaching its highest level since the series began in 1999. Overall, the PMI survey offers some encouragement that the economy has been fairly resilient to the war in Ukraine so far. But this probably won\u2019t last. And, today\u2019s survey will only fuel the Bank of England\u2019s fears that high inflation is feeding through into rising price and wage expectations. We think the Bank will have to raise rates to 2.0% next year, with the next hike to 1.0% coming on 5th May. UK businesses are raising their prices at the fastest rate in at least 20 years as the Ukraine invasion pushed up costs. With business optimism hitting a near-18 month low, risks of \u2018stagflation\u2019 are rising, the latest survey of purchasing managers at UK companies shows. Escalating fuel, energy and staff costs led companies to drive up their prices this month at the fastest rate since at least 1999, when the PMI report began. These price rises will intensify the cost of living squeeze, as companies pass on an \u201cunprecedented rises in their operating expenses\u201d onto customers. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global, says risks of \u2018stagflation\u2019 are rising. Prices pressures have spiked higher due to increased energy and commodity prices resulting from the invasion. With March seeing by far the largest rise in selling prices for goods and services ever recorded by the survey, consumer price inflation is set to rise further in the months ahead. The survey indicators point to potentially sharply slower growth in the coming months, accompanied by a further acceleration of inflation and a worsening cost of living crisis, which paints an unwelcome picture of \u2018stagflation\u2019 for the economy in the months ahead. These escalating inflationary pressures, and worries about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, hammered business optimism to its lowest since October 2020 (just before the first Covid-19 vaccine trial results). Markit\u2019s business confidence index dropped from 76.1 in February to 71.4 in March, which is the biggest monthly drop since the start of the pandemic. Both manufacturing and services companies expect much weaker growth in the year ahead. Output across the manufacturing sector fell to a five-month low, but service sector growth hit a nine-month high, with the return to offices and customer events lifting activity this month. Overall, the Composite PMI edged down from 59.9 to 59.7, showing a slight slowdown (although rising prices will push up the PMI...). The media reaction to yesterday\u2019s spring statement is notably negative, with many papers focusing on the historic slump in living standards looming this year. The UK has announced a new set of sanctions against Russian companies, banks, business people, and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov\u2019s step daughter, Polina Kovaleva. The 65 sanctions target key industries supporting Russia\u2019s invasion of UKraine, including Russian Railways and defence company Kronshtadt, which produces Russian drones used in the conflict. The Wagner Group \u2013 the organisation of Russian mercenaries reportedly ordered to assassinate President Zelenskyy - has also been sanctioned, as has Alfa Bank whose cofounders include oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan who have already been sanctioned. Billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler, a close friend of Roman Abramovich, is also on the list (a jet suspected to be linked to Shvidler was stopped at Farnborough airport earlier this month). Tinkoff bank founder Oleg Tinkov, and Herman Gref, the CEO of Russia\u2019s largest bank Sberbank, are on the list too, as is Galina Danilchenko, who was installed by Russia as the \u2018mayor\u2019 of Melitopol. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price. Putin should be under no illusions \u2013 we are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine. There will be no let-up\u201d. All those sanctioned today will have their assets in the UK frozen which means no UK citizen or company can do business with them, and individuals subject to travel bans are also prohibited from travelling to or from the UK. Today\u2019s sanctions will bring the total global asset value of the banks the UK has sanctioned since the invasion to \u00a3500bn and the net worth of the oligarchs and family members in excess of \u00a3150bn. On Kovelava, the UK says: Polina Kovaleva, stepdaughter of Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov...reportedly owns a c.\u00a34m property in London. This sends a strong signal that those benefiting from association of those responsible for Russian aggression are in scope of our sanctions. MPs has called for action against Labrov\u2019s \u2018second family\u2019 earlier this month: A group of protesters gathered outside Kovaleva\u2019s luxury flat in Kensington earlier this month, the Mirror reported. Rishi Sunak has indicated that the Government could intervene on energy bills before the autumn, if bill are set to rise sharply again in October: Asked if the Government would take action in that case, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cYes, of course we\u2019ll have to see where we are by the autumn and it\u2019s right for people to recognise that they are protected between now and the autumn because of the price cap.\u201d Pressed on whether that meant yes, he will intervene before October, Sunak said: \u201cI always keep everything under review, and the Government, as it\u2019s shown over the past two years, is always responsive to what\u2019s happening. \u201cBut I would say with energy prices, you know, they are very volatile, and I don\u2019t think you, I or anyone else has any certainty about what will happen in October right now.\u201d Yesterday, the OBR warned that the energy price cap could rise by another 40% in October, given current wholesale prices. That would lift bills from \u00a31,971 per year to \u00a32,800 a year, and drive inflation towards 9%. Back on the spring statement, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has said she is \u201cabsolutely gobsmacked\u201d that Rishi Sunak didn\u2019t choose to increases benefits and pensions yesterday to help with the cost of living crisis. Universal credit and the state pensions are to rise 3.1% in April, in line with last September\u2019s inflation rate. Since then, inflation has doubled to 6.2%, and could hit almost 9% later this year, meaning recipients face a real terms cut this year (which will push absolute poverty up). Reeves told the Today Programme that Labour would have brought forward some of the likely increase due in 2023 (because inflation will be high this coming September), to help people pay for their food and energy bills this year. Next year, pensions and benefits will go up by more, because inflation is still so high. The chancellor could have brought that forward, and it was wrong that he didn\u2019t do that yesterday. Reeves also slammed Sunak\u2019s claim to be a tax-cutting chancellor, telling LBC: The Chancellor can say as many times as he likes that he\u2019s a tax-cutting chancellor but it\u2019s a bit like a kid in his bedroom playing air guitar - he\u2019s not a rockstar. \u201cThe problem is for this Chancellor, is that by the end of this Parliament seven out of eight people will be paying more taxes - only one in eight will be paying less taxes.\u201d Daleep Singh, deputy US national security adviser for international economics, has dismissed today\u2019s Moscow stock market reopening as a \u2018charade\u2019, given the various restrictions in place. Singh pledged that Russia will remain isolated from the international economic order as long as it continues the war in Ukraine, saying: What we\u2019re seeing is a charade: a Potemkin market opening. After keeping its markets closed for nearly a month, Russia announced it will only allow 15% of listed shares to trade, foreigners are prohibited from selling their shares, and short selling in general has been banned. Meanwhile, Russia has made clear they are going to pour government resources into artificially propping up the shares of companies that are trading. This is not a real market and not a sustainable model\u2014which only underscores Russia\u2019s isolation from the global financial system. The United States and our allies and partners will continue taking action to further isolate Russia from the international economic order as long it continues its brutal war against Ukraine. Russia\u2019s government has also tried to prop up its market by directing its wealth fund to buy shares. Back on March 1, Moscow said would channel up to 1 trillion roubles (\u00a37.7bn) from its rainy-day National Wealth Fund on buying Russian stocks, Reuters reported. \u201cLarge bids to buy Russian shares have been seen since the market opening,\u201d BCS Brokerage said in a note. \u201cThe overall sentiment is supported by the confidence that the finance ministry will buy stocks.\u201d The recent recovery in the ailing rouble could be helping stocks in Moscow. Russia\u2019s currency rallied yesterday after President Vladimir Putin demanded that \u201cunfriendly\u201d nations should pay for natural gas purchases in roubles. It\u2019s now trading at around 91 roubles to the dollar, having slumped to 130/$1 after the invasion. But that\u2019s still much weaker than the pre-invasion levels of around 75 roubles/$1. Hasnain Malik, a strategist at Tellimer in Dubai, told Bloomberg that Moscow still isn\u2019t a \u2018functional market\u2019, given the curbs on overseas investors selling shares. \u201cWith restrictions on foreign selling and repatriation this is not a functional market in terms of efficient price discovery, given foreigners dominate the market\u2019s free float. \u201cThe one fundamental factor that has improved during the stock market\u2019s suspension is the partial recovery in the currency as Russia tries to shift oil and gas trade to rubles.\u201d Despite this morning\u2019s gains (in limited trading), the Moscow stock market is still down almost 30% this year. The Moscow stock exchange has opened higher, as trading finally resumes after a near month-long suspension. The MOEX index rallied as much as 11% in early trading, suggesting that measures put in place to prop up stocks are working. Its the first session since the exchange was shuttered on February 25th following the invasion of Ukraine. Energy firms are leading the rally, with gas giant Gazprom surging 18% and oil group Rosneft gaining 20%. Russian bank Sberbank is among the risers too, up over 10% despite having been targeted by Western sanctions; it quit almost all its European markets earlier this month But airline group Aeroflot have fallen 10%, with its planes banned from much Western airspace. However, it\u2019s not a full trading session. Just 33 of the 50 stocks that make up the Russian equity benchmark are trading, short selling is banned and foreign investors aren\u2019t yet able to sell stock. Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, described Rishi Sunak\u2019s spring statement as \u201ca total swindle\u201d, arguing \u201che\u2019s giving a bit and taking a lot\u201d. He told BBC Breakfast: If you look at the fine print that was published yesterday, it shows taxes overall going up by over \u00a31,500 a year per household under this Conservative Government. \u201cAnd those tax rises from Conservatives are coming at the worst possible time - the squeeze on families and pensioners, again, set to be the worst for over 40 years, pump rises, food bills, energy bills, inflation the highest for over 40 years. \u201cPeople are drowning in these tax rises and these higher bills. The Chancellor needed to provide a lifeboat for people and he didn\u2019t.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Around 1.3 million people will fall into absolute poverty over the next year because chancellor Rishi Sunak didn\u2019t provide more help for low-income families yesterday, according to new analysis of Wednesday\u2019s spring statement. The Resolution Foundation has reported that Sunak delivered a \u201cbig but poorly targeted policy package\u201d yesterday, which failed to support those families hit hardest by the cost of living crisis. That means that absolute poverty is expected to rise by 1.3 million people next year - including 500,000 children \u2013 the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions, Resolution says. In a sobering analysis, Resolution explains that household incomes are forecast to fall by 2 per cent across the parliament as a whole, making this parliament the worst on record for living standards. Typical working-age household incomes are to set to fall by 4 per cent in real-terms next year (2022-23), a loss of \u00a31,100. The poorest quarter of households face the most pain - their incomes are set to tumble by 6 per cent, after the chancellor resisted calls to update benefit payments by more than the planned 3.1%, which means a fall in real terms. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, says the policies announced yesterday don\u2019t match the Chancellor\u2019s rhetoric. The decision not to target support at those hardest hit by rising prices will leave low-and-middle income households painfully exposed, with 1.3 million people, including half a million children, set to fall below the poverty line this coming year. \u201cAnd despite the eye-catching 1p cut to income tax, the reality is that the Chancellor\u2019s tax changes mean that seven-in-eight workers will see their tax bills rise. Those tax rises mean the Chancellor is able to point to a swift fiscal consolidation and significant headroom against his fiscal rules. \u201cThe big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low-to-middle income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself fiscal flexibility in the years ahead. Whether that will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls to come remains to be seen.\u201d Only one-in-eight workers will see actually see their tax bills fall by the end of the parliament, Resolution reports, despite Sunak\u2019s decision to lift the National Insurance threshold by \u00a33,000 in July: Resolution says: Considering all income tax changes to thresholds and rates announced by Rishi Sunak, only those earning between \u00a349,100 and \u00a350,300 will actually pay less income tax in 2024-25, and only those earning between \u00a311,000 and \u00a313,500 will pay less tax and National Insurance (NI). Of the 31 million people in work, around 27 million (seven-in-eight workers) will pay more in income tax and NI in 2024-25. Yesterday, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned that UK living standards are heading for a historic fall, with the tax burden heading for a 70-year high and inflation likely to average over 7% this year. Sunak banked most of a windfall in the public finances from higher tax receipts and lower-than-expected borrowing, a move that could create firepower for a pre-election giveaway in 2024. But there are dark economic times ahead. Last night, Sunak was challenged on LBC Radio by a single mother who told the chancellor she cannot afford to heat her home and has had to take on two extra jobs, Hezel, a single mother, said she had a good salary \u201con paper\u201d but rising costs had put \u201can intense strain\u201d on her ability to provide for her children. Also coming up today MPs on the Business and Transport committee are holding a hearing into P&amp;O Ferries\u2019s shock sacking of 800 workers last week. It starts at 9.30am, with Peter Hebblethwaite, chief executive, P&amp;O Ferries, and Jesper Kristensen, Group COO, Maritime Services, DP World, up at 11am. Yesterday, Boris Johnson has said it appears P&amp;O Ferries broke the law when it suddenly sacked 800 workers, and that the government would take legal action. Purchasing manager surveys from UK and eurozone companies are expected to show a slowdown this month, as soaring energy prices and the Ukraine war hits the economy. Moscow\u2019s stock market is to partially reopen today for a shortened session, after a near month-long shutdown after stocks plunged when the Ukraine invasion began. Several measures will be in place to limit the pace of a new selloff, as Bloomberg explains: When trading resumes at 9:50 a.m. in Moscow on Thursday for a shortened four-hour session, only 33 stocks will be active, including some of the nation\u2019s biggest companies, such as Gazprom PJSC and Sberbank PJSC. However, foreigners won\u2019t be allowed to sell equities in a ban scheduled to last until April 1, and short selling won\u2019t be permitted. The agenda 9am GMT: European Central Bank economic bulletin 9am GMT: Eurozone flash PMI survey of manufacturing and services companies for March 9.30am GMT: UK flash PMI survey of manufacturing and services companies for March 9.30am GMT-12.30pm GMT: Transport and Business Committees hearing into P&amp;O Ferries sackings 10.15am GMT: IFS briefing on the spring statement"

            "date": "2022-03-02T06:00:32Z",
            "content": "In recent weeks, Shamla Laxman, 54, has been rising at dawn or staying out late at night. She is on the prowl for an item that has become rarer than gold dust in Sri Lanka\u2019s commercial capital of Colombo in recent weeks: sachets of milk powder. \u201cThese days it\u2019s become impossible to find, and when you do find it in a shop, the prices are so expensive, double or triple what it was before, that I can\u2019t afford it for my family,\u201d said Laxman, who feeds a family of seven in her small house. Chicken, which used to be a staple, is now a luxury item after it more than doubled in price. \u201cAll our basic items have become almost unaffordable now,\u201d said Laxman. \u201cEvery day I am fearful of not being able to feed my family tomorrow.\u201d Sri Lanka, an island off the southern tip of India, is in the midst of one of the worst financial crises to hit the country since it became independent in 1948. In recent month, food prices have skyrocketed, there has been a continued dearth of essential goods, fruit and vegetables, and long queues have formed outside petrol stations due to a shortage of fuel. This week, daily power cuts of over five hours began to be imposed across the island and warnings were issued that water supplies might also soon be disrupted. Last week two ships carrying diesel and a tanker of fuel oil sat in the port but their essential cargo could not be brought in as the government didn\u2019t have the dollars to pay for it. Over the weekend, Gemunu Wijeratne, President of the Lanka Private Bus Owners\u2019 Association, warned that buses were not being given enough petrol to continue functioning and that journeys were already being shortened. \u201cIf this continues, public transport will collapse and the economy will come to a standstill,\u201d said Wijeratne. It is a crisis many say has been over a decade in the making but was exacerbated by the pandemic and economic policies of the current government, led by president Gotabaya Rajapaksa who came to power in late 2019. Consecutive governments have borrowed high-interest sovereign bonds, which coupled with billions in loans from countries including China and Japan have left Sri Lanka with cripplingly high foreign debt repayments. It has been operating with a $6bn trade deficit, importing far more than it exports, and invested billions in expensive, large-scale infrastructure projects. \u201cWe have been spending beyond our means for years,\u201d said Ahilan Kadirgamar, a political economist and senior lecturer at the university of Jaffna. As the pandemic hit, Sri Lanka lost crucial foreign income from tourism, and tax cuts by the Rajapaksa government meant that the flow of federal income was severely reduced. Over the past two years, inflation has surged, foreign reserves fell by 70% and an ill-advised outright ban on fertilisers crippled the farming industry, leading to an ongoing shortage of fruit and vegetables. Sri Lanka now owes $15bn in foreign bond repayments, with $7bn owed this year and a $1bn repayment required as soon as June, all to be paid in dollars. But with Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign reserves at their lowest levels in years, and the country\u2019s economic rating in the gutter, there are barely any dollars left and many fear the country is headed for a default. \u201cThe situation here is very bleak,\u201d said Kadirgamar. The impact on the daily lives of people, from lowest income up to the country\u2019s wealthiest, is palpable. Nishan Shanaka 40, is a civil engineer in Colombo but he now drives an auto-rickshaw in the evenings and on the weekends because his salary won\u2019t cover the cost of food and his children\u2019s education. He described his family\u2019s struggle to afford flour and bread and said they now existed on cheap vegetables. \u201cThe cost of everything is far too high now, even if I go to buy a toffee it\u2019s unaffordable,\u201d said Shanaka. \u201cThe high fuel prices are impacting everything, my daughters can\u2019t even get the school bus because they can\u2019t afford to run them any more.\u201d Thangarasa Vathani, 48, owner of a fabric and tailoring shop, said she had already had to close one of her tailoring factories, and let go several members of her staff. The few left now worked from her home, but she was concerned she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep them on for much longer. \u201cPeople here are so disturbed, we don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow. Those who can afford it are sending their children abroad but not all of us have the money to do that,\u201d said Vathani. The crisis is already affecting industry. Lawrence Wilson runs a lucrative noodle-making factory but has had to cut back production to alternative weeks because the necessary supplies have stopped coming in. \u201cThe situation here is dire and it\u2019s only getting worse,\u201d said Wilson, who said he spent his nights trying to find petrol for the car. \u201cGroceries that used to cost 2000 Sri Lankan rupees are now costing 5,000 rupees. I don\u2019t know how people on lower incomes are surviving.\u201d There are many signs that the economic crisis is turning Rajapaksa\u2019s core voting base, the Buddhist Singhalese majority, against him. An editorial in the daily newspaper Daily Mirror last week ran with the headline \u201cEmpty treasury, power cuts, fuel shortages and nonsense\u201d. His government\u2019s failure to restructure their foreign loans and refusal to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an emergency loan as Sri Lanka has done in the past \u2013 likely over fears they would impose stringent cost-cutting conditions which would be politically unpopular \u2013 has angered many, who now see it as too late. The government is still placing its hopes on the return of foreign tourism and a rise in exports, but experts say it\u2019s unlikely to solve the crisis. \u201cI blame this government,\u201d said Shanaka, who voted for Rajapaksa. \u201cI work hard at a garment factory supplying foreign brands like Nike and Victoria\u2019s Secret and Lulu Lemon. We bring good foreign income into Sri Lanka, but the government has wasted it all away with bad policies. It is a terrible time for this country.\u201d"

            "title": "After partygate: Tory government goes from crisis to crisis",
            "date": "2022-03-27T08:00:20Z",
            "content": "Last Friday morning, a group of Tory advisers, including Boris Johnson\u2019s new deputy chief of staff, David Canzini, held a meeting at Conservative party headquarters to discuss political strategy. A self-styled hard man who uses the name @DCGrumpy on Twitter, Canzini was one of those brought in to Downing Street a few weeks ago to sort the place out after \u201cpartygate\u201d, and resurrect Johnson\u2019s fortunes. \u201cCanzini is one of Lynton Crosby\u2019s people,\u201d said a party source, referring to the veteran Australian election guru who worked with Johnson on his successful 2008 mayoral campaign in London. \u201cThey think Ukraine has changed everything, taken the focus off partygate. They think, with the war, that everything can move on, and they get him re-elected in 2023 or 2024.\u201d Over the past few weeks, Canzini has been telling Tory advisers that Brexit and measures to deal with the soaring cost of living should be the two top domestic priorities for the Johnson government. Advisers say the theory seems to be that the supposed benefits of leaving the EU, including freedoms over setting taxes such as VAT, can help ease the current economic pain caused by inflation, giving a domestic coherence to the Johnson administration that it has struggled so far to find. In Friday\u2019s strategy session, there was discussion of how their ministers should best take these messages to the country. But the mood was subdued. The reason was that the process of \u201crelaunching\u201d Johnson and his government around domestic themes had just hit a major bump in the road, in the form of Rishi Sunak\u2019s spring statement two days before. Before he rose to address MPs at 12.40pm on Wednesday, Sunak\u2019s set-piece had been billed as the moment when the Tory government would show it cared about people struggling to pay their energy and food bills, as inflation headed skywards. But \u2013 despite its enthusiastic initial reception by Conservative MPs in the chamber \u2013 within hours of Sunak sitting down, it was clear the statement had bombed, both in the party and out in the country. By Thursday and Friday, even normally ultra-loyal Tory newspapers were accusing the chancellor of having failed to rise to the moment and grasp the gravity of the cost of living crisis. The Express ran a headline on its front page on Thursday asking what on earth had gone wrong for the man who, only weeks ago, was hailed as Johnson\u2019s likely successor: \u201cThe forgotten millions say: what about us?\u201d it said. Tory MPs observed that Sunak\u2019s chances of ever being prime minister appeared to have just gone up in smoke while Labour claimed that privileged Conservatives such as Sunak \u2013 one of the richest men in politics \u2013 simply could not identify with real people. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get all class war about this,\u201d a shadow cabinet minister said on Thursday \u201cbut it did look a bit like the rich boys think this crisis in people\u2019s lives is all just a political game.\u201d Before the statement, there had been tensions within the cabinet over what it should contain. Several senior ministers, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for Brexit opportunities, had wanted Sunak to cut spending to reduce inflation. Johnson, on the other hand, is said to have wanted more help for people with their mounting energy bills. But Sunak wanted to hold down spending in order to cut taxes closer to a general election, and stood firm to his own plan. What emerged was a set of offerings and political messages that satisfied almost no one. A 5p cut in fuel duty and a rise in the threshold at which national insurance will kick in were among measures for those struggling to get by. But the NI move raised questions about why Sunak had opted in his spending review last autumn to raise it by 1.25% from April \u2013 a plan that remains in place. The biggest hole in Sunak\u2019s plan, however, was that there was nothing for millions of people who are self-evidently suffering most \u2013 those on benefits. \u201cIt did not sit well with us being all about levelling up,\u201d said a former Tory minister afterwards. Despite demands for the chancellor to increase benefits by the rate of inflation, or near to it (such a move would have cost a few billion pounds if implemented for just one year), he did nothing: benefits and pensions for millions will go up by 3.1% next month as already stated, with inflation heading towards 8%. Political motives were clearly at play. In an attempt to appease Tory MPs who accuse him of being a high-tax chancellor, Sunak held back about \u00a320bn of cash in his war chest for a 1p income tax cut \u2013 but not until 2024, the probable year of the next general election. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the chancellor\u2019s actions would offset only about a quarter of the tax rises he had announced last October and warned that living standards would fall by 2.2% over the coming tax year \u2013 the biggest fall since the 1950s. What had been intended as an occasion to ease the pain had served merely to advertise the enormity of the cost of living crisis, increase national anxiety, and demonstrate the government\u2019s inability to respond. Out in the real world away from Westminster, those Tory MPs who took seats from Labour in 2019 had particular reason to worry. Johnson had led the Tories to victory and broken down the \u201cred wall\u201d in that election on promises to level up the country and deliver Brexit dividends to working people. One such red wall seat is West Bromwich East, now held by Conservative MP Nicola Richards, having before been a Labour stronghold. The constituency contains some of the poorest communities in the UK. Nearly a third of children live in relative poverty, according to government figures from 2019/20, which are likely to have risen further since then as household incomes have become squeezed. In some postcodes, more than 60% of children are living in poverty. On Friday, Keith Turner, the manager of a local food bank which he set up in West Bromwich community church in 2007, said demand was rising all the time. \u201cMost people round here are on a hiding to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are usually on prepayment meters, which are more expensive, and the rising energy costs are going to be a killer. That\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d He says it is not just food bank users who are feeling the pressure caused by rising prices \u2013 but those who run them, too. His team of about eight volunteers take donations from the local community, but nowadays they are not enough and they have to supplement them by buying in additional supplies. \u201cWhen things are going up by 30p each, it doesn\u2019t sound much on each individual item but it adds up to a significant extra cost to us,\u201d says Turner. He was disappointed by the lack of help for low earners in Sunak\u2019s statement. \u201cThey need to take a serious look at the benefits system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s being propped up by food banks. The government and civil servants must have the brains and talent to understand that it\u2019s not fit for purpose.\u201d Outside the nearby jobcentre, Alexander, a single man living in a shared house, explained that he had \u00a3250 a month to live on after paying his rent. \u201cI\u2019m looking for work picking and packing but there\u2019s nothing in West Bromwich. I don\u2019t drive, and the buses don\u2019t run early or late enough to places like Oldbury and Wolverhampton, where all the work is. I can get by at the moment but I don\u2019t know how much longer I can live like this.\u201d Sophia Bright, a single mother of two children aged four and six, said inflation was hitting her hard and eroding the income from her job at a bakery. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I can work and my mum can look after the kids but everything is so hard with only one income. There\u2019s a lot of talk about looking after \u2018hardworking families\u2019 but you just know they don\u2019t mean my kind of family, because if they did, there\u2019d be more support. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the only one working and you have kids to feed and clothe and keep warm, it\u2019s almost impossible. My rent has just gone up nearly 10% because the landlord said his costs have risen. \u201cI could barely afford heating before and my flat is small \u2013 now food is going up as well and I don\u2019t have anyone to split the cost with. There\u2019s no one more hardworking than a single mum, and the government doesn\u2019t seem to care.\u201d While she did not vote at the last election, she did vote against Brexit, which she now believes is the primary cause of rising prices. West Bromwich East had one of the highest proportions of leave voters in the UK, with 68% voting to come out of the EU in 2016. Bright thinks lots of people have now changed their minds. \u201cAll my friends voted for Brexit and I think now they\u2019re regretting it. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d vote the same again now. I tried to warn them but they didn\u2019t listen \u2013 and now look where we f***ing are.\u201d The latest Opinium poll for the Observer on Sunday finds that 58% of voters think Brexit is helping to push prices up in the shops against just 8% who do not: 49% think it is damaging the economy as a whole, while 16% do not. And 68% think the government should be doing more to ease the cost of living crisis. The danger for Johnson and his government is that these perceptions take deeper root in the coming months as the cost of living crisis intensifies. As we report today, huge battles now lie ahead, with millions of public sector workers demanding pay rises that match or exceed inflation. The unions are warning that people will leave their jobs in the NHS, teaching or the civil service unless they receive pay rises that allow them to maintain their standard of living, and reward them for getting the country through the pandemic. But Sunak \u2013 who offered nothing to people on benefits \u2013 has signalled the need for pay restraint to avoid an inflationary spiral. The two sides are miles apart. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, told the Observer on Sunday that the country is at a tipping point. Using unusually strong language, she says: \u201cMany public sector workers across services like health, education and social care say they don\u2019t know if they can take it any more. If they don\u2019t at least get a proper pay rise and help to reduce workloads, it will be the final straw.\u201d Already since Wednesday there are signs that the cost of living crisis is dividing No 10 and the Treasury as a blame game rages over the bungled spring statement. Splits are appearing across government on wider fronts. In the coming fortnight, the government is due to set out its new energy strategy to achieve independence from oil and gas supplies from overseas, including Russia, and to gain more control over energy costs as a result. But the issue is prising apart Johnson\u2019s cabinet, with ministers at loggerheads over the extent to which renewable energy projects, such as wind farms, should be increased, and nuclear power stations expanded. Suddenly the challenges facing Johnson have changed. The crisis over parties has been replaced by another that directly affects millions of people who struggle to pay their bills. As another Tory ex-minister put it on Thursday, that kind of crisis is far more dangerous for the Conservative party as a whole. \u201cIf we really think we are in a better place than we were a few weeks ago, we are deluding ourselves.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-17T11:30:27Z",
            "content": "The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, says improved economic conditions will allow the government to deliver a \u201ctargeted\u201d cost of living package in this month\u2019s budget, while gradually improving the budget bottom line. In the traditional pre-budget speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Friday, Frydenberg will set out how the 29 March budget will mark a return to normal budget settings as Australia emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, warning that \u201ccrisis level\u201d spending must stop. The Treasurer, who is facing calls to do more to ease cost of living pressures that are being exacerbated by rising fuel prices, will argue that the government needs to start pulling back on spending, or risk making inflationary pressures across the economy worse. \u201cCrisis level economic support must not become entrenched,\u201d Frydenberg will say in the speech on Friday. \u201cWith our tight labour market and our strong economic recovery, continued support at those levels would do more harm than good. It would risk putting further pressure on inflation, interest rates and cost of living.\u201d Amid mixed views within the Coalition about the benefit of cutting the fuel excise and extending a low and middle income tax offset (LMITO), the treasurer will say that any support for families to address cost of living concerns would need to be limited. Frydenberg has previously indicated that extending the LMITO \u2013 which has an annual cost of about $7bn and would not be paid out until after the next financial year \u2013 could cause the Reserve Bank to revise its inflation forecasts upwards. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has indicated the government is conscious of the hip-pocket effect of rising fuel prices, and has left open the idea of cutting or freezing the fuel excise as John Howard did in 2001. Frydenberg said the economic recovery that was now under way would deliver a \u201cfiscal dividend\u201d to the budget which would allow the government to move to its second phase of fiscal repair while also addressing cost of living concerns. \u201cIn the budget in less than two weeks\u2019 time, there will be further measures to support families to meet the cost of living pressures, in a targeted and proportionate way,\u201d he says. He points to the full employment being \u201cwithin sight\u201d, December\u2019s strong economic growth figures and private sector investment levels, as indicators of the country\u2019s stronger than expected recovery. \u201cIt is this underlying strength and resilience of Australia\u2019s economy that now enables us to transition to the second phase of our fiscal strategy,\u201d Frydenberg says. \u201cThe time for large scale economy-wide emergency support is over (and) fiscal settings need to be normalised.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Under the second phase of the fiscal strategy, the government will begin to reign in spending and start to reduce budget deficits, while also starting to \u201cstabilise and then reduce\u201d debt as a share of the economy. Federal government gross debt has reached $866bn and is forecast to surpass $1tn by 2024-25. The amount of financial support provided throughout the Covid pandemic has totalled $314bn. Commonwealth outlays on the economy and health during the Covid pandemic amounted to more than 14% of gross domestic product. Saying the government can start to reduce debt as a percentage of GDP as a result of the improving budget circumstances, Frydenberg will emphasise the importance of a gradual winding back of support, so as not to threaten the economic recovery. \u201cA sharp and sudden tightening in the fiscal settings would likely be counter-productive, undermining the economic recovery and ultimately hurting the budget.\u201d \u201cWhile Australians can be confident about their economic future and the underlying resilience of our economy, what recent years have shown, is that we live in very uncertain times. \u201cThe consistent lesson from these successful fiscal consolidations is that they are almost always achieved gradually and are underpinned by a strong economy and genuine fiscal discipline.\u201d Provided that economic growth remained higher than the interest rate Australia paid on its debt, then the debt to GDP ratio would continue to fall, \u201ceven without running surpluses.\u201d \u201cA gradual and measured pace of consolidation ensures that the economy can continue to adjust and grow, even as fiscal policy normalises. \u201cIt\u2019s about striking the right balance.\u201d Frydenberg\u2019s comments come as Thursday\u2019s labour force statistics showed unemployment fell to 4% in February, down from 4.2% in January and its lowest level since 2008. Morrison incorrectly claimed it was the lowest level in 50 years. \u201cThe unemployment rate at 4% is the lowest rate that we\u2019ve seen in almost 50 years. I was five years old when we last had an unemployment rate this low \u2013 and I think that says something,\u201d Morrison said. The employment minister, Stuart Robert, later clarified, saying it was the \u201cequal lowest\u201d, and the \u201clast time it was 4% was August 2008, February [2008] and [1974].\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I chose my words carefully to say it is the equal lowest rate \u2013 so the prime minister is absolutely correct,\u201d Robert said. The unemployment was 4.01% in August 2008 and 3.98% in February 2008. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed that 77,400 people joined the workforce in February, full-time employment grew by 121,900 jobs and part-time work fell by 44,500."

Sunak gave his outlook at the Conservatives\u2019 spring conference in Blackpool, where he was interviewed by a fellow Tory MP, Paul Maynard, who asked him how he had coped with \u201cone thing after another\u201d including the Covid pandemic, supply chain disruption and the war in Ukraine. Pressed on how difficult it had been to get perspective with \u201cso much going on\u201d, Sunak told the audience of party members: \u201cIt has been a little bit, for all of us actually \u2013 the prime minister more than anyone \u2013 just crisis to crisis. It feels like that, which isn\u2019t great. I mean, it\u2019s not great for any of us.\u201d His comments came as the party attempted to use its spring conference to draw a line under the prime minister\u2019s rocky start to the year, which led to Tory attempts to oust him over lockdown-defying parties in Downing Street. Earlier, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit minister, appeared to dismiss the partygate furore as \u201cfluff\u201d compared with the conflict in Ukraine, while Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the audience he thought the pandemic was difficult but realised he did not have \u201cthe first clue about what tough is\u201d when speaking to his Ukrainian counterpart. Sunak, considered a frontrunner to be the next Tory leader, did not mention the various troubles facing the prime minister, who is still under police investigation over the No 10 parties. But in his interview with Maynard, he gave strong hints that he may take action to help with the cost of living in the spring statement. He is thought to be weighing up cutting fuel duty as petrol and diesel prices hit record highs. He told the audience tax rises were \u201cdone\u201d and \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d were over, after the national insurance rise that would come into force in April, coinciding with high inflation and rising energy bills. He said he had \u201csympathy\u201d for those struggling with the cost of living in the face of \u201cglobal inflationary forces\u201d, and would consider taking action \u201cwhere we can make a difference\u201d. Sunak promised at the last budget that he wanted to cut taxes in the future, but he restated that aim even more strongly in Blackpool. \u201cI made this very clear at the budget in the autumn, that is done. We\u2019ve made the difficult decisions that we have to make. My priority going forward is to cut taxes,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Moscow\u2019s stock market has rallied after share trading resumed for the first time since being suspended when the Ukraine invasion began nearly a month ago, although the US dismissed Thursday\u2019s limited reopening as a \u201ccharade\u201d. The market initially rose by more than 11% when a limited, shortened trading session got under way on the Moscow Exchange. But the rally lost some momentum, with the Moex index of blue-chip shares ending the day 4.4% higher. It was its first session since 25 February when trading was halted after sanctions sent Russian equities tumbling. Energy companies and commodity producers led the gainers, reflecting the rise in gas, oil and raw material prices since the war began, but some companies exposed to the extensive sanctions imposed on Russia fell. Just 33 of the 50 securities on the rouble-denominated Moex were trading. Stocks that were trading were supported by new restrictions, including a bar on traders short-selling shares they do not own, while foreign investors cannot sell stocks until 1 April. Reports earlier this month that Russia planned to channel up to 1tn roubles (\u00a37.7bn) from its national wealth fund to buy stocks could also have encouraged buying. The US was scathing about Moscow\u2019s attempt to restart equities trading. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a charade, a Potemkin market opening,\u201d said Daleep Singh, the US deputy national security advisor for international economics, referring to fake villages supposedly created for the Russian empress Catherine the Great to give the illusion of prosperity. \u201cAfter keeping its markets closed for nearly a month, Russia announced it will only allow 15% of listed shares to trade, foreigners are prohibited from selling their shares, and short selling in general has been banned. Meanwhile, Russia has made clear they are going to pour government resources into artificially propping up the shares of companies that are trading,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a real market and not a sustainable model \u2013 which only underscores Russia\u2019s isolation from the global financial system.\u201d Traders agreed that the heavy restrictions meant Moscow was not a properly functional market. \u201cThe Moex rallied in early trade, but that is what happens if lots of people can\u2019t sell,\u201d Neil Wilson of Markets.com pointed out. The chemical firm PhosAgro, which produces fertilisers and phosphates, surged by 26% while oil and gas group Tatneft jumped 20%, and energy giant Gazprom gained 13.4%. Nickel and palladium miner Nornickel rose 10%. The airline Aeroflot sank 16%, the top faller, with Russian planes banned from EU and UK airspace. The state-owned bank VTB dropped 5.5%. having been hit by western sanctions. The oil pipeline operator Transneft fell 6%, and children\u2019s toy retail chain Detsky Mir lost 5.5%. Despite Thursday\u2019s recovery, the Moex is still down almost a third this year, having weakened in the run-up to the Ukraine invasion and plunged when it began, before being suspended. The rouble fell by nearly 10%, to about 98 roubles to the dollar, reversing Wednesday\u2019s gains after Vladimir Putin said \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries would be forced to pay for their gas purchases in roubles rather than dollars."

            "content": "Time to wrap up - here are today\u2019s main stories: Goodnight. GW Back on the cost of living crisis, UK farmers are warning that milk production is starting to fall as sharp rises in cost of fuel, feed, and fertiliser outstrip increases in farm-gate prices. My colleague Zoe Wood reports: \u201cSomething has to give and if the milk price doesn\u2019t give, then the producers will,\u201d says Oxfordshire dairy farmer David Christensen in a stark assessment of the peril his industry is facing as soaring costs push farm finances into the red. Christensen, whose family business manages a herd of about 1,000 cows, says costs were already going up as a result of the upheaval caused by the pandemic and Brexit, but the war in Ukraine has \u201cturbocharged inflation to levels the like of which I\u2019ve never seen in 30 years of farming\u201d. He is a member of Arla, Britain\u2019s largest dairy co-operative, which has sounded the alarm as the financial squeeze forces UK milk production to fall \u2013 a trend that could threaten future milk supplies. Ash Amirahmadi, the managing director of Arla Foods UK, said producing fresh milk had for some time been delivering \u201clittle to no profitability for farmers\u201d but the situation was now acute as the Ukraine crisis stoked farm cost inflation. Shares in UK engineeering group Rolls-Royce surged in late trading in London, finishing 19% higher as the top FTSE 100 riser. The late rally in Rolls-Royce shares came after the Betaville website, which covers deals news and gossip, reported speculation that the aerospace and defence group could soon be involved in a significant corporate transaction - such as a merger or even a takeover offer. As Seeking Alpha explains: Rolls-Royce spikes after a Betaville \u201cuncooked alert\u201d says the company may be involved in a \u201csignificant corporate transaction\u201d that could include a merger or takeover deal. According to the Betaville blog post, an unidentified suitor may be in the early stages of considering a combination with Rolls-Royce. The post is billed as an \u2018uncooked alert\u2019, which is defined as \u201cMarket gossip as Betaville receives it\u201d. It seems to have been the catalyst for the share price jump into the close of trading. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson tells us: \u201cwe do not comment on rumour and speculation\u201d. The FTSE 100 ended 16 points higher, up 0.2% at 7483 points. European stock markets have ended a choppy week with some modest gains. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.1% higher, but was 0.2% lower for the week. Germany\u2019s DAX gained 0.2%, and Italy\u2019s FISE MIB rose 0.6%, with the US-EU deal to cut dependency on Russian gas providing some relief. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says the markets are \u201cbroadly in consolidation\u201d at present. We appear to have hit a point in which the initial shock of the Ukraine invasion has passed and markets have corrected back to a point where the economic risks are deemed to be priced in. In the absence of any significant developments, equity markets have come to a relative standstill and could remain that way until we see some progress. Volatility remains in the commodity space which is contributing to the day-to-day fluctuations in equity markets. Higher commodity prices mean a further squeeze on the global economy this year and more inflation at a time when central banks are already accelerating tightening plans after falling behind the curve. Oil has reversed its earlier losses after an attack on one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-run oil company Aramco\u2019s storage facilities. AP explains: A raging fire erupted Friday at an oil depot in Jiddah ahead of a Formula One race in the Saudi city. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed it was an attack by the group among a barrage of others. While Saudi Arabia and its state-run oil behemoth Saudi Aramco did not immediately acknowledge the blaze, it was centered on the same fuel depot that the Houthis had attacked in recent days. Brent crude is now up 1% at $120 per barrel, having dipped towards $115 earlier. Jewellery group Tiffany\u2019s has said it will stop buying new diamonds mined in Russia. The move follows pressure on the jewellery industry to cut ties with Russia following the Ukraine war. But, as Bloomberg\u2019s Jeannette Neumann, explains here, there are some caveats. The Russian stock market fell back today, wiping out much of Thursday\u2019s rally when the exchange reopened for the first time in almost a month. The Moex share index slid by 3.66% today, with every sector in the red, having gained 4.4% yesterday. Limited stock trading resumed yesterday with several restrictions to prop up shares, including a ban on short-selling, and on foreign investors selling stocks. That helped to spark a rally yesterday, when oil and commodity stocks jumped. Analysts have pointed out that these curbs meant Moscow\u2019s market wasn\u2019t operating properly, while the US dubbed it a \u201cPotemkin market opening\u201d. But despite these measures, airline Aeroflot shed another 18% today, on top of Thursday\u2019s 16% drop. Sanctions have barred its jets from EU and UK airspace. Gas giant Gazprom fell 12%, after the US and EC agreed a deal to cut Europe\u2019s dependency on Russian gas. Steel giant Severstal fell 9%, with reports that sanctions were holding up a loan payment to ite creditors, putting it on the verge of default. Before Thursday, stocks had not traded on Moscow\u2019s exchange since February 25, the day after Putin sent thousands of troops into Ukraine. The move prompted Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically, which are driving the country into a deep recession. The rouble-denominated Moex is now down 34% so far this year, having plunged when the invasion began in February before trading was suspended. In dollar terms, it\u2019s almost halved. Dmitry Polevoy, an analyst at Locko-Invest in Moscow, told Bloomberg: \u201cYesterday, the main theme was hot money searching for tactical buying. Today, we see some selling plus more activity from people who stayed aside yesterday seem to be driving the move.\u201d \u201cPrice-discovery will take time as it is hard to correctly assess new fair prices. The sanctions story is still open-ended.\u201d With the slump in the rouble driving up prices, some investors may be looking to stocks as a hedge against inflation. US consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level in 11 years, as worries about inflation and the Ukraine war mount. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment report found that confidence declined in March due to falling real incomes, which recently accelerated as fuel prices rose sharply. The index fell to 59.4 this month, down from 62.8 in February and 84.9 last March. That\u2019s slightly worse than the preliminary estimate of 59.7 earlier this month. The year-ahead expected inflation rate rose to its highest level since 1981 and expected gasoline prices posted their largest monthly upward surge in decades. Personal finances were expected to worsen in the year ahead by the largest proportion since the surveys started in the mid-1940s. University of Michigan economist Richard Curtin, director of the surveys, says: Just when difficult decisions need to be made about monetary and fiscal policies, consumers have expressed loss in confidence in government economic policies. Moreover, most consumers are uncertain about the ultimate impact Putin\u2019s war will have on their personal economic situation. US home sales fell last month, as rising mortgage rates and low availability of properties hit the sector. Pending home sales (signed contracts to buy existing homes), fell 4.1% in February, the fourth monthly drop in a row. That suggests the market has cooled ahead of the spring sellin season, with mortgage rates have risen as the markets anticipated a flurry of interest rate rises this year. In New York, stocks have opened a little higher with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 gaining 0.2%, or 9 points, to 4,529. There\u2019s more action in the bond market, where the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds have hit a fresh two-year high. That shows investors are anticipating a more aggressive path of interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve, to try to curb inflation. The 10-year yield has hit 2.475%, its highest level since May 2019, as traders sell the bond (yields rise when bond prices fall). German bank Berenberg has predicted that the UK economy will stagnate over the next quarter, or worse, as the shock of the Ukraine invasion hits growth. Berenberg have also cut their forecast for eurozone growth, pointing to the tumble in UK consumer confidence and business expectations. Although initial measures of activity for March, such as the PMI reports, have been stronger than expected, forward-looking confidence indicators point to trouble ahead, Berenberg says: Due to the shock of a major European war and a surge in inflation, consumer confidence and business expectations are flashing red, having plunged to levels only witnessed during the great financial and euro crises, and the early phase of the pandemic. Amid unusually high uncertainty, we now expect UK real GDP to flatline in Q2, instead of growing by 0.1% qoq, and Eurozone GDP to expand by just 0.2% qoq, instead of 0.6%. The risks to our new Q2 calls remain tilted to the downside. Berenberg predict that the shock to confidence will lessen from May, when we may have more clarity about the outcome of the Ukraine war and any further sanctions on Russia. But inflation is expected to stay very elevated until late-2022 as rising food prices initially offset a gradual fall in oil prices \u2013 from $120 per barrel, towards $90 by early 2023. And there is also a danger that Europe\u2019s economy could suffer stagnation, or even a modest contraction, that lasts beyond the initial shock in Q2. Berenberg say this scenario is unlikely, but clearly not impossible. As any EU embargo on imports of Russian oil and gas would probably hurt more in winter when energy demand peaks, any rebound in economic activity during Q3 could be short-lived. In a worst-case scenario (15% risk), Europe could face a period of de facto stagflation during 2022, where real GDP stagnates, or even falls modestly, and inflation surges by even more than expected. That could delay any robust rebound until early 2023 when energy demand starts to moderate and Europe manages to secure sufficient energy supplies from non-Russian producers Joe Biden has agreed a landmark energy supply deal with the EU under which the US will increase transatlantic gas deliveries, in the hope of weakening the power the Kremlin wields thanks to its natural resources. Speaking in Brussels after the deal was agreed on Friday, the US president said Vladimir Putin exploited Russia\u2019s status as Europe\u2019s main supplier of gas to \u201ccoerce and manipulate his neighbours\u201d and that the proceeds of gas and oil sales \u201cdrive his war machine\u201d. He said the partnership with the EU (see earlier post) would strip Putin of that weapon by reducing Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian energy, as well as the continent\u2019s overall gas demand. Under the plan, the US and other nations will increase exports of seaborne liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe by 15bn cubic metres this year. Even larger shipment volumes would be delivered in the future, he promised. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Gazprom to accept payment in roubles for its natural gas exports to Europe, Reuters reports. The gas behemoth has four days left to work out how to move over billions of dollars in sales, the Kremlin said. After the West imposed sanctions on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine, Putin on Wednesday fired the first major salvo of Moscow\u2019s response to what the Kremlin casts as a declaration of economic war against the world\u2019s biggest nuclear power. Putin said that Russia, which supplies 40% of Europe\u2019s gas, would expect payment for natural gas in roubles, one of the sharpest turns in Russian energy politics since the Soviets built gas pipelines to Europe from Siberia in the early 1970s. It is also a potential headache for Gazprom, the world\u2019s biggest natural gas company by reserves. \u201cThere is an instruction to Gazprom from the president of the Russian Federation to accept payments in roubles,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said that Gazprom, a company so powerful in Russia that it is considered to be \u201ca state within a state\u201d, had four days left to work out a system for rouble payment. \u201cThis information will be brought to the purchasers of Gazprom products,\u201d Peskov said. Here\u2019s the full story: Gazprom has 4 days to work out rouble payments for gas exports - Kremlin says Yesterday, the leaders of Germany and Italy said that Russia\u2019s demand that \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries use roubles to buy its oil and gas could breach supply contracts. The executive director of the IEA, Fatih Birol, called a \u201csecurity threat\u201d. The UK car sector had a tough February, with shortages of semiconductors continuing to limit production of cars and engines. UK engine production fell by over 30% year-on-year last month, to 117,551 units, trade body SMMT reports, taking engine output so far this year down almost a quarter. Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said, \u201cFebruary\u2019s engine production figures further highlight the challenging start to the year for manufacturers. With new pressures arising from soaring energy costs, as well as the continued impact of the global semiconductor shortage, the UK\u2019s competitiveness is at risk. We need urgent action to alleviate business costs for manufacturers and encourage the investment needed to futureproof the sector and the skilled jobs it creates as the industry transitions to new technologies.\u201d Overall UK car production was down 41% year-on-year, the eighth monthly fall in a row. Output of commercial vehicles jumped 92%, but that was compared to the worst February on record last year, when supply chain shortages, new customs processes and prolonged lockdown measures all hit the sector. Here\u2019s a round-up of reaction to the unexpected 0.3% drop in UK retail sales last month: Karl Thompson, Economist at CEBR: Retail sales volumes unexpectedly fell in February, despite the easing of the Omicron wave and the lifting of all remaining restrictions at the end of the month. Non-store retailing saw the sharpest monthly fall, with a contraction also seen in food store sales volumes. Despite some evidence of consumer activity shifting away from online shopping and toward in-person retail and non-retail environments, price rises in excess of earnings growth are now eroding consumer spending power overall. The squeeze on household budgets is set to worsen over the coming months, exerting further downward pressure on retail sales.\u201d Bethany Beckett of Capital Economics: The small fall in retail sales in February probably had more to do with the shift back towards non-retail spending and the impact of Storm Eunice than it did the cost of living crisis. But, with further rises in inflation and interest rates looking likely, we are downbeat on the outlook for overall spending this year. Karen Johnson, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking: \u201cFebruary saw Covid restrictions lifted and the mass return of workers to their offices. This led to notable increases in spending on clothing (as people kitted out their new wardrobes), and furniture (as customers returned to showrooms with the confidence to both try products and make purchases). It also led to a reduction in the proportion of sales being made online versus last year, and suggests the industry has now come to the other side of its pandemic-driven \u2018bounce\u2019 in online spend.\u201d In the markets, European stock are ending the week with gains. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 0.3% at 7491 points, around its levels before the Ukraine invasion began. The blue-chip index is on track for its third weekly rise in a row, as it continued to recover from its plunge early in the war. But housebuilders are down around 3%, after JP Morgan lowered its price targets. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC are both up around 0.8%. Oil prices have dropped around 2%, after the EU didn\u2019t agree any new sanctions on Russian oil this week. Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, explains: With inflation rates around the world skyrocketing amid the surge in most key commodity and raw material prices, the EU\u2019s decision not to add to its long list of sanctions against Moscow has offered some respite to the markets. There is a growing fear of recession, not just in the euro area but globally too, the longer these price spikes last and the more amplified they become. NATO is doing everything it can to support Ukraine without getting itself entangled in a direct military confrontation with Russia. But the downside of that is a potentially long drawn-out war and subsequently, a prolonged market fallout. Oil prices pulled back yesterday after hitting two-week highs as no new significant economic measures were announced by the US or the EU. WTI and Brent futures were extending their declines today, sliding by more than 2%. Billionaire Sir Christopher Hohn has urged shareholders to vote against bank directors who lobby against climate action while making net-zero promises, saying this was greenwashing\u201d Our environment reporter Helena Horton explains: The hedge fund manager, who once had Britain\u2019s highest salary at \u00a31m a day, made headlines when he donated \u00a350,000 to climate activist group Extinction Rebellion. Hohn, who was once Rishi Sunak\u2019s boss at hedge fund TCI, is also one of the nation\u2019s biggest philanthropists, and has pumped billions into his own charity, The Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation. He said: \u201cAny bank making a net zero promise while actively lobbying against necessary climate regulation \u2013 such as mandatory disclosure of borrowers\u2019 emissions and climate action plans \u2013 is greenwashing. Shareholders should vote against the directors of banks who are hiding their exposure to climate risk.\u201d Less than half of the 5p per litre cut to fuel duty announced in Wednesday\u2019s spring statement had been passed onto motorists yesterday. The AA reports that petrol prices at the pumps were down just 2.71p per litre on average on Thursday, with diesel only 1.59p cheaper. On Tuesday, petrol and diesel pump prices had jumped to new records yet again, at 167.30p and 179.72p a litre respectively. Yesterday, petrol averaged 164.59p a litre and diesel 178.13p. The fuel duty cut (which is worth 6p/litre once you include VAT) began at 6pm on Wednesday night, just a few hours after Rishi Sunak\u2019s statement [the chancellor then visited a Sainsbury\u2019s petrol forecourt to fuel someone else\u2019s car] Luke Bosdet, the AA\u2019s fuel price spokesman, says it\u2019s \u2018very disappointing\u2019 that prices didn\u2019t drop faster. \u201cThe Chancellor rode to the rescue of drivers on Wednesday and even before the 6pm start of the fuel duty cut drivers were reporting the price cut at some Asda forecourts. \u201cAlthough we have to accept that, for many forecourts, the duty cut comes through with the next delivery of fuel, the size of the fall is very disappointing. I expect the Government will be watching very closely to see if pump prices reflect more of the fuel duty cut over the weekend.\u201d \u201cThe truth is that, while diesel wholesale costs have been climbing, petrol\u2019s have fallen substantially since the peaks of 7/8 March. That should have brought a further 6p-a-litre cut in pump prices, effectively doubling the saving from the fuel duty cut. \u201cFor now, the message to drivers is clear: head to the cheaper forecourts \u2013 you can\u2019t miss them.\u201d The Petrol Retailers Association warned on Wednesday that retailers\u2019 current petrol and diesel stocks had been purchased before the duty cut came in. Gordon Balmer, Executive Director of the PRA, explained: Retailers are holding duty-paid stock which will be sold before the fuel duty cuts come in. To give the motorist an immediate discount at the pumps, the Chancellor would have to backdate the fuel duty cut to 1 March,\u201d Business confidence in Germany has tumbled this month, as the Ukraine war hammers the economic outlook for Europe\u2019s largest economy. The Ifo research institute reports that \u201csentiment in the German economy has collapsed\u201d since the war in Ukraine began. Its Business Climate Index has fallen to 90.8 points in March, down from 98.5 points in February. Ther was a record collapse in expectations of 13.3 points (even worse than the 11.8 drop in March 2020, when the pandemic hit), as companies face the economic implications of the conflict, such as high energy prices and supply chain problems. Here\u2019s the details: In manufacturing, the index fell faster than ever before. Companies\u2019 expectations also saw a record drop, flipping from optimism to pronounced pessimism. Moreover, companies now rated their business outlook as extremely uncertain. Assessments of the current situation were also lower. In the service sector, too, the business climate worsened notably. This was due to a conspicuous drop in expectations. The outlook for the coming months is particularly bleak in the logistics industry. In contrast, service providers left their assessments of the current situation practically unchanged. In trade, the Business Climate Index crashed. The expectations indicator saw a record collapse. Assessments of the current situation, however, were almost unchanged and remain positive. In construction, the business climate deteriorated significantly. This, too, was driven by considerably more pessimistic expectations. Assessments of the current situation also worsened, but a majority of construction companies are still satisfied with their current business. Carsten Brzeski of ING says: The risk is high that the economic implications of the war are much more of a structural game-changer for the European and particularly the German economy than the pandemic has ever been. With high energy and commodity prices for a protracted period, possibly even energy supply interruptions, and an acceleration of deglobalisation, possibly Cold War 2.0, an export-oriented economy highly dependent on energy imports will suffer. The risk of another contraction in the first quarter of the year and hence a technical recession is high, Brzeski adds. IFO, though, suggest Germany could avoid recession this quarter (the economy shrank in Q4 2021). The United States and European Commission have agreed a new partnership to cut Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian energy. Under the plan, the US and partners will \u201cstrive\u201d to deliver at least 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe this year, the White House says. Even larger shipments would be delivered in the future, with both sides aiming to boost deliveries from the US to 50 bcm per year over time. The pledge is part of a new Task Force agreed by President Joe Biden and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, to reduce Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian fossil fuels and strengthen European energy security. The White House says: It will work to ensure energy security for Ukraine and the EU in preparation for next winter and the following one while supporting the EU\u2019s goal to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. The EC is aiming to cut EU dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies of the fuel \u201cwell before 2030\u201d, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. At a joint press conference in Brussels, Von der Leyen said: \u201cWe aim to reduce this dependency on Russian fossil fuels and get rid of it. This can only be achieved through... additional gas supplies, including LNG deliveries. \u201cWe as Europeans want to diversify away from Russia towards suppliers that we trust, that are our friends, that are reliable. In an attempt to keep climate goals on track, the new Task Force will try to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of all new LNG infrastructure. That will include using clean energy to power onsite operations, reducing methane leakage, and building \u201cclean and renewable hydrogen-ready infrastructure\u201d. The EC will also try to ensure demand for approximately 50 bcm/year of additional U.S. LNG until 2030. The Commission says this will happen: ...on the understanding that the price formula of LNG supplies to the EU should reflect long-term market fundamentals, and stability of the cooperation of the demand and supply side, and that this growth be consistent with our shared net zero goals. In particular, price formula should include consideration of Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price and other stabilising factors. At the same time, the partnership will also attempt to cut demand for fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. The White House says: Immediate reductions in gas demand can be achieved through energy efficiency solutions such as ramping up demand response devices, including smart thermostats, and deployment of heat pumps. The US and EC will also work to speed up planning and approval for renewable energy projects and strategic energy cooperation on technologies such as offshore wind. The EC says the Task Force will also: Developing a strategy to accelerate workforce development to support the rapidly deployment of clean energy technologies, including an expansion of solar and wind. Collaborating to advance the production and use of clean and renewable hydrogen to displace unabated fossil fuels and cut greenhouse gas emissions, including by investing in technology development and supporting infrastructure. London-listed Russian gold miner Petropavlovsk has warned that it cannot sell gold to its main lender, Gazprombank, after the bank was sanctioned in the UK on Thursday. Petropavlovsk is also blocked from making an interest payment to Gazprombank today due to sanctions, putting the company in turmoil. Petropavlovsk told shareholders that it has a $200m loan with Gazprombank (GPB) -- under which it agrees to sells all its gold production to GPB. Howwever, sanctions now prohibit it from selling any more gold to GPB at present. Petropavlovsk adds that: ...restrictions on purchasing and selling gold in Russia may make it challenging to find an alternative purchaser for the Group\u2019s gold output. The company operates three gold mines in the far east of Russia, at Pioneer, Malomir and Albyn. Petropavlovsk is due to make an interest payment of $560,000 today to GPB, but warns \u201cthe Company is currently prohibited from making such payment under the Regulations.\u201d The company is now \u201curgently considering\u201d the implications for its activities and financing arrangements with its advisers. Shares in Petropavlovsk have tumbled 21% this morning to 1.4p, and have slumped 90% since the Ukraine invasion began. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has called for the chief executive of P&amp;O Ferries to resign over the sacking of 800 workers and pledged to force the ferry company to reverse the move and pay its crew the minimum wage. Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs on Thursday that his company broke the law by sacking the 800 workers without consultation. Shapps said Hebblethwaite performance in front of the transport and business committee was \u201cbrazen, breathtaking, and showed incredible arrogance\u201d. Speaking to Sky News, Shapps said: \u201cI cannot believe that he can stay in that role having admitted to deliberately going out and using a loophole \u2013 well break the law \u2013 but also use a loophole. \u201cThey flagged their ships through Cyprus avoided having to tell anybody about this, or they felt they did. And even though they know they\u2019ve broken the law, what they\u2019ve done is to pay people off in such a way to try and buy their silence. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d February\u2019s drop in retail sales is a sign of things to come for retailers, warns Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club: \u201c2022 has got off to a mixed start for retailers, and things will soon get tougher. Though covid cases have been on the rise again of late, this doesn\u2019t appear to be discouraging consumers from engaging in social consumption activities. A normalisation of spending patterns back towards activities such as eating out and going to the cinema is likely to mean less spending in the retail sector. \u201cThis headwind will be compounded by the intensifying cost of living squeeze. The EY ITEM Club now expects inflation to average well over 6% this year and, with this week\u2019s Spring Statement offering limited support, there is still likely to be the biggest squeeze on household finances for more than a decade. Some households may be able to dip into savings accumulated during the pandemic, but many won\u2019t have that luxury. So, retail demand is likely to come under increasing pressure as we move through 2022.\u201d \u201cAfter a buoyant January, retail sales fell back a little last month,\u201d said Heather Bovill, ONS deputy director for surveys and economic indicators. \u201cThere was a notable decline for companies that predominantly trade online, following a strong performance over the festive and new year period.\u201d If you strip out fuel sales, retail sales volumes fell by 0.7% last month. With petrol prices at record levels, the increased demand for petrol and diesel would have left less for other spending. The retail sales report also shows the impact of inflation. Although retail sales volumes were down 0.3% month-on-month in February, the amount spent rose by 0.7%. Customers spent more, to get less. Petrol sales rose in February, as the lifting of Plan B restrictions in England at the end of January 2022 increased travel. Automotive fuel sales volumes rose by 3.6% during the month, and were above their pre-coronavirus February 2020 levels for the first time, the ONS says. Just in: British retail sales fell unexpectedly in February. Online shopping dropped back towards pre-pandemic levels, winter storms kept people away from the high street, and spending at food and drink retailers dropped as customers returned to pubs and restaurants. The Office for National Statistics reports that sales volumes were down by 0.3% month-on-month, below the 0.6% rise expected by economists. Internet sales fell sharply -- non-store retailing sales volumes were down 4.8% over the month. Sales volumes at food stores fell by 0.2% in February 2022, with large falls in alcohol and tobacco stores. This \u201cmay be linked to higher spending in pubs and restaurants as confidence increased in going out\u201d, the ONS says. Non-food stores sales volumes rose by 0.6% in February, though, with growth at clothing (13.2%) and department stores (1.3%). That may be due to \u201cwider socialising and the return to the office following the lifting of Plan B restrictions at the end of January\u201d But sales volumes at household goods stores dropped 2.5%, and \u201cother non-food stores\u201d dropped by 7%, with \u201csome retailers suggesting the stormy weather during the month had impacted footfall\u201d, the ONS says. The UK was buffetted by three storms in February - Dudley, Eunice and Franklin. February\u2019s fall follows a 1.9% rise in retail sales volumes in January. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK consumer confidence has plummeted for a fourth month in a row as the Ukraine war, the surging cost of living, and the pandemic leave people facing a \u2018wall of worry\u2019. GfK\u2019s consumer sentiment index dropped by five points to minus 31 in March, levels last seen in October and November 2020. With inflation at a 30-year high, and heading to 8% next month, people are much gloomier about their personal finances, and the general economic situation as the war in Ukraine continues. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, warns there is an \u201cunmistakable sense of crisis in our numbers\u201d. Consumers across the UK are experiencing the impact of soaring living costs with 30-year-high levels of inflation, record-high fuel and food prices, a recent interest-rate hike and the prospect of more increases to come, and higher taxation too \u2013 all against a background of stagnant pay rises that cannot compensate for the financial duress. This is the fourth month in a row that UK consumer confidence has dropped. \u201cWith a headline score of -31, we are at a level last seen in October and November 2020 when Covid numbers were rising. Confidence in our personal financial situation and in the wider economy are severely depressed while the daily news of unimaginable suffering from a horrifying war in Europe and rising COVID numbers at home is adding to the bleak mood. The outlook for consumer confidence is not good; it\u2019s certain there\u2019s more bad news to come.\u201d The forecast for personal finances over the next 12 months fell four points to -18 -- 28 points lower than this time last year. Expectations for the general economic situation over the next year dropped by six points to -49; 32 points lower than March 2021. Wednesday\u2019s spring statement brought little help for those facing the toughest squeeze, with economists at the Resolution Foundation warning 1.3 million people will fall into absolute poverty next year.

            "date": "2022-03-04T20:01:19Z",
            "content": "The London stock market has suffered its biggest weekly losses since the start of the global pandemic in March 2020, as investors took fright at the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Shares plunged in the City following news of a fire and Russian capture of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, with the one-day drop of more than 250 points in the FTSE 100 index taking the weekly loss to 6.7%. European bourses also recorded big falls amid concerns that the impact of the fighting in Ukraine would spread westwards across the continent. David Malpass, president of the World Bank, told the BBC the war was a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the global economy. Currency and commodity markets also ended the week amid fresh signs of turbulence, with a flight to the safe haven of the US dollar and the highest crude oil prices in a decade. Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices reached record levels in both Britain and the EU. The UK National Balancing Point (NBP) benchmark soared above 500p a therm at one point, smashing through the previous all-time high set in December, amid a prolonged surge that caused the collapse of a series of household gas suppliers. The FTSE 100 index in London finished 251 points lower on Friday at 6,998, a 3.5% drop. The German and French stock markets fell more than 4%, taking the Dax in Frankfurt to its lowest levels since late 2020, while the Italian index tumbled 6.2% to its lowest level in more than a year. Europe\u2019s Euro Stoxx 600 index closed at its lowest level in almost a year. Nervous investors were taking few chances ahead of what they expect to be another tough week when markets reopen on Monday. Liam Peach, emerging markets analyst at Capital Economics, said: \u201cRussia has fallen into chaos and we\u2019ll get a clearer sense next week of the impact that sanctions are having on the economy. A dollar bond repayment by Gazprom on Monday will be a litmus test of the government\u2019s (and government-linked companies\u2019) willingness to pay external debt, while inflation figures for the week just gone by (due on Wednesday) are likely to show that the collapse in the ruble started to push inflation higher.\u201d Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cThe FTSE 100 has had a shocker of a week, posting its largest decline since March 2020, and below the 7,000 level to its lowest point since August last year. In terms of weekly performance, the best performers have been in defence and commodities, with weekly gains for BAE Systems, and the likes of Glencore, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta.\u201d Mining and energy stocks have benefited from the boom in commodity prices which saw the price of Brent crude hitting $120 a barrel at one stage. After a jump of $25 a barrel in the past month, the cost of crude ended the week at $115 a barrel. Wheat prices rose to a 14-year high, while corn prices reached their highest level in eight years. Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM said: \u201cRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine means that fears over supply will remain front and centre.\u201d He said there is a \u201cnew sense of urgency\u201d for the west to try and strike a nuclear deal with Iran. Russia\u2019s military invasion of Ukraine more than a week ago has raised recession risks for the US and European economies \u2013 and far more so for Russia, which has been isolated economically by widening sanctions, economists said. US stocks on Wall Street also fell as concerns over the escalating conflict in Ukraine overshadowed the latest non-farm payrolls data that showed a sharp pick-up in jobs growth last month, and a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.8%. As stock markets slid, investors piled into investments regarded as safer \u2013 gold, currencies like the dollar and yen, and government bonds. British 10-year government bonds recorded their biggest weekly rise in more than a decade. As gilts were in demand, this pushed their yields, or returns to investors, down the most since November 2011. Yields go down when bond prices go up. On the currency markets, sterling lost 1% against the dollar to $1.3210. War in Ukraine has boosted demand for safe-haven investments such as gold. Spot gold rose 1.5% to $1,965 an ounce. The Moscow stock exchange stayed closed all week, while the rouble fell to record lows amid wider sanctions on Russia. The rouble hit a record low of 118.35 per dollar in Moscow on Thursday, and ended the week at 105 per dollar. Caleb Thibodeau, of Validus Risk Management, said: \u201cEvolving into arguably the most serious security threat to continental Europe since the Second World War, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia couldn\u2019t have come at a more economically precarious time for the EU.\u201d"

The FTSE 100 index in London has gained 63 points to 7,537, a 0.85% rise, while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC 40 have rallied more than 3%, and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is 2.4% ahead. Bond yields have also jumped, and the euro rose 1.3% to $1.1127. US stocks opened higher on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones climbing 244 points to 35,200, up 0.7%. Russia has promised to dramatically scale back its military operations in northern Ukraine, easing supply concerns that have sent commodity prices surging. Ukraine has proposed adopting neutral status with international guarantees to protect it from future attacks. Oil prices have fallen by more than 5%, extending Monday\u2019s selloff, with Brent crude falling more than $5 to $107.03 a barrel while US light crude slid to $100.77 a barrel. On the metal markets, aluminium led industrial metals lower. Russia is a major producer of aluminium, nickel and copper. Benchmark three-month aluminium fell 5.4% to $3,410 a tonne, after hitting a record high of $4,073.50 a tonne on 7 March. Our main stories today: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care! \u2013 JK Crude oil is selling off for a second day, with Brent crude now down $6 to $106.56 a barrel. US light crude has also lost more than 5% and is just a touch above $100 a barrel. Oil started the day lower as rising Covid infections prompted a new lockdown in Shanghai, China\u2019s financial hub, which is expected to lead to a drop in oil demand. As Russia\u2019s defence minister announced Moscow would cut military activity around Kyiv and Chernigiv and there were signs of progress in the peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, fears around oil supplies receded. The rally on European stock markets is gathering steam and bond yields jumped after Ukrainian and Russian negotiators reported some progress in their peace talks, with the first face-to-face talks in nearly three weeks. Russia\u2019s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow has decided to \u201cradically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernigiv\u201d in order to \u201cincrease mutual trust and create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine.\u201d Ukraine proposed adopting neutral status in exchange for security guarantees. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 1.9%, with markets in Paris and Milan up 3%, while Frankfurt is 2.6% ahead. Bond yields \u2013 the return to investors \u2013 rose sharply, with Germany\u2019s 10-year yield, the benchmark in Europe, rising as much as 15 basis points to 0.741, the highest since early 2018, while the two-year yield turned positive for the first time since 2014. The euro extended gains against the dollar, rising 1.2% to $1.1116. A \u00a338m superyacht, owned by a Russian businessman, has been seized as part of sanctions against Russia, in Canary Wharf, east London, the UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps announced. It is the first vessel to be detained in the UK. Officials boarded \u201cPhi,\u201d named after the mathematical concept, on Tuesday. It is 58.5 metres long, and has an \u201cinfinite wine cellar\u201d and a freshwater swimming pool. The vessel was in London for a superyacht awards ceremony and was due to depart at noon. Shapps said: Today we\u2019ve detained a \u00a338m superyacht and turned an icon of Russia\u2019s power and wealth into a clear and stark warning to Putin and his cronies. Detaining the Phi proves, yet again, that we can and will take the strongest possible action against those seeking to benefit from connections to Putin\u2019s regime. The Department for Transport said it worked with the National Crime Agency and the Border Force maritime investigation bureau to identify and detain the vessel. It declined to reveal the name of the owner. The department described Phi\u2019s ownership as \u201cdeliberately well-hidden\u201d. The vessel is registered to a company based in Saint Kitts and Nevis and carries a Maltese flag. The ship made its maiden voyage last year after being built in the Netherlands. The UK government is aiming to triple the number of solar panels, more than quadruple offshore wind power and double onshore wind and nuclear energy by 2030, in a move that could lower bills for consumers and reduce the UK\u2019s reliance on foreign energy suppliers such as Russia, writes Mark Sweney. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business minister, has put forward the targets as part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\u2019s plans for inclusion in the upcoming energy security white paper. The paper has faced delays because the cost of approving at least six nuclear power stations as part of an expansion of the UK\u2019s renewable energy strategy has been debated at the Treasury. Britons are drinking cocktails in record numbers at home and in bars. According to the drinks group AG Barr, consumers are opting for a pornstar martini or mojito in a trend accelerated during the pandemic, reports my colleague Mark Sweney. The Scottish company, which makes Irn-Bru, Rubicon and cocktail brand Funkin, said 7.4 million people drink cocktails when they go to a bar, club or restaurant, a 13% increase compared with pre-pandemic levels. About 43% of those cocktail drinkers indulge at least once a week. And here\u2019s our full story on the rise in UK grocery price inflation to 5.2%, the highest since April 2012. UK shoppers are choosing to shop at discount supermarkets in greater numbers as grocery price inflation reaches the highest level in a decade amid a mounting cost of living crisis, reports our retail correspondent Sarah Butler. Aldi grabbed its biggest share of the grocery market to date and Lidl matched its previous peak as grocery price inflation reached 5.2% in March, the highest level since April 2012, according to the latest figures from analysts Kantar. Here\u2019s the latest in the P&amp;O Ferries sackings saga. P&amp;O Ferries has rejected the government\u2019s call to move this week\u2019s deadline for the 800 sacked workers to accept redundancy offers, saying most had already signed contracts and ministers were \u201cignoring the situation\u2019s fundamental and factual realities,\u201d reports our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham. In a bullish response to transport secretary Grant Shapps, the ferry operator\u2019s chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, said the demand was legally impossible and would close the firm down. He wrote to Shapps: \u201cComplying with your request would deliberately cause the company\u2019s collapse, resulting in the irretrievable loss of an additional 2,200 jobs. I cannot imagine that you would wish to compel an employer to bring about its downfall, affecting not hundreds but thousands of families.\u201d European shares are pushing higher, as negotiators from Ukraine and Russia resumed talks in Istanbul. The FTSE 100 index in London has climbed nearly 100 points, or 1.3%, to 7,570, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up almost 2%, France\u2019s CAC 40 is 2.4% ahead and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has posted a 2.1% gain. Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has dismissed reports that the sanctioned Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning during an informal round of talks earlier this month, calling the reports \u201cpart of the information war.\u201d The Chelsea FC owner is part of the latest talks in Istanbul, Peskov confirmed, but said the Russian billionaire was not an official member of the delegation. You can read more on our Ukraine live blog: Consumer stocks such as the Coca-Cola HBC bottling company, JD Sports and Ocado are leading the share gains in London. Barclays is the top faller on the FTSE 100, trading 3.6% lower at 154.68p. It fell as much as 6% in early trading, after one of its main shareholders offloaded $1.2bn off shares at a discount overnight. An unnamed investor sold 599m shares, facilitated by Goldman Sachs, and equivalent to a 3.6% stake, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. It\u2019s another blow to the UK bank, a day after it disclosed a bond sales blunder, which led to a \u00a3450m loss for overselling structured products in the US. UK consumers borrowed an additional \u00a31.9bn in February, a five-year high, of which \u00a31.5bn was borrowing racked up on credit cards. Mortgage approvals fell slightly in February, but remained above pre-pandemic levels, according to data from the Bank of England published this morning. The monthly figure fell to 71,000 in February from 73,800 in January, still above the pre-pandemic average of 66,700 in the 12 months to February 2020. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: The leap in credit card borrowing in February and smaller increase in household savings could suggest that the cost of living crisis is already starting to bite. But we think it is more likely that households had the confidence to borrow and spend a bit more and/or were willing to use borrowing/savings to smooth their spending. As a result, the economy may have a bit more near-term momentum than we thought. The \u00a31.9bn rise in consumer credit beat the consensus forecast of \u00a3800m, was the largest in five years and compared to the pre-pandemic 2019 average rise of \u00a31.1bn. Admittedly, as it was driven by a \u00a31.5bn gain in borrowing on credit cards, it could be a result of the cost of living crisis forcing people to turn to credit. But while that may be true for some people, typically during periods when finances are tight households in aggregate pare back their demand for credit. The Russian rouble continues to strengthen against the dollar. It\u2019s up more than 2% at 87.81 per dollar, touching 87.40 per dollar earlier, its highest level since 28 February (four days after Russia invaded Ukraine). Russia is demanding to be paid in roubles for its gas shipments, and exporting firms are required to convert 80% off their foreign currency earnings into roubles. This is supporting the Russian currency, said Iskander Lutsko, chief investment strategist at ITI Capital. Referring to the Russian stock market, which fully reopened yesteday after weeks of shutdown, he told Reuters: The market now really depends on progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. The rouble-based Moex Russia index has turned negative, trading 2.45% lower at the moment, after an earlier gain of more than 4%. The dollar-denominated RTS index is clinging on to a 4% increase, after climbing more than 10% earlier. The Russian flag carrier Aeroflot, one of the most volatile stocks since the market reopened, jumped nearly 15%. The oil and gas giant Rosneft and the state lender Sberbank are both up more than 2%, after earlier bigger gains. The latest fuel prices from the RAC motoring group show that the chancellor\u2019s fuel duty cut of 5p per litre, plus 1p for VAT, hasn\u2019t been passed on in full by petrol stations across the UK. It said Rishi Sunak missed a trick \u2013 a VAT cut on fuel would have given drivers \u201can immediate and guaranteed reduction on their fuel bill\u201d. According to the RAC, the average petrol price was 167.01p per litre last Wednesday, when Rishi Sunak presented his spring statement (a mini-budget), and dropped to 163.30p yesterday \u2013 a fall of 3.71p. The average price of diesel dropped by 2.79p from 179.90p last Wednesday to 177.11p yesterday. RAC spokesperson Rod Dennis said: Unfortunately, wholesale fuel prices were already rising before the chancellor made his announcement on fuel duty last week. This meant retailers were buying fuel in at a higher cost than they were a week earlier, which meant drivers may not have immediately and fully benefitted from the duty cut. Wholesale prices are currently falling, but it\u2019s likely to be next week before we see what impact this has at the pumps. Had the chancellor instead cut VAT on motor fuel last week, drivers would have seen an immediate and guaranteed reduction in their fuel bill next time they visited a petrol station. As things stand, drivers remain entirely dependent on what is happening on the wholesale market and the extent to which retailers are able or willing to pass on savings they make. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is under mounting pressure over accusations that his wife, Akshata Murthy, is collecting \u201cbloody money\u201d in dividends from a family company that has refused to pull out of Russia, despite Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, writes my colleague Rupert Neate. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are calling on Sunak to answer \u201cvery serious questions\u201d over Murthy\u2019s estimated $900m (\u00a3690m) stake in the IT services and consultancy company Infosys. Infosys, which was founded by her billionaire father, NR Narayana Murthy, continues to operate in Russia while most big global IT and consultancy firms such as SAP, Oracle, PwC, McKinsey, Accenture and KPMG have all closed their Russian operations. Sunak, who has repeatedly called on British companies to pull out of Russia in order to \u201cinflict maximum economic pain\u201d on Putin\u2019s regime, refused to comment on his wife\u2019s 0.91% stake in Infosys. Here is a profile of Akshata Murthy. Money comes in from her 0.91% stake in Infosys, which is valued at about $900m (\u00a3690m), making Murthy richer than the Queen (\u00a3365m). Our Guardian US reporter Lauren Aratani has looked at how America is embarking on the great new experiment of hybrid working. It can be hard to remember what work at the office was like before the pandemic forced millions of Americans to start working from home. That shift was monumental and seemingly implausible, until it happened. But people soon adapted to saying \u201csorry, you\u2019re on mute\u201d on Zoom calls and wearing sweatpants all day. This spring, workers are finally heading back to the office en masse and into another untested and ambitious experiment in work life: hybrid working. \u201cThis is a brave new world \u2013 we\u2019re doing something we\u2019ve never done before, which is we\u2019re going to go, en masse, hybrid,\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford. More than 7,000 finance jobs have moved from London to the European Union as a result of Brexit, according to consultants EY. While the total is far less than the 12,500 job moves forecast by firms after June 2016, when Britain voted to leave the bloc, more could follow, EY said in its latest Brexit Tracker. Paris scored highest in terms of attracting jobs from London, totalling 2,800, followed by Frankfurt at around 1,800, and Dublin with 1,200. Some \u00a31.3 trillion of assets was also transferred from London to EU hubs. EY said new local hires linked to Brexit total 2,900 across Europe, and 2,500 in Britain, where just over a million people work in the financial services sector. Further relocations could result from European Central Bank checks on whether new hubs in the EU opened by banks which used London as their European base have enough staff to justify their new licences, EY said. The Bank of England is scrutinising these to avoid banks in London being left with too few senior staff. Omar Ali, financial services leader for Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa at EY, said: Staff and operational moves across European financial markets will continue as firms navigate ongoing geo-political uncertainty, post-pandemic dynamics and regulatory requirements. McKevitt added: The grocers are also adapting their pricing strategies in response to the rising cost of goods. One trend we\u2019re already tracking is the move away from selling products at \u2018round pound\u2019 prices. The percentage of packs sold at either \u00a31, \u00a32 or \u00a33 has dropped significantly from 18.2% last year to 15.9% this March. Turning to the impact of the pandemic, he said: Two years on since the first lockdown, we can assess what permanent changes the pandemic has made to the grocery landscape. The real story of Covid-19 has been the acceleration of online shopping, and retailers have built their digital capacity to match a seismic change in demand. 12.6% of sales were made online in March 2022 compared with just 8% three years ago. Shoppers over the age of 65 are leading the charge \u2013 the proportion of this demographic buying online has doubled from 9% to 18% over the past three years. What we\u2019re buying has shifted too and some of the recipes we learnt during the lockdowns have become firm favourites. For some, baking seems to have gone from fad to hobby as flour volume sales are 28% higher than in March 2019. The dry pasta market is also 17% larger compared with two years ago. There are hints too that people have become permanently more germ-conscious with liquid soap volumes up by 11%. Grocery price inflation in the UK hit 5.2% in March, the highest since April 2012, according to the latest figures from data analytics firm Kantar. As costs rise, consumers are turning to own-label products which tend to be cheaper than branded ones, and now account for 50.6% of all spending (versus 49.9% this time last year). Discount retailers Aldi achieved a record market share of 8.6% and Lidl matched its best performance at 6.4%, as both chains grew sales by 3.6%. Overall supermarket sales fell by 6.3% over the 12 weeks to 20 March from a year earlier, when many people stayed home because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: It\u2019s no surprise that sales are down over the latest period as consumers are now more confident eating out of the home again. As well as enjoying meals out with friends and families, people will have also been grabbing food and drink on the go from supermarkets while travelling or at work. Those sales aren\u2019t included in these take-home figures, but they will be adding to the grocers\u2019 overall performance. What we\u2019re really starting to see is the switch from the pandemic being the dominant factor driving our shopping behaviour towards the growing impact of inflation, as the cost of living becomes the bigger issue on consumers\u2019 minds. More and more we\u2019re going to see consumers and retailers take action to manage the growing cost of grocery baskets. Consumers are increasingly turning to own label products, which are usually cheaper than branded alternatives. European stock markets have opened higher, ahead of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. The FTSE 100 index in London is 59 points ahead at 7,532, a 0.8% gain. The Dax in Frankfurt climbed 1.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris is up 0.56%, the Ibex in Madrid rose 1.1% and the Milan exchange added 1.2%. And, finally in our news round-up, my colleague Dominic Rushe has taken a look at Joe Biden\u2019s proposed new tax on America\u2019s richest households, when he unveiled his latest budget on Monday. The Biden administration wants to impose a 20% minimum tax on households worth more than $100m. The proposal would raise more than $360bn over the next decade and \u201cwould make sure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters\u201d, according to a factsheet released by the White House. The plan \u2013 called the \u201cbillionaire minimum income tax\u201d \u2013 is the administration\u2019s most aggressive move to date to tax the very wealthiest Americans. Also on the retail front: Deliveroo has struck a partnership with WH Smith, Sarah reports. Books, stationery, phone chargers, toys and exam study guides are the latest items to be ferried to customers on fast-track delivery bikes via a partnership between WH Smith and Deliveroo. The high street retailer will offer 600 products for delivery in as little as 20 minutes, joining similar services offered by supermarkets, pharmacies and takeaways. Meanwhile, Asda faces a legal wrangle with Waitrose after unveiling a new \u00a345m cut-price grocery range with a similar name to its pricier rival\u2019s established discount brand. Waitrose, which has used the Essential Waitrose brand for about 13 years, said it had sent a legal letter to its bigger rival over its new brand name Just Essentials by Asda on Monday. \u201cWe were surprised to hear that Asda is launching an essentials range as the Essential Waitrose brand has been in use since 2009 and has built up a strong reputation for value, quality and higher welfare standards in that time,\u201d said a spokesperson for Waitrose, which is part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership. The supermarket chain Iceland will temporarily return to using palm oil in some own-label foods from June because the price of a key alternative \u2013 sunflower oil \u2013 has soared by 1,000% during the war in Ukraine, reports our retail correspondent Sarah Butler. In 2018 the supermarket chain announced to much fanfare that it was removing the controversial ingredient, which has been linked to destruction of the Earth\u2019s forests. As part of its stand against the product, it launched a TV advert made with Greenpeace, which was pulled after it was deemed too political. But now the retailer\u2019s boss, Richard Walker, has announced in a blog that he is making a U-turn with \u201chuge regret\u201d. \u201cThe only alternative to using palm oil under the current circumstances would simply be to clear our freezers and shelves of a wide range of staples including frozen chips and other potato products,\u201d he said. \u2018Our top search term is nuclear\u2019: US bunker sales soar as anxiety over Russia rises. Gary Lynch, chief executive of Rising S Company in Texas, sold five bunkers on a single day in February, at prices ranging from $70,000 to $240,000, reports Bradley Garrett. Rishi Sunak yesterday defended his spring statement from accusations that it failed to do enough to help the poorest in Britain with soaring living costs by arguing that extra help could have put government finances at risk, report my colleagues on the economics team, Richard Partington and Phillip Inman. In a fractious exchange with MPs on the House of Commons Treasury committee, the chancellor said he had been forced to make choices over where to prioritise support because of rising government borrowing costs as the British economy is buffeted by surging inflation made worse by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. \u201cOne may say, if they don\u2019t like my choices, they\u2019d be happy to borrow a lot more. That\u2019s just not something I think is responsible or sensible,\u201d he said. The Bank of England\u2019s governor Andrew Bailey warned of an energy price shock on the scale of the 1970s, and said there were already signs of a growth slowdown, as consumers and businesses come under heavy pressure from the cost of living squeeze, with soaring prices for gas, electricity and other goods and services. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In Germany, a closely-watched consumer confidence barometer from GfK fell to -15.5 going into April, below expectations and a 14-month low. In March, it was at -8.5. Consumers worry about rising inflation and the war in Ukraine, which led to a substantial decline in expectations for the economy and their own finances. The income expectations measure fell to -22.1, the lowest since the financial crisis of 2009. GfK said: In February hopes were still high that consumer sentiment would recover significantly with the foreseeable easing of pandemic-related restrictions. However, the start of the war in Ukraine caused these hopes to vanish into thin air. Rising uncertainty and sanctions against Russia have caused energy prices in particular to skyrocket, putting a noticeable strain on general consumer sentiment. Oil prices are falling again, extending losses from Monday, as traders worried about a sharp drop in demand from China. Yesterday saw the biggest oil sell-off since mid-March, as Shanghai went into a two-stage Covid lockdown, and ahead of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. Negotiators are set to meet in Istanbul today for the first time in almost two weeks. The war drove oil to 14-year highs earlier this month, but today Brent crude is down 1.1% at $111.24 a barrel while US light crude is at $104.84 a barrel. China is the world\u2019s largest oil importer, and Shanghai, its financial hub, accounts for 4% of the country\u2019s oil consumption, according to analysts at ANZ Research. Japanese shares led gains in Asian stock markets as the Bank of Japan vowed to keep monetary policy ultra-loose, offering to buy unlimited government bonds for the first four days of this week, to stop yields rising. Globally, bond yields are climbing following the US Federal Reserve\u2019s moves to lift interest rates to tame soaring inflation. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 1.1% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gained 0.8%, and the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.3%.

            "date": "2022-03-04T09:40:07Z",
            "content": "The London Stock Exchange has suspended trading in more Russian companies, while an independent director resigned from the board of Evraz, the steel and mining group in which Roman Abramovich holds a 29% stake. The LSE suspended trading in the remaining eight companies with strong links to Russia that were not included on a list of 27 companies suspended on Thursday. The companies trade financial instruments in London, including global depositary receipts and American depositary receipts, but not ordinary shares, which are traded in on other stock exchanges where they have their primary listings. Also on Friday, Evraz \u2013 which has its primary listing in London and is incorporated in the UK \u2013 announced that James Rutherford had resigned from the board immediately. Rutherford was a non-executive director at Evraz for only nine months and also holds directorships at the mining groups Centamin and Anglo Pacific. His resignation came a day after the Institute of Directors urged British nationals to quit Russian boards, saying it was \u201cno longer tenable\u201d for them to remain after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, adding that any directors of Belarusian firms should also quit. Evraz also counts the former Ford executive Stephen Odell and Sir Michael Peat, a former private secretary to Prince Charles and whose family name is the \u201cp\u201d in KPMG, on its board. Peat, who was paid $224,000 (\u00a3168,232) last year, is due to stand down at the end of March, having been a board member since 2011. Rutherford was paid $125,000 from his appointment last June until the end of last year. Odell was paid $138,000. Evraz, which last week announced a dividend worth $450m to Abramovich, has so far not been caught in the sanctions being levelled at companies with strong links to Russia. On Thursday, the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in 27 companies, including the energy and banking firms Gazprom and Sberbank. The LSE said it was taking the action \u201cin light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets\u201d. On Friday, the LSE added the state-owned Federal Grid, Russia\u2019s largest transmission company, the telecoms provider Rostelecom, the residential property developer Etalon, the supermarket chain O\u2019Key, the fertiliser company Acron, the food retail chain Magnit, the investment firm Sistema and the commercial seaport Novorossiysk to its list of companies barred from trading in London. However, Evraz is one of a number of companies linked to Russia that have so far not been barred because they have been assigned \u201cUK nationality\u201d by the LSE for trading purposes. Nevertheless, international pressure is taking an increasing toll on Russian businesses, while the invasion of Ukraine is also disrupting those with operations in the region. On Wednesday, Evraz and the precious metals mining group Polymetal dropped out of the FTSE 100 in its quarterly review after their market values plummeted. The market value of Evraz has fallen by more than 80% since Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine."

            "content": "Rishi Sunak has battled to protect the Treasury from rising prices while allowing inflation to ravage the finances of low and middle-income households. That is the accusation levelled at the chancellor after a spring budget statement that put government debt reduction ahead of calls for extra welfare support for hard-pressed families. Sunak\u2019s dilemma, as inflation heads towards 8% and possibly beyond, is whether he can afford to increase the Treasury\u2019s outlay on welfare and public services, including public sector pay. His team believes that the Treasury needs to keep a large fund in reserve to pay higher debt costs, much of which is linked to inflation. A proportion of the UK\u2019s debt is held by lenders in the form of index-linked bonds. The more inflation rises, the higher the interest rate the government must pay. Then there is the \u00a3875bn of government debt held by the Bank of England \u2013 equal to more than a third of the total \u2013 which until last year carried an interest rate of just 0.1%. Central bank officials are attempting to limit the rise in inflation by increasing borrowing costs. Two rate rises later, and the annual interest rate stands at 0.75%, raising Sunak\u2019s debt bill further. Figures covering the public finances in February show inflation pushed up interest payments on government debt by more than 50% to \u00a38.2bn, the highest February figure on record. Yet debts costs remain at historic lows as a proportion of the government\u2019s budget, which is a better measure of its ability to pay. In the 1980s, debt interest cost the government about 10% of annual revenues. Today that figure is below 3%, despite a debt mountain that has more than doubled in relation to national income over that time. In addition, UK government debt is still highly sought after by international investors, meaning they are prepared to accept low returns over long periods. And there is little prospect of recent increases in inflation being sustained over the longer time horizons used by the Treasury to judge the nation\u2019s financial stability. Inflation will fall back this year and next because fuel prices are the biggest impetus for rising prices. Inflation is also kinder to the chancellor than it is to businesses or households. It increases his income from VAT. There is also a boost from wage rises that are slightly larger than forecast a year ago, which generates more income tax. Adding an estimated \u00a321bn to his stockpile is a freeze on income tax thresholds set to last four years. In the meantime, soaring gas prices and the higher cost of petrol and diesel will eat into business and household incomes with only limited compensation from higher incomes or government support. In truth, much of the Treasury reserve fund is being kept back to fund tax cuts ahead of the next election, when much of it could be used to prevent more than 1.3 million people \u2013 including half a million children \u2013 from being pushed below the poverty line next year."

            "date": "2022-03-18T14:00:01Z",
            "content": "If you notice that a wine you bought a couple of weeks ago is suddenly 50p more expensive, you no doubt assume that all the other bottles have gone up, too. The real surprise, however, is that there is still a fair amount of value around, with prices not much higher than they were 12 months ago. One reason for this is that the supermarkets are getting progressively more ingenious about their marketing. Tesco, for example, now seems to have near-permanent discounts for its Clubcard members, even in smaller stores; Co-op members also benefit from discounts. And the more affordable 20% off three bottles seems to have become more popular than 25% off six. But how do they manage these lower prices, especially after Brexit? The supermarkets themselves are reluctant to talk about promotions, waffling on about being committed to offering value to their customers, but my suspicion that they treat wine as a loss-leader is borne out by wine consultant Angela Mount, former head buyer for Somerfield. \u201cA wine promotion will often be funded from a central marketing pot for several departments,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s a key footfall driver and pays for itself in sheer volume.\u201d So what do you have to spend nowadays to get a decent bottle? Although many supermarket wines have now hit the \u00a39.99 mark, I can guarantee that, if you\u2019re prepared to spend between \u00a37 and \u00a38 a bottle, you\u2019ll still drink pretty well. I\u2019d say the three most important things you can do to keep your wine bill down are not to be sniffy about own-label, particularly the premium ranges such as Tesco\u2019s Finest, Morrisons The Best and Asda\u2019s Extra Special; buy brands only when they\u2019re on offer; and stick to inexpensive sources such as South Africa, which is currently giving New Zealand a run for its money on sauvignon blanc \u2013 Chile and Portugal, especially for reds, Languedoc (cheaper for ros\u00e9 than Provence), and cava, which offers the best value for sparkling wine; Italian wines, especially whites, are also almost invariably good value, too. According to Mount, some of us are willing to pay more, even at discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. \u201cThey\u2019ve been really successful in building credibility in the quality of their wines,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if people see a barolo at \u00a313.99, they assume it\u2019s going to be good and are inclined to spoil themselves, especially at weekends. When restaurants reopened, there was a rush to eat out, but people forgot how expensive it is to go out, say, twice a week \u2013 and \u00a313.99 a bottle in a restaurant would be cheap.\u201d Four of the best-value wine buys Tesco Finest Soave Classico Superiore \u00a37.50, 13%. You have to thank soave for being such an unfashionable wine for this brilliant price. A really elegant, Italian white that would be great with risotto, or chicken or pasta in a creamy sauce. Villiera Sauvignon Blanc 2021 \u00a38 (by the case) Marks &amp; Spencer, 13%. New Zealand had a poor sauvignon harvest in 2021, so look to South Africa for savvy b bargains such as this deliciously crisp, citrussy example. Morrisons The Best Barbera d\u2019Asti 2018 \u00a37.50, 14.5%. Warm, hearty barbera is a bit of a bargain, and great with robust pasta dishes or pulses. Aldi Specially Selected Ribera del Duero 2019 \u00a37.99, 13.5%. If you like rioja, you\u2019ll love ribera del duero, a similarly mellow, oak-aged red from the north of Spain that cries out for a Sunday roast. And one at under \u00a37\u2026 Asda Extra Special Fiano Terre Siciliane 2020 \u00a36, 12.5%. Smooth, ripe, peachy, chardonnay-like white with a fresh, citrussy aftertaste.

            "content": "The boss of John Lewis and the supermarket chain Waitrose has said the UK is facing double-digit inflation as the war in Ukraine exacerbates the soaring cost of living, with prices rising in the supply chain and on shelves. The prediction from Sharon White, chair of the John Lewis Partnership, comes with UK inflation ready at a 30-year high of 5.5%, and expected to rise to almost 8% in April, when household energy bills will soar by hundreds of pounds. \u201cWe are seeing inflation we haven\u2019t seen in 30 years,\u201d said White, a Cambridge-educated economist and former second permanent secretary at the Treasury, speaking on the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme. \u201cEverything you can see in terms of energy prices from the impact of the Ukraine war suggests that we might well end up with double-digit inflation. My big worry is that it ends out being more enduring than anyone expects. So I think inflation is the big macroeconomic washout.\u201d She was also taken to task over John Lewis\u2019s decision to pay all staff a 3% bonus, worth 1.5 weeks pay, after reporting a strong bounce-back in 2021, despite deciding not to repay \u00a358m in tax relief it accepted from the government to weather the worst of the pandemic two years ago. \u201cWe kept that relief, that exemption from tax, we used that exactly for the purposes intended, which was to secure jobs and to avoid further restructuring,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I make no apologies for paying the bonus to partners who have worked their socks off over the last year.\u201d In 2020, for the first time in 67 years, John Lewis Partnership did not pay staff, which it terms partners, a bonus as the business was forced to close some stores after reporting a \u00a3517m loss. \u201cDo I think it was the right thing that we have been able to pay a bonus to partners on the back of results,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel very comfortable morally, absolutely it was the right decision,\u201d White said. She also said the organisation was continuing to look at its supply chain to see whether a ban on the sale of Russian goods in its stores, which it announced earlier this month, could be extended to other products or suppliers. \u201cWe have removed Russian vodka from Waitrose shelves and Russian-made pallets that go into outdoor pizza ovens [sold] in John Lewis,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything that is made in Russia is off the shelves. And then, because supply chains are really complicated, we are looking at whether there are other products we need to take off the shelves as well.\u201d"

            "content": "Last month, anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe sparked change by highlighting huge price increases on food that far exceeded the Office for National Statistics\u2019 inflation figure of 5.4%; the cost of living crisis, it seems, is hitting low-income Britons the hardest. The ONS responded by saying it accepted that everyone has their own \u201cpersonal inflation\u201d rate. But what affects our rate, and why does it matter? I asked Edward Smith, co-chief investment officer at Rathbones, a wealth management firm which offers a free-to-use personal inflation calculator. I\u2019d never heard of a personal inflation rate before. Why are we talking about it now? For the last 25 years, inflation has been stable. But now we\u2019re back to a rate we haven\u2019t seen since the 90s. It\u2019s probably going to get up to 7.5%, possibly 8%, come April. Oof! All this because of energy prices? Not entirely. Energy prices accounted for about six-tenths of the overall increase last year, but there\u2019s also Covid. We\u2019re spending more on goods than services, and that demand butted up against supply-chain disruptions. The good news is we think spending habits are likely to normalise, and we expect it to be back at 2% by next year. Hmm, I\u2019m not sure. It sounds like inflation spikes when disaster strikes, and with the climate crisis there are plenty of those coming. Yes. Some of the areas most affected by climate disasters are in our supply chains, such as Asia. Though there are some people who say the rising energy costs are due to Europe going down the green route too quickly and failing to consider the impact of a relatively windless summer, like last year\u2019s. So how long have the ONS averages on inflation been problematic? I wouldn\u2019t say they have been. The ONS has always been clear that the number it produces is an average for the whole country, and over the past 20 years the rates haven\u2019t been all that different between groups. We\u2019re talking about a few tenths of a per cent between lower earners \u2013 who tend to be younger, without property wealth \u2013 versus higher earners. One of the reasons we have the personal inflation calculator is because you may have a few years when you\u2019re spending more on something: medical care for a loved one, say. And inflation is an important part of planning. Say you save \u00a3100 a month for 20 years; if the rate of inflation was 2%, then your \u00a324k savings would be worth about \u00a316k in inflation-adjusted terms. But if 2% wasn\u2019t representative for you and your rate was more like 3%, then your savings would be worth only about \u00a313k. That\u2019s massive. The ONS says it\u2019s working on capturing the rates across different groups \u2013 how? By using a big-data approach, where it takes all the transaction data from supermarkets instead of using a sample of prices through surveys. That sounds like a data-protection nightmare. It\u2019s all anonymised! Hope so \u2013 I prefer to keep my prosecco-purchasing habits out of any official roster. We talked about 2% being a \u201cgood\u201d amount of inflation; why not 0%? Because if inflation is too low, people may be put off spending, thinking prices are going to get even lower. That means companies making fewer sales, and job losses. Ultimately, the cost to society of 1-2% of deflation is much greater than the cost of 1-2% inflation. Though I\u2019d like the price of my prosecco to stay the same."

            "content": "Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze intensified further last month, according to official figures showing inflation reached 6.2% in February \u2013 announced before Rishi Sunak\u2019s spring statement. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a jump in the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living from 5.5% in January, fuelled by the rising cost of petrol and diesel and a wide range of goods from food to toys and games. The February inflation figure for the consumer prices index was higher than the 5.9% predicted by a Reuters poll of economists, illustrating the scale of the squeeze on UK households from soaring living costs. According to the latest snapshot, soaring inflationary pressure was fuelled by rising costs for gas and electricity, as well as average petrol and diesel prices hitting record highs in a blow to motorists. Prices for clothing, footwear, furniture and flooring all rose after the end of the traditional January sales on the high street, reversing a trend from a year earlier when prices dropped during the third nationwide Covid lockdown when many shops were forced to close. Business groups and Labour warned that the chancellor needed to take urgent action to address rising living costs in his spring statement. Sunak will announce his set-piece tax and spending update to the Commons on Wednesday afternoon, with expectations that additional support for households will be announced. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said plans to increase national insurance contributions needed to be ditched as part of measures to support workers through the tightest squeeze on living standards for at least three decades. \u201cAs he heads into his spring statement, he can either choose an unfair tax rise on working people and business at the worst possible time. Or he can cancel his tax rise, and ease the cost of living hitting families by cutting energy bills by up to \u00a3600 through bringing in a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits,\u201d she said. The latest increase in the consumer prices index took the measure of inflation to the highest rate since March 1992, when it stood at 7.1%. Further increases are expected as higher motoring costs triggered by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and April\u2019s increase in domestic energy prices take effect. The Bank of England said last week it expected inflation to be about 8% in April with the risk of a double-digit increase in the autumn if there is another sharp increase in the energy price cap. Reflecting the potential for higher inflation in future, the ONS said the price of goods leaving UK factories had been rising substantially and was now at the highest rate for 14 years. Matt Whittaker, the chief executive of Pro Bono Economics, said the latest inflation figures meant a typical single parent will face paying out an estimated additional \u00a3315 in food and heating this year compared with 2019, while bills for a family of four are likely to jump by \u00a3580. \u201cWith inflation driven by staples such as food and fuel, the everyday impacts of inflation will be felt most sharply by the poorest,\u201d he said. \u2022 The cost of living crisis Join Hugh Muir, Richard Partington and Anneliese Dodds MP in a livestreamed event on 14 April.

            "date": "2022-03-20T12:48:20Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England\u2019s message to Rishi Sunak was simple. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is the latest unwelcome shock to the UK economy. It will make people poorer. There is nothing we, the Bank, can do about it. So, over to you, Chancellor. Threadneedle Street is absolutely right. It doesn\u2019t have the tools to respond to rising global commodity prices but the Treasury does. Sunak has all sorts of ways of alleviating the pain: cutting taxes, increasing benefits, reducing excise duties, helping out with energy bills. And although the original intention was not to turn Wednesday\u2019s spring statement into a mini-budget, recent events mean that is what it needs to become. Unless Sunak wants to go down in history as the new Philip Snowden \u2013 the Labour chancellor who cut benefits during the Great Depression \u2013 he will need to come up with something meaningful. Sunak says he is \u201cdone\u201d with tax increases and has sympathy with people struggling to make ends meet. He needs to convert words into action because this is how things look. Inflationary pressure was growing even before Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine, because as the global economy started to emerge from lockdown the supply of basic commodities \u2013 such as oil \u2013 struggled to keep pace with demand. Both companies and consumers are affected by rising inflation. Businesses that have to pay higher costs for fuel and raw materials have a choice: try to pass on the costs to their customers or take a hit on their profit margins. Consumers face a similar problem. If it costs more to fill up the car with petrol or heat their home, they can either try to secure pay increases that keep pace with inflation, cut spending on non-essential items, or rack up debt. It is not hard to see how things will play out in the coming months. Companies will initially seek to pass on their higher costs to their customers, but won\u2019t be able to make the price increases stick when consumers are belt-tightening. As any A-level student of economics knows, national output \u2013 or gross domestic product \u2013 is consumer spending plus investment plus government spending plus exports net of imports. Consumer spending is going to be weak this year because wages will fail to keep pace with prices. Companies are going to mothball investment as the costs of doing business go up. The chances of an export-led boom are nil given that every other energy-importing country faces exactly the same pressures as the UK. That leaves the government, where policy is currently the opposite of what it needs to be. Sunak has frozen tax allowances for the rest of the parliament; he will raise employer and employee national insurance contributions by 1.25 percentage points from next month; and he has temporarily scrapped the pensions triple lock. Taken together, these measures will suck tens of billions of pounds out of the economy at precisely the wrong time. The Treasury has a dual function. It is primarily a ministry of finance with a ministry of the economy tacked on. During the early stages of the pandemic the finance ministry element took a rare back seat because there was an obvious need to spend money to prevent the economy collapsing during lockdown. Now that the pandemic is perceived to be over \u2013 even if there appears to be a sting in the tail \u2013 the Treasury has reverted to its normal way of working, with reducing public borrowing the main aim. That mindset needs to change. It is not as if Sunak hasn\u2019t been warned. The Bank of England was already forecasting the biggest squeeze on living standards since modern records began three decades ago, and says the impact of the invasion of Ukraine will make the situation \u201cmaterially\u2019 worse. Number crunching by the chartered accountant and political economist Richard Murphy suggests the hit to living standards will be extremely painful: a 14% hit for someone on the minimum wage, 11% for someone on median earnings. \u201cFor half UK households it\u2019s very hard to see how they have any chance of making ends meet without significant government support,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cThis is not just disastrous for them, it also signals that a recession is very likely unless Sunak takes action now. Delay would make it almost impossible to prevent a massive downturn happening.\u201d It\u2019s hard to disagree with Murphy\u2019s conclusion. As things stand, Britain is heading for a monster recession and time is running out to take evasive action. It is clear that after fighting and winning a battle with Boris Johnson, Sunak is not going to scrap or even postpone the increase in NICs, even though going ahead with them now is an act of economic self-harm. But the chancellor dropped enough hints on his Sunday morning TV appearances to make it clear he will announce some additional help this week. Fuel duty looks certain to be slashed and there may be a temptation to shoot Labour\u2019s fox by announcing a temporary cut in VAT on domestic energy bills. Either measures would have the effect of increasing spending power and reducing the annual inflation rate. Sunak announced a package of support for households with their energy bills early last month and that already seems inadequate. The Treasury is, though, resistant to making it more generous until it is clear what will happen to the energy price cap when it is next revisited in October. That leaves state benefits, which are due to rise by 3.1% next month \u2013 about five percentage points below the likely rate of inflation. Raising benefits in line with the expected inflation rate would protect the most vulnerable and boost the economy. It would be costly but not as costly as doing nothing."

Even before this week\u2019s rise in crude oil prices to more than $110 (\u00a382) a barrel \u2013 the highest since 2014 \u2013 analysts were cutting growth forecasts and raising estimates for inflation. Including energy in the list of items targeted would mean oil and gas would be dearer for longer, increasing the risk of a slowdown turning into recession. The world economy is less dependent on oil than it was at the time of the first postwar spike in 1973-4, and uses the fossil fuel more efficiently. Back then it took a little less than a barrel of oil to produce $1,000 of output. By 2019 global oil intensity was 0.43 of a barrel per $1,000 of output. Even so, what happens to the oil price still matters and Russia \u2013 which is the second biggest exporter after Saudi Arabia \u2013 is a key player in the global market. So far, most economists think Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will merely dent the recovery they have pencilled in for this year. But as the Warwick University academic Prof Andrew Oswald has noted, almost every postwar recession has been preceded by a rise in oil prices. The cost of crude rose sharply in 1973, in 1979, in 1990 and in 2007. All were followed by recessions, though sometimes dearer energy was not the only factor. Three factors will determine the hit to western economies over the coming months. The first is whether energy continues to flow, something that is looking less likely by the day. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB bank, estimates that 70% of the 4.3m barrels of crude Russia would normally be exporting daily is already frozen. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said the latest jump in oil prices reflected a sense that formal sanctions on Russia\u2019s energy sector were inevitable. Rising oil prices were a windfall for the Kremlin, he added. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why western governments might play this card \u2013 the cognitive dissonance of squeezing Russia on all fronts with sanctions while still funding their war machine by buying oil and gas may not survive for long.\u201d The second factor involves the size and the duration of higher oil prices. Most analysts assume crude will rise a little further \u2013 perhaps to $125 a barrel \u2013 and then start falling in the second half of the year. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said if oil and gas followed current futures pricing, UK inflation would peak at just below 8% in April and still be above 5% by the end of the year. Under an alternative scenario the oil price rises to $130 a barrel and stays above $100 until early 2023, while European wholesale gas prices rise to \u20ac160 (\u00a3133) a megawatt hour and end this year around \u20ac100 a MWh. In that event, Dales said inflation would peak above 8% and still be nudging 6% by the end of the year. Some fear the oil price could hit $150 a barrel, intensifying the squeeze on consumers. Businesses would also be hit, with more expensive energy and lower demand hitting profits. Finally, there is the question of how central banks will respond. Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said events in Ukraine would not derail plans by the US central bank to start raising interest rates. The Bank of England, which has already increased borrowing costs twice in recent months, is also likely to tighten policy. What is not yet clear is how far and how fast interest rates will rise. One risk is that central banks do too little. An even bigger risk is that they do too much."

            "title": "UK to phase out Russian oil imports by 2023 and explore ending gas imports",
            "date": "2022-03-08T22:37:45Z",
            "content": "Britain and the US together moved to ban Russian oil on Tuesday in the biggest financial crackdown on Moscow since its invasion of Ukraine two weeks ago. In a move likely to hit the Kremlin\u2019s coffers hard, as well as further raise petrol prices and feed inflation in the west, Boris Johnson said stopping imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022 was \u201canother economic blow to the Putin regime\u201d. Joe Biden announced a joint ban on Russian oil and gas imports, while the EU presented a plan to phase out gas imports only. \u201cToday I\u2019m announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia\u2019s economy,\u201d President Biden said in an address at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy. That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports, and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin\u2019s war machine.\u201d The sanctions are expected to be highly damaging to the Russian economy, with experts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit saying the UK oil ban alone could cost Moscow more than \u00a35bn this year. The EU sources about 40% of its gas from Russia and 27% of its oil, while the US gets no gas from Russia and 7% of its oil. In Britain, 4% of gas and 8% of oil comes from Russia. Analysts said the crackdown was expected to push up the price of fuel, with petrol already hitting a record 155p a litre this week in the UK, 24% higher than a year ago. Conservative MPs are clamouring for a reduction in fuel duty in this month\u2019s spring statement as a result. Johnson said consumers would be protected and the government said the transition to new suppliers of oil would be \u201csmooth\u201d, implying motorists have no need to queue at the pumps in a repeat of the autumn\u2019s panic over fuel. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the UK imports 13% of its diesel from Russia, and none of its petrol. Johnson said: \u201cWe can certainly do it \u2026 in a way that doesn\u2019t disrupt supply, that ensures we have substitute supplies on stream in an orderly way and in a timetable that won\u2019t affect UK business, won\u2019t affect UK manufacturing, road haulage or other parts of our industry but will punish the regime of Vladimir Putin.\u201d But Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWith supply constrained, while demand rockets for supplies from elsewhere in the world, it seems the only way is up for energy prices.\u201d She added: \u201cThere is no magic wand to wave to speed up the shift to renewables, and although the EU has pledged to accelerate the process of weaning member countries off Russia, it\u2019s going to be a hugely difficult and expensive transition.\u201d Analysts at Credit Suisse warned that if oil hit $160 a barrel, it could drive inflation to 9.5% by October and push the UK into recession. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will come under pressure to take fresh action to protect consumers from the cost of living squeeze, with higher oil prices having an impact across the economy. Announcing the plan, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, said he would establish a \u201ctaskforce for oil\u201d to help companies. He said that the UK is a significant producer of oil, and alternative suppliers included \u201creliable partners such as the US, Netherlands and the Gulf\u201d. Kwarteng also said he was \u201cexploring options\u201d for a total ban on Russian gas. The government said Russian oil supplies would be \u201cquickly\u201d replaced by other suppliers as its products are already being ostracised by the market: nearly 70% of Russian oil currently struggles to find a buyer. Labour backed the move. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: \u201cIt is the right decision to ban imports of Russian oil. We need to do everything possible to isolate the Putin regime.\u201d BEIS is soon expected to publish an updated energy supply strategy including accelerated investment in renewables and a new round of North Sea licences to maximise extraction. However, ministers remain deeply sceptical about fracking, which some Tories would like to see go ahead as the UK strives for energy independence. Jacob Rees-Mogg, minister for Brexit opportunities, signalled support for a change in policy on Tuesday. He called shale gas \u201cvery clean\u201d and appeared to dismiss concerns about tremors caused by drilling, saying: \u201cSome of the seismic effects are ones that can only be measured with sophisticated equipment. Others are equivalent to a bus passing by your house, assuming there\u2019s a pavement in between you and the house. And as I say, it\u2019s not the San Francisco earthquake.\u201d A BEIS source said fracking would not be restarted \u201cuntil there is compelling scientific evidence that allows us to predict and manage earthquakes associated with it\u201d. Some MPs in favour of fracking said it was possible the government could announce fresh research on its impact if they wanted to show it was being kept on the table. The prime minister\u2019s announcement of a ban on Russian oil was relatively abrupt given his comments on Monday that the west would have to take a phased approach to reducing reliance on Moscow\u2019s oil and gas. European countries including Germany, which is much more heavily reliant on Russian gas in particular, have been reluctant to move rapidly towards phasing it out. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 March 2022. An earlier version described Ed Miliband as the shadow business secretary, a previous post; he is now the shadow climate change secretary."

            "date": "2022-03-16T19:20:25Z",
            "content": "The Federal Reserve has raised US interest rates for the first time since 2018; now all eyes are now on the Bank of England to see whether it increases UK borrowing costs for a third time in succession. Wednesday\u2019s quarter-point increase by the world\u2019s most powerful central bank was never really in doubt. It would have come as a complete shock to Wall Street had the Fed decided to sit on its hands as a result of the war in Ukraine. The US is much less dependent on imported energy than other developed nations and further away from the conflict. The message from Jerome Powell, the Fed\u2019s chairman, was clear: plenty more rate rises \u2013 six more quarter-point jumps \u2013 are planned before the end of the year. As far as the Fed is concerned, this is now the post-Covid era. For Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee, things are less clear cut, and any one of three options is possible: another quarter-point increase; a half-point increase; or no change. There are nine MPC members and they could easily split three ways when it comes to the vote. The reason it is a tough call for the Bank is that the economy is being pulled in two directions at once. On the one hand, inflationary pressure was strong even before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine gave an added upward thrust to global commodity prices. Yet, on the other, UK households are facing the biggest squeeze on their real \u2013 inflation-adjusted \u2013 incomes for half a century. As the year wears on, and people have to contend with higher energy bills, higher food prices and higher taxes, the deflationary pressure will intensify. A return to 1970s-style stagflation is the worry on both sides of the Atlantic. Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, is predicting that unemployment and inflation will remain above 5% for the next few years in America, and the same pressures affect the UK, only more so. There is nothing the Bank of England can do to affect the global price of energy or food, but some members of the MPC are jittery about higher prices generating pressure for higher wages. The fear is that in a tight labour market, a wage-price spiral will set in. Others on the committee are more concerned about the economy hitting the wall in the second half of 2022. Their fear is that over-aggressive interest rate increases will help push the economy into recession. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there had been speculation the Bank might get more aggressive with a half-point rise this month. That now looks less probable, although it cannot be entirely ruled out. Nor can the suck-it-and-see approach, although leaving rates unchanged would also be a surprise given that the Bank was expecting inflation to rise above 7% next month even before Vladimir Putin complicated matters. The likeliest outcome is that the Bank will stick to its policy of gradually edging rates to a more normal setting by raising rates by a quarter-point to 0.75% \u2013 returning borrowing costs to their pre-pandemic level \u2013 and leave the option open of raising them by a further quarter-point in May, when it will publish updated forecasts for the economy."

            "date": "2022-03-23T07:15:23Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak will give his spring statement on Wednesday on the second anniversary of the initial Covid lockdown, with the economy still reeling from the effects of the pandemic and facing fresh headwinds from war in Ukraine. In the two years since the government first ordered people to stay indoors to guard against soaring infections, the country has been through huge economic changes. Initial turmoil and uncertainty eventually gave way to a gradual recovery, but now UK households face a worsening cost of living crisis amid high inflation and a surge in energy prices made worse by Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion. GDP Britain\u2019s economy suffered the worst recession in 100 years as the initial wave of Covid-19 and late entry into a tight lockdown caused a sudden stop in activity across the country. UK GDP plunged by almost 20% in the second quarter of 2020, and by 9.4% for the year as a whole \u2013 the worst performance in the G7. The economy has since grown at the fastest rate in the group of wealthy nations, partly because of the snapback from a bigger fall, and returned to pre-Covid levels in December. However, other G7 nations are further above their pre-pandemic levels, including the US and France. Inflation Inflation has risen to the highest rate since 1992 in the fallout from Covid-19, with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine threatening to add to the problem. Disruption to global supply chains, shortages of workers and materials, and a boom in demand after lockdown have led to the cost of living soaring around the world. In the UK, trade disruption has been added to by Brexit. Inflation had sunk close to zero early in the pandemic as businesses struggled with evaporating demand. However, stimulus from central banks and governments helped soften the blow and maintain spending power. With war in Ukraine now fuelling a sharp rise in global energy prices, the Bank of England expects inflation could reach 8% this spring. It has forecast that the rate could peak close to 10% this year. Public finances The UK government budget deficit \u2013 the gap between spending and income \u2013 surged to a peacetime record of about \u00a3318bn in 2020-21, as tax receipts collapsed and the state pumped billions of pounds into emergency pandemic support such as furlough, business grants and loans. The national debt \u2013 the sum of every budget deficit \u2013 has risen to about \u00a32.3tn, or about 95% of GDP, the highest level since the early 1960s. Borrowing has fallen sharply in 2021-22 as the economy recovers, to about \u00a3150bn, although is expected to remain higher than pre-Covid levels in each year until at least the middle of the decade. Transport Public transport use has been slow to recover from the pandemic amid a rise in working from home. The number of car journeys is close to pre-Covid levels, although the number of trips on buses remains at 80% and usage is lower in London. A minority of Britons worked from home during the pandemic, with rates reaching a peak of about 48% in February 2021 \u2013 with more people in the capital working from home because of a higher proportion of office-based jobs than in smaller cities and towns. Figures show the London underground is quieter on Mondays than later in the week, as office staff embrace flexible working in a trend that could persist after the pandemic. Retail sales Lockdown fuelled a boom in internet shopping as consumers stayed away from the high street. While online sales have fallen back as physical shops reopened, experts expect a permanent shift to higher rates of internet sales after the pandemic. Online spending rose from about 19% of total retail sales in February 2020 to a peak of 37.8% during the January 2021 lockdown, before cooling back to about 27% in January 2022. The shift has prompted a wave of shop closures, changing the landscape of Britain\u2019s high streets. Online firms have recorded bumper profits \u2013 enriching their billionaire owners \u2013 while fuelling rapid growth in warehouse and delivery jobs. House prices House prices have soared during the coronavirus pandemic, in an unusual trend during a recession. The average UK house price was \u00a3275,000 in December 2021, a rise of \u00a327,000 from a year earlier. The government\u2019s stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland, launched by Sunak in the summer of 2020 amid concerns of a housing market crash, spurred demand. Helped by savings built up during lockdown for wealthier households able to get on the property ladder, and employment levels remaining robust, homeowners looking to move for more space during lockdown also fuelled the market outside urban centres. \u2022 The cost of living crisis Join Hugh Muir, Richard Partington and Anneliese Dodds MP in a livestreamed event on 14 April.

            "content": "One of London\u2019s leading independent day schools has been downgraded by Ofsted after inspectors criticised some of its teaching for focusing more on social justice than subject knowledge, and a culture where \u201calternative opinions are not felt welcome\u201d. The American School in London (ASL), which charges annual fees of \u00a332,650 for older pupils, was previously rated \u201coutstanding\u201d but slipped two grades to \u201crequires improvement\u201d \u2013 just above \u201cinadequate\u201d \u2013 after inspection in December. Ofsted inspectors were sent in after the ASL featured in a series of newspaper articles, which reported that parents were concerned about a \u201cwoke agenda\u201d at the school and had complained children were being \u201cindoctrinated\u201d in critical race theory. Most recently the Jewish Chronicle reported the school in St John\u2019s Wood was at the centre of a row about a Holocaust Memorial Day presentation, which highlighted \u201coutspoken\u201d Jews of a radical leftwing background who \u201chad no relevance to the Holocaust whatsoever\u201d. The Ofsted report, published on the school\u2019s website, found much to praise about the school with its first-class resources and well-qualified teachers. The inspectors said the school, which teaches four- to 18-year-olds, has high expectations and \u201cgives strong importance to equality and inclusion\u201d. The report added: \u201cSometimes, however, teaching places much more weight on the school\u2019s approach to social justice than on learning subject-specific knowledge and skills.\u201d In lower-school social studies, inspectors pointed out that pupils \u201cspend much time repeatedly considering identity (including analysing their own characteristics) rather than learning, for example, geographical knowledge\u201d. The teaching of middle-school humanities, including English, also led to a focus on social issues rather than subject knowledge and skills, the report said, leaving some pupils feeling underprepared for the next stage of their schooling. And while there was praise for the extracurricular activities on offer, the report raised concerns about the school\u2019s use of \u201caffinity groups\u201d, in which pupils discuss world issues, which in some cases were limited to under-represented groups. \u201cSome parents and pupils feel that this approach is divisive when seen alongside some teachers\u2019 stridently expressed views on social justice,\u201d the report said The report said the school\u2019s trustees had already taken action to deal with concerns raised around the promotion by some staff of political and partisan views and there has been a change in leadership. It concluded: \u201cWhile recognising the importance of promoting equalities, a significant minority of parents and pupils told inspectors that a culture has developed where alternative opinions are not felt welcome. \u201cIn some classrooms, teaching has not allowed for questioning or for the balanced presentation of opposing views. Leaders and trustees should ensure that teaching does not preclude tolerance of those with different views, particularly where specific partisan or political views are presented.\u201d An ASL spokesperson said: \u201cASL has been rated outstanding in all of our previous inspections. This review, however, was unusual in scope and substance, with a narrow focus on some aspects of our programme. \u201cDespite meeting 96% of the Independent School standards, our rating was downgraded two levels. We do not think this rating reflects the quality of our school or excellence of our teaching.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-23T05:28:20Z",
            "content": "Aquatic-safety advocate Angela Beale-Tawfeeq grew up swimming at the public pool in her predominantly Black neighborhood. \u201cWe always say, \u2018In North Philadelphia, born and raised, in the swimming pool is where we spent most of our days,\u2019 she recites, referencing the familiar lyrics of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song. Now the education and research director of Diversity in Aquatics (one of the nation\u2019s only organizations of Black and brown aquatics professionals), Beale-Tawfeeq is one of the many compelling voices contributing to Pool: A Social History of Segregation, a new wide-ranging exhibition about the United States\u2019s history of segregated swimming and its connection to today\u2019s alarming drowning rates in Black communities. Encompassing history, artworks and storytelling across a broad array of media, the immersive presentation uses public swimming pools as a lens through which to ponder social justice and public health. The 4,700-sq-ft exhibition is now on view at Philadelphia\u2019s historic Fairmount Water Works, a neo-classical landmark abutting the Schuylkill River that pumped water into the city until the turn of the 20th century and later became an aquarium and then one of the city\u2019s first integrated pools, backed by the father of the actor Grace Kelly. After decades of preservation efforts, most of the building reopened in 2003 as an environmental education center, but the three-lane cement pool area was never restored due to lack of funding, according to Victoria Prizzia, the exhibition organizer. \u201cIt felt very important to have that sacred space \u2013 a historic site and former public pool that had been neglected and captured in a state of arrested decay,\u201d says Prizzia, a former lifeguard and competitive swimmer who since 2009 has directed many projects about water issues and the environment. \u201cWhen you step inside, you really are transported. This is a reclaiming of that space, to tell the story in a different way.\u201d The exhibition\u2019s projections bring the walls of the space to life. Near the entrance lies a digital pool of water that visitors are encouraged to sit around and virtually dip their feet into while listening to interview excerpts from athletes, activists and academics. \u201cI love when you have the architectural elements speak for themselves, and in this case they really become another character,\u201d Prizzia notes. (And this character has seen its share of floods due to its riverbank location: the exhibition was all set to open in September, but Hurricane Ida swept through mere hours after the opening reception; the space flooded, but miraculously nothing was damaged.) Public pools have long been contested sites that reflect America\u2019s racial and economic divisions, since the 1920s when pools began to be segregated by race instead of, as previously, by sex or class. A deep anxiety emerged around that time about people of different races and sexes sharing such intimate spaces. In the south, segregation was mandated through city ordinances and other official exclusionary rules; in northern states, de facto segregation occurred as a result of building public pools in white neighborhoods or, more frequently, through intimidation, harassment and violence. A digital animation commission by the noted Philadelphia playwright James Ijames titled Moving Portraits interweaves the history of segregated swimming with the achievements of Black swimming heroes. Cast on to the Water Works\u2019 historic facade opposite custom stadium seating evoking the golden era of public pools, it\u2019s a highlight of the exhibition, according to Prizzia: \u201cWe\u2019re not only showing tragedy but also revealing this other current \u2013 the accomplishments that have been forgotten, happening in parallel, by Black swimmers.\u201d Also largely overlooked is the fact that many non-European peoples were proficient swimmers until the late 1800s, at which point a nascent white beach and pool culture drove people of color away from those spaces. In Pool, this essential and little-known historical context comes via archival images and narratives from Kevin Dawson, author of the 2018 book Undercurrents of Power: Aquatic Culture in the African Diaspora. \u201cThe exhibit is really important in that it\u2019s helping to encourage Black people to get back into the water,\u201d Dawson tells the Guardian. \u201cMany are seeing swimming as kind of their historical heritage that Jim Crow racism denied them.\u201d The legacy of that shameful history, compounded by the slashing of funds for public pools, is evident in today\u2019s grim drowning disparities: in Pennsylvania, Black children have a 50% higher rate of accidental drowning than white children. Nationwide, Black youth are almost six times more likely than white children to drown in a swimming pool, and 69% of Black children have little to no swimming ability, compared with 42% of white children. \u201cThe story of water is really a story of social justice,\u201d says Prizzia, pointing to inequities in land use, infrastructure and pollution in addition to access to swimming spaces. Philadelphia has a uniquely rich public pool culture, opening the first outdoor municipal pool in the US in 1883 (which functioned as a public bath for poor and immigrant communities who didn\u2019t have indoor plumbing) and, with more than 70 pools, still boasting the largest number of public pools per resident of any large American city. In response to an outcry over drownings in nearby rivers and creeks, seven swim clubs cropped up around the middle of the century to serve both urban and suburban Black swimmers. (Several are still going strong today, including the nation\u2019s first Black-owned swim club.) \u201cPhiladelphians love their pools,\u201d Prizzia says. \u201cThey\u2019re really important to the fabric of local neighborhoods. They\u2019re like your extended family.\u201d Beale-Tawfeeq knows that well: \u201cI grew up understanding that learning to swim can actually save lives in more ways than one.\u201d She joined the Philadelphia Parks and Recreation diving team at age 10, later was coached by the visionary Jim Ellis (who formed the country\u2019s first Black swim team and was the subject of the 2007 film Pride), and eventually attended Howard University on an athletic scholarship. Now a physical-education educator, she touts swimming\u2019s health benefits: \u201cIt\u2019s a physical activity you can do from six months old until you\u2019re 100.\u201d Beale-Tawfeeq notes there\u2019s trauma in the exhibition\u2019s narratives, but an exuberant mural at the exhibition entrance hopes to balance that. Created by El Salvador\u2013 born, Philadelphia-based artist Calo Rosa and representing an offering to a Yoruba water goddess, the piece exhorts visitors to \u201cdive in\u201d. \u201cWe wanted to create an invitation to come in and enjoy too,\u201d Prizzia says. \u201cBy excluding people from swimming, you\u2019re also excluding them from a very natural joy. People gravitate toward water; everyone wants to play in it. Hopefully the exhibition is a pathway for people to learn to swim and have access to something that would bring them joy.\u201d Pool: A Social History of Segregation is showing at the former Kelly Pool in the National Historic Landmark Fairmount Water Works until August 2022"

            "date": "2022-03-21T12:21:16Z",
            "content": "The supreme court justice Clarence Thomas was admitted to hospital after experiencing \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d and was then found to have an infection, the court said late on Sunday. A court spokesperson told news outlets Thomas, who has been vaccinated and boosted, did not have Covid-19. The court offered no explanation for why it waited two days to disclose that the justice was in the hospital. Thomas, a statement said, \u201cwas admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington DC on Friday evening after experiencing flu-like symptoms. \u201cHe underwent tests, was diagnosed with an infection and is being treated with intravenous antibiotics. His symptoms are abating, he is resting comfortably and he expects to be released in the hospital in a day or two.\u201d The 73-year-old conservative is the longest-serving justice, having been confirmed under George HW Bush in 1991. Thomas\u2019s confirmation hearings were tempestuous, after he was accused of sexual harassment, which he denied. The supreme court is meeting this week to hear arguments in four cases. The court said: \u201cJustice Thomas will participate in the consideration and discussion of any cases for which he is not present on the basis of the briefs, transcripts and audio of the oral arguments.\u201d In Congress on Monday, confirmation hearings will begin for Ketanji Brown Jackson, Joe Biden\u2019s first nominee to the court, who will if confirmed replace Stephen Breyer, another liberal who will retire this summer. Jackson will be the first African American woman on the court. Thomas was the second Black man to become a justice, after Thurgood Marshall. Justices are appointed for life or until they choose to retire. Thomas sits on the extreme right of a court tilted 6-3 in favour of conservatives after Donald Trump appointed three justices in his four-year term. Jackson\u2019s confirmation will not change that balance, prompting predictions that most Republicans may go relatively easy on the nominee during questioning. Some Republicans have indicated they could vote for Jackson. Others have mounted or signalled attacks. Extensive reporting of the activities of Thomas\u2019s wife, Ginni Thomas, a rightwing activist, has recently placed the justice in an uncomfortable spotlight. Ginni Thomas admitted last week that on 6 January 2021, she attended a rally in support of Trump\u2019s lie that his defeat by Biden was caused by electoral fraud. Clarence Thomas was the only justice to say Trump should be allowed to stop Congress obtaining White House records concerning the protests and the deadly Capitol riot which followed. On Sunday night Mehdi Hasan, an MSNBC host, wrote: \u201cI can both believe Justice Thomas should be impeached, as I wrote several days ago, while also offering positive thoughts and prayers today for his recovery and return to good health tonight.\u201d"

            "content": "In a makeshift hut by the ministry of justice in La Paz, Bolivia, a group of activists shuffle into place for a meeting. They are the survivors of the dictatorships that ruled Bolivia between 1964 and 1982; most are now in their 70s or 80s. In 2012, fearing the country was moving on without a reckoning, they built the hut and moved in: a permanent protest to demand justice for the crimes committed against them. Ten years later, they\u2019re still there. Almost 50 of them have died since the protest began, and many of the rest are old and ailing. Yet their demands seem no closer to being met. Operation Condor, the state terror network that targeted opponents of South America\u2019s military dictatorships, is better known for its actions in Argentina and Chile. But it was present in Bolivia, too, where more than 200 people were murdered and 150 forcibly disappeared. After its dictatorships, Bolivia had little transitional justice. When Evo Morales and the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) came to power in 2006, many victims believed the time had come, but ultimately, little changed: the military archives remained closed, and the government offered only partial reparations to the estimated 6,000 victims. And so, on 13 March 2012, the activists began their live-in protest. \u201cWe all supported it, we all agreed,\u201d said Victoria L\u00f3pez, who leads the activists today. \u201cBut we never thought it would last so many years, that it would entail so much suffering.\u201d Inside the hut, there is a meeting room, with a kitchen to one side and a bedroom to the other. It is on one of the busiest streets in the city, and the noise is relentless. At an altitude of almost 4,000m, it gets bitterly cold at night. In 10 years it has never been empty. Once a week, the activists gather to plan their next move. They are onetime politicians and union leaders, as well as teachers, miners and campesinos. The youngest are in their 60s, the oldest approaching 100. In 2017, after five years in the hut, the activists achieved one of their goals: a truth commission. Five investigators were chosen, among them Nila Heredia, a former MAS politician and member of ASOFAMD, an association for families of the disappeared. Heredia said that the commission lacked time and resources, but it did have access to military archives. Their report was handed to the government in March 2021. It has not been published online, but Heredia said it recommended reparations for the victims and their families \u2013 though not necessarily economic reparations. The government is yet to act on the report. The activists have become sceptical about the commission. They believe that the report maintains impunity and offers no real advance on emblematic cases, such as that of socialist leader Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz, one of the many whose bodies were never found. Another emblematic case is that of Juan Carlos Flores Bedregal, who at 27 years old was Bolivia\u2019s youngest ever parliamentarian when he disappeared in 1980. His family, having exhausted the legal options in Bolivia, have taken the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. \u201cEvery country has created its own transitional mechanisms, some with more success than others,\u201d said Karinna Fern\u00e1ndez, the lawyer representing the family. \u201cBut from our assessment, without a doubt, the country that has the greatest debt with its victims is Bolivia.\u201d Mark Goodale, an anthropologist who interviewed the activists, believes this neglect stems from the change that took place in the Bolivian left with the election of Morales in 2006. While the MAS is mostly centred around Indigenous politics, he says, the activists represent a traditional revolutionary left that is out of favour. \u201cThey are relics of an ideological past which doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez offers an alternative explanation. As a lawyer, she has dealt with various Bolivian governments \u2013 not just the MAS \u2013 and found no difference between them. \u201cWhy is it that they all have the same response of denials when it comes to forced disappearances? In my opinion, it reflects the influence of the armed forces.\u201d For Heredia, though, it is just a matter of priorities. \u201cAs it was not urgent, or more urgent, like the economic, social and development matters, we took too long to get to it.\u201d Yet the urgency is felt in the hut, where there is a banner with the number of years, months and days the protest has lasted \u2013 and a list with the name of each activist that has died in that time. \u201cWe are what remains of those that stood up to the dictators,\u201d said L\u00f3pez. \u201cWe won democracy for our country. And today we are forgotten.\u201d There is no national campaign for them, said Goodale, nor is it something that gets into the news. The protest has gone on so long, it has become invisible. \u201cAnd at some point, there won\u2019t be any survivors left. Then it will fade away.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-13T18:03:08Z",
            "content": "Forty years ago, the BBC broadcast a documentary series titled Police. In the most influential episode, the pioneering director Roger Graef, who sadly died this month, filmed three bullying male detectives interviewing a distressed rape victim in Reading police station. The footage caused a sensation. The furore led directly to tighter rape questioning guidelines. Four decades on, not enough has changed in British policing. A month ago, Dame Cressida Dick resigned after the revelation that 14 Metropolitan police officers had been sharing misogynistic and racist messages for at least two years. Since Sarah Everard\u2019s murder a year ago, trust in the police has fallen to record low levels; a majority now lack confidence in them to deal with crime in their local area. A high court ruling on Friday against the Met over its efforts to cancel a vigil for Ms Everard shows the yawning sensibility gap between the force and the public. Last week, two new reports underscored the unprecedented seriousness of this crisis. The first, the result of a comprehensive review chaired by Sir Michael Barber for the independent Police Foundation, warned that policing in Britain is at a crossroads. In what amounts to a red alert for public order, it said that, without urgent change, the principle of policing by consent that has defined this country\u2019s policing for decades risks being destroyed. The Barber team published 56 interconnected recommendations for reform, not just to police culture, but also to training, skills and organisational structure. Two days later, the chief inspector of constabulary for England and Wales echoed several of the same things. After a decade in post, Sir Tom Winsor ended his final review by saying there remain major shortcomings in British policing, that problems must not be underestimated, and that they are not confined to London. He told the 43 forces of England and Wales that they must operate as a unified network to become fitter for purpose. He warned that the current recruitment of 20,000 new officers risks hiring too many of the same kind of people who have done such reputational damage to the service. The reports are complementary. Both grasp the urgency for change. Both stress the neglected primacy of crime prevention. Both see neighbourhood policing, abjectly downgraded in many areas, as the bedrock of public confidence. Both say more spending and better training are essential. Both call for a change in police governance. Both stress the revolution in online crime. Sir Tom\u2019s warning that children are now in greater danger in their bedrooms than in the streets is chilling. Yet very little in the two reports is categorically new. Britain\u2019s modern policing system has faced repeated calls for reform, most powerfully after the 1981 riots and the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence. The issues have often been variations on the same themes: mistreatment of women, racism, police culture, unnecessary violence, complaints handling, structures and accountability. Although there have been periods of reform and progress, they have not been maintained and have sometimes even gone into reverse, as at present. A bigger and more lasting reform is therefore needed. But it is hard to see the Home Office, with its shattered departmental reputation and its obsession with immigration control, being capable of delivering it. It is inconceivable that the home secretary, Priti Patel, is capable of leading such a process either. Pending the election of a different government, the onus rests on the rising generation of police chiefs, College of Policing managers and local community leaders to do what they can to prepare the ground. The urgency, though, is beyond doubt. The stakes, as the Police Foundation report confirms, could hardly be higher."

            "date": "2022-03-21T06:00:17Z",
            "content": "It is a \u201cmoral imperative and operational necessity\u201d for police forces across the UK to demonstrate \u201cno tolerance for misogyny, racism and discrimination\u201d within their ranks and across wider society, the head of Police Scotland has said, adding that the voices of survivors of sexual violence are \u201cvital\u201d in making improvements. Writing exclusively for the Guardian, the chief constable of the force, Iain Livingstone, says: \u201cWords and good intent are not enough. There must be action \u2013 practical, firm, progressive, visible action.\u201d He adds that the \u201chard-earned lessons\u201d from reforming Police Scotland \u2013 the second largest force in the UK \u2013 can provide insights for colleagues and communities elsewhere. Almost a decade after Scotland merged 10 policing organisations into a single national service, Livingstone acknowledges that the transition has been \u201cenormously challenging\u201d and \u201cwe did not get everything right\u201d, but points to the force\u2019s record on solving murder cases, the policing of the Cop26 climate summit and drug overdose prevention as evidence of how the restructuring has improved policing. Last week, two separate reviews led by Sir Michael Barber and Sir Tom Winsor argued that the 43 forces of England and Wales must operate as a unified network if they are to become fitter for purpose. They also recommended changes to training and skills. Policing culture remains under close scrutiny following the murder of Sarah Everard in March last year and evidence of institutional misogyny and racism at the Met that ultimately led to the resignation last month of the force\u2019s commissioner, Cressida Dick. Livingstone refers to the \u201cDon\u2019t Be That Guy\u201d public awareness campaign, launched last October, which called on men to interrogate their own and their peers\u2019 behaviour towards women. \u201cThis was an important message for Scottish society, including for us in policing \u2013 as individuals and as a service.\u201d Immediately after details emerged of Everard\u2019s abduction by a serving police officer, Livingstone introduced a verification scheme to reassure women approached by a lone police officer \u2013 a measure, he writes, that reflected \u201cthe onus on policing to accept responsibility for addressing public concerns\u201d. These moves were welcomed by campaigners, especially in the wake of other responses that appeared to emphasise the need for female victims to take responsibility for protecting themselves. \u201cOperational failings, or when we don\u2019t live up to our values, are rightly subject to critical review,\u201d writes Livingstone. He ordered an independent review last October after an industrial tribunal found evidence of a \u201csexist culture\u201d in Scotland\u2019s armed police. Another independent public inquiry is currently under way into the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died in 2015 in police custody after he was restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife. \u201cAs we continue our own development,\u201d he concludes, \u201cour offer is to share the insight and value that Scotland\u2019s hard-earned lessons can provide to improve policing for communities across the UK.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-02T16:02:40Z",
            "content": "The Scottish government\u2019s long-awaited bill to simplify how people legally change the sex on their birth certificate is finally published on Thursday. Since Nicola Sturgeon first mooted the changes to obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC) in 2016, this reform and associated legislation on the census, hate crime and the right of rape victims to request the sex of their medical examiner, have resulted in the most significant revolts of her premiership. Proponents of the reforms \u2013 which include removing the requirement for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria \u2013 hope they will streamline a process that transgender people find intrusive and distressing, but will not affect the spaces or services they use in their day-to-day lives. Critics argue that the simplification \u2013 known as self-identification \u2013 will fundamentally alter who can access women-only services and that the planned changes are already prompting an unwelcome policy shift, for example in single-sex wards. On Thursday, Shona Robison, the cabinet secretary responsible, will make a parliamentary statement to launch the bill, not usual procedure and a reflection of the fraught context of reform. Campaigners, advisers and politicians have told the Guardian they believe that delays to the bill have created a vacuum in which a toxic discourse has taken hold, damaging trust between the Scottish National party and the LGBT+ community that will take more than the success of this legislation to repair. In advance of publication, MSPs describe an atmosphere of trepidation, with supporters and critics fearing a \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201cfebrile\u201d debate in Holyrood. Within the SNP, finance secretary Kate Forbes \u2013 a member of the socially conservative Free Church of Scotland \u2013 is the most senior politician to express concerns. It is understood that critical voices hold less sway throughout the party after a number left to join Alex Salmond\u2019s Alba party, which has been accused of weaponising the reform against the SNP, although there is also deep disappointment within other sections of the party at the way alleged transphobia has been handled internally. A handful of SNP rebels are reported to be pressing for a free vote on this bill, as there was for same-sex marriage in 2014, and there are wider concerns that public uncertainty about the proposals could lose votes in May\u2019s council elections. The reform was a non-negotiable aspect of the Scottish Greens\u2019 partnership deal with the SNP, while the Scottish Lib Dems are likewise strongly in support, the Scottish Labour group is understood to be largely in favour and Scottish Conservatives largely against. While advocates calculate the overall arithmetic for the bill there remain concerns that some critics have not yet taken a public stance, and complaints there has not been enough internal discussion within parties. Those hopeful of a respectful debate praise the all-party LGBT+ group led by the Conservatives\u2019 Jamie Greene and the SNP\u2019s Emma Roddick for brokering informal conversations. Vic Valentine of Scottish Trans Alliance said the time taken to implement reform had been \u201cfrustrating and harmful\u201d, while another experienced LGBT+ campaigner, Blair Anderson, explained: \u201cScotland has become the lightning rod because reform has been shelved elsewhere.\u201d The UK government dropped plans for self-identification two years ago. Last week, Scotland\u2019s highest court approved the decision by the government agency running this month\u2019s census to allow any transgender person to self-identify as their lived sex \u2013 after a challenge by Fair Play for Women, which overturned similar guidance in England and Wales. The Guardian has spoken to a number of transgender Scots about the current process of acquiring a gender recognition certificate, which requires an individual to have lived in their preferred gender for two years and evidence of a medical diagnosis. One described the \u201cdemeaning\u201d experience of a \u201cfaceless panel\u201d thumbing through their private medical notes. Several had been unable to secure the necessary documents because of \u201cpedantic\u201d requirements: for example, their specialist had not used an accepted medical term on a form, or their old patient paper records had been shredded. Young trans people in particular have described being hurt and angered by the recent intervention from the Equality and Human Rights Commission urging the Scottish government to pause its reforms for \u201cmore detailed consideration\u201d, despite two public consultations since 2017. The argument that the reforms are purely a simplification of the process have been \u201ckicked into touch\u201d by the recent EHRC letter, argues Susan Smith of For Women Scotland, one of the most active critical groups, founded in 2018. \u201cThis is opening up gender recognition certificates to a whole new cohort of people, without gatekeeping, and there is huge public opposition to self-identification and the risk of people taking advantage of that.\u201d FWS say supporters are \u201cstepping up\u201d their campaigning \u2013 which has already seen protesters booing Nicola Sturgeon outside Holyrood. Recent polling by Savanta ComRes for the BBC found that, while 57% supported making the process of obtaining a certificate easier, support fell over specific proposals, with 40% in favour of self-identification and 38% against it, while 44% opposed reducing the amount of time spent living in the acquired gender, compared with 37% in favour. LGBT+ campaigners say there will be no \u201cfloodgates\u201d: the reforms still require a person to be living permanently in their chosen gender for three months, along with a three-month cooling off period, and any increase is likely to reflect those who had other documents, like a passport or driving licence, changed already. They insist that the profile of people applying will not change. But Murray Blackburn Mackenzie, a policy analysis collective also set up in 2018 and which has been highly critical of Scottish government \u201cbiased\u201d engagement with sympathetic campaigners, recently argued that ministers sought to \u201cminimise\u201d the effect of the plans, making it \u201ceasier to dismiss even the possibility of unintended consequences.\u201d."

            "title": "Policing in Scotland has been radically reformed \u2013 all UK forces can learn from us | Iain Livingstone",
            "date": "2022-03-21T06:00:19Z",
            "content": "Our police services across the UK are under intense scrutiny. The onus is on us to nurture trust and legitimacy by demonstrating no tolerance for misogyny, racism and discrimination within policing and across society. Equally, ensuring an effective and professional policing response for victims and communities is a prerequisite for public confidence. Two recent reports from Sir Michael Barber and Sir Tom Winsor both called for structural, cultural and operational reform of policing in England and Wales, as referred to in last week\u2019s Guardian editorial. But when discussing policing reform in Britain, it is important to consider the experiences of Police Scotland. Nine years ago, 10 policing organisations in Scotland merged into a single national police service of about 23,000 people, the second largest in the UK, serving a third of Britain\u2019s land mass and communities in villages, towns, islands and cities. Establishing a reformed service has been enormously challenging and we did not get everything right. However, much progress has been made. Under our structure, we have strengthened operational competence and provided direct access to all policing capabilities for every citizen. More than 520 murders and homicides have been committed in Scotland since 2013. Only two are currently unsolved. Our safety and security operation for last November\u2019s Cop26 resulted in no significant violence, disorder or injury and relatively few arrests. The climate change summit, along with our approach to policing during the pandemic, demonstrated our core duty and responsibility to enable the public to make their voices heard \u2013 and independent reviewing has largely concluded Police Scotland did so in line with our commitment to put human rights at the heart of all we do. Last month, I announced Police Scotland will become the first service in the world to train and equip all operational officers with Naloxone, a life-saving overdose first aid nasal-spray, on a national basis, reflecting our broad mission to improve the safety and wellbeing of communities as enshrined in the law establishing Police Scotland. Tests remain: operational failings, or when we don\u2019t live up to our values, are rightly subject to critical review and require persistent leadership, focus and action. We must face up to the cultural challenges of UK policing as a whole, of other sectors and organisations, and of wider society. That\u2019s been underlined by reports including Dame Elish Angiolini\u2019s review of police complaints and individual cases such as Rhona Malone\u2019s employment tribunal, describing unacceptable behaviours. There is a moral imperative and operational necessity for policing to lead change to improve the experiences of all our communities, including our own officers and staff. Words and good intent are not enough. There must be action; practical, firm, progressive, visible action. Structural simplicity and stability can help drive progress: our response to serious offending has been transformed under reform but we continue to listen so we can do better, our resolve to tackle violence against women and girls being a clear example. Last year, I was grateful to meet survivors to hear directly about their experiences of the criminal justice system. The voices and perspectives of survivors and groups such as Rape Crisis Scotland are vital and help us to improve our response to rape and sexual offending. Every year since reform we have returned more than \u00a3200m to the public purse while providing better, more efficient policing. This remains an achievement and a challenge \u2013 especially given that serving increasingly complex community needs requires significant investment. Digitally enabled offending such as online child sexual abuse and fraud continue to grow at a very high rate, underlining that online policing is frontline policing. We must build the workforce and tools to keep people safe in public, private and virtual spaces. It is wrong to view community policing and specialist capability as competing imperatives \u2013 they complement each other and both are essential to build public confidence. Confidence to come forward. Confidence you will be treated fairly, with compassion and respect. Confidence our response will be professional and thorough. Reform has enabled clearer communication, leadership and accountability \u2013 key when driving change. Last October, our That Guy public awareness campaign asked men to challenge their own and each other\u2019s behaviours and attitudes towards women. This was an important message for Scottish society, including for us in policing \u2013 as individuals and as a service. A verification scheme, established to reassure women approached by lone officers, also reflected the onus on policing to accept responsibility for addressing public concerns. Policing in Scotland is realistic about the challenges ahead but confident in the progress made and optimistic we can build on it. I am encouraged by the consistently strong levels of public confidence reported in our own research, and by the recent Scottish government household survey which found 87% of respondents trusted the police. The key assessment I apply is whether our communities and people are safer and better served now than they would have been had reform not taken place - not only for the threats of today but those of tomorrow. The answer is yes. As we continue our own development, our offer is to share the insight and value that Scotland\u2019s hard-earned lessons can provide to improve policing for communities across the UK.

            "date": "2022-03-06T06:00:45Z",
            "content": "Prominent women, including the former Australian of the year Grace Tame and the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, are launching a fresh call for the Morrison government to implement significant policies to protect women and children from violence, harassment and discrimination. On the eve of International Women\u2019s Day, the new coalition \u2013 which includes Christine Holgate, Lucy Turnbull, the former Liberal MP Julia Banks, as well as the film-maker and Indigenous advocate Larissa Behrendt, the youth advocate Yasmin Poole, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Michele O\u2019Neil, the businesswoman Wendy McCarthy, the consent activist Chanel Contos, the Paralympic gold medalist Madison de Rozario, and The Parenthood\u2019s Georgie Dent \u2013 has launched a social media campaign to press for reforms. The high-powered group is calling on the government to implement the central recommendation of the Respect@Work report \u2013 imposing a positive duty on employers to safeguard their staff from sexual harassment. In addition, the call is for 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave, full implementation of the National Plan for First Nations Women and Girls, ensuring effective employment programs for women with disability, enacting stronger and consistent child sexual assault laws, and legislative measures to address the gender pay gap. The group is also seeking the provision of free, accessible and quality early childhood education and care, expansion of paid parental leave, and embedding respectful relationships and consent education in schools, universities, workplaces and homes. In a new video message fronted by members of the coalition, the women make it clear they want to continue the momentum of 2021 \u2013 an extraordinary year where thousands of Australian women and their allies took part in public demonstrations triggered by a #MeToo moment in the Australian parliament. In February, Scott Morrison, along with other political leaders, apologised for the \u201cterrible things\u201d that happened in parliament workplaces and acknowledged a culture of bullying, abuse, harassment \u201cand in some cases even violence\u201d built up over decades. Morrison\u2019s apology followed a landmark review by Australia\u2019s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, in 2021 into federal parliament\u2019s culture. The Jenkins review, which recommended a significant overhaul of the workplace culture, found one in three staffers interviewed had been sexually harassed. That inquiry was constituted after Higgins, a former government adviser, alleged she was raped by a colleague after hours in a Parliament House ministerial office in March 2019. The new social media campaign video opens with Tame, a survivor of sexual assault, declaring: \u201cAustralia \u2013 we need to talk\u201d. The women note that 2021 \u201cwasn\u2019t the first year that women in Australia were harassed or unsafe or ignored or disrespected\u201d. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even the first year that women spoke up about these things. But in 2021 more Australians started to listen to women of different ages, occupations and beliefs, who stood up and spoke out, exposing discrimination, harassment, sexism, disrespect and intimidation,\u201d they say. \u201cAnd the more people listened, the more familiar the story became\u201d. In a joint statement, members of the coalition noted one in five Australian women would be sexually assaulted or raped in her lifetime, and one in three women would encounter workplace sexual harassment. Poole, Plan International\u2019s national ambassador and advocate for girls\u2019 rights, noted: \u201cIf you\u2019re a First Nations woman, a woman of colour, have a disability or identify as LGBTIQ+, those statistics are even worse.\u201d Morrison governments announces funding Separately, the Morrison government announced on Sunday it would spend $189m over five years on strengthening prevention and early intervention efforts in family, domestic and sexual violence. The pledge includes $104m over five years for the primary prevention organisation Our Watch, which will help it to drive change in the corporate sector and raise awareness about gendered violence. The minister for women, Marise Payne, said Our Watch would also develop safety programmes for use in Tafes, universities, the media, workplaces and sports organisations. \u201cOur Watch will also boost its efforts in prevention for LGBTIQA+ Australians, Australians with disability and migrant women and develop further resources to educate young people about consent,\u201d Payne said. The government will fund two new campaigns to run across mass media channels, including television, cinema, social media and bus stops. One of the campaigns will be adapted from Scotland\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be That Guy\u201d initiative and will ask men to consider \u201chow they can hold each other to account because sexual violence should not be considered a women\u2019s problem to solve\u201d. The other government-funded campaign will target young people 12 and older and their parents. The minister for women\u2019s safety, Anne Ruston, said new research showed while almost nine in 10 Australians polled agreed \u201cadults should talk to young people more about the topic of consent\u201d, almost half of Australians were confused about the issue of sexual consent. That led them to actively avoid the topic. \u201cToday we are also making the announcement to fund a survey of secondary school-age students so that we can understand what are the issues that they are confronted with as they make their journey through life and to make sure that they have a better understanding of consent,\u201d Ruston said. The Australian Human Rights Commission will develop the survey in partnership with coalition member Contos, who is the founder of Teach Us Consent. Ruston said the government was committed to making Australia \u201ca country where everybody lives free from fear of violence and free from violence\u201d. Patty Kinnersly, the chief executive of Our Watch, said the organisation was seeing \u201crecord demand for our support and services in universities, workplaces and sporting clubs and organisations\u201d and community sentiment was changing. \u201cWe are now talking about consent, we are now talking about violence against women being in the public domain, we are now giving people in the community to be bystanders and not let the sexist joke go past,\u201d Kinnersly said."

            "content": "Global warming is changing European birds as we know them, a study has found, but it\u2019s not just the increase in temperature that\u2019s to blame. Researchers have found that garden warblers, for example, are having a quarter fewer chicks, which has huge implications for the species. Chiffchaffs are laying their eggs 12 days earlier. Some birds are decreasing in size, while others, such as redstarts, are getting larger. Researchers pored over data collected since the mid-60s in Britain and the Netherlands on 60 different species, including the house sparrow, the crested tit, the reed bunting, the bullfinch and the willow warbler. They zero in on how these birds have changed over time with regard to their egg-laying schedules, number of offspring and morphology. Although research has already linked the way passerines are getting smaller over time to hotter temperatures, scientists weren\u2019t sure whether this was due to heat stress directly or because rising temperatures make it harder to forage. The scientists investigated what proportion of changes over time were linked to warming, and whether warming affected some species or traits more than others, as well as whether other factors unrelated to temperature reinforced these effects. The study, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal last week, found that although more than half of trait changes are linked with rising temperatures \u2013 and warming is likely the largest factor driving change over the years \u2013 other factors such as urbanisation, pollution, habitat loss and more could also affect shifts in characteristics. \u201cFor example, climate change caused chiffchaffs to lay their eggs six days earlier over the last 50 years, but other unknown environmental factors led to an additional six days, meaning in total they now lay their eggs 12 days earlier than they did half a century ago\u201d, said Martijn van de Pol, lead author of the paper from James Cook University in Australia. A change in schedule this big can cause a mismatch between when chicks are born and when food is available for them, breaking the ecosystem balance. On average, up to 57% of overall change over the past decades can be linked to temperature warming, according to the study. Approximately 32% of 60 bird species had changes in body conditions due to temperatures, with an average decrease in size of 0.45% for every celsius increase in heat. About 86% had changes in egg-laying times, and 31% had changes in their number of offspring. \u201cGarden warblers in the UK have experienced a 26% decrease in their average number of offspring over the past half century, which is really concerning for the long-term fate of this species,\u201d said Nina McLean, the lead researcher on the study, from the ANU Research School of Biology. \u201cBut only half of this reduction, 13%, can be attributed to climate change.\u201d Not all species are being affected the same way. Some, like the redstart, are clearly increasing their body condition and offspring number. The researchers speculate the variation of how much different species\u2019 traits are changing is most probably up to non-temperature factors. \u201cThe study gives a well-grounded explanation for why different species change at such different rates. And it is not to do with temperature sensitivity, but with those other, non-temperature factors,\u201d said Shahar Dubiner, an ecologist at Tel Aviv University, who was not involved in the study. Dubiner\u2019s research has, similarly, found dramatic changes in shape and body condition for over half of Israeli bird species \u2013 including many who migrate from Europe, such as storks. Overall, this means warming is likely the largest factor driving trait change, but it\u2019s not the only element at play. Other adjacent factors may play a more prominent role than previously thought \u2013 the question is what these other non-temperature factors are, and how they are linked to temperature increase. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 March 2022, to correct errors in the meaning of \u2018passerine\u2019. A previous version indicated that passerines did not include redstarts, and referred solely to the swallow family. In fact it covers a far broader category of birds, including redstarts. The time period from which the research was gathered was also corrected, from the mid-90s to mid-60s."

            "date": "2022-03-23T04:20:25Z",
            "content": "The Lismore council has been gripped by in-fighting over whether it should make references to \u201cclimate change\u201d following the flood disaster and a decision to pause its work on flood mitigation despite warnings the \u201coptics\u201d of doing so were \u201cnot good\u201d. The disaster-ravaged town is still in the early stages of recovering from an unprecedented 14.4-metre flood, which wiped out thousands of homes and businesses and brought Lismore to its knees. On Tuesday, in a late-night sitting, Lismore council proposed a message of thanks to volunteers and the community for their efforts in the immediate response and clean-up effort. It included a line saying the council \u201cacknowledges we are likely to experience further disasters of this nature as climate change continues to escalate\u201d. The words \u201cclimate change\u201d prompted a reaction from four councillors, led by independent councillor Big Rob, who attempted to have the reference removed and replaced with a line saying \u201cwe are definitely going to experience further disasters of this nature\u201d. Rob \u2013 who says he does not deny climate change but likes to \u201cstir up lefties\u201d \u2013 said he did not think a message of community support was the right place to make \u201cpolitical\u201d statements about climate change. \u201cThat motion was about thanking people, not being political about climate change,\u201d he said. Rob was supported by three other councillors, including Andrew Gordon, who told the Guardian it was \u201cpiss poor\u201d to add a climate change reference to a statement thanking the community. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The effort to delete the reference to climate change failed. But it rankled other councillors, including Greens councillor Adam Guise, who first proposed the climate change reference be added. \u201cThey tried to couch it as not politicising it,\u201d Guise said . \u201cBut this is the whole thing about climate change, it\u2019s not political, it\u2019s science.\u201d The dispute came amid further divisions within council over a decision to halt the work of a key committee working to improve flood mitigation measures in Lismore. That occurred despite councillors acknowledging the \u201coptics\u201d of pausing the flood mitigation committee so soon after a disaster were \u201cnot good\u201d. The council has also sacked members of the Lismore community who were on a community reference group advising council on flood mitigation. On Tuesday, at 11pm, the council decided to pause the work of the floodplain committee to wait for more information from CSIRO, which has been given $10m to explore flood mitigation measures in the region. Lismore council decided it should hold off doing any further work on flood mitigation of its own until it understood what CSIRO was doing. But councillor Vanessa Ekins, who chairs the committee, warned that could take months. She said pausing the committee was \u201cvery dangerous ground\u201d and would not look good to Lismore residents. \u201cWe have just been through a big flood, we are still experiencing that and for us to send a message out there that we are pausing work that we have been working really hard on for years until we hear what the CSIRO are doing \u2026 they might take six months to tell us what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could take a really, really long time and meanwhile our community has no guidance from us, we\u2019re not doing anything, we\u2019ve paused the consultation we\u2019re currently engaged in until someone else tells us what they\u2019re doing.\u201d She said the decision was \u201cabsolutely outrageous\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that our flood plain committee continues the work that it\u2019s been doing for the last five years on mitigating the impacts of flooding on the CBD and residences,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were in the middle of a consultation process with members of the community about various options.\u201d Others were furious that community members had been sacked from the committee so soon after the floods. \u201cWe had community members on that committee with five years\u2019 experience and expertise in understanding the mitigation options that were before us,\u201d councillor Elly Bird said. \u201cTo throw all of that experience away, I don\u2019t support it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-26T10:00:53Z",
            "content": "Jannina Campos walks up a sandy hillside in Arica, a port city on the edge of the Atacama desert, the driest place on the planet. The slope is dotted with dozens of orange markers placed in December. Each indicates skeletal remains recently uncovered by unusually strong winds and increased rainfall. \u201cEvery time a body appears we place a flag, and we bury it again,\u201d said Campos, an archaeologist. \u201cThey\u2019ve been preserved there for 7,000 years.\u201d The sprawling cemetery belongs to the Chinchorro, an ancient culture of hunters and fishers who painstakingly mummified their dead. After stripping their loved ones of their skin and organs, they swaddled their skeletons in elaborate confections of reeds, sea lion skins, clay, alpaca wool, and wigs of human hair, trusting in the arid desert climate to preserve them for eternity. But their gravesites, dotted around Chile\u2019s far north, are increasingly being disturbed by abnormal weather linked to the climate crisis, and their remains left exposed to the elements. This presents cash-strapped archaeologists with a dilemma: try to rescue everything they can, or simply cover up the cadavers and focus on conserving and studying already-excavated mummies. \u201cThe museums are a bit overwhelmed with all this material,\u201d said Bernardo Arriaza, a leading expert on the Chinchorro at the University of Tarapac\u00e1 in Arica. Increasing humidity in the Atacama is damaging the mummies already in collections. Some are sprouting with mould; others are succumbing to dry rot or being nibbled by insects. Their eclectic mix of materials makes it hard to get storage conditions exactly right, he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic solution.\u201d At a museum a short walk down the hill, Campos pointed through a glass floor to dozens of skeletal Chinchorro bodies below, the sand around them speckled with white fragments. \u201cThat\u2019s the bones turning to dust,\u201d she said. A ray of hope came last July, when the Chinchorro mummies were inscribed on the Unesco World Heritage list after a laborious, 20-year application process. Many anticipate that growing appreciation for the mummies \u2013 and the beginning of construction this year of a new, climate-controlled \u00a314m ($19m) museum near Arica \u2013 could help arrest the disappearance of what Arriaza calls \u201ca wonder of world prehistory\u201d. The Chinchorro mummies are the earliest examples of deliberate mummification anywhere in the world, say scholars. They date back to 5,000BC \u2013 more than two millennia before Egyptian pharaohs were first embalmed and entombed in pyramids. They also possess a striking aesthetic value \u2013 and a poignant human resonance. The semi-nomadic coastal dwellers cast no pottery nor built any monuments. Instead, \u201cthe body becomes a kind of canvas where they express their emotions,\u201d said Arriaza. \u201cThe Chinchorro transform their dead into genuine works of pre-Hispanic art.\u201d A clue as to why this remarkable outpouring of feeling may have first emerged lies in Caleta Camarones, 60 miles south of Arica. Sitting at the mouth of a green, fertile river valley gouged through barren desert, the spot is an Eden-like oasis \u2013 and its fresh drinking water and teeming animal life probably enticed the first Chinchorro to settle here. But it had hidden dangers, said Arriaza. The Camarones River carries 1000 micrograms per litre of arsenic: a hundred times the safe human limit. With every drink of water, the Chinchorro were unknowingly poisoning themselves, analysis of hair samples shows \u2013 and they suffered high rates of miscarriages and infant deaths as a result. The earliest Chinchorro mummies come from here: tiny babies and stillborn foetuses, their fragile forms bolstered by sticks and adorned by sparingly carved masks of black manganese. Over 3,500 years, Chinchorro mummification spread to adults and evolved \u2013 via ochre-daubed corpses stuffed with feathers to bandages of pelican skin. Today, residents of Caleta Camarones feel a strong affinity with the Chinchorro, said Jorge Ardiles, part of a group of artisanal fishing families who settled here 30 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s not a genetic link, but a natural connection,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were fishermen; so are we.\u201d Ardiles drove his battered truck along the shoreline, and pointed out deep excavations lined with dense banks of discarded mollusc shells. \u201cRight there is where they found the oldest mummies in the world,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cAll this hillside is full of bodies.\u201d A few metres above the track, resting on ancient reed mats, several skeletons jutted out of the scree, uncovered by wind and rain and now at the mercy of grave robbers and the elements. \u201cThe authorities don\u2019t care,\u201d Ardiles lamented. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones looking after the area.\u201d The fisher argued that a basic site museum should display Chinchorro artefacts found by locals: quartz arrowheads, fish hooks, combs made of cactus spines. But efforts to get small-scale tourism initiatives off the ground have stalled, partly because the community is the subject of a decades-long land dispute. Visitors are often disappointed not to find pristine cadavers in Inca-style palaces, said Cristian Zavala, the local mayor. \u201cIf you go to Machu Picchu, it\u2019s obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here, the history is below the ground.\u201d Zavala expressed hope that UNESCO status, and Chile\u2019s current redrafting of its dictatorship-era constitution, could force the government to better protect and promote the mummies. \u201cLook how many bodies are turning up,\u201d the mayor added, gesturing at the bone-studded slope. \u201cIf we don\u2019t look after the Chinchorro, they\u2019ll vanish because of climate change.\u201d The living are also suffering the effects of ecological upheaval. The nearby ocean is emptying of marine life, warned Ardiles, blaming overfishing by trawlers and warming waters. The younger generation are abandoning fishing and entering the Atacama\u2019s mining industry \u2013 itself increasingly under fire for exhausting water resources and contaminating the desert. \u201cI can\u2019t see the fishermen continuing here,\u201d Ardiles reflected. \u201cWe\u2019re going to disappear, like the Chinchorro.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-03-29T04:01:12Z",
            "content": "Bitcoin mining already uses as much energy as Sweden, according to some reports, and its booming popularity is revitalizing failing fossil fuel enterprises in the US. But all that could change with a simple switch in the way it is coded, according to a campaign launched on Tuesday. The campaign, called Change the Code Not the Climate and coordinated by Environmental Working Group, Greenpeace USA and several groups battling bitcoin mining facilities in their communities, is calling on bitcoin to change the way bitcoins are mined in order to tackle its outsized carbon footprint. The software code that bitcoin uses \u2013 known as \u201cproof of work\u201d \u2013 requires the use of massive computer arrays to validate and secure transactions. Proof of work is a way of checking that a miner has solved the extremely complex cryptographic puzzles needed to add to the bitcoin ledger. Rival cryptocurrency ethereum is shifting to another system \u2013 \u201cproof of stake\u201d \u2013 that it believes will reduce its energy use by 99%. In the proof of stake model, miners pledge their coins to verify transactions; adding inaccurate information leads to penalties. With the value and use of cryptocurrencies rising, the campaign\u2019s organizers argue bitcoin must follow suit or find another, less energy intensive, method. \u201cThis is a big problem. In part because of where the industry stands now but also because of our concerns about its growth,\u201d said Michael Brune, campaign director and former executive director of Sierra Club. The US now leads the world in cryptocurrency mining after China launched a crackdown on mining and trading last May. \u201cCoal plants which were dormant or slated to be closed are now being revived and solely dedicated to bitcoin mining. Gas plants, which in many cases were increasingly economically uncompetitive, are also now being dedicated to bitcoin mining. We are seeing this all across the country,\u201d said Brune. Brune added: \u201cIt\u2019s particularly painful to see this in the electric sector because that is precisely the place where the US has made most of its progress in the last decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can reach our climate goals if we are reviving fossil fuel plants. Some bitcoin miners have recently begun powering their operations using renewable energy from wind and solar. But Brune said while such moves were \u201cclearly well-intentioned\u201d, adding \u201csome boutique wind or solar operations powering a few high- profile mining operations\u201d would not do enough to counter the environmental cost. \u201cFossil fuel growth is outpacing renewable growth in bitcoin mining and that\u2019s the fundamental challenge,\u201d Brune said. Without a change to the code, the fundamental problem will remain that bitcoin\u2019s code \u201cincentivizes maximum energy use\u201d, said Chris Larsen, founder and executive chairman of crypto company Ripple and a climate activist. \u201cThe minute that there is the opportunity to go to something dirty, which is what you are seeing, that is going to happen.\u201d One \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d, he said, is that the world does get to a renewable future in China, the US and EU but countries rich in fossil fuel switch to bitcoin mining to keep their operations running. \u201cImagine the Saudis sitting on all that oil, which has a cost of about \u00bd cent per kilowatt hour \u2013 no renewable can match that,\u201d Larsen said. \u201cBitcoin mining could be this endless monetization engine for fossil fuels. That would be a nightmare.\u201d The campaign is launching with digital advertising in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Marketwatch, Politico, Facebook and other publications. Organizers are also taking legal action against proposed mining sites and using their large memberships to push bitcoin\u2019s biggest investors and influencers to call for a code change. \u201cIn this world, with all these smart people, there has got to be a better solution,\u201d said Larsen."

            "content": "Josh Frydenberg has flagged he is \u201copen\u201d to further market interventions making insurance more affordable, but says more preparatory work will need to be done before the Morrison government would extend its $10bn cyclone reinsurance pool in northern Australia to cover more natural disasters. In an interview with Guardian Australia ahead of the budget on 29 March, the treasurer said he was conscious that a changing climate rendered insurance problematic in some parts of Australia. Frydenberg said the cleanup after catastrophic flooding in New South Wales and Queensland would be a focal point in his pre-election economic statement. Asked whether he would extend the current reinsurance scheme in line with a recent call from the scheme\u2019s principal architect, the veteran Liberal Warren Entsch, Frydenberg said: \u201cThere\u2019s more work to be done.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m open to finding ways to make insurance more accessible and affordable,\u201d the treasurer said. \u201cI\u2019m conscious that many people in flood- and fire-prone zones are either underinsured or not insured at all because the cost of insurance can be prohibitively high.\u201d Asked whether he was happy with the reinsurance model, which had been controversial with both the insurance sector and Australia\u2019s consumer regulator before its ultimate adoption by the Coalition, Frydenberg said: \u201cIt\u2019s early days but it\u2019s been well received and there was a lot of work done. \u201cBut I\u2019m not creating expectations. There are questions about how to make that workable, so we\u2019ll have to get further work done.\u201d Legislation giving effect to the current proposal, which covers cyclones and related flood damage, has already passed the House of Representatives and is expected to clear the Senate during budget week. The scheme is supposed to be operational by July. The current reinsurance pool model for cyclones and related flood damage covers residential, strata and small business property insurance policies in northern Australia. Entsch, the north Queensland MP, told Guardian Australia earlier this month recent disasters, including the recent floods, had made the case to apply the government guarantee more broadly a \u201cno-brainer\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Morrison government is hoping the looming March budget will create a political springboard into the election the prime minister will call shortly after. A raft of polls suggest Labor would win an election held today. The economic statement is expected to contain cash payments providing cost-of-living relief for low and middle income earners, as well as spending on security and defence and on local manufacturing and regional infrastructure, including new hydrogen proposals for the energy transition. With fuel prices soaring, and other consumer prices on the rise, the government faces political pressure to assist households given wages growth is persistently sluggish. The government favours short-term cash payments to help with rising petrol and grocery prices in order to avoid building structural spending into the budget bottom line. Asked whether the Reserve Bank of Australia could lift interest rates while Australia was on an election footing, Frydenberg said that was ultimately a decision for the central bank. But he said the RBA, based on its public commentary, would be monitoring inflation and employment and looking for signs of wages growth before increasing the official cash rate. With the latest labour force statistics confirming Australia\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 4% in February, down from 4.2% in January and its lowest level since 2008, the government will attempt to engage disadvantaged and disengaged young Australians in labour market readiness programs. The budget will contain a $46.8m pre-employment program for people between the ages of 15 and 24. The government says the program will provide community-focused interventions including training and work experience. In another pre-budget announcement, the government has also earmarked about $75m in additional support for travel agents and tour providers, following pandemic-related disruptions. The tourism minister, Dan Tehan, said the targeted program would \u201csupport travel agents and tour arrangement service providers to meet ongoing costs of running outlets, continue to process rebookings and provide high-quality customer service to their customers\u201d. Asked whether the government was serious about moving past fiscal support for businesses hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic even if new variants necessitated a public health response \u2013 a position Frydenberg has publicly signalled \u2013 he said the days of \u201clarge economy-wide-scale support has ended\u201d."

            "title": "Six promises you can make to help reduce carbon emissions",
            "date": "2022-03-07T07:00:38Z",
            "content": "Research shows that people in wealthier, high-consuming countries can help avert climate breakdown by making six relatively straightforward lifestyle changes, creating a society of \u201cless stuff and more joy\u201d. Experts say if enacted these \u201cshifts\u201d would account for a quarter of the required emissions reductions needed to keep the global heating down to 1.5C and increase pressure on government and the private sector to make the necessary far-reaching systemic change. The research has inspired the Jump campaign, urging people to sign up to make the changes. Tom Bailey, one of its co-founders, said if pledging to make all six shifts is too daunting, just making a start on some of them can make a difference. End clutter Keep electronic products \u2013 smartphones, personal computers, smartwatches and TVs \u2013 for at least seven years. \u201cThe addiction to gadgets and buying \u2018stuff\u2019 in general is a major contributor to carbon emissions,\u201d according to the report. The process of extracting rare earth metals and producing ever more products often generates more emissions than using the items themselves, the study shows. For example, only 13% of an iPhone 11\u2019s lifetime emissions are down to its use; the other 86% are associated with its production, transport and end-of-life processing. \u201cWe typically replace these products for an upgraded model at least every couple of years,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cThe target is to keep electronic products for five to seven years \u2013 their full optimum lifetime.\u201d He says people should try repairing equipment, borrowing, renting or buying second hand, adding: \u201cIf you really need something then keep new items to a minimum.\u201d Get rid of private vehicles (unless absolutely necessary) Many people have become accustomed to owning a car and for some their vehicle is essential either for work or because they are disabled or live in a remote area. But car ownership is driving huge emissions, the research shows. Globally, transport is responsible for about a quarter of overall greenhouse gas emissions, and more than two-thirds of this comes from the engines of road vehicles. Campaigners are calling on those who can to stop using private vehicles \u2013 ideally getting rid of any they own \u2013 and to turn instead to public transport, walking, cycling or car clubs. \u201cIf you were planning on buying a car, see if you can hold off and find alternatives which can get you where you need to go,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cIf you are feeling brave, get rid of the car/s you have, or see if you can join a car-sharing scheme to share the benefit \u2013 and the emissions.\u201d The study says that although there is a lot of emphasis on the role of electric vehicles (EVs) in tackling climate change, a bigger effort needs to go towards reducing the number of cars on the road overall as a significant source of emissions is in the manufacture of vehicles \u2013 even EVs. Dress retro The clothing and textiles industry accounts for more greenhouse gas emissions than international aviation and shipping combined and the rise of fast, disposable fashion is accelerating that trend. Bailey says: \u201cLower prices often means poorer quality clothes that don\u2019t last as long; but these low prices have also resulted from unseen human and environmental costs such as pollution of rivers, poor working conditions, low wages and exploitation of workers in factories.\u201d Campaigners are therefore urging people to buy second hand, repair or adjust existing items and restrict purchases to three items a year \u2013 ideally ones that are durable and will last. Bailey said: \u201cThese clothes might be more expensive, but it is worth considering the cost per wear. If it will last three times as long but is only double the price, that\u2019s a financial saving over the lifetime of the item and better for the environment too.\u201d Eat green More than 25% of total global emissions come from the food system and today\u2019s research shows there are three changes to diet that would dramatically reduce the impact of the food we eat: Move to a mostly plant-based diet. Eat everything you buy. Eat healthy amounts. Bailey said: \u201cChanging our behaviours around food is the most impactful of all the shifts. And it\u2019s not just about climate change; if you look at biodiversity loss, land use change, fertilisers in the ocean creating dead zones and the massive extinction and loss of insects due to pesticides, these problems are all driven by food. Fly no more than once every three years Aviation contributes to about 2% of overall global emissions and this figure is increasing more than any other form of transport. Flying is also highly unequal: in the UK, 70% of all flights are taken by just 15% of the population. The research found the global average number of return flights per person in 2017 was one short-haul return every one to two years. Experts say halving this number \u2013 committing to one short-haul return flight every three years or one long-haul flight every eight years \u2013 would have a huge impact. Bailey said: \u201cWe can still see the world: flying abroad 15 to 20 times over a lifetime, or travelling more slowly overland to different places. But we need to get realistic about the impact of weekend city breaks abroad. Why not visit all the incredible places we have closer to home?\u201d The report suggests choosing holiday destinations closer to home that you can access by train, ferry or bus. It also advocates making use of technology such as video calls to keep in touch with family and friends. Change the system The actions outlined above can lead to huge reductions in global emissions \u2013 25% of that required to keep to 1.5C of warming \u2013 but the research is also clear that the bulk of reductions will come from systemic change made by governments and the private sector. To help transform the system campaigners are calling for people to make at least one change in their own lives. Ideas include: Changing to a green energy supplier. For those who can afford it, installing energy efficiency measures at home such as insulation and heat pumps. Switching your pension to a green investor. Using ethical and green banks. Using energy efficiently at home. Pushing for change through activism or peaceful protest or writing to your MP. Bailey says: \u201cThis shift is different to the others because the research doesn\u2019t imply that individuals are responsible for changing global systems. However, we know that personal shifts to our own lives can, collectively, have a massive impact.\u201d"

            "content": "Rewilding has the potential to supercharge climate mitigation, says the Global Rewilding Alliance, an umbrella group for organisations working to restore ecosystems. Sunday 20 March is World Rewilding Day, and the focus this year is on the critical importance of wild animals for the climate. Rewilding landscapes with wolves and wildebeest could be even more important than planting trees. Adding the right animals to the right landscape can help to rebalance the ecosystem and maximise the amount of carbon that can be stored. For example, introducing herbivores such as Highland cattle to upland areas can help to redistribute seeds and nutrients over wide areas and promote plant growth. But too many herbivores can result in overgrazing, so carnivores are vital too. Get the balance right and the carbon benefits are huge: an estimated 10% of US carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels could be mopped up by North American boreal forests, if they contained the correct balance of wolves, moose and trees. It\u2019s not just on land that animals can help. Ocean predators such as whales devour prey in deep water and excrete nutrients at the surface, promoting phytoplankton production that draws down carbon dioxide. The take-home message: we\u2019re going to need wolves as well as wind turbines to stand any chance of capping global heating at 1.5C."

            "date": "2022-03-07T07:00:37Z",
            "content": "People in well-off countries can help avert climate breakdown by making six relatively straightforward lifestyle changes, according to research from three leading institutions. The study found that sticking to six specific commitments \u2013 from flying no more than once every three years to only buying three new items of clothing a year \u2013 could rein in the runaway consumption that is partially driving the climate crisis. The research carried out by academics at Leeds University and analysed by experts at the global engineering firm Arup and the C40 group of world cities, found that making the six commitments could account for a quarter of the emissions reductions required to keep the global heating down to 1.5C. The study was published on Monday alongside the launch of a new climate movement to persuade and support relatively well off people to make \u201cThe Jump\u201d and sign up to the six pledges. Tom Bailey, co-founder of the campaign said: \u201cThis ends once and for all the debate about whether citizens can have a role in protecting our earth. We don\u2019t have time to wait for one group to act, we need \u2018all action from all actors now\u2019.\u201d Last week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its \u201cbleakest warning yet\u201d, saying the climate crisis was accelerating rapidly with only a narrow chance left of avoiding its worst ravages. Bailey said as the world reaches the edge of ecological collapse, it needed a workable alternative to this \u2018universal consumer society\u2019 in the next decade. \u201cThe research is clear that governments and the private sector have the largest role to play but it is also equally clear from our analysis that individuals and communities can make a huge difference.\u201d The Jump campaign asks people to sign up to take the following six \u201cshifts\u201d for one, three or six months: \u2022 Eat a largely plant-based diet, with healthy portions and no waste \u2022 Buy no more than three new items of clothing per year \u2022 Keep electrical products for at least seven years \u2022 Take no more than one short haul flight every three years and one long haul flight every eight years \u2022 Get rid of personal motor vehicles if you can \u2013 and if not keep hold of your existing vehicle for longer \u2022 Make at least one life shift to nudge the system, like moving to a green energy, insulating your home or changing pension supplier The campaign was officially kicked off on Saturday and Bailey said there was already a growing movement emerging in response to the evidence with Jump groups up and running around the country. \u201cThis is not just new information, or a normal behaviour change \u2018campaign\u2019, but a fun movement that is working to go way beyond the usual \u2018greenie\u2019 suspects,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cA movement that is able to engage all types of people \u2026 engaging and being led by communities of colour and the economically excluded.\u201d Bailey said there has been a widespread belief in climate circles in recent years that individual action was relatively ineffective and the only option was to get out on the streets and demand system change from governments and corporations. \u201cObviously this is still hugely important but what this research shows is that there is a role for a new joyful climate movement which can help lead the way to less stuff and more joy.\u201d Some of the shifts the campaign calls for are, at least partially, dependent on systemic change \u2013 the prohibitive cost of train fares might leave individuals with little choice but to use short haul flights for essential journeys; public transport maybe expensive or nonexistent in areas of the country, leaving people with no choice but to use their car. Bailey was the lead author of Labour\u2019s plan to decarbonise the UK\u2019s energy sector at the last election. He has worked in the green energy sector in the UK, US and China for the past 15 years, and said individual actions could have a cascade effect, leading to community level action and ultimately contributing to systemic change. Although not everyone would be able to commit to all the pledges, just \u201cmaking a start\u201d could have a big impact, he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going back to the stone age, it\u2019s just finding a balance. Less consuming in relatively rich western countries can mean more creativity, comedy, connection \u2026 Live for joy, not for stuff.\u201d The research is based on a study by academics at Leeds University, Arup and the C40 group of leading cities which assesses the impact of consumption by people in the world\u2019s leading cities. Analysis of that data has found that six steps set out above could cut global emissions by between 25% and 27%. Ben Smith, director of climate change at Arup, who led the analysis said that as scientific evidence mounts, it was clear that all sections of society had to act. \u201cOur research shows that all of us, from politicians, city and business leaders to individual citizens, have important roles to play. And it is clear there\u2019s lots that we can do as individuals, and that this is one of the easiest and quickest places to start\u201d."

            "title": "Is Australia really beating other countries at cutting emissions? | Graham Readfearn",
            "date": "2022-03-16T23:30:12Z",
            "content": "According to prime minister Scott Morrison, two years ago the message he was giving the public on climate change was that \u201cwe need to get emissions down\u201d. In a morning TV interview with Nine News political editor, Chris Uhlmann, Morrison accepted Australia was now a harder place to live because of the climate crisis, and tried to suggest his priority had always been getting emissions down. \u201cI said this a couple of years ago,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI said we need to get emissions down, and we\u2019ve got it down by more than 20 %. Canada can\u2019t say that. New Zealand can\u2019t say that. United States can\u2019t say that. Japan can\u2019t say that. But we can.\u201d But does Australia really look good against those other countries? Before we get into this, what those countries also can\u2019t say is that they\u2019re among the world\u2019s biggest exporters of both coal and gas; that their government has marketed a \u201cgas-fired recovery\u201d from a global pandemic; or that they have a leader who once held aloft a lump of coal in parliament and told everyone not to be scared of it. Before last year\u2019s UN climate talks in Glasgow, one thing all of those countries did do was improve their emissions targets. Australia refused, and is still stuck with the same Abbott-era target to cut emissions by 26% by 2030 based on 2005 levels (Canada\u2019s target is now 40% and the US\u2019s is 50%). But back to Morrison\u2019s list. When it comes to communicating its emissions, the government has to be very selective for it to make a favourable comparison with those countries. The United Nations official record of emissions from countries that have signed the climate change convention (that is, pretty much every country on the planet) has figures up to and including 2019. But the government has previously told the ABC\u2019s Fact Check unit that to make the 20% claim, it has been using more recent quarterly figures that cover a period when emissions slowed around the world from the coronavirus pandemic. That means we can\u2019t compare these more recent year-to-date Australian figures to those of other countries. But we can still do a useful comparison based on the latest submissions to the UN. First, the essential caveat because UN emissions data comes in two forms. One includes the impacts of changes to vegetation on emissions (such as forests being cleared or regrowing), and the other doesn\u2019t. Australia uses the data that includes forestry because, as historical land clearing since European invasion has slowed, this has seen emissions in this sector fall steeply. Using this data does put Australia out ahead of those other countries with a reduction of 15% compared with the next best country in Morrison\u2019s list, the United States, with 13%. But changes in land cover are influenced by state governments. Federal policy has practically no influence. And given that Morrison was speaking in the context of what federal government policy has done, we should be looking at emissions without the effect of land clearing included. If we do that, between 2005 and 2019 Canada\u2019s emissions have fallen 1.1%, Japan\u2019s 12% and the US\u2019s 11.65%. New Zealand\u2019s emissions are almost the same (82.4m tonnes of CO2e in 2005 compared with 82.3mt in 2019). Australia\u2019s went up by 4%. So in this context, Australia is the worst performing country on Morrison\u2019s list, not the best. Ahead or behind? Talking of targets, one columnist appeared confused about how they are set. In the Australian, that newspaper\u2019s former editor Chris Mitchell criticised one ABC presenter for failing to point out that \u201cAustralia is ahead of most of the world on its 2030 Paris emissions reduction targets \u2026\u201d Perhaps someone should point out to Mitchell that countries set their own targets under the UN\u2019s climate convention, and that Australia\u2019s progress to those targets is an artefact of a lack of ambition at the time they were set (seven years ago) rather than any sign of stellar performance. Despite signing a pledge at the Glasgow climate talks that all countries should \u201crevisit and strengthen\u201d targets before the next talks later this year in Egypt, the Morrison government had barely landed back in Australia before it said it would ignore that promise. Instead, Morrison government ministers have quoted projections which they say will see the country cut emissions by 35% by 2030. But one leading analyst has told this column even if Australia did achieve cuts at that level, it would still fall short of its commitment under the Paris agreement. Carbon copy Talking of comparing Australia with other countries, another columnist in the Australian, Chris Kenny, ridiculed any suggestions this country should be phasing out fossil fuels to lower the risk from extreme weather events. \u201cWe could lead the way, abandon fossil fuels, and then just hope we are followed by China, India, Indonesia, Russia, America, Canada, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria, Kuwait, Iraq, Papua New Guinea, Brunei, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. You never know.\u201d All those countries are signatories to the UN climate convention, which agreed in Glasgow last year to phase down coal power. Australia, Canada and the United States have already agreed not to finance unabated coal plants overseas through their membership of the OECD. China has also made the same pledge. Basic oversimplification Kenny also ridiculed the notion that climate change could have an impact on both floods and droughts. \u201cThe blaming of floods on global warming makes more sense than the finger pointing about droughts, given anyone with a basic understanding of climate science understands a warmer planet is a wetter one,\u201d he wrote. Prof Steve Sherwood, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, explained to Temperature Check this was an oversimplification, but at least there was an acknowledgement that global warming was real and having some effect. \u201cThis is all related to the greater water holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect heavier rains but also longer gaps between rains, rainier rainy years \u2013 like this one \u2013 and drier dry years.\u201d"

            "content": "The US\u2019s top financial watchdog proposed on Monday that publicly traded companies report information on their greenhouse-gas emissions and even those of their suppliers and consumers in one of the Biden administration\u2019s most sweeping environmental actions to date. The new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules faces staunch opposition from some politicians and members of the business community and will be open to public comment for at least two months before final rules are released. \u201cI am pleased to support today\u2019s proposal because, if adopted, it would provide investors with consistent, comparable and decision-useful information for making their investment decisions, and it would provide consistent and clear reporting obligations for issuers,\u201d said the SEC chair, Gary Gensler. The proposal, which has been in the works for over a year, would force companies to make public the extent of their carbon footprint. While some companies including Apple and Microsoft now publish detailed analyses of their emissions, others have been reluctant to improve disclosure. Under the proposal publicly traded companies would have to report greenhouse-gas emissions and obtain independent certification of their estimates. Some companies would also be required to report emissions from both their supply chains and consumers, known as Scope 3 emissions. Republicans and some industry groups have already begun lobbying against the new requirements, which they argue would increase costs and go beyond the SEC\u2019s mandate. In a speech last year Gensler said the rules would introduce consistency to company reporting at a time when investors were increasingly concerned about the impact of climate on businesses. \u201cToday, investors increasingly want to understand the climate risks of the companies whose stock they own or might buy. Large and small investors, representing literally tens of trillions of dollars, are looking for this information to determine whether to invest, sell, or make a voting decision one way or another. Investors are looking for consistent, comparable, and decision-useful disclosures so they can put their money in companies that fit their needs,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Australia\u2019s electronic spy agency will double in size and ramp up its ability to launch its own offensive cyber operations as part of a $10bn national security budget pledge curiously dubbed Redspice. But the funding is spread over 10 years and only $4.2bn will be spent in the first four-year budget cycle. Given the government is partly offsetting the package with savings from other parts of the defence portfolio, the cyber pledge is worth only $588.7m in new money in the first four years. The money would allow the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) to \u201ckeep pace with the rapid growth of cyber capabilities of potential adversaries\u201d, the government said. In a separate move, the government has budgeted an extra $1.2bn between now and the late 2030s towards a national space mission for Earth observation, \u201cwhich will see Australia design, build, and operate four new satellites\u201d. While the cyber package reflects advice from security agencies about the increasing threats of attacks on critical infrastructure, it also fits the Coalition\u2019s political desire to make national security a key issue in the looming election. In a move that will do nothing to diminish criticism of prime minister Scott Morrison as being unduly focused on marketing, the government has created a buzzword for the initiative, Redspice \u2013 \u201cResilience, Effects, Defence, Space, Intelligence, Cyber and Enablers\u201d. Under the package, the ASD is expected to add 1,900 jobs over the decade, including data analysts, computer programmers and software engineers. The government said it would bolster Australia\u2019s commitment to its Five-Eyes and Aukus partners \u201cwhile supporting a secure Indo-Pacific region\u201d. While ASD on the whole will double in size, it is expected to triple its offensive cyber capabilities. The agency will also bolster its efforts to fend off cyber-attacks on Australia\u2019s critical infrastructure, \u201cbeing able to counter attack and protect our most critical systems\u201d, according to Tuesday\u2019s budget papers. It will aim to \u201canticipate and deter a crisis and deliver asymmetric capabilities\u201d. Budget papers revealed the cost of Redspice would be partially offset by savings in the Defence Integrated Investment Program, but those specific cuts were not immediately clear. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told parliament it was \u201cthe biggest ever investment in Australia\u2019s cyber preparedness\u201d and the lesson of history was that \u201cweakness invites aggression\u201d. He said the world faced \u201cuncertain times\u201d \u2013 a message the government is increasingly amplifying as it warns voters against risking a change of government in May. \u201cTonight, as we gather, war rages in Europe,\u201d Frydenberg said. He used his budget speech to launch a political attack on Labor, saying \u201cthose opposite allowed defence spending to fall to its lowest level since 1938\u201d. The Gillard Labor government did outline defence cuts in the 2012 budget while under political pressure to deliver a promised surplus, but then used its 2013 defence white paper to reinstate a commitment to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence each year. In the lead-up to this year\u2019s election, Labor leader Anthony Albanese has offered bipartisan support to the 2% minimum and has said big national security, defence and strategic issues are above politics. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Coalition has previously faced accusations of talking tough on cybersecurity but failing to deliver. The Australian National Audit Office found last year that just a quarter of Australian government entities were compliant with the mandatory strategies to protect themselves against cyber threats. After the establishment last week of a space command within the Royal Australian Air Force, the government is also pledging more funding to develop Australia\u2019s space industry, to be led by the Australian Space Agency. The minister for science and technology, Melissa Price, said the government wanted \u201cmore expertise and more jobs right here in Australia in this critical industry\u201d. \u201cDeveloping and launching these first four Australian satellites will create the foundation of industry knowhow for more complex space missions next decade,\u201d Price said. The budget does not update the projected cost of Australia\u2019s planned new nuclear-propelled submarines, which are subject to a joint study with the US and the UK. Aukus is mentioned as a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d in the budget papers, because the costs of the acquisition are yet to be assessed. Nor does the budget outline the projected cost of cancelling the contract with French firm Naval Group. But the government wants to secure additional land in Adelaide to build a construction yard for nuclear-powered submarines adjacent to the existing Osborne North shipyard. It also reiterated that its plan to build a new submarine base on the east coast of Australia would be part of an estimated $10bn long-term investment in future submarine infrastructure. Earlier this month the government announced plans to recruit an extra 18,500 defence personnel by 2040 at a total cost of $38bn. The budget also confirms the $156.5m cost of Australia\u2019s support to Ukraine following its invasion by Russia in February, including $91m in \u201clethal and non-lethal military assistance\u201d. Against the backdrop of heightened concern in Canberra about a planned defence agreement between China and Solomon Islands, the government said it was delivering a record $1.85bn in Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the Pacific this year. Solomon Islands will gain $161.1m in ODA in 2022-23, up from $156.4m this year. The government also continues to pledge \u201ctemporary and targeted\u201d additional funding to help the Pacific respond to Covid. The government said it would spend $65m building and maintaining a new complex for the Australian high commission in Honiara in Solomon Islands. The government is ending the freeze on indexation of Australia\u2019s overall ODA levels, meaning it will increase from $4bn in 2021-22 to $4.089bn in 2022-23. In a sign of concerns about the personal safety of MPs and senators, the budget also includes $30m over four years to increase security at Parliament House in Canberra. That includes improving CCTV, upgrading screening equipment and expanding the security operations room."

            "content": "Employees should report any suspicious emails rather than delete them and firms must step up their vigilance against cyber-attacks in the face of a heightened threat from Russian hackers, the UK\u2019s data watchdog has said. John Edwards, the information commissioner, said a new era of security had begun where instead of blacking out windows, people needed to maintain vigilance over their inboxes. Experts including the UK\u2019s cybersecurity agency have said Russian hackers could target Britain, and the imposition of sanctions by London on Moscow has increased those fears. Asked about the potential for a Russia-Ukraine cyber conflict spreading to the UK, Edwards said: \u201cWe have picked up on that heightened threat environment and we think it\u2019s really important to take the opportunity to remind businesses of the importance of security over the data that they hold. This is a different era from blacking out the windows and keeping the lights off. The threats are going to come in through your inbox.\u201d Edwards said that outside the Ukraine conflict and the warnings it had brought of a heightened security threat, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office had seen a \u201csteady and significant\u201d increase in cyber-attacks against UK businesses over the past two years. Between July and December last year the ICO recorded 1,345 \u201ccybersecurity incidents\u201d, including ransomware attacks, where assailants demand payment in cryptocurrency to decrypt a target\u2019s computers, and phishing attacks, where the victim is tricked, often via email, into downloading malware or handing over their login details. This represented an increase of nearly 20% on the same period in 2019, according to the ICO data. \u201cThey may be from state actors as part of an offensive or they may be organised crime or they may be some nuisance vandal hackers. It doesn\u2019t matter. What we need to keep doing is with the NCSC [National Cyber Security Centre] and the National Crime Agency amplify the message that cybersecurity is not a question of do it once and forget it. It\u2019s about all-the-time vigilance.\u201d Edwards said the ICO had yet to see warnings of Russian cyber retaliation for UK support of Ukraine come to fruition, but companies should check their cybersecurity, including reminding employees to report suspicious emails rather than just deleting them. The NCSC said before the Russian invasion began that UK firms should \u201cbuild resilience and stay ahead of potential threats\u201d. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen those threats being realised,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cBut it is a time for vigilance, for checking security settings and making sure those servers are patched and up to date, reminding staff of basic email hygiene and of scepticism to phishing attacks. And of the need of not just to curl your lip and hit delete but to notify your IT department and get these things blocked so one of your colleagues doesn\u2019t inadvertently open the organisation to a vulnerability.\u201d Edwards, who was New Zealand\u2019s privacy commissioner before moving to the UK, said companies could be exposed to penalties, which can include multimillion-pound fines, if they did not take adequate measures against attacks. The ICO\u2019s remit is to help ensure organisations protect people\u2019s data while enforcing data protection regulation. \u201cIf it\u2019s the equivalent of leaving the front door open with a whole lot of other people\u2019s stuff inside, really for anyone to walk away with, then we\u2019ll maybe look at the regulatory options that we have and the penalties that are available,\u201d Edwards said."

            "content": "Small businesses that spend on new technologies and training courses to upskill staff will be able to claim 120% of the costs as deductions, as part of budget measures that will cost the government $1.6bn in tax revenue. For the estimated 3.6m businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50m, eligible costs incurred from Tuesday evening can be deducted from their taxable revenue at an amount greater than what was actually spent. The budget also includes several other initiatives for small businesses, including $4.6m over two years for free Beyond Blue mental health support for entrepreneurs. The Fair Work Commission will also be given $5.6m over four years to establish a dedicated unit for dealing with unfair dismissals and industrial protection disputes for small businesses. The Technology Investment Boost allows businesses to claim the bonus 20% deduction for the cost of expenses and depreciating assets, such as portable payment devices, cybersecurity systems and subscriptions to cloud-based services. An annual cap of $100,000 will apply to eligible technology expenditure, with the initiative set to last until 30 June 2023. In his budget speech, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said he hoped the technology scheme would encourage small businesses \u201cthat are embracing the digital revolution\u201d by rewarding those that invest in new technologies. \u201cFrom tonight, every hundred dollars these small businesses spend on digital technologies like cloud computing, e-invoicing, cybersecurity and web design will see them get a $120 tax deduction,\u201d Frydenberg said. The Skills and Training Boost will also cover spending incurred by eligible businesses from Tuesday, and will last until 30 June 2024. There is no limit on how much spending on training courses can be deducted by a small business at the bonus rate of 120%, but certain rules apply, such as that the course must be run by an external education provider, which needs to be registered in Australia. In-house and on-the-job training is not eligible, nor is money spent training people who are not employees of the business. The courses can be provided in person (only in Australia) or online. Frydenberg said the skills initiative was designed to help small businesses \u201cbecome more productive and competitive\u201d. \u201cNo one knows better than a small business owner what skills they need in their employees,\u201d he said. The Technology Investment Boost is budgeted to cost $1bn in forgone tax revenue over the life of the scheme, while the Skills and Training Boost will similarly reduce tax revenue by $550m. Frydenberg claimed his government had helped small businesses more than any other, with the lowest tax rates in 50 years. \u201cSmall and family businesses are at the heart of our economy and local communities,\u201d he said. \u201cLower taxes for small business is part of our plan for a stronger future.\u201d"

            "content": "As the conflict in Ukraine escalates, expert cyber-watchers have been speculating about the kind of cyber-attacks that Russia might conduct. Will the Kremlin turn off Ukraine\u2019s power grid, dismantle Ukraine\u2019s transport system, cut off the water supply or target the health system? Or would cybercriminals operating from Russia, who could act as proxies for the Russian regime, conduct these activities? Over the past decade, Ukraine has experienced many major cyber-attacks, most of which have been attributed to Russia. From election interference in 2014, which compromised the central electoral system and jeopardised the integrity of the democratic process; to a hack and blackout attack in a first-of-its-kind fully remote cyber-attack on a power grid in 2015, resulting in countrywide power outages; to one of the costliest malicious software attacks, NotPetya, in 2017, which significantly disrupted access to banking and government services in Ukraine and, subsequently, spilled over to France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the UK, the US and Australia. On the eve of 13 January, as troops were amassing along the Ukrainian border, about 70 Ukrainian government websites were taken down due to \u201cunauthorised interference\u201d, dubbed WhisperGate. The following day, these websites were defaced with a political threat that Ukrainian data had been leaked and with a warning to \u201cbe afraid and expect the worst\u201d. The attacks did not stop there. Almost a month later, further denial of service attacks took down government websites and state-owned banking services. The UK, US and Australia were quick to publicly attribute the attacks to Russia, and name and shame the military intelligence arm of the Russian armed forces (GRU) as responsible for the attacks. In response to the Russian threat, there have been unprecedented efforts by private and government entities \u2013 and even individuals \u2013 to support Ukraine\u2019s cyber resilience. Responding to cyber-attacks and building national cyber resilience has never been \u2013 and will never be \u2013 the sole responsibility of governments. It requires a whole-of-society approach grounded in international cooperation efforts. For the first time since its inception, the EU rapid cyber response team, with capabilities to detect and respond to a variety of threats, and headed by Lithuania, was deployed to help defend against cyber-attacks targeting Ukraine. The Romanian national cybersecurity agency and a cybersecurity company called Bitdefender launched a public-private partnership to provide pro bono technical support and threat intelligence to Ukraine\u2019s government, businesses and citizens for \u201cas long as it is necessary\u201d. Nato, which has been working for a number of years with Ukraine to increase its cyber defences, signed an agreement a few weeks before the invasion aimed at enhancing cyber cooperation with Ukraine. The tech community leveraged its resources and knowledge to expose cyber-attacks and threats, and limit their spread. Shortly after WhisperGate, Microsoft shared technical analysis on the tools and techniques used in the attack and recommendations for those affected, and it continues to do so. The Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET exposed the nefarious component of the HermeticWiper malware attacks in February, a malware designed with a component aimed at \u201cwiping\u201d the data out of systems. This timely technical analysis provided vital information to security experts and governments about the technical steps that should be put in place to mitigate and protect against hacks. At the same time, efforts within Ukraine started to materialise. In what has been referred to as an unprecedented effort in the midst of an armed conflict, a whole \u201cIT army\u201d of volunteers was assembled in response to a request by the minister of digital transformation to support the country\u2019s cyber-defence efforts, with reports of some even operating from within bomb shelters. The solidarity shown so far is unprecedented and a testament to the benefits and potential of collective action across sectors and communities. As the war continues, this solidarity will become even more important. Joyce Hakmeh is a senior research fellow for the International Security Programme at Chatham House.

            "date": "2022-03-09T16:17:12Z",
            "content": "As military conflict has mounted between Ukraine and Russia, so have fears of unprecedented cyberwar. Experts are monitoring both countries closely, fearing a volatile crisis involving one of the world\u2019s leading hacking super powers could lead to a huge conflict playing out online \u2013 one that could outlast the physical battles. Joe Biden pre-emptively warned Russia that the US is \u201cprepared to respond\u201d to any attacks on critical infrastructure, and others have warned for years of a \u201cCyber Pearl Harbor\u201d. But thus far, experts say, it has been relatively quiet on the cyber warfront. \u201cThough it would be foolhardy to rule it out in the future, we have not yet seen the completely destructive attacks on Ukraine infrastructure some anticipated,\u201d said Glenn S Gerstell, former general counsel of the National Security Agency and Central Security Service. Fears of cyber warfare are stoked by a long history of international attacks coordinated out of Russia. The country was behind a large-scale attack on Ukraine\u2019s power grid in 2015 in coordination with its annexation of Crimea. In 2017, Moscow unleashed on to Ukraine the data-wiping NotPetya virus, a destructive malware that ultimately spread globally. In addition, non-government Russian hackers have been linked to several brazen hacking schemes in past years, including the debilitating 2021 ransomware hack of the Colonial pipeline in the US. Coinciding with its invasion of Ukraine, Russia unleashed a number of smaller hacks \u2013 starting in January when more than 70 Ukrainian websites were defaced and separate cyber-attacks knocked out government websites including the ministry of foreign affairs and the education ministry. While these attacks have been \u201csignificant and unprecedented\u201d, according to Aaron Turner of California cybersecurity firm Vectra, they have \u201cnot yet been catastrophic\u201d. That is largely because no international power yet wants to be the one to cast the first stone in a cyber third world war, he said. \u201cWe have most likely reached a sort of detente, where both sides understand that catastrophic cyber-attacks will most likely result in mutually assured destruction of systems,\u201d he added. National powers are also now better prepared to stave off attacks than they were previously, so it is possible some larger hacks have been quietly thwarted, experts said. The US has invested billions in cyber defense resources \u2013 both from private and public sources. Ukraine spent the past seven years in the wake of its power grid attack in 2015 steeling its infrastructure. \u201cThere has been a lot of thought and hard work put into preparing for an all-out assault on the cyber domain,\u201d said Theresa Payton, cybersecurity expert and former White House chief information officer. \u201cIf we were to experience a hit to critical infrastructure, there are many playbooks in place to avoid sustained outages. Russia also seems to be investing more resources in coordinated disinformation campaigns than overt hacking operations, said Payton. Several US tech firms have been forced to take measures after Ukrainian officials pleaded with them to address the stream of Russian disinformation that has exploded on their platforms. Disinformation experts have reported Russia is leading a coordinated campaign to push false narratives around the invasion of Ukraine, including doctored videos and disinformation. Russian officials have blocked access to social media in the country to prevent the spread of information that does not fit its narrative. Gerstell, the former NSA general counsel, said it was not unexpected for Putin to preference a disinformation-heavy strategy over destructive hacks. An attack on infrastructure would be treated as \u201cequivalent to a physical attack by a bomb or missile\u201d, he said, while propaganda falls into a gray area. \u201cThese are all acts that fall below the threshold of an act of war, but are very malicious and damaging nonetheless,\u201d he said. Payton also noted that just because there have not yet been major attacks does not mean that there will not be in the future \u2013 or that there are not others in progress now. Many covert operations, especially those on a large scale, take time to unfurl, she said. In the case of the Solarwinds hack, for example, Russia\u2019s massive breach of US organizations started in March 2020 was not revealed until December 2020. \u201cThere could be incidents already under way that we are not yet aware of,\u201d she said. \u201cWith Russia, I always say that if you have not seen anything yet, just stay tuned.\u201d"

            "content": "Reuters reported earlier that the Kremlin has said customers won\u2019t have to switch to roubles for gas payments straight away, as \u201cpayments and delivery is a time-consuming process\u201d. The full story will be up shortly. Good-bye! Some breaking news before I go: Vladimir Putin has indicated that he could turn off gas supplies to Europe overnight unless \u201cunfriendly\u201d states drop their refusal to start paying for gas in roubles from Friday, reports Rob Davies. \u201cTo buy Russian gas, they need to open rouble accounts in Russian banks,\u201d Putin said in a televised appearance. \u201cIt is from those accounts that gas will be paid for, starting 1 April. If such payments aren\u2019t made, we will consider this a failure by the client to comply with its obligations.\u201d According to an order signed by Putin, gas buyers should open accounts with state-controlled Gazprombank to facilitate currency exchange on gas purchases. The G7 group of advance economies \u2013 the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada \u2013 has so far refused to countenance meeting Putin\u2019s demand for rouble payments. The impasse has already led to Germany and Austria making preparations for potential gas rationing, activating an emergency plan designed to help it cope with any disruption in supplies from Russia. There are fears that Putin could extend the rouble payment plan to include exports of oil, grain, fertilisers, coal, metals and other key commodities. Oil prices have sunk after White House officials said the US was considering a record-breaking release of crude oil reserves \u2013 of up to 180m barrels over several months \u2013 to allay fears of shortages after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude is trading about $5 lower at $108.52 a barrel, while US light crude is at $104 a barrel. Gas prices in Europe are continuing to rise, amid uncertainty over supply sparked by a stand-off between Russia and the wests over rouble payments for gas. Britain\u2019s economy grew faster than previously thought in the last three months of 2021, but the increase was largely due to Covid-related activity in the health sector \u2013 visits to doctors, more test and trace and vaccinations \u2013 which won\u2019t last, and masked the impact of the cost of living crisis. Consumer spending was revised sharply lower to 0.5% from 1.2%. European shares are trading lower, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 0.6% and Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC both losing 1%. The Dow Jones on Wall Street has fallen 0.6%. Our other top stories today: Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with the latest news. Take care \u2013 JK Britain has sanctioned 14 more Russian entities and individuals, including the state media organisations behind Rossiya Television and Sputnik and some of their senior figures, for pushing out \u201cPutin\u2019s fake news and narratives,\u201d Reuters reported. They are the latest sanctions against Moscow to punish it for its invasion of Ukraine. The UK government is sanctioning Kremlin-funded TV-Novosti, which owns RT, and Rossiya Segodnya, which controls news agency Sputnik. Among the individuals sanctioned are RT\u2019s managing director, Alexey Nikolov, Sputnik\u2019s editor-in-chief Anton Anisimov, and Sergey Brilev, a prominent news anchor at RT. Foreign secretary Liz Truss said: Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine is based on a torrent of lies. Britain has helped lead the world in exposing Kremlin disinformation, and this latest batch of sanctions hits the shameless propagandists who push out Putin\u2019s fake news and narratives. Gas prices in Europe are continuing to rise, amid uncertainty over supply sparked by a stand-off between Russia and the wests over rouble payments for gas. British gas for next-day delivery is up 8p at 286p per therm, a 2.9% rise, while the Dutch May contract rose \u20ac2, or 1.7%, to \u20ac121 per megawatt hour. Moscow is expected to set out publicly its plans for rouble payments today, although the Kremlin has said customers won\u2019t have to switch to roubles straight away, as \u201cpayments and delivery is a time-consuming process\u201d. The G-7 group of nations has resisted the demand, and Germany and Poland, which are highly reliant on Russian gas, have accused Moscow of breaching existing contracts. Vladimir Putin told the German chancellor Olaf Scholz during a phone call yesterday that nothing would really change for European customers: payments would still be made in euros and transferred to Gazprombank, which is not affected by sanctions, and then converted into roubles, Reuters reported, quoting a German spokesperson. The spokesperson said: Scholz did not agree to the procedure in the conversation, but asked for written information to better understand the procedure. Analysts at Fitch Solutions doubt that Russia will turn off the taps as this would hurt Russian gas producers. The EU is Russia\u2019s largest gas consumer and there are no other customers that could readily replace their demand. We do not expect Russia to shut off gas supplies, as it would be a major escalation from its previous position that this would be a response to an oil embargo. If Russia were to shut off gas supplies, it would mark a serious step-change from Russia\u2019s deference to long-term contracts as the model for gas supply agreements. Companies led by women disproportionately attract less investment than those led by men, according to a large-scale study of female entrepreneurship in the UK, reports Joanna Partridge. The Gender Index, which was launched on Thursday, is a research study of all 4.4m active UK companies and allows users to track the impact of female-led firms on the economy via an online, interactive tool. The data identified that just under 17% of all active companies are led by women, but they only managed to attract less than 12% of 1.3m investments made in UK firms. In comparison, 61% of active companies are led by men, and those firms attracted two-thirds (66%) of all investment. The remainder recorded 17% of investment obtained by firms led by a gender-balanced team, while 4.7% of investments were directed to companies where there was no information about gender of the leadership. More on our main story: oil prices have fallen sharply on expectations that the US will tap its strategic oil reserves for the third time since November, by a massive amount. The International Energy Agency\u2019s member countries are due to meet tomorrow at 1pm BST and will decide how much more oil to release from reserves to cool the market. The US is considering releasing up to 180m barrels of oil over several months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Reuters reported, citing four US sources. This would be the biggest in its 50-year history. The reserve holds 568.3m barrels, its lowest level since May 2002. The release would increase oil supplies by 1m barrels per day for six months. Oil prices hit 14-year highs this month after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine amid supply fears, but have since fallen back. Brent crude, which spiked to $139 a barrel immediately after the invasion, the highest since 2008, fell more than $6 to $107.39 a barrel today, down 5.3%, while US light crude is at $102.35 a barrel, a 5% drop. The Opec oil cartel and its allies including Russia will meet next Thursday, but have so far resisted demands to pump more oil, sticking to its plan to gradually boost production. The British wealth manager Brewin Dolphin has received a \u00a31.6bn takeover offer from Royal Bank of Canada, and its directors have unanimously backed the deal. The news sent its share price 61% higher to a record 511.26p. RBC has offered to pay 515p a share. It is the latest of a series of foreign takeovers of British companies, including some wealth management firms. David Thomas, chief executive of RBC Capital Markets Europe, said: The UK is a key growth market for RBC, and Brewin Dolphin provides us with an exceptional platform to significantly transform our wealth management business in the region. The deal will make RBC Wealth Management the third-biggest wealth manager in the UK and Ireland, as well as the market leader in Canada and give it a bigger presence in the United States. The 54% hike in energy prices tomorrow has led to chaos, it seems. The websites of several energy suppliers have crashed, as customers rushed to send in meter readings before prices rise by more than 50% at midnight, report Rob Davies and Rupert Jones. British Gas, EDF, E.ON, SSE and Scottish Power all appeared to be struggling with the volume of submissions from households looking to beat the deadline. With energy bills due to rise by an average of 54% from Friday, millions of households have been urged to take gas and electricity meter readings the day before, to ensure they get the current, cheaper rates for all the energy they use right up until close of play on Thursday. European stock markets have turned negative, giving up earlier gains. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.1% at 7,570 Germany\u2019s Dax unchanged at 14,606 France\u2019s CAC down 0.1% at 6,734 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.25 at 25,249 In Italy, inflation rose to an annual rate of 6.7% in March, according to a preliminary estimate from Istat, Italy\u2019s statistics office. Here\u2019s a ranking of European inflation rates, based on the EU\u2019s harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) measure: Charlotte de Montpellier, economist for France and Switzerland, has looked at the jump in French inflation to 4.5% in March. Inflation rose more than expected in France in March, reaching 4.5%. This is a figure that has not been seen since the 1980s, but it is still much lower than in neighbouring countries. Inflation will continue to rise in the coming months, before falling sharply. For the next few months, we expect inflation to continue to rise, driven by energy and food prices, but also by inflationary pressures that are increasingly spreading to all sectors of the economy. The 5% mark for the national inflation indicator could be exceeded in the second quarter, even without further increases in energy prices. Indeed, all business indicators suggest that companies expect to set higher prices in the coming months. That said, it is likely that the inflation peak is near and that inflation will start to fall again in a few months, probably as early as the summer. The eurozone unemployment rate fell to a record low of 6.8% in February, from 6.9% in January, according to Eurostat, the statistics office of the European Union. However, economists cautioned that the recovery in the jobs market will slow in coming months, and also noted that wage growth has not kept up with rising inflation. The youth unemployment rate remained high at 14% (down from 14.3% in January), as 2.1 million people under 25 were out of work. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING, said: Germany has hit very low levels of unemployment and has seen the pace of decline slow, while France, Italy and Spain are still seeing rapid improvements in people returning to work. This helps boost nominal income growth, somewhat dampening the negative effects of inflation on real household incomes. Still, we haven\u2019t seen much evidence so far of improving wage growth and the war is likely to dampen wage growth improvements further. The rapid recovery of the job market is set to slow from here on. The war adds uncertainty to the employment outlook and could result in delayed new hiring. This is especially the case in manufacturing, as the industrial sentiment survey already revealed declining hiring expectations in March. Still, the labour market remains very robust at current levels of unemployment. The Financial Times\u2019 Frankfurt bureau chief Martin Arnold tweeted: Let\u2019s have a look at this morning\u2019s economic data out of the eurozzone. In Germany, the number of unemployed people declined by 20,400 in February from January to 1.34 million, according to official figures. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.1%. Employment increased for the tenth month, by 668,000 people to 45 million. German retail sales recovered less than expected in February when some pandemic restrictions remained in place, separate figures showed. They rose just 0.3% from January, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations of a 0.5% gain. As it announced a tripling in 2021 profits, EN+, the mining company part-owned by the sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, has flagged equipment supply problems due to western sanctions. It also warned that the likely need to replace foreign currency credit facilities with debt denominated in roubles will negatively affect its financial position. At the start of the month, the company halted production at its refinery in Ukraine, which produced 1.8m tonnes of alumina (substances for the smelting of aluminium) last year. 2021 was a bumper year for En+. Revenues climbed 36% to $14bn last year on the back of a 41% increase in the average aluminium price per tonne. The firm\u2019s annual net profit more than tripled to $1.5bn from 2020. The En+ share price rose almost 15% in Moscow after the results were released. Referring to the impact of western sanctions against Moscow, En+ said: There has been a significant increase in volatility on the securities and currency markets, as well as a significant depreciation of the rouble against the US dollar and the euro. The quantitative effect of these events cannot be accurately estimated at the moment with any degree of confidence. Due to all these circumstances, the group may potentially face difficulties in supply of equipment, which may lead to the postponement of investment projects. The likely necessity of having to replace foreign currency credit facilities with debt nominated in roubles may negatively affect the financial position of the company due to high interest rates in the local rouble market caused by general instability and the key rate set by the Bank of Russia at 20%. The recently announced intention by the Russian Government to change regulation of domestic metals\u2019 sales prices may have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s profitability. The Conservative peer Greg Barker, an energy minister in David Cameron\u2019s government, resigned as chairman of the aluminium and hydropower group on 7 March. He was replaced last week by Christopher Bancroft Burnham, who has sat on the En+ board as a senior independent director, and is a former undersecretary-general of the United Nations. Another En+ board member, Joan MacNaughton, has also quit since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The war has prompted a number of resignations of UK directors from Russian company boards. Time for a quick round-up of today\u2019s main stories. The UK economy was only 0.1% below pre-pandemic levels after growing faster than previously thought at the end of 2021 because of an increase in visits to GPs and a rush of coronavirus test-and-trace activities, the latest official data has shown. UK house prices grew at the fastest annual pace since 2004 in March, continuing the ascent to new record levels \u2013 a fifth higher than at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Private jets linked to Russian oligarchs and officials appeared to continue flying into and out of EU and UK airports despite flight bans and sanctions imposed after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, a Guardian data investigation found. Vladimir Putin has demanded payment in roubles for Russian gas sold to \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries, setting a deadline of 31 March. Why is he demanding payment in roubles? The switch to rouble payments could extended to include exports of oil, grain, fertilisers, coal, metals and other key commodities. Eight Russian oligarchs on the UK sanctions list over their links to Vladimir Putin were granted \u201cgolden visas\u201d to live in Britain. The eight individuals, who Boris Johnson described as having \u201cthe blood of the Ukrainian people on their hands\u201d, were granted the right to live in the UK after promising to invest at least \u00a32m under the controversial tier 1 investor visa scheme. The UK video games market hit a new record of \u00a37.16bn last year as the pandemic continued to fuel an unprecedented boom in home entertainment, with gamers rushing to stock up on new consoles and virtual reality kit even as overall sales of games fell. Lockdown conditions have made gaming one of the biggest pandemic winners with the value of the UK market now a third higher than in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis hit and worth more than the music and video streaming markets combined. Almost 500 \u201cghost flights\u201d a month departed from the UK between October and December 2021, data has revealed. The information, obtained through a freedom of information request by the Guardian, shows Heathrow, Aberdeen, Manchester, Stansted and Norwich were the top five airports for such flights during the period. More than a third of all compost sold in the UK in 2021 was peat dug from carbon-rich habitats, new data has revealed. Today is the day to read your gas and electricity meters in the UK. With energy bills due to rise by an average of 54% on Friday 1 April, millions of households are being urged to take gas and electricity meter readings today, writes my colleague Rupert Jones. The aim is to ensure you get the current, cheaper rates for all the energy you use right up until close of play on Thursday. Otherwise your supplier might charge some of it at the new higher unit prices. Gareth Kloet, the energy spokesperson at the comparison site GoCompare, says: \u201cWe would urge all bill payers to take both gas and electricity meter readings on 31 March and make sure you submit these to your supplier.\u201d Money-saving guru Martin Lewis is encouraging people to do the same, to \u201cdraw a line\u201d in terms of their usage. Shares in Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s advertising business S4 Capital plummeted yesterday, after it said its auditor had not been able to sign off on its results, a day before they were due to be published. The S4 share price fell by 36% on Wednesday afternoon, wiping \u00a31bn off the company\u2019s market value. This morning, the shares bounced 6.6% but the gains were short-lived. The shares are now up just 0.9% at 312.9p. The company said in a statement yesterday: PwC informed us that they were unable to complete the work necessary for S4 Capital to release the preliminary statement tomorrow morning. As a result, the company will release its preliminary results for 2021 as soon as PwC have completed their work. The company believes that the results for 2021 remain within the range of market expectations and continued to trade strongly in the first two months of 2022. It is the second time this month that S4 has postponed its results. On 1 March, S4 said PwC had asked for more time to complete its audit \u201cbecause of the impact of Covid and Omicron on travel and resource allocation, particularly in the Netherlands\u201d. Sorrell set up S4 in 2018 after he left the advertising giant WPP, the company he founded, after staff made allegations of personal misconduct. Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing. UK house prices grew at the fastest annual pace since 2004 in March, continuing the ascent to new record levels \u2013 a fifth higher than at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, reports my colleague Jasper Jolly. Prices rose by 14.3% in the year to March, the strongest pace of increase since November 2004 when the UK experienced a housing boom that preceded the financial crisis, according to Nationwide, the UK\u2019s largest building society. The price of an average UK home hit \u00a3265,312, more than \u00a333,000 higher than March 2021. Price rises were evident across the country, with prices in Wales soaring by 15% over the year. House price growth accelerated in every region of England and Scotland. Detached homes have gone up nearly \u00a368,000 in price since the start of pandemic, a 22% rise, as people working from home sought out bigger properties, while average flat prices have increased by \u00a324,000, or 14%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s economy grew at a faster clip than previously thought in the last three months of 2021 when the country was hit by the Omicron wave. GDP in the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy rose by 1.3% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the Office for National Statistics said, stronger than a preliminary estimate of growth of 1.0%. The ONS said the biggest contributors to the increase were from human health and social work activities, driven by increased GP visits at the start of the quarter, and a large increase in coronavirus testing and tracing activities, and the extension of the vaccination programme. However, consumer spending growth was revised lower from 1.2% to 0.5%. Some economists said it looks as though the upward revision was driven by higher inventories, which is not a sustainable source of growth. Paul Dales, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: The upward revision to GDP growth in Q4 of last year may not be as encouraging as it looks as a lot of it appears to be due to inventories while consumer spending was revised down. The latter suggests the squeeze on real incomes is starting to bite, although the fall in the saving rate is providing a cushion. Overall, the data leave the economy just 0.1% smaller than the Q4 2019 pre-pandemic level. The 9.4% drop in GDP in 2020 was revised to a smaller 9.3% fall, while the 7.5% rise in GDP in 2021 was revised down to a 7.4% increase. GDP growth will probably be around 4.0% this year, if not a bit weaker, said Dales. Oil prices have fallen as much as $5 a barrel this morning on news that the United States is considering the release of up to 180 million barrels from its strategic petroleum reserve over several months, which would be the biggest ever, Reuters reported. Brent crude is now trading $4 lower at $109.44 a barrel, while US light crude is at $103.28 a barrel. Activity in Chinese manufacturing and services simultaneously contracted in March for the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, adding to the urgency for more policy intervention to stabilise the economy. Chinese authorities have already indicated they will step in with more support measures. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index fell to 49.5 from 50.2 in February, China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said, while the non-manufacturing PMI eased to 48.4 from 51.6 in February. Asian stocks fell after the data. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed down 0.7% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 1% and the Shanghai composite index lost 0.45%. European shares have opened higher after yesterday\u2019s declines. The FTSE 100 index is 0.2% higher at 7,594 while Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.6% and France\u2019s CAC advanced 0.3%. Inflation in France has climbed to 4.5% in March, from 3.6% in February, because of higher energy, food and services prices, the French statistics office said.

            "date": "2022-03-17T15:30:31Z",
            "content": "As of Wednesday Russia has been scheduled to pay investors holding two dollar-denominated government bonds $117m in interest payments. It will likely make the payments, but probably in roubles rather than dollars. Some of Russia\u2019s debt contracts permit such an arrangement; the two bonds in question do not. Russia has a grace period of 30 days within which to make payments in the normal fashion. If it fails to do so, it is likely to be declared in default by its creditor. Sovereign defaults send shockwaves through the global financial system. They signal that a debtor at the very apex of the monetary system \u2013 a government \u2013 is either unwilling or unable to meet its obligations. Since, in a modern monetary system, government debt is generally treated as the ultimate safe asset, this is a shock that goes beyond the arena of high finance. Russian defaults have rocked the global financial system twice in modern history. In 1917, the Bolsheviks repudiated the debts of the Tsarist empire, souring relations with Russia\u2019s former allies, most notably France, for decades to come. In 1998, in the financial crisis that defined Vladimir Putin\u2019s rise to power, Russia defaulted on its domestic debt and some Soviet-era foreign debt. The repercussions were significant enough to bring about the meltdown of the LTCM hedge fund, the world\u2019s biggest, in New York. The current impending default is nothing like either of those occasions. Only a few short months ago Russia was a top-rated sovereign debtor. It had only $38bn in foreign currency debt outstanding, of which only $20bn was owned by foreign investors \u2013 a tiny amount for a trillion-dollar economy. The payment that is due now, $117m, is a small fraction of what Russia continues to earn every day for its oil and gas exports. For gas alone, Russia was a fortnight ago earning more than $700m a day. Russia will pay in its local currency not because it is unable to find $117m, or because it has unilaterally decided that these debts are odious and should not be serviced. It is not paying its foreign creditors because it is locked in an asymmetrical proxy war with the west, a struggle in which the latter has chosen to weaponise the financial system. The defining moment came on Saturday 26 February, with the announcement of central bank sanctions. This sent the rouble plunging, and forced the closure of Russia\u2019s financial markets. In the coming months, inflation in Russia will surge. To contain the price increases, interest rates have been savagely hiked. Russia will have a hard time getting hold of vital imports. Economists estimate that Russia\u2019s economy could contract by 15% or more. All of this is terrible news for Russian households and businesses. But if Iran is anything to go by, it will not lead to a total collapse of the Russian economy. Since only the US, which consumes hardly any Russian oil, has so far imposed an embargo on Russian energy exports, Russia continues to earn hard currency. Having piled up its foreign exchange earnings, it has enough foreign exchange reserves to settle its entire foreign currency debt outright more than 12 times over. Russia\u2019s problem is not financial but political. It cannot access its hundreds of billions in foreign exchange reserves because of European and American sanctions. For its part, it has barred foreign investors from selling their Russian investments. And when it makes the $117m payment in roubles, it is not obvious that its foreign creditors will be able to set up bank accounts in Russia into which to receive them. To treat this as a regular default is to engage in a charade: it is a tit-for-tat measure in a financial war. Given the sanctions we have imposed, it is frankly silly to expect anything less. The losers will be the west\u2019s private investors in Russian bonds. Their interests \u2013 not just the oligarchs\u2019 \u2013 were sacrificed the moment sanctions were announced. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, has almost entirely written off the $18.2bn in Russian assets it had at the beginning of the year. Practically every major western brand name is pulling out of Russia. Some will incur heavy losses in the process, inflicting pain both on their investors and on the hundreds of thousands of Russians who work with them. Ethics aside, it makes perfect sense from a business point of view. No one wants the reputational damage. Foreign creditors of the Russian government are in a different position. Their interest was not in selling hamburgers or self-assembly furniture to ordinary Russians. They put their money directly towards funding the Russian state, warts and all. The prospectuses of Russia\u2019s bonds issued since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 specifically refer to geopolitical tensions with the west and the risk of sanctions. Knowing full well what they were funding, western investors snapped them up. That bet has now gone bad. The legal claims by Russia\u2019s creditors may be odious but they are also powerful. If they are shameless enough to pursue their defaulted loans through the courts in London or New York, they may well be granted liens on Russian government property while the true victims of Putin\u2019s aggression, first and foremost the Ukrainians, have no such recourse. Debt activists around the world have pushed for legislation in major creditor countries to ban vulture funds from taking advantage of distressed sovereigns. It is time for legislation in the UK and US to ensure that if anyone is able to make financial claims against Putin\u2019s regime, it is not those who sought to profit by investing in it.

            "date": "2022-03-02T01:40:55Z",
            "content": "Pent-up demand by households freed from Covid lockdowns helped drive Australia\u2019s economy back to growth in the December quarter, although the pace of the rebound fell short of some expectations. Australia\u2019s gross domestic product expanded at a seasonally adjusted 3.4% clip in the December quarter, recovering from a 1.9% contraction in the previous three months when Melbourne and Sydney was under tight Covid restrictions, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. GDP expanded 4.2% compared with the December quarter in 2021, quickening from the 3.4% annual rate in the September quarter. Economists are likely to focus on the relatively weak quarterly pace compared with expectations, and may pare back their forecasts of when the Reserve Bank may move to lift the official cash rate. As of yesterday, investors were betting that first move would come in July after the RBA board held its March meeting and warned of fresh uncertainties because of Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine. The household saving ratio, which measures how much they set aside from income, fell by about one-third during the December quarter to 13.6% from 19.8%, helping to stoke growth. \u201cDomestic demand drove the growth this quarter with high levels of household spending, particularly in the states that emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns,\u201d said Sean Crick, acting head of National Accounts at the ABS. \u201cHousehold spending in [the locked down jurisdictions of] NSW, Victoria and the ACT rose 9.6% compared to the rest of Australia which rose 1.6.\u201d Household spending recovered from the 4.8% dive in the September and exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, the ABS said. Hotels, cafes and restaurants were prime targets for shoppers, rising almost a quarter during the final three months 0f 2021, while outlays for recreation and culture grew 17.1% and health 7.9%. Even so, limited travel meant overall spending on services remained 3.9% below pre-pandemic levels. Spending on goods, which had held up better amid the Covid restrictions, advanced 6.3% during the quarter and was almost 9% above pre-pandemic outlays. Offsetting households\u2019 splurge was a 1.4% drop in private investment, reflecting ongoing shortages of labour and construction materials, the ABS said. Dwelling investment fell 2.2% in the quarter despite high levels of approvals lately. Government consumption, which had been a ballast for economic activity, made no net contribution to the latest quarter\u2019s growth. Among the banks, Westpac had forecast 3.3% quarterly growth, ANZ 3.6% and the CBA 3.7%. The median forecast was 3.5%, which was also NAB\u2019s tip. NAB said there were clear signs that economic activity had already recovered from Omicron, although March quarter growth would be affected. \u201cWe continue to see growth of around 3.5% over 2022, and closer to trend growth of around 2.1% in 2023,\u201d NAB said. \u201cWe expect the unemployment to fall to around 3.5% by mid-2022 and wage growth to pick up, with the RBA having enough evidence that inflation is sustainably within the target band to begin normalising [that is, raising] rates in the second half of 2022.\u201d The CBA has been the most bullish of the big four banks, bringing forward to June the timing of when it predicts the RBA would lift its cash rate to 0.25%. The bank\u2019s chief economist Gareth Aird said the December quarter was equal to the strongest quarterly GDP increase since the March quarter 1976. It matched the pace set in the September quarter in 2020 when the economy bounced back after the first Covid wave. Domestic final demand soared 6.7% in NSW and 3.7% in Victoria in the December quarter, as those two states opened up after Delta lockdowns. CBA said the public sector cut investment in the quarter, the first such drop since the September quarter in 2017. A drop in defence spending was the main prompt. The farm sector was particularly buoyant, aided by good rains and soaring commodity prices, especially for beef. Farm GDP rose by 11.1% for the quarter and annual growth was 20.9%, CBA said. Staff shortages, though, have been a significant constraint on the industry due to the closure of the international border, the bank said, adding \u201cthe reopening of the border and changes to visas allowing those on an agriculture visa a pathway to permanent residency may alleviate shortages over the medium term\u201d."

            "date": "2022-03-05T16:00:28Z",
            "content": "Elvira Nabiullina could barely hide her unease. The governor of the central bank of Russia \u2013 famed for sending coded messages with her attire \u2013 had chosen to dress in funereal black as she warned about the devastating hit to the Russian economy from sweeping sanctions imposed by western governments in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine. With the rouble plunging by more than a quarter and queues forming for foreign currency, Nabiullina announced last Monday that the central bank\u2019s key interest rate would more than double to a record 20%, to curb soaring inflation. In steps to cushion the blow for ordinary Russians, capital controls would be put in place, while the stock market would temporarily close. Her choice of clothing, as well as an awkward appearance on TV with Vladimir Putin at an emergency meeting on Monday, have raised questions over what she really thinks about his decision to wage war. Ashen-faced and remote, did she really support the war? \u201cWe know she hates the war as she was wearing black on Monday. She always wears something to give her views away,\u201d said Charlie Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital. \u201cShe\u2019s in mourning for the Russia she helped to build. I don\u2019t think her feelings will be hidden, and Putin will be aware of it. But he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d Highly respected in the international community, including among some of Putin\u2019s harshest critics, Nabiullina is viewed as a moderniser who reformed the central bank and kept Russia\u2019s economy out of worse trouble despite challenging conditions since taking her post in 2013. As a former trusted adviser to the president, she is credited with helping to build up a \u201cfortress Russia\u201d economy, one with less dependency on the US dollar and better equipped to cope with western sanctions than during Putin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Softly spoken, she communicates not just through words but through her apparel \u2013 especially brooches \u2013 to drop hints about her policy thinking. In May 2020, as the government urged people to stay at home, she wore a house-shaped brooch. A month later, after cutting rates, she choose a pigeon \u2013 in Russian, the word also means \u201cdove\u201d. \u201cI put something into each symbol but I\u2019m not going to explain,\u201d she told Russian TV two years ago. For Sergei Guriev, a professor of economics at Sciences Po in Paris and leading authority on Russia, this week\u2019s coded message was to demonstrate the severity of the blow being dealt by western sanctions. \u201cThis time she was in black and had no brooch. It should not be read as she disagreed with Putin\u2019s policy, but as a sign that it is time to bury normal monetary policy,\u201d he said. Guriev, a liberal-minded former Kremlin adviser who left Russia abruptly in 2013 amid a political crackdown by Putin, has known Nabiullina for 15 years. \u201c[She is] very highly regarded and respected. Viewed as competent, modest, and honest. \u201cShe is trusted by Putin. She has built a lot of elements of fortress Russia \u2013 not just foreign exchange reserves but also a domestic payment system and the payment card \u2018Mir\u2019 \u2013 but I am sure she was not part of the narrow circle making the decision on going to war.\u201d Analysts expect Russia\u2019s economy could be set for a deeper recession this year than the one caused by Covid-19. Sanctions freezing the central bank\u2019s assets have severely limited Nabiullina\u2019s room for manoeuvre. Out of $630bn (\u00a3475bn) in foreign currency reserves built up by the central bank \u2013 which could have been used to protect the rouble \u2013 experts say much of the sum has been rendered useless. Analysts estimate $300bn worth of assets could be tied up at foreign banks, while much of the remaining sum is thought to be in Chinese yuan and gold bullion stored in Moscow, which cannot be sold quickly or easily. With the central bank sanctioned, any possible Middle East or Chinese buyers could also face reprisals from the US. For Nabiullina, the developments unpick almost a decade of work going against the grain of Putin\u2019s increasing global isolation by opening up the economy. When western sanctions came in 2014 following his invasion of Crimea, she opposed capital controls and pressed ahead with floating the rouble on the currency markets, while adopting inflation targeting, in line with the world\u2019s leading central banks. In recent years she has taken public positions to urge the government to accelerate reforms to encourage private investment. \u201cShe is a brilliant governor. The war is not her fault,\u201d said one Russian economist based in London. \u201cPutin makes geostrategical decisions with huge economic consequences and leaves it to his team of experienced technocrats to pick up the pieces and sort out the mess.\u201d An ethnic Tatar \u2013 the largest minority group in Russia \u2013 she was born in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan, between the Volga river and Ural mountains, a year after the Cuban missile crisis. Her mother was a manager at a factory, while her father was a chauffeur. A fan of opera who recites French poetry from memory, she was the first woman to lead the central bank of a G8 country, before Russia\u2019s suspension from the group of rich nations in 2014. Last week, in an internal video, Nabiullina told staff the economy was facing an extreme situation they had all hoped would not happen. \u201cYou can just sense that something really serious has just happened. She pleads with her staff not to start arguing about politics. That\u2019s pretty unusual,\u201d said John Lough, an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, who was sent a copy of the video. \u201cThere are signs of panic. It\u2019s extraordinarily serious and it\u2019s going to bring the Russian economy to its knees.\u201d Now Russian economists question whether she will stay when her five-year term expires in June, although they say her priority could be to help protect ordinary Russians from the consequence of Putin\u2019s actions by staying in post."

            "date": "2022-03-18T19:00:10Z",
            "content": "When Tara Toomey gave up city life to return to the small town of Uralla in northern New South Wales, she came across many creatives who handcrafted their products yet were sharing market space with those selling mass-produced, imported items for a lower price. Her solution was to create a movement that platforms truly local artisans, and since 2014 the Seasons of New England expo has taken place at Uralla in autumn. Rural-based artisanal businesses benefit from Buy From the Bush and \u201cbuy local\u201d campaigns, but initiatives such as Toomey\u2019s are driving a renewed handmade economy that draws a clear line around local manufacturing. \u201cConsumers, particularly in the past two years, have levelled up in terms of quality,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cThey are tired of buying imported things and they are tired of buying things that are second-rate. There\u2019s a much stronger groundswell towards valuing the handmade.\u201d Toomey believes the economic impact of Seasons of New England was up to $1.4m for each event, pre-Covid. According to its recent impact report, Buy From The Bush (handmade-heavy but not exclusively artisanal) has sent about $9m worth of sales to country businesses. After launching an online store in 2019, the demand for New England-made products was so great that in late 2021 Toomey opened a bricks-and-mortar Seasons of New England store in Uralla\u2019s main street. Support for manufacturing Jo Sweeney from Glen Gowrie Distillery says the past two years have been the business\u2019s best to date. After using pandemic downtime to rebrand and rebuild their website, Jo believes Covid has helped change the way people buy. \u201cThey\u2019re more focused on where their produce comes from, and more keen on the money going straight back to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people are seeking out authenticity and want to buy regional produce made by regional people.\u201d The Glen Innes boutique distillery is a Seasons expo regular, known for Australia\u2019s first beer liqueurs made in collaboration with Uralla\u2019s New England Brewing Co. Uralla shoemaker Kath Caddy started the sustainable, eco-friendly shoe brand Sole Purpose with her friend Em O\u2019Connell after learning how to make her own wedding shoes. At the 2022 Seasons expo, Caddy is prepped for customers to watch their new bespoke shoes being created. She once saw a lot of hesitancy around paying more for handmade. \u201cThe first question we used to get was \u2018what\u2019s the price?\u2019 and that would be the end of the discussion,\u201d Caddy said. \u201cThese days, people are more curious about how things are made, then the pricing comes later and it\u2019s not necessarily a conversation killer. \u201cI think the pandemic has been an eye-opener to the fact that we don\u2019t have much of any scale of manufacturing in Australia, and people are starting to recognise that could be a problem; that maybe we should start supporting our local artisans and manufacturers.\u201d Taking charge Along with increased interest in handmade products, Toomey believes consumers have gained a better understanding of the time and skill that goes into them, which in turn helps makers. \u201cI think they\u2019ve learned slowly \u2013 and it\u2019s a hard lesson to learn \u2013 to value their time and price accordingly,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re still very price-conscious, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re still offering extremely good value, but there\u2019s been a terrible problem with undervaluing their work.\u201d Despite around 10% of Australians engaging in crafting activities at the time, in 2011 the Australian government\u2019s principal arts investment and advisory body the Australia Council decided to defund the country\u2019s national craft body, Craft Australia. No government has provided a craft policy since. Instead, country towns are relying on people like Toomey to take charge. \u201cUralla has the most amazing community at the moment and Tara is really instrumental in bringing that together and really pushing our council and everyone to get involved,\u201d Caddy said. \u201cIf every community had a Tara we\u2019d be worlds ahead of where we are now.\u201d Big impact on towns In 2023, Toomey is hoping to take the Seasons expo on the road. \u201cI think that might be the beginning of running it in other locations,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would help us connect better with other parts of the New England, and that\u2019s very important to us. I know we bring a lot of value to the region and it has a big impact in the town where we hold the expo, so we\u2019d like to share that around.\u201d Whether at an expo or through the physical or online store, Toomey hopes to continue to connect people who make quality, handmade products in the bush with the people who will appreciate them. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for them to get to the customer, but once the customer finds them they can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t find them before,\u201d she said.

            "date": "2022-03-25T21:18:25Z",
            "content": "Good evening. We\u2019re closing the US liveblog for the weekend. Here\u2019s where things stand at the close of business on Friday. Joe Biden visited Rzeszow, Poland, a city about an hours-drive from the border with Ukraine, where he met with US troops, listened to an update on the growing humanitarian crisis and praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Biden will deliver a \u201cmajor\u201d address on the war in Ukraine tomorrow, speaking from Warsaw after a trio of international summits in Brussels before he returns to the US. Supreme court justice Clarence Thomas was discharged from the hospital on Friday, a week after he was admitted for what the court said was an infection. It comes as the congressional panel investigating the January 6 assault on the US capitol weights whether to seek testimony from his wife, Ginni Thomas, after it was revealed that she exchanged text messages with Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, urging him to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Joe Manchin, a Democrat of West Virginia, will vote to confirm Biden\u2019s nominee for the supreme court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, all but ensuring she will be the first Black woman to sit on the bench. He also signalled a willingness to restart a conversation about the centerpiece of Biden\u2019s domestic agenda, which he stalled. In some late-breaking news (at least for us on the politics blog), the Supreme Court blocked a lower court order that prevented the Biden administration to from restricting the deployment of Navy SEALs who refused to be vaccinated against covid-19. For those interested in reading more about the war in Ukraine, please follow our global liveblog with updates, analysis and insights from our reporters around the world. Speaking in Poland earlier today, Biden compared the Ukrainian resistance to Russia\u2019s brutal invasion to the the student-led protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 while reaffirming his belief that Russian president Vladimir Putin was a \u201cwar criminal.\u201d \u201cI mean, talk about what happened to Tiananmen Square,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is Tiananmen Square squared.\u201d He said that Putin was \u201ca man who, quite frankly, I think is a war criminal\u201d and added that he thinks the Russian leader\u2019s actions will \u201cmeet the legal definition\u201d of a war criminal under international law. This week the US determined that the Russian military had committed war crimes in Ukraine, citing examples of the indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas, including a maternity hospital and a theater where Ukrainians had taken refuge. Speaking to US troops stationed in Poland, Biden said: \u201cYou\u2019re in the midst of a fight between democracies and autocrats. What you\u2019re doing is consequential, really consequential.\u201d Biden will deliver a \u201cmajor\u201d speech laying out the stakes of the war in Europe from Warsaw, before returning to the US on Saturday. The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell confirms reports that members of the congressional panel investigating the January 6 assault on the US capitol will meet Monday to discuss whether to seek testimony from Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. Lowell reports that they will consider whether to issue a subpoena if she declines to cooperate with the committee, should they choose to seek her testimony. The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa reported earlier that \u201cat least two members\u201d of the committee believed Ginni Thomas should speak to the panel, even if that meant issuing a subpoena. In a background briefing with reporters, a senior US defense official said the Pentagon had assessed for the first time that Kherson, a port city in southern Ukraine, is no longer under full Russian control. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city that Russian forces captured as part of Moscow\u2019s invasion of its democratic neighbor. Any progress by Ukrainian forces in reclaiming the region would be a major development in the war and a significant setback for Russian troops. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before. Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson back and we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again,\u201d the senior defense official said, according to the Washington Post. The situation remains unclear, as a top Russian military official said the Kherson region remained under their \u201cfull control\u201d. A Maryland judge on Friday struck down the state\u2019s new congressional map that would have given Democrats seven safe seats and endangered the state\u2019s lone Republican. The decision is a set back for Democrats, already facing strong headwinds in the November election as they attempt to defend a paper-thin majority in the House. According to Reuter\u2019s, Anne Arundel county senior judge Lynne Battaglia \u201cagreed with Republican arguments that the map violated the state constitution\u2019s equal protection guarantee, among other provisions, by diluting Republican voters\u2019 electoral power.\u201d \u201cThe 2021 plan is an outlier and a product of extreme partisan gerrymandering,\u201d Battaglia wrote in a 94-page opinion. The Democratic-controlled legislature has until Wednesday to draw a new map. Democrats have fared better than expected in the decennial congressional redistricting, given that Republicans control a majority of the state legislatures in the country and therefore in many cases control the process by which lawmakers can draw congressional maps that give their party the partisan advantage. This cycle, Democrats have had a string of legal successes challenging Republican maps in several swing states, including Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Maryland stands out as a rare example of a judge throwing out a map heavily gerrymandered by Democrats. In a new essay for the New York Times, Hillary Clinton reflects on the legacy and wisdom of her friend and mentor Madeleine Albright, who died this week at 84. \u201cMadeleine\u2019s death is also a great loss for our country and for the cause of democracy at a time when it is under serious and sustained threat around the world and here at home,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow more than ever we could use Madeleine\u2019s vital voice, her clear-eyed view of a dangerous world and her unstinting faith in both the unique power of the American idea and the universal appeal of freedom and democracy.\u201d Clinton outlined three lessons she believed the US could learn from Albright on preserving democracy around the world. Stand up to bullies Protect and defend Nato Attacks on democracy at home fuel authoritarianism abroad Even at the end of her life, she treasured her first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty, sailing into New York Harbor in 1948 as an 11-year-old refugee on a ship called the S.S. America,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cShe would have been thrilled by President Biden\u2019s announcement on Thursday that the United States will welcome up to 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine, and she would encourage us to do more to respond to this unfolding humanitarian nightmare. She would warn, as she did in her book, about the \u201cself-centered moral numbness that allows Fascism to thrive,\u201d and urge us to keep pushing the envelope for freedom, human rights and democracy. We should listen. There may be more text messages exchanged between Ginni Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to the Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, who broke the story. There might very well be texts we have not seen. Twenty-nine were provided to the committee,\u201d said Costa, referring to the congressional committee investigating the January 6 assualt on the US capitol, in an interview on CBS Morning. \u201cTwenty-one from Ginni Thomas to Meadows. Eight from Meadows to Ginni Thomas. These were part of a collection of over 2,300 text messages Meadows provided to the committee. But there are gaps. The last text in what we\u2019ve reported comes in late November 2020. Then there is a stray one about Vice President Pence and the end of America in January of 2021, days after the insurrection. So, this is a story that is beginning, not ending.\u201d Ginni Thomas has publicly denied any conflict of interest between her work as a political activist and her marriage to supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. Watch the full interview here. The Washington Post has spoken with Wesley Hawkins, a defendant who judge Jackson sentenced for possession of child pornography when he was a teenager in 2013. His case was repeatedly cited by Republicans as an example of what they said was a tendency by the judge to be lenient on child sex crime offenders, a charge Jackson forcefully denied. In an interview with the Post from a relative\u2019s home in DC, Hawkins was shocked to learn that his case had been the subject of several contentious back and forths between Biden\u2019s historic nominee for the supreme court and Republicans. Of his actions, Hawkins told the Post: \u201cWhen I got to a place that I could think about what I had done, retrospectively, I was disgusted. And if someone else wants to continue to see me that way, I can\u2019t stop them. But what I hope is that when people look over time they can see he was just a young man, that he\u2019s grown and learned from his actions.\u201d Jackson sentenced Hawkins to three months in prison, followed by three months of home detention and six years of supervision. He was also required to register as a sex offender. In sentencing Hawkins, Jackson told him she was imposing a punishment that would allow him to \u201cspend enough time in prison to understand and appreciate the consequences of your actions \u2026 but not so long that you will be subjected to harm in prison or introduced to incorrigible influences such that you are lost to society forever.\u201d Hawkins noted that many Republicans continued to support candidates who faced allegations of sexual misconduct. \u201cWhile I\u2019m not defending my actions, because, again, they are undefendable, I feel that their hypocrisy should be pointed out,\u201d he said. Reading about Jackson\u2019s confirmation hearing, Hawkins told the Post he felt sympathy for the judge who he had once been angry with over her decision to send him to prison. I wasn\u2019t very happy that she gave me three months, though, after reflection when I was in jail, I was hearing from other people who said it was their first time arrested and they got five years, six years,\u201d he said. I feel that she chose to take into consideration the fact that I was just getting started [in life] and she knew this was going to hold me back for years to come regardless,\u201d he said, \u201cso she didn\u2019t really want to add on to that.\u201d Read the full story here. Here\u2019s a teaser for the latest episode of the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast. Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, seems to relish addressing whatever culture war is raging. He might have learned a thing or two from his former backer, Donald Trump. If the polls are right, the two might end up fighting against each other in the Republican primaries for the 2024 presidential election. So who is DeSantis, and what are his chances? Jonathan Freedland speaks to Ana Ceballos of the Miami Herald and Peter Schorsch of Florida Politics to learn more about him. Listen here. As the House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack was negotiating with Donald Trump\u2019s former strategist Steve Bannon to cooperate with its inquiry, the panel affirmed a rule: no third-party lawyers could attend witness depositions. So when Bannon\u2019s then-attorney asked whether a lawyer for Trump could be present for the closed-door interview to decide what issues were covered by the former president\u2019s invocation of executive privilege, the committee flatly refused. Now, that refusal appears set to feature as one of Bannon\u2019s central arguments to defend against his contempt of Congress indictment that came after he skipped his deposition last October and refused to produce documents as required. The former Trump aide is advancing a high-stakes \u2013 and arcane \u2013 defense as he battles the Department of Justice (DoJ) in a case that could mean up to a year in federal prison and thousands of dollars in fines if convicted, but could also de-fang congressional power should he prevail. The all-or-nothing nature of the defense is characteristic of Bannon, a fierce defender and confidante of the former president even after he left the White House seven months into the Trump administration after a turbulent tenure as his chief strategist. It was precisely because of his contacts with Trump in the days before January 6 that the select committee made Bannon one of its first subpoena targets as it seeks to uncover whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy that culminated in the Capitol attack. The crux of Bannon\u2019s argument is that he could reasonably believe the subpoena was invalid when the select committee refused to allow a Trump lawyer to attend the deposition, after the former president asserted executive privilege over the materials covered by the subpoena. Full story: In light of the revelations about Ginni Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas and the deadly assault on the US Capitol on January 6, Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, which campaigns for reform of the supreme court, tells the Guardian the rule of law depends not just on impartiality, but on the appearance of impartiality. \u201cThere is a lack of moral authority on the supreme court right now, there is a lack of trust, and the court needs to acknowledge it and take steps to ameliorate it,\u201d Roth said. The commotion about Ginni Thomas\u2019s contacts with the Trump White House and activities around the Capitol attack has come at a torrid time for the supreme court on which her husband sits. On Friday Clarence Thomas himself was discharged from hospital having been treated for days with an infection. Millions of Americans also viewed the televised spectacle of the first Black woman to be nominated for the highest court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, being subjected to bizarre and hostile questioning by Republicans in her confirmation hearings. Senators including Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley pressed her on her sentencing record regarding offenders in child-abuse imagery cases, and on anti-racist teaching in schools in ways that at times came closer to dog-whistle politics than a solemn constitutional process. Full report: The Oregon senator Ron Wyden has called for Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from any cases before the supreme court concerning January 6 and the 2024 election. \u201cIn light of new reporting from numerous outlets, Justice Thomas\u2019 conduct on the supreme court looks increasingly corrupt,\u201d Wyden said in a statement, referring to the stunning revelation of Ginni Thomas\u2019s texts with Mark Meadows, then Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, around the deadly Capitol attack. (Ed Pilkington\u2019s Guardian report is here.) \u201cAt the bare minimum, Justice Thomas needs to recuse himself from any case related to the January 6 investigation, and should Donald Trump run again, any case related to the 2024 election.\u201d In January, Clarence Thomas was the only justice to say Trump should not have to release records to the January 6 committee. Since then, his wife\u2019s activities around the rally that preceded the attack have come into sharp focus. Emily Flitter, a New York Times reporter, points out that Thomas has recused himself on grounds of family before: Another Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, has meanwhile said Clarence Thomas should consider \u201cvoluntarily appearing\u201d before the January 6 committee to resolve questions about his wife\u2019s texts with Meadows. That seems \u2026 unlikely. Calls have erupted for ethical conflict-of-interest rules on America\u2019s top court after it was revealed that Ginni Thomas, wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, pressed Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The Washington Post reported that it had obtained a stash of 29 text messages between Ginni Thomas and Mark Meadows, then Trump\u2019s top White House aide, which were exchanged in the tumultuous days after the November 2020 election. In the texts, Thomas blatantly urged Meadows to do anything he could to subvert the democratic result so as to frustrate Joe Biden\u2019s victory and keep Trump in power. Ethics groups, members of Congress, law professors, pundits and a slew of other interested parties responded to the revelations with astonishment and concern. The Thomas-Meadows texts were contained in a trove of 2,320 digital communications Meadows handed to the House select committee investigating the storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6. Those communications were only obtained after the supreme court ordered them transferred to Congress, rejecting claims by Trump that they were covered by executive privilege. The court forced disclosure of the material, including the Ginni Thomas texts, by a vote of 8-1 \u2013 with Clarence Thomas providing the only dissent. Norman Ornstein, a senior emeritus fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the development \u201ca scandal of immense proportions\u201d. Branding Ginni Thomas a \u201cradical insurrectionist\u201d, he said it was time for the January 6 committee to subpoena her texts and emails to see what other incriminating evidence was out there. Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard law school, called on the justice department to investigate the apparent conspiracy between Thomas, Meadows and Trump. \u201cHard to see Justice Thomas not recusing when that reaches\u201d the supreme court, he said. Full story: After a brief delay, Polish President Andrzej Duda arrived at Rzesz\u00f3w\u2013Jasionka Airport, where he met Biden, who was joined by USAID administrator Samantha Power. The presidents then received a briefing on the humanitarian response to the exodus of refugees fleeing Ukraine. \u201cIt is fair to say, I think, that none of us have ever seen the speed and the scale of this destruction in our lifetimes,\u201d Power said. \u201cIt took a little over four years for four million refugees to flee the Syrian war. Ukraine could reach that number four days from now, just over a month since the war began.\u201d Biden began his remarks by reaching out and squeezing Duda\u2019s hand in a show of solidarity. To the humanitarian leaders at the table, he thanked them for their work and expressed his \u201cdisappointment\u201d that he could not firsthand the devastation and the desperation of the crisis in Ukraine, due to security reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s like something out of a science fiction movie,\u201d Biden said of the destruction wrought by the Russian assault on Ukraine. After the briefing, Biden will travel to Poland\u2019s capital, Warsaw. Biden is in Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland, not far from the country\u2019s border with Ukraine, where he is meeting with US service members. In remarks to the members of the 82nd airborne division, Biden hailed them as the \u201cfinest fighting force in the history of the world\u201d and said their work was \u201cconsequential.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to sound too philosophical \u2013 but we\u2019re in the midst of a fight between democracies and the oligarchs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is: who\u2019s gonna prevail? Are democracies going to prevail and the values we share or are autocracies going to prevail?\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s really what\u2019s at stake.\u201d Before his remarks, Biden visited troops at a barbershop. Then he stopped by the mess hall where he sat for a slice of pizza and some selfies. Per the pool report, Biden sat down in the middle of a table and grabbed piece of pepperoni and jalape\u00f1o pizza. \u201cThe jalape\u00f1os made his eyes water, so he dabbed at them with a napkin and someone got him a glass of water,\u201d according to the report. Joe Manchin is back in the headlines with an apparent offer to revive Democrats\u2019 climate and social spending plans \u2013 aims he had a lot to do with thwarting in December. The Washington Post cites two sources in saying the West Virginia senator, who holds outsized power as a centrist swing vote in the 50-50 chamber, \u201cwants the bill to take an \u2018all-of-the-above\u2019 approach to energy policy \u2026 and that it\u2019s still possible to reach a deal that includes billions of dollars\u2019 worth of provisions to tackle climate change, cut prescription drug costs and update the tax code. \u201cHe has also indicated that he wants the Biden administration to make some concessions related to oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and natural gas exports\u201d, the Post\u2019s sources added. West Virginia is a state somewhat in the grip of big energy interests. Put it that way. The interior department did not comment. A spokesperson for Manchin told the Post: \u201cSenator Manchin is always willing to engage in discussions about the best way to move our country forward. He has made clear that we can protect energy independence and respond to climate change at the same time.\u201d The Post also points out that the White House and Manchin have not exactly been best buddies since Manchin sank the huge Build Back Better spending plan, apparently telling Fox News Sunday before he told Joe Biden. There is also not much time left to move major legislation before the approach of the midterm elections renders such moves moot. And the White House is focusing on getting Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmed to the supreme court. The Post said the White House had indicated it could be receptive to overtures from Manchin. Sheldon Whitehouse, a senator from Rhode Island, told the paper Manchin \u201cappears to be on board with the clean energy tax credits as well as a fee on emissions of methane, a potent planet-warming gas\u201d. Here\u2019s what Whitehouse tells us about Democrats and climate today: There were a few more newsy lines from McCarthy\u2019s question and answer session with reporters in Florida. He demurred when asked whether Clarence Thomas should have recused himself from cases involving the congressional investigation into the January 6 assault on the US Capitol, in light of text messages in which his wife repeatedly urged Trump\u2019s then-chief of staff to overturn he 2020 presidential results. \u201c It\u2019s his decision based upon law,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHe\u2019s one who studies correctly, all the way through.\u201d Thomas is one of the most conservative justices in the court\u2019s history and was the lone dissenter in the court\u2019s order to reject Trump\u2019s bid to withhold documents from the January 6 panel. McCarthy was also joined on the panel by arch-conservative congressman Jim Jordan. There was some uncertainty about whether members of the Freedom Caucus would try to challenge or undermine McCarthy\u2019s bid to become speaker if Republicans take back the House in 2022. But during the conversation, Jordan anticipated that McCarthy, who has gone to great lengths to brandish his conservative credentials and display allegiance to Trump, would become the next Speaker. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said Republican congressman Jeff Fortenberry should resign after he was convicted in a campaign finance case of lying to the FBI. \u201cI think when someone\u2019s convicted, it\u2019s time to resign,\u201d McCarthy told reporters during the Republican retreat in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. The Nebraska congressman was convicted in federal court in Los Angeles on Thursday of lying to federal authorities about an illegal contribution to his campaign in 2016 from a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire. Fortenberry, who is in his ninth term, told reporters at the courthouse that he planned to appeal. McCarthy said that was his right, but suggested he do it as a private citizen, not a member of Congress. Supreme court justice Clarence Thomas was discharged from the hospital on Friday, a week after he was admitted for what the court said was an infection. The 73-year-old conservative justice was admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital last Friday after experiencing flu-like symptoms that a court spokeswoman said was not covid-19. The court announced Thomas\u2019 hospitalization two days later, on Sunday, and declined to provide updates on his health. News of Thomas\u2019 hospitalization comes amid revelations that his wife, Virginia Thomas, repeatedly urged Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff to help overturn the results, according to text messages obtained by the Washington Post and CBS News. It also comes as the Senate considers the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson. Jackson would be the first Black woman to serve on the court, where Thomas is currently the only Black justice. With Manchin\u2019s support in the bag, attention now turns to senator Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, another centrist holdout on key parts of Biden\u2019s agenda. But so far, the senator has signaled that she intends to support Jackson\u2019s nomination. Despite a brutal confirmation hearing, Democratic leaders remain hopeful Jackson will attract some Republican votes, as she did during her confirmation to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit last year. As long as all 50 Democrats support Jackson, they do not need any Republican votes to confirm her to the bench. The filibuster no longer applies, after minority leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans voted in 2017 to lower the threshold to confirm supreme court nominees from 60 votes to 50 in response to an attempt by Democrats to block the confirmation of judge Neil Gorsuch. It followed a 2013 rule change by Democrats that lowered the threshold from 60 to 50 votes to confirm most presidential nominees, excluding Supreme Court picks, amid a Republican blockade against several nominees of Barack Obama. Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, said he would vote to confirm Biden\u2019s nominee for the supreme court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, all but ensuring she will be the first Black woman to sit on the bench. \u201cAfter meeting with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, considering her record, and closely monitoring her testimony and questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, I have determined I intend to vote for her nomination to serve on the Supreme Court,\u201d he said, citing the judge\u2019s \u201cexemplary\u201d record and career. Though not a complete surprise, it is likely a relief for Democrats in the evenly divided, 50-50 Senate, where they need every vote from their party to confirm Jackson. Manchin, who has blocked major pieces of Biden\u2019s legislative agenda and recently doomed his nominee to the Fed, has largely supported the president\u2019s judicial nominees. \u201cOn top of her impressive resume, she has the temperament to make an exceptional jurist,\u201d he said, adding a very Manchian (Manchinian?) detail: \u201cNotably, Judge Jackson and her family spend a great deal of time in West Virginia and her deep love of our state and commitment to public service were abundantly clear.\u201d He concluded: \u201cI am confident Judge Jackson is supremely qualified and has the disposition necessary to serve as our nation\u2019s next Supreme Court Justice.\u201d Air Force One has landed at Poland\u2019s Rzesz\u00f3w-Jasionka Airport, which is in the southeast part of the country, roughly an hour drive from the border with Ukraine. Biden was supposed to meet first with Andrzej Duda, but the Polish president\u2019s plane has been delayed. Polish media is reporting that the plane was forced to return due to a technical issue. Instead, Biden will first greet US service-members of the 82nd Airborne Division, who are working alongside Polish allies on deterrence efforts on Nato\u2019s eastern flank, before receiving a briefing by humanitarian groups. According to background provided by the White House, members of the Task Force 82 have completed \u201ccombined training, civic, and cultural engagements\u201d since their arrival in Poland last month. That includes \u201ccombined arms training\u201d with Polish and British allies as well as civic and cultural visits to local orphanages, youth groups, military memorials and the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp site. Sullivan answered questions from reporters a number of topics. Concern that Russia may use chemical weapons was an \u201cimportant topic of conversation\u201d during Biden\u2019s visit to Europe. Biden vowed to respond \u201cin kind\u201d if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine. Pressed on what that means, as chemical weapons are illegal under international law and Biden has repeatedly said the US would not send troops to fight Russia in Ukraine, Sullivan said it was an issue being discussed and prepared for both militarily and diplomatically as well as among allied leaders. \u201cWe are working through contingency planning for a range of different scenarios,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to give precision to these kinds of hypotheticals because of course, the form of use, the location of use, the context of use, all have a bearing on the specificity of the response. But in broad terms, I believe that there is convergence around the fundamental nature of how the alliance would respond to these issues.\u201d He also told reporters that the US does not believe China has granted Russia\u2019s request for military aid. \u201cWe have not seen the Chinese move forward with the provision of military equipment to Russia, but it\u2019s something we continue to watch every day,\u201d he said. Asked whether the president expected to discuss a Polish proposal to send international peacekeepers into Ukraine, Sullivan said he wasn\u2019t sure if the Polish president would raise that with Biden during their meeting and said the US needed more information before it responded. He also said there is \u201cno update\u201d on Ukraine\u2019s request for more warplanes, after the US rejected a proposal from Poland to transfer Russian-made MiG fighter planes from a US base in Germany to Ukraine out of concern that it might escalate the conflict with Russia. Asked about how Biden views his trip to Europe, Sullivan emphasized a point Biden stressed in his remarks on Thursday: that unity will take work over time. \u201cPart of the reason that he decided that we needed to do this is because the early weeks unity can be carried forward by momentum and inertia and adrenaline,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cBut this could go on for some time, and to sustain that unity as costs rise, as the tragedy unfolds, that\u2019s hard work. And the president wanted to get everybody together to say, \u2018we\u2019ve got to do that work.\u2019 ...It takes an American president coming over to really try to drive this forward.\u201d On the flight to Poland from Belgium, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan previewed Biden\u2019s visit to Poland. Sullivan said Biden would meet with Ukrainian refugees and American humanitarian groups in Warsaw before delivered a \u201csignificant speech\u201d on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cHe will give a major address tomorrow that will speak to the stakes of this moment, of the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world, and why it is so important that the free world to stay in unity and resolve in the face of Russian aggression,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cHe\u2019ll also talk about the context and history of this conflict and where he sees it going from here.\u201d Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of US politics. Joe Biden is en route to Rzeszow, Poland, a city some 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he will be greeted by the country\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, after the president participated in a round of summits with leaders of Nato, Group of Seven (G7) and European Union nations. There he will receive a briefing on humanitarian response to ease suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and meets service members from 82nd Airborne Division before traveling to Warsaw. Biden\u2019s visit comes as the battle for the Ukrainian capital Kyiv grinds on, more than a month after Russia began its brutal assault. For more on the war in Ukraine, follow our global liveblog here. Earlier on Friday, Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed a new partnership that they said would reduce Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian energy. The US said it would increase exports of liquefied natural gas exports to Europe by at least 15 billion cubic meters without hindering efforts to meet the White House\u2019s climate goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to make sure the families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we\u2019re building the infrastructure for a diversified, resilient and clean energy future,\u201d Biden said in Brussels."

            "date": "2022-03-28T21:08:14Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s been a lively day in Washington. Joe Biden defended his comment that Vladimir Putin should be removed as president of Russia, but said it was an expression of his \u201cmoral outrage\u201d and not a threat that the US aimed to topple the Russian leader over his decision to invade Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019m not walking anything back,\u201d he said of the remark, which allied leaders have downplayed and the Kremlin has condemned. Biden unveiled a budget blueprint for the 2023 fiscal year that advocates higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans, more money for law enforcement and greater spending on domestic priorities like education, health care and housing. The budget proposes that households worth more than $100m pay at least 20% in taxes on both income and \u201cunrealized gains.\u201d A federal judge believes Donald Trump probably committed felony obstruction of Congress with attempted coup at US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The House panel investigating the Capitol attack is reportedly seeking to interview with Ginni Thomas, the wife of supreme court justice Clarence Thomas. It is expected to be a topic of conversation at this evening\u2019s committee hearing. Here\u2019s the full report on Biden\u2019s budget proposal from the Guardian\u2019s business editor, Dominic Rushe. For the latest on Ukraine, please follow our 24/7 global liveblog. The press briefing wrapped pretty quickly, with Bates asking reporters to send any further questions by email. He did not answer shouted questions about why national security advisor Jake Sullivan didn\u2019t attend the briefing as the White House said he would. Young was reluctant to expand on efforts to revive Biden\u2019s domestic policy agenda, but said the president\u2019s budget included a \u201creserve\u201d to account for a possible policy agreement on Capitol hill. So far, such a consensus has eluded lawmakers. Asked whether the emphasis on deficit reduction was aimed at wooing moderates, Young said this was a feature of both of Biden\u2019s budgets. \u201cThis is a classic Joe Biden budget,\u201d she said. It seeks to create a tax system that is \u201cfair\u201d and seeks to lower the deficit. Rouse again said that Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will have an impact on both energy and food prices. \u201cWe do expect inflation to ease this year into next year,\u201d she said. Young outlined the president\u2019s budget proposal, emphasizing again that a budget is a reflection of the president\u2019s priorities. Rouse then offered the White House\u2019s assessment of the economy. \u201cIn many ways the forecast looks healthier today than it did when we locked it all the way back last November,\u201d Rouse said. \u201cThe economy has created on average 600,000 jobs per month since then, including through the omicron wave and the unemployment rate has fallen an additional 0.8%.\u201d Citing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she warned that inflation could get worse before it gets better. The war, she said, \u201cmay put upward pressure on energy and food prices. That in turn could reinforce inflation, which was already an issue.\u201d White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates is at the podium for his first press briefing, after White House press secretary Jen Psaki and White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tested positive for covid-19. Psaki, he said, shared that she is \u201cfeeling stir crazy and will be back soon.\u201d He is joined by Shalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cBe nice to the newbie,\u201d Young said with a hearty laugh. Now he\u2019s being asked about the Supreme Court. He declined to say whether he thinks Clarence Thomas should recuse himself from all matters related to the January 6th assault on the US capitol. He said that was a matter for the Congressional committee and for the Justice Department, not him. Democrats have implored Thomas to recuse himself after it was revealed that his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, exchanged text messages with Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff supporting efforts to overturn the election results. She also attended the rally that preceded the violence. On the matter of his supreme court nominee, Biden said he did not have a chance to watch the hearing but dismissed the conservative criticism of judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. \u201cLook, this is one of the most qualified nominees ever nominated for the supreme court, in every respect...a woman who is totally, thoroughly qualified,\u201d he said. Now, taking questions from reporters, Biden is defending his unscripted remarks during a speech in Poland, in which he said Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin \u201ccannot remain in power\u201d. Biden was adamant that he was not calling for regime change and instead was expressing his \u201cmoral outrage\u201d at the brutality of Putin\u2019s assault as Russian troops raze Ukrainian cities. \u201cI\u2019m not walking anything back,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI was expressing the moral outrage I felt toward the way Putin is dealing and the actions of this man, which is just brutality .... But I want to be clear that I wasn\u2019t then nor am I now articulating a policy change.\u201d \u201cI make no apologies for it,\u201d he added. He argued that Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d and said the comment does not undermine diplomatic efforts by the US and European allies to pursue peace and negotiate an end to the brutality. Pressed on his remarks, Biden was defiant and said he was not worried that his comments will be interpreted as a call for regime change or that it will be used by Russian propagandist. \u201cNobody believes I was talking about taking down Putin...nobody believes that,\u201d he said. \u201cI was expressing my outrage at the behavior of this man.\u201d Biden did not directly say whether he would be willing to meet with Putin. Biden said it would depend \u201con what he wants to talk about.\u201d Defending the line items that would deliver more funding for law enforcement, Biden said the US is \u201cmore prosperous, more successful, and more just when it is more secure. \u201cWe\u2019re in a different world today,\u201d he said, once again emphasizing that the answer to tackling rising violent crime rates was to \u201cfund police\u201d not to defund the police. Republicans have sought to tar Democrats as \u201csoft on crime\u201d by tying Biden and the broader Democratic party to calls by activists to defund the police. Most Democrats have not embraced the slogan and there is a range of views on what such a proposal would look like. He also outlined many of his domestic policy proposals related to child care, health care, drug pricing and education. \u201cWe give hardworking parents raising children tax relief to give them just a little bit of breathing room and lower child poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. This will bring down the cost for seniors and reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. Congress can do this this all right now are debating it now.\u201d Outlining his budget, Biden said it makes headway \u201ccleaning up the mess I inherited\u201d and \u201creturning our fiscal house to order.\u201d This is a nod to moderates and conservatives who have accused Biden of prioritizing progressive spending policies without regard to the national deficit. Throughout his remarks, Biden assailed his predecessor, blaming the \u201cTrump tax cuts\u201d for ballooning the deficit and helping top earners. He repeated his campaign pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 per year. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that Congress enacts this law,\u201d he said. There are few signs that Congress will take up Biden\u2019s budget. But it\u2019s a messaging tool that Democrats can point to as they face a difficult election cycle this November. Here\u2019s Joe Biden and Shalanda Young, the director of the the Office of Management and Budget, outlining the president\u2019s budget for the 2023 fiscal year. \u201cBudgets are value statements: they\u2019re about the kind of country we want to be and the type of future we want to leave our kids,\u201d she said, introducing Biden. Stepping up to the podium, Biden said his new budget \u201csends a clear message to the American people.\u201d He outlined three priorities of his new budget blueprint: fiscal responsibility safety and security at home and around the world investments to \u201cbuild a better America\u201d Here are the details of the opinion poll mentioned earlier that deals with US public anxiety over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has most Americans at least somewhat worried that the US will be drawn directly into the conflict and could be targeted with nuclear weapons, with a new poll reflecting a level of anxiety that has echoes of the cold war era, the Associated Press writes. The AP further reports: Close to half of Americans say they are very concerned that Russia would directly target the US with nuclear weapons, and an additional 3 in 10 are somewhat concerned about that, according to the new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Russian President Vladimir Putin placed his country\u2019s nuclear forces on high alert shortly after the 24 February invasion. Roughly nine in 10 Americans are at least somewhat concerned that Putin might use a nuclear weapon against Ukraine, including about 6 in 10 who are very concerned. \u201cHe is out of control, and I don\u2019t think he really has concern for much of anything but what he wants,\u201d said Robin Thompson, a retired researcher from Amherst, Massachusetts. \u201cAnd he has nuclear weapons.\u201d Seventy-one percent of Americans say the invasion has increased the possibility of nuclear weapons being used anywhere in the world. The poll was conducted before North Korea test-fired its biggest intercontinental ballistic missile on Friday but also shows 51% of Americans saying they are very concerned about the threat to the US posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. An additional 29% expressed moderate concern. In the recent AP-NORC poll, close to half of Americans say they are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned that the US might be drawn into a war with Russia. Roughly four in 10 Americans said they are \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned. The findings reflect not just anxiety about what seems like a proxy war with Russia, even if the US isn\u2019t directly involved in the conflict, but also the unprecedented saturation coverage of the war through traditional news outlets and social media. \u201cWe are seeing almost moment by moment what\u2019s happening to these poor people,\u201d said Linda Woodward, a retired phone company technician from Hot Springs Village, Arkansas. The concern about nuclear war cuts across party lines and even resonates with some young adults who were born after the cold war. You can read AP\u2019s full report on its poll here.

The January 6 news keeps coming, with ABC reporting that Jared Kushner, son-in-law and senior White House adviser to Donald Trump, is expected to appear before the investigating House committee this week. Kushner, ABC says, citing multiple anonymous sources, will do so voluntarily, if the virtual session is not delayed. He was not at the White House on 6 January 2021 but his wife, Ivanka Trump, was. Kushner was also a senior White House staffer throughout his father-in-law\u2019s attempts to overturn the election and stay in power, attempts motivated like the Capitol attack by lies about voter fraud. Elsewhere, it has been reported that the committee wants to talk to Ginni Thomas, a rightwing activist and wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas whose texts with Trump\u2019s chief of staff on and around the Capitol attack were reported last week, stoking a Washington scandal. It\u2019s also emerged today that a federal judge both thinks it likely that Donald Trump \u201ccommitted multiple felonies as he sought to return himself to power on 6 January\u201d and has \u201cordered Trump lawyer John Eastman to turn over hundreds of emails\u201d to the investigating House committee. Those are quotes from Hugo Lowell\u2019s full report on the matter, which is here: Returning to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, here\u2019s a taste of today\u2019s Guardian US column from Rajan Menon, director of the Grand Strategy Program at Defense Priorities and senior research fellow at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University: Can proponents of regime change in Russia be certain that the denouement will be the one they have in mind and are confident about? The dismal record of the US and its allies in predicting the results of the regime changes they precipitated \u2013 in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya \u2013 are grounds for caution, not least because the consequences of getting this particular attempt wrong might prove disastrous. Rajan\u2019s full piece can be read here: Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican senator and reputed presidential hopeful, found himself in a tough spot at the weekend when he claimed tax rises contained in his own \u201c11 point plan to rescue America\u201d were actually \u201cDemocratic talking points\u201d instead. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s in the plan!\u201d his interviewer exclaimed, on Fox News Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s in the plan!\u201d Our report is here. For interested readers, meanwhile, here\u2019s some further reading: an award-winning report from Benjamin Ryan, in 2019, about how when Scott was governor of Florida, \u201chis administration presided over the effective blocking of $70m in federal funds available for fighting the state\u2019s HIV crisis\u201d: Florida\u2019s Republican governor Ron DeSantis signed the so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, moments ago, that forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity to school children in kindergarten through third grade (ages five to eight, approximately) - a policy that has drawn intense national scrutiny from critics arguing it is an attempt to marginalize LGBTQ people. The bill was passed by the state\u2019s Republican-led senate earlier this month. Since its inception, the measure has drawn intense opposition from LGBTQ+ advocates, students, Democrats, the White House and the entertainment industry, amid increased attention on Florida as Republicans push culture war legislation and DeSantis ascends in the GOP as a potential presidential candidate. The legislation has pushed Florida and DeSantis, an ascending Republican and potential 2024 presidential candidate, to the forefront of the country\u2019s culture wars, with LGBTQ advocates, students, Democrats, the entertainment industry and the White House denouncing what critics have called the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill. The Associated Press writes: DeSantis and Republicans have repeatedly said the measure is reasonable and that parents, not teachers, should be broaching subjects of sexual orientation and gender identity with their children. \u201cWe will make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination,\u201d DeSantis said before he signed the bill into law. He and other speakers stood at a podium affixed with a placard reading Protect Children/Support Parents. Critics say the bill is so vaguely worded that speech could be muzzled throughout public schools. The bill states: \u201cClassroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201d Parents would be able to sue districts over violations. DeSantis signed the bill after a news conference held at the Classical Preparatory School in Spring Hill, about 46 miles north of Tampa. The school was founded by Anne Corcoran, wife of Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, according to The Gainesville Sun. Federal prosecutors plan to finish presenting evidence this week in the trial of four men charged with conspiring to kidnap Michigan\u2019s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer. An undercover FBI agent known as \u201cRed\u201d is due to appear today at the trial in Grand Rapids, the Associated Press writes. The AP further reports: Red joined key members of the group on a 2020 trip to Elk Rapids to take a look at Whitmer\u2019s vacation home and a nearby bridge that could be blown up to distract police during her kidnapping, according to evidence. Adam Fox, Barry Croft Jr., Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta are charged with conspiracy. Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, two other men who were also arrested in October 2020, have pleaded guilty and were critical witnesses for the government last week. Authorities said the men were armed extremists who, after weeks of training, were trying to come up with $4,000 for an explosive. They practiced that summer in Wisconsin and Michigan by dashing in and out of crude structures built to resemble a house or office. Garbin testified last week that Whitmer\u2019s kidnapping could ignite a U.S. civil war involving antigovernment groups and possibly prevent Joe Biden from winning the presidential election. Fox talked about snatching the governor \u201cevery time I saw him,\u201d Franks said. Defense attorneys deny there was an actual plan to get Whitmer, claiming the men were improperly influenced by undercover agents and informants, and exchanged wild talk while often smoking marijuana. Whitmer rarely talks publicly about the case, though she referred to \u201csurprises\u201d during her term that seem like \u201csomething out of fiction\u201d when she filed for reelection on March 17. She has blamed former president Donald Trump for fomenting anger over coronavirus restrictions and refusing to condemn right-wing extremists like those charged in the case. Whitmer has said Trump was complicit in the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection by thousands of his extremist supporters who sought to stop the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory over the Republican at the November 2020 election. As you\u2019ll have seen from this blog today and dozens of Guardian stories, the insurrection is still very much in the news , with a special House panel investigating and hundreds charged with crimes relating to the attack on the Capitol. The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack is expected to discuss Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, tonight, before it officially considers holding in criminal contempt of Congress two of Donald Trump\u2019s most senior White House advisers, Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro. The move to initiate contempt proceedings against the two Trump aides amounts to a biting rebuke of their refusal to cooperate with the inquiry, as the panel deploys its most punitive measures to reaffirm the consequences of noncompliance. House investigators said in a notice that it would consider a contempt report against Scavino and Navarro in a business meeting scheduled for next Monday on Capitol Hill, after they defied subpoenas compelling them to provide documents and testimony, Hugo Lowell has reported. The select committee is expected to vote unanimously to send the contempt report for a vote before the House of Representatives, according to a source close to the panel, so that the Trump aides can be referred to the justice department for prosecution. The select committee took a special interest in Scavino, since, as Trump\u2019s former deputy chief of staff for communications, he was intimately involved in a months-long effort by the Trump White House to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Scavino was also closely involved in the scheme to pressure then vice-president Mike Pence to stop the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election at the joint session of Congress on January 6, according to his subpoena, first issued in October last year. The select committee sought information from Navarro since he knew of that scheme to have Pence return Trump to office, through his contacts with the former president and the Trump \u201cwar room\u201d at the Willard hotel in Washington that oversaw its implementation. Navarro was briefed on the scheme \u2013 called the \u201cGreen Bay Sweep\u201d \u2013 by the political operatives responsible for the operation at the Willard, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who was also indicted for contempt last year for subpoena defiance. The Guardian has reported that Trump discussed ways to stop Biden\u2019s certification from taking place with the Willard war room hours before the Capitol attack, based on unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud that originated in part from Navarro\u2019s aides. However, the select committee\u2019s move to consider contempt reports against the two Trump aides indicate neither one complied with their subpoena. Their contempt reports are expected to be made public Sunday, said a source familiar with the matter. Read the rest of Hugo Lowell\u2019s report for the Guardian here. Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer John Eastman must turn over to the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack around a hundred emails he had refused to turn over to the investigation, a federal judge ruled Monday, also saying then-president Trump \u201cmore likely than not\u201d committed felonies over the January 6 insurrection. The extraordinary ruling that paves the way for the select committee to obtain some of Eastman\u2019s most sensitive emails concerning his illegal scheme to return Trump to office marks another major breakthrough for the investigation. \u201cBased on the evidence the court finds that it is more likely than not that president Trump and Dr Eastman dishonestly conspired to obstruct the joint session of congress on Jan 6, 2021,\u201d ruled judge David Carter. Among the emails that the judge ordered Eastman to turn over include messages forwarded to him by Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani recommending that then-vice president Mike Pence overturn the 2020 election and laid out a day-by-day plan of action leading up to January 6, Hugo Lowell reports for the Guardian Trump and Eastman may have been planning a crime as they sought to disrupt the January 6 congressional certification of the presidential election in 2021, two months after Democrat Joe Biden defeated Republican Trump in the November 2020 election. The election was later called by officials at multiple levels across the country as the most secure in US history and the result was also backed by Trump\u2019s then-attorney general Bill Barr. CNN reports further on the judge today: Carter\u2019s reasoning is a startling acknowledgment by a federal court that Trump\u2019s interest in overturning the election could be considered criminal. Trump has not been charged with any crime nor has Eastman. \u201cThe illegality of the plan was obvious,\u201d Carter writes. \u201cOur nation was founded on the peaceful transition of power, epitomized by George Washington laying down his sword to make way for democratic elections. Ignoring this history, President Trump vigorously campaigned for the Vice President to single-handedly determine the results of the 2020 election \u2026 Every American \u2013 and certainly the President of the United States \u2013 knows that in a democracy, leaders are elected, not installed.\u201d Also this is on Twitter from Law Crime News: The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol by extremist supporters of then-president Donald Trump plans to request an interview with Virginia Thomas, the wife of US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, according to a new report. Yesterday, Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republican members on the committee, had vowed the panel will \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of events surrounding the 2021 insurrection but had refused to reveal whether they intended to question conservative activist Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas over reports of her urging the White House then-chief of staff Mark Meadows to make all efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s election defeat. Kinzinger did however hint that it would be a topic of conversation on the panel this week and moments ago the Washington Post reported that the committee will indeed request to talk to Thomas, citing a source familiar with the investigation as confirming an earlier report to that effect by CNN. Speaking on CBS yesterday morning, Kinzinger had refused to confirm or deny the existence of text messages Ginni Thomas is reported to have exchanged with Meadows, although he did not contest the Post and CBS\u2019s joint revelation last week that they obtained copies of such messages from materials submitted to the congressional committee by Meadows. Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding 6 January 2021, said of witnesses being summoned to give evidence to the committee: \u201cWe\u2019ll call in whoever we need to call in.\u201d He added: \u201cWas there an effort to overturn the legitimate election of the United States? What was January 6 in relation to that? And what is the rot in our system that led to that and does it still exist today?\u2026 We are going to get to the bottom of this.\u201d He did not say whether that \u201crot\u201d extended to the nation\u2019s highest court. Thomas and her husband are rightwing political darlings who have described themselves as \u201cone being \u2013 an amalgam,\u201d according to the New York Times. Amid the latest reports, Justice Thomas is now facing calls to recuse himself from any cases surrounding the 2020 presidential election, the insurrection and potentially the 2024 presidential election, should Trump run for re-election. Also yesterday, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, chairwoman of the Senate rules committee and a member of the Senate judiciary committee, which quizzes nominees for the supreme court, demanded that Clarence Thomas be removed from any cases surrounding the 2020 presidential election, the insurrection and potentially the 2024 presidential election, should Trump run for re-election.. \u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d Klobuchar told ABC\u2019s This Week yesterday. \u201cYou have the wife of a sitting supreme court justice advocating for an insurrection, advocating for overturning a legal election, to the sitting president\u2019s chief of staff. And she also knows this election, these cases, are going to come before her husband. This is a textbook case for removing him, recusing him, from these decisions.\u201d The 29 exchanges reported between Ginni Thomas and Meadows reveal how the wife of one of the land\u2019s top jurists disseminated disinformation related to the QAnon conspiracy theory and other inaccurate arguments during the tempestuous days following the November 2020 election when rightwingers were claiming Democrat Joe Biden had not won. Even as Trump strategized efforts to overturn his defeat through the courts, Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas \u201cspread false theories, commented on cable news segments and advocated with urgency and fervor that the president and his team take action to reverse the outcome of the election,\u201d the Post reported. It reported she wrote to Meadows: \u201cHelp This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!...You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America\u2019s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.\u201d Joe Biden has unveiled some details and his rationale behind the official budget announcement that is forthcoming this afternoon. In a statement put out by the White House a few minutes ago, the US president said that: \u201cBudgets are statements of values, and the budget I am releasing today sends a clear message that we value fiscal responsibility, safety and security at home and around the world, and the investments needed to continue our equitable growth and build a better America.\u201d Biden continued that: \u201cMy administration is on track to reduce the federal deficit by more than $1.3 trillion this year, cutting in half the deficit from the last year of the previous administration and delivering the largest one-year reduction in the deficit in US history. \u201cThat\u2019s the direct result of my administration\u2019s strategy to get the pandemic under control and grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. We spent less money than the last Administration and got better results: strong economic growth, which has increased revenues and allowed us to responsibly scale back emergency spending. \u201cMy budget will continue that progress, further reducing the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share. \u201cAt the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our nation and building a better America. We will secure our communities by putting more police on the street to engage in accountable community policing, hiring the agents needed to help fight gun crime, and investing in crime prevention and community violence intervention. \u201cI\u2019m calling for one of the largest investments in our national security in history, with the funds needed to ensure that our military remains the best-prepared, best-trained, best-equipped military in the world. \u201cIn addition, I\u2019m calling for continued investment to forcefully respond to Putin\u2019s aggression against Ukraine with US support for Ukraine\u2019s economic, humanitarian, and security needs. \u201cMy budget also makes the investments needed to reduce costs for families and make progress on my Unity Agenda \u2013 including investments to cut the costs of child care and health care; help families pay for other essentials; end cancer as we know it; support our veterans; and get all Americans the mental health services they need. \u201cAll told, it is a budget that includes historic deficit reduction, historic investments in our security at home and abroad, and an unprecedented commitment to building an economy where everyone has a chance to succeed.\u201d There continues to be short-term fall-out from Joe Biden\u2019s ad libbed remark at the end of his keynote speech in Poland on Saturday, where he added, of Russian president Vladimir Putin: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u201d There will probably be long-term fall out, too. But during the weekend, not only did senior administration figures from secretary of state Antony Blinken on down scramble to do damage limitation and insist that Biden was not calling for \u201cregime change\u201d in Russia, while some such as French president Emmanuel Macron were critical, but the remark was even picked up in the pulpit when the US president returned to Washington, DC. After arriving back at the White House in the early hours of Sunday, Biden emerged in the early evening to attend church for mass. Politico reported that: Biden attended the 5.30pm service at Georgetown\u2019s Holy Trinity Catholic Church. The gospel reading of the day was the story of the prodigal son. During the homily the priest reflected on that reading and compared Biden and Putin, America and Russia, to the estranged brothers in that New Testament story. \u201cPutin/Russia may be the wayward son that we need to pray for and love,\u201d one of Biden\u2019s fellow parishioners emailed us after the service. The pool reporter of the night afterwards noted that Biden left the church at 6.26pm and a reporter asked him if he was \u201ccalling for regime change?\u201d Biden said, simply: \u201cNo.\u201d A quick reminder that our global, 24/7 live blog on the war is here. Russian president Vladimir Putin does not appear ready to make compromises to end the war it started in Ukraine, a senior US official told Reuters today, as Ukraine and Russia were preparing for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks, in Turkey. \u201cEverything I have seen is he is not willing to compromise at this point,\u201d the senior US State Department official told the news wire, on condition of anonymity, after Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymr Zelenskiy sketched out a potential way to end the crisis over the weekend. Reuters further reports: \u201cSo, how far we go in trying to offer him [Putin] off-ramps that undercut the sovereignty of Ukraine and the decisions that President Zelinskiy would have to make, I don\u2019t have a good insight for you,\u201d the official said. Ukrainian officials played down the chances of a major breakthrough at the talks, due to be held in Istanbul after Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Putin on Sunday. Ukraine is ready to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia but such a pact would have to be guaranteed by third parties and put to a referendum, Zelenskiy said in remarks aired on Sunday. Speaking to Russian journalists in a 90-minute video call more than a month after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, an interview that Moscow authorities preemptively warned Russian media to refrain from reporting, Zelenskiy said no peace deal would be possible without a ceasefire and troop withdrawals. He ruled out trying to recapture all Russian-held territory by force, saying it would lead to a third world war, and said he wanted to reach a \u201ccompromise\u201d over the eastern Donbas region, held by Russian-backed forces since 2014. Russia says it is conducting a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine with the aim of demilitarizing its neighbor. Ukraine and its Western allies call this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s video clip of Zelenskiy\u2019s statement. The Biden administration is set to propose a 20% minimum tax on households worth more than $100m. The proposal would raise more than $360bn over the next decade and \u201cwould make sure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters,\u201d according to a factsheet released by the White House. The plan - called the \u201cBillionaire Minimum Income Tax\u201d - is the administration\u2019s most aggressive move to date to tax the very wealthiest Americans. Billionaire wealth grew exponentially during the coronavirus pandemic, helped by soaring share prices and a tax regime that charges investors less on their gains than those taxed on their income. \u201cIn 2021 alone, America\u2019s more than 700 billionaires saw their wealth increase by $1tn, yet in a typical year, billionaires like these would pay just 8% of their total realized and unrealized income in taxes. A firefighter or teacher can pay double that tax rate,\u201d the White House factsheet notes. Under the plan households worth over $100m would have to give detailed accounts to the Inland Revenue Service of how their assets had fared over the year. Those who pay less than 20% on those gains would then be subject to an additional tax that would take their rate up to 20%. The Biden administration calculates that the tax would impact only the top 0.01% of American households, those worth over $100m million, and that over half of the revenue would come from households worth more than $1bn. The budget also looks set to tackle another issue that some economists have argued contributes to widening income inequality: share buybacks. In recent years cash-rich companies including Apple, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft, have used their funds to buyback huge quantities of their own shares, boosting their share price. Last year companies in the S&amp;P 500 bought back a record $882bn of their own shares and Goldman Sachs estimates that figure will rise to $1tn this year. Critics charge that the purchases divert money away from hiring new staff, raising wages and research and development. Research by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that there is \u201cclear evidence that a substantial number of corporate executives today use buybacks as a chance to cash out\u201d. The Biden proposal would stop executives from selling their shares for three years after a buyback is announced. Biden attempted to impose a 1% tax on share buybacks last year but the proposal failed in Congress. Both Biden\u2019s billionaire tax and the share buyback proposal will also face tough opposition in Congress. The Washington Post broke the latest news with details of the new tax proposal, on Saturday. The US president will ask Congress to approve the new budget for the next fiscal year, passing the new minimum tax on billionaires and other proposals aimed at galvanizing Biden\u2019s domestic agenda, cutting the US deficit and some measures that the White House also hopes will bring down inflation. Biden\u2019s budget has conservative West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin \u201cwritten all over it\u201d, Politico opines this morning. It notes guidance over the weekend that the multi-trillion 2023 budget aims to, per White House briefing: \u201cReflect three important values: fiscal responsibility, safety and security at home and abroad, and a commitment to building a better America.\u201d Also that: \u201cThrough a new billionaire minimum income tax and other measures, budget policies will reduce deficits by a total of over $1tn over the next decade.\u201d And in a move that will dismay progressives, but which Biden had been strongly signaling, the budget will propose more funding for police. \u201cThe Budget will help keep our communities safe by putting more cops on the beat for community policing, fighting gun crime, and investing in crime prevention and community violence interventions,\u201d the White House said. The proposed budget will also propose to \u201cmake one of the largest investments in our national security in US history...and make other critical investments to help build a better America...cutting costs for families.\u201d Politico remarks: To say this is a dramatic change compared to Biden\u2019s agenda last year is an understatement. The midterm messaging from the White House may as well have been written by Senator Joe Manchin: an emphasis on taxing only the wealthiest Americans, a new commitment to deficit reduction, lots more money for cops and the military, and chunks of the old Build Back Better agenda repackaged as inflation-fighting policies. What a difference a year makes! Joe Biden will unveil his fiscal year 2023 budget this afternoon with a central proposal for a new income tax on the wealthiest Americans. The US president is due to make his announcements at 2.45pm ET today and will be accompanied by director of the Office of Management and Budget, Shalanda Young. Biden is set to announce a tax aimed at US billionaires as part of his 2023 budget plans in a move that will likely delight many progressives in his party but could meet opposition from conservative Democrats who have already stymied his domestic agenda. What is expected is a \u201cbillionaire minimum income tax\u201d plan that would establish a 20% minimum tax rate on all American households worth more than $100m, as reported by the Washington Post on Saturday. That would mean the majority of new revenue would come from billionaires, who are a frequent target of public and political ire for tax avoidance schemes. The paper said it would be \u201ca tax on the richest 700 Americans for the first time\u201d. The White House has been briefing that the budget, which covers the year from 1 October, \u201cwill reflect three important values: fiscal responsibility, safety and security at home and abroad, and a commitment to building a better America.\u201d Biden wants to reduce the US deficit. He also wants to increase funding for police and increase defense spending. Good Monday morning, US politics live blog readers, there\u2019s a lively day and week ahead in American political news and we\u2019ll bring you all the developments as they happen. The Guardian is also running a global news blog on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, so while we\u2019ll cover many US political aspects of that war here for round-the-clock news and what\u2019s happening on the ground, please follow that here. Here\u2019s what\u2019s in store in US politics today: Joe Biden will unveil his multi-trillion dollar blueprint for the US budget for 2022-2023, including a proposal for a billionaire minimum income tax, reportedly starting at 20% on households worth more than $100m. The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection is set to begin proceedings towards holding in criminal contempt of Congress two of Donald Trump\u2019s most senior White House advisers, Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro. The committee is also expected to discuss the matter of whether to call Ginni Thomas, wife of US supreme court Justice Clarence Thomas, in for questioning over last week\u2019s report that she exchanged text messages with Donald Trump\u2019s then chief of staff Mark Meadows urging efforts to overturn the Republican president\u2019s defeat by Biden in the 2020 election. Most Americans are at least somewhat worried that the US will be drawn directly into Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and fear the use of nuclear weapons, a new poll shows. The Senate judiciary committee will begin considering Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s nomination to the supreme court, following her confirmation hearing last week, with a vote expected next week."

            "content": "GET INTERIM \u2026 Astronomers have recently become fascinated with FRB 121102. That\u2019s the name given to a mysterious burst of radio-wave activity in space. It follows a repeating pattern: silence for 67 days, then several rapid spurts of excitement before another bout of nothingness. One theory is that the radio waves indicate the presence of a dwarf galaxy three billion light years away; another is that they are simply reflecting the recent pattern of play from a more familiar celestial body, Cristiano Ronaldo. The Fiver doesn\u2019t know what to think. That\u2019s OK, we have Tin. Anyway, it\u2019s not up to us to figure out how long the 37-year-old\u2019s bursts of activity can last these days and whether, following Saturday\u2019s otherworldly hat-trick against the Harry Has-Been Team, he should be deployed from the start in Tuesday\u2019s Big Cup showdown with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. That\u2019s a decision for Ralf Rangnick. The Fiver doesn\u2019t know what to think about Rangnick. That\u2019s OK, we have Tin. What we can say for sure is that the German has already pulled off one brilliant feat at Old Trafford by negotiating a deal whereby if he does a good job as interim manager, he could become the full-time manager \u2013 and if he does a bad job as manager, he could become the full-time manager\u2019s boss. That\u2019s some top, top politics! In fairness to Rangnick, he has only lost three of 19 matches in charge and there have been no humiliations quite like the ones endured by his predecessors, such as the 4-1 slippering by Watford or the 6-1 whipping by Spurs. And the first leg of the tie with Atl\u00e9tico yielded one of United\u2019s best results under him, a 1-1 draw that leaves the contest right in the balance. So maybe he really could oversee an unlikely triumph, even if the deal he wangled is one of the reasons why it wouldn\u2019t be right to class him alongside Tony Barton or Roberto Di Matteo. Or maybe, given how well this side tends to cope when the pressure is on, that epochal humiliation is coming real soon. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt is important for the competition that the match against Middlesbrough goes ahead, however it is with extreme reluctance that we are asking the FA board to direct that the game be played behind closed doors for matters of sporting integrity\u201d \u2013 never underestimate football\u2019s ability to misread a room after Chelsea call for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final on Teesside to be played without fans. Remarkable. Boro\u2019s response? \u201cGiven the reasons for these sanctions, for Chelsea to seek to invoke sporting \u2018integrity\u2019 as reason for the game being played behind closed doors is ironic in the extreme.\u201d RECOMMENDED LOOKING Here\u2019s David Squires on \u2026 another festival of edification for English football. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Get your ears around the latest Football Weekly podcast. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: Gordon Lee (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). It was Duncan McKenzie who teased the Everton boss, not Malcolm Macdonald. Or so Duncan told me when I interviewed him for the NME in the late-70s, after he\u2019d left Goodison for Blackeye Rovers. He was a funny lad, and evidently still amused by Mr Lee\u2019s team talks\u201d \u2013 Monty Smith (and others). \u201cHaving not seen Mr Roy\u2019s new eyewear, I dutifully clicked on the link to the Watford Observer article (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) where my eye was immediately caught by the avatar of senior sport reporter Ryan Gray sporting an England football top. It immediately occurred to me that Big Website\u2019s roster of top journalism talent should do the same to demonstrate their commitment to and undying love for their chosen sport. I look forward to the day when Fiver writers showcase their finely-honed physiques in tight-fitting, overpriced club merchandise\u201d \u2013 Andrew Parker. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mr Roy would appreciate the literary allusion of him being the second coming of WB Yeats (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). From his poetry, it would appear that Yeats was a football fan, quite possibly an Evertonian: \u2018Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world\u2019\u201d \u2013 Matt Emerson. \u201cAlthough I appreciated the photo of \u2018the Budapest Baggio\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs), is there any way we can see a picture of the look on the face of a certain Jonathan Wilson, from elsewhere in your parish, when he hears that particular sobriquet?\u201d \u2013 Christopher Smith. \u201cThe people of Bury, so cruelly deprived of their football team, will not be denied the opportunity to call Callum Styles \u2018the Bury Baggio\u2019 rather than \u2018the Budapest Baggio\u2019. We already have Kieran \u2018Bury Beckham\u2019 Trippier. At this rate we\u2019ll soon have a full XI of Bury-born namesakes. Maybe they could put on an exhibition game of some sort to save Gigg Lane\u201d \u2013 Tom Dowler. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for wit among the Bono- and U2-related correspondence (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), but I still haven\u2019t found what I\u2019m looking for\u201d \u2013 Martin Leaver. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019 the day is \u2026 Matt Emerson. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Finally, someone at Everton has picked up three points. Unfortunately, Dominic Calvert-Lewin has also been fined for driving his Lamborghini at 58mph in a 50 zone. Manchester City\u2019s goalless draw at Crystal Palace has thrown the Premier League title race wide open \u2013 though Pep Guardiola never considered it over. \u201cWith 14 points [Liverpool] had played two games less,\u201d he said. \u201cFewer,\u201d parped The Fiver. Amazingly, some good news: Christian Eriksen is back in the Denmark squad for the first time since his cardiac arrest at Euro Not 2020. Godspeed. The Glazer family are considering revamping Old Trafford \u2013 and may knock the whole thing down \u2013 although have yet to share how they plan on getting fans to pay for it. While Diego Simeone is famously receptive to new ideas, he plans to keep faith with his old methods for Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Big Cup visit. \u201cEveryone has their own opinion [about styles] and we all try to do the best we can for the club we\u2019re at with the characteristics of the players we have,\u201d he tooted. And Bangkok FC player Aitsaret Noichaiboon has been sacked after retaliating to a petulant kick from North Bangkok University\u2019s Supasan Ruangsuphanimit with a vicious elbow to the face. STILL WANT MORE? Richard Foster reports on Grenfell Athletic, a team set up in the tragic aftermath of the 2017 tower-block fire.

Your editorial (23 March) draws attention to the fact that humanitarian assistance cannot substitute for a functioning economy. The humanitarian pledging conference will almost certainly not discuss the simple measure that would enable the money donated for Afghanistan to be used effectively. Allowing the Afghan central bank to draw down modest amounts \u2013 some $150m monthly \u2013 from reserves totalling over $9bn held in US and European banks would revive the banking system and facilitate the payment of bills and salaries. It would also allow humanitarian aid to be administered effectively. That this will not even be discussed at the conference is a scandal. Governments have allowed the impression to take hold that enabling the central bank to draw on its reserves would confer legitimacy on the Taliban administration. This shows blind disregard for the suffering of millions of ordinary Afghans. If the Afghan funds in US banks have been tied up in legal knots, then those in two German banks and the Bank for International Settlements should be released under international monitoring. If the Taliban interfere in this arrangement, it can be suspended. Governments should put compassion before politics and allow Afghans to benefit from a functioning banking system.

            "date": "2022-03-12T17:21:01Z",
            "content": "The US supreme court could \u201cat some point\u201d become \u201ccompromised\u201d by politics, said Clarence Thomas \u2013 one of six conservatives on the nine-member court after Republicans denied Barack Obama a nomination then rammed three new justices through during the hard-right presidency of Donald Trump. \u201cYou can cavalierly talk about packing or stacking the court,\u201d said Thomas, whose wife, Ginni Thomas, has come under extensive scrutiny for work for rightwing groups including supporting Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn an election. \u201cYou can cavalierly talk about doing this or doing that. At some point the institution is going to be compromised.\u201d Thomas was speaking at a hotel in Salt Lake City on Friday. \u201cBy doing this,\u201d he said, \u201cyou continue to chip away at the respect of the institutions that the next generation is going to need if they\u2019re going to have civil society.\u201d The court is set to rule this year on divisive issues including abortion, gun control, the climate crisis and voting rights. Conservative victories are expected. The conservative-dominated court has already ruled against the Biden administration on coronavirus mitigation and other matters. The US constitution does not mandate that the court consist of nine justices. Some progressives and Democratic politicians have therefore called to expand it, in order to reset its ideological balance. Democrats in Congress last year introduced a bill to add four justices and Joe Biden has created a commission to study expansion. Few analysts think expansion is likely to happen. Republican senators are currently attacking Biden for his campaign promise to nominate a first Black woman to the court, a promise he fulfilled by nominating Ketanji Brown Jackson to replace the retiring Stephen Breyer. Republican presidents have nominated justices on grounds of identity, most recently when Trump said he would pick a woman to replace Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the liberal lion who died in September 2020. Ignoring their own claims about the impropriety of confirmations in election years, made in denying Merrick Garland even a hearing to replace Antonin Scalia in 2016, Senate Republicans installed Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline Catholic conservative, as Ginsberg\u2019s replacement. In Utah on Friday, Thomas also voiced a familiar conservative complaint about so-called \u201ccancel culture\u201d, the supposed silencing of voices or world views deemed unacceptable on political grounds. He was, he said, \u201cafraid, particularly in this world of cancel culture attack, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to learn to engage as we did when I grew up. \u201cIf you don\u2019t learn at that level in high school, in grammar school, in your neighborhood, or in civic organizations, then how do you have it when you\u2019re making decisions in government, in the legislature, or in the courts?\u201d Thomas also attacked the media for, he said, cultivating inaccurate impressions about public figures including himself, his wife and Scalia. Ginni Thomas has faced scrutiny for her involvement in groups that file briefs about cases in front of the supreme court, as well as using Facebook to amplify partisan attacks. Thomas has claimed the supreme court is above politics \u2013 a claim made by justices on either side of the partisan divide. Congress is preparing for confirmation hearings for Jackson. She will be installed if all 50 Democratic senators back her, via the casting vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Some Republicans have indicated they could support her too. In Utah, Thomas recalled his own confirmation in 1991 as a humiliating and embarrassing experience. Lawmakers including Biden grilled Thomas about sexual harassment allegations from Anita Hill, a former employee, leading him to call the experience a \u201chigh tech lynching\u201d. Biden has also been criticised for his treatment of Hill. On Friday, Thomas said he held civility as one of his highest values. He said he learned to respect institutions and debate civilly with those who disagreed with him during his years in school. Based on conversations with students in recent years, he said, he does not believe colleges are now welcoming places for productive debate, particularly for students who support what he described as traditional families or oppose abortion. Thomas did not reference the future of Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision that guaranteed abortion rights. The court on which he sits is scheduled to rule this year on Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, concerning whether Mississippi can ban abortions at 15 weeks. The court is expected to overturn Roe. While the justices deliberate, conservative lawmakers in Florida, West Virginia and Kentucky are advancing similar legislation.

            "content": "Doubling down on his vow to vote for Donald Trump if he is the Republican nominee in 2024 despite writing in his new book that Trump is dangerously unsuited for the job, William Barr said: \u201cElections are binary choice, and unfortunately sometimes it\u2019s choosing the lesser of two evils.\u201d Speaking to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Trump\u2019s second attorney general added: \u201cI believe that the progressive wing of the Democratic party is dangerous for the United States.\u201d Barr also repeated that he would support another Republican if Trump does run in the primary again. In office, Barr was widely seen as too close to his hardline rightwing president, in particular over the Mueller report on Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. Differences over Trump\u2019s lies about electoral fraud prompted Barr\u2019s resignation, but not before he had used the Department of Justice to investigate such claims, a highly controversial move. In his new memoir, One Damned Thing After Another, Barr defends his record in office and some of Trump\u2019s, on traditional conservative issues like crime and immigration. He told NBC: \u201cI give him a lot of credit for identifying the key issues and having the gumption to press forward and accomplish a lot of good things \u2026 his combativeness worked for him in 2016 and partly while he was in office, breaking through the smothering hostility of the media. \u201cBut I tried to be balanced. I pointed out what I thought were his failings, and the fact that he went off the rails at the end.\u201d Barr left office before, on 6 January 2021, supporters Trump told to \u201cfight like hell\u201d in support of his lies stormed the US Capitol. A bipartisan Senate report said seven deaths were connected to the riot. On NBC, Barr was asked if he \u201creally think[s] the left in this country is somehow more dangerous than some issues around the world\u201d? \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI just said in terms of the leadership of the country, I think they would be a dangerous choice for the United States.\u201d He also said: \u201cI think there are a lot of American people right now that might prefer having [Trump] back in office than what we see under Biden.\u201d Trump is in legal jeopardy for his attempted electoral subversion as well as his business affairs but at a rally in South Carolina on Saturday night he hinted yet again at another White House run. Barr said he told Trump before his defeat by Biden that \u201chis personal behavior, his obnoxious behavior\u201d was turning voters off. \u201cI felt for a long time that he was going to lose the election,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI went in in April and told him that I thought he was going to lose the election. On election night, I felt he was going to lose. And I was actually surprised it was as close as it was.\u201d Biden beat Trump by more than 7m ballots in the popular vote and by 306-232 in the electoral college \u2013 a margin Trump called a landslide when it was in his favour over Hillary Clinton in 2016."

            "date": "2022-03-10T13:17:43Z",
            "content": "Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned a Russian attack on a children\u2019s hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol as evidence of \u201cgenocide\u201d as the US moved to drastically bolster support to the war-ravaged country with a $13.6bn aid package. The Ukrainian president shared video footage showing massive destruction at the hospital \u2013 a combined 600-bed complex with children\u2019s and maternity wards \u2013 in the southern port city that has been under relentless bombardment for nine days. \u201cA children\u2019s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them?\u201d said Zelenskiy on Telegram. \u201cHospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. The aerial bombing of a children\u2019s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.\u201d The White House condemned the attack as \u201cbarbaric\u201d while US House lawmakers voted to rush through a $13.6bn aid package that would increase military and humanitarian support to Ukraine and its European allies. The aid includes $6.5bn for the US costs of sending troops and weapons to eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there, and $6.8bn to care for refugees and provide economic support to allies. Senate approval is expected within days. The House also passed a bill banning Russia oil imports. US House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she talked to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for 45 minutes on Wednesday. She said they discussed the weapons and other assistance his country needs and \u201cthe crimes against humanity that [Vladimir] Putin is committing\u201d, including the maternity hospital air strike. \u201cThis is the beast that Putin is,\u201d Pelosi said. Pelosi indicated the $13.6bn US aid package was likely to be just the tip of a much broader aid effort. \u201cAll of us will have to do more\u201d to help Ukraine in coming weeks or months and over the long term to help it rebuild, Pelosi said, referring to the US and Nato allies. The US meanwhile warned Russia could be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in the war. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Russia had been making \u201cfalse claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine\u201d, and added that the allegations had been echoed in Beijing. \u201cNow that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,\u201d she tweeted. The concerns came as UK intelligence highlighted the strength of the Ukrainian resistance. In an update on Thursday, Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the large Russian column north-west of Kyiv had made \u201clittle progress in over a week\u201d and suffers continued losses at the hands of Ukraine forces. The MoD said there had been a noticeable drop in Russian air activity in recent days, likely due to the \u201cunexpected effectiveness\u201d of the Ukraine forces. It also said Russia has deployed conscript troops despite assurances from Putin not to do so. As the Russian president seeks to regain momentum, local authorities described the damage to the Mariupol hospital as \u201ccolossal\u201d and said women in labour were among the wounded. A local official said the attack injured at least 17 staff, though no deaths were immediately reported. Zelenskiy said the \u201cdirect strike by Russian troops\u201d had left children under the wreckage. The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said Mariupol was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s medieval,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pure genocide. The attack isn\u2019t simply treacherous. It\u2019s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.\u201d The Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials\u2019 accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. The Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as \u201capocalyptic\u201d, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. Zelenskiy compared the devastation and suffering there to that caused by the Nazis. Journalists have described corpses lying unburied in the streets and hungry residents breaking into stores in search of food, and melting snow for water while thousands sheltered in basements. The Russian army had also \u201cshot and bombed\u201d a humanitarian corridor agreed with Moscow and intended to allow civilians a safe route out, the deputy mayor of the city said, mined the road, and installed a checkpoint. Of an estimated 200,000 people desperate to leave, only 2,000 to 3,000 a day were able to. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy said at least 35,000 civilians were able to leave the cities of Sumy, Enerhodar and areas around Kyiv. He said he hoped the evacuations would continue on Thursday with three more routes set to open out of Mariupol, Volnovakha in the south-east and Izyum in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was \u201cat the maximum\u201d and again called on the west to impose a no-fly zone, saying it risked a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d if it did not. Speaking in Washington, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reiterated the Nato position that a no-fly zone would bring Nato into direct conflict with Russia. The conflict has also raised fears of a nuclear accident in a country with major nuclear plants and the site of the Chernobyl disaster. The UN\u2019s atomic watchdog said Wednesday it saw \u201cno critical impact on safety\u201d at Chernobyl, location of the world\u2019s worst nuclear disaster in 1986, despite a loss of power there. But it warned it was not receiving updates from either Chernobyl or Zaporizhzhia, Europe\u2019s largest nuclear plant, which is also now under Russian control. The UK said the Russians had confirmed the use of a thermobaric rocket system. The weapons, also known as vacuum bombs, suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. Three rounds of peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no progress, with Moscow continuing to insist Ukraine must \u201cdemilitarise\u201d and enshrine neutrality in its constitution before it halts what it calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d aimed at ensuring Russia\u2019s security. Moscow insisted on Wednesday it would prefer to reach its goals through negotiation. In other developments: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has landed in Turkey for the face-to-face talks on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the highest-level meeting between the two countries since Russia invaded. Kuleba warned in a Facebook video his expectations were \u201climited\u201d. So far, the parties have been engaged in lower-level talks in Belarus, largely over humanitarian issues and involving only Ukrainian officials. Leaders of the 27-nation EU are to meet in Versailles on Thursday and Friday. A draft declaration prepared for the summit said: \u201cRussia\u2019s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history.\u201d The leaders are expected to discuss reducing the bloc\u2019s energy dependency on Russia, and Ukraine\u2019s request to join the EU The US is weighing sanctions on nuclear power supplier Rosatom, a senior Biden administration official said on Wednesday. Nestle, cigarette maker Philip Morris and Sony on Wednesday joined the list of multinationals stepping back from the country. Agencies contributed to this report"

            "date": "2022-03-01T14:09:19Z",
            "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to the EU to \u201cprove that you are with us\u201d and help \u201clight win over darkness\u201d in a passionate address to the European parliament after Ukraine\u2019s membership application. In the speech made by videolink from Kyiv on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president said his people, including those killed by missile strikes on Tuesday in the country\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, were sacrificing their lives for European ideals in the fight against the invading Russian forces. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to break us. We\u2019re strong, we\u2019re Ukrainians. We have a desire to see our children alive, I think it is a fair one,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cWe are fighting for survival. We are fighting to be equal members of Europe.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are exactly the same as you are. So do prove that you are with us. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness. Glory be to Ukraine\u201d. The appeal came as France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, declared that the EU was \u201cwaging an all-out economic and financial war on Russia\u201d, describing the sanctions packages as proving \u201cextremely effective\u201d. He told France Info radio. \u201cWe will cause the collapse of the Russian economy.\u201d The comments drew an angry response from Russia\u2019s former president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the deputy chair of the security council of the Russian Federation. He tweeted: \u201cWatch your tongue, gentlemen! And don\u2019t forget that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones.\u201d In Geneva, a number of diplomats walked out of the room when Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, addressed the UN human rights council via a pre-recorded video message, after a similar boycott of his speech at the nearby Conference on Disarmament. Diplomats gathered outside the Conference on Disarmament hall in front of a Ukrainian flag and applauded loudly. The applause could be heard in the chamber where Lavrov\u2019s speech continued, with only a handful of ambassadors from countries including Yemen, Syria, Venezuela and Tunisia there to hear it. Ukraine\u2019s envoy to the EU on Tuesday formally handed over a request for membership of the European Union to the French ambassador, whose country holds the rolling presidency. Addressing MEPs, and Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, presidents of the European Commission and council respectively, Zelenskiy said the EU was \u201cgoing to be much stronger with us, that\u2019s for sure. Without you, Ukraine is going to be lonesome.\u201d The impassioned appeal received a cautiously positive welcome from the two leaders of the EU\u2019s institutions as they took the podium at the front of the parliament\u2019s hemicycle. \u201cThe council (of EU governments) will have to seriously look at the symbolic, political and legitimate request that has been made and make the appropriate choice in a determined and clear-headed manner,\u201d Michel said. Von der Leyen said there was a \u201clong path ahead\u201d. \u201cWe have to end this war,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we should talk about the next steps. But I am sure: nobody in this hemicycle can doubt that a people that stands up so bravely for our European values belongs in our European family.\u201d The path to membership will require the commission to give a positive assessment as to Ukraine\u2019s potential candidature, a process that can take up to 18 months. There would then be a transitional period of indefinite length during which Ukraine would need to adopt the entirety of EU law. Slovenia and Poland have called on EU member states to take \u201cquick and courageous decisions\u201d to ensure that Ukraine can join the EU by 2030. But there is some scepticism in other capitals about the wisdom of further expansion. Zelenskiy told MEPs he was speaking to them between Russian bombardments. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t read off the paper, off the sheet,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the time of paper in the life of my country has ended.\u201d Today would be the last for some of those fighting for Ukraine\u2019s freedom, he added. \u201cWe are giving away our best people, the strongest ones, the most value based ones\u201d. \u201cThis morning was a very tragic one for us: two cruise missiles hit Kharkiv, the city, which is located on the borders of the Russian Federation\u201d, he said. \u201cCan you imagine two cruise missiles hit Freedom Square? Dozens were killed. This is the price of freedom.\u201d"

            "title": "Peruvian court approves prison release of ex-president Alberto Fujimori",
            "date": "2022-03-17T20:44:38Z",
            "content": "Peru\u2019s constitutional court has approved the release from prison of former president Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for murder and corruption charges. Judge Eloy Espinosa-Saldana confirmed the 4-3 ruling in remarks broadcast on local channel Canal N. It was unclear when Fujimori could leave prison or if new legal challenges could halt the decision. The decision restored a humanitarian pardon granted to Fujimori on Christmas Eve in 2017 by then president Pablo Kuczynski. That pardon was overturned in 2018 when the supreme court ordered the former strongman returned to jail to serve out his sentence for human rights abuses. Kuczynski had said he pardoned Fujimori because he suffered a heart condition made worse by prison conditions, though the move was widely seen as an attempt to stave off impeachment by courting favor with Fujimori\u2019s allies in Congress. The pardon sparked protests across the country and Kuczynski resigned three months later. Fujimori, 83, governed between 1990 and 2000. His sentence was to end 10 February 2032. He remains a polarizing figure in Peru. Some Peruvians laud him for defeating the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement, while others loathe him for human rights violations carried out under his government. A former mathematics professor, Fujimori was a political outsider when he emerged from obscurity to win Peru\u2019s 1990 presidential election over writer Mario Vargas Llosa. Peru was being ravaged by runaway inflation and guerrilla violence when he took office. He quickly rebuilt the economy with mass privatizations of state industries. Defeating the fanatical Shining Path rebels took longer but his fight won him broad-based support. But his presidency collapsed just as dramatically as his rise to power. After briefly shutting down congress and putting himself into a third term, Fujimori fled the country in disgrace in 2000 after leaked videotapes showed his spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, bribing lawmakers. Fujimori went to Japan, his parents\u2019 homeland, and sent in his resignation by fax. Five years later, he stunned supporters and enemies alike when he flew to neighboring Chile, where he was arrested and extradited to Peru. Fujimori\u2019s goal was to run for Peru\u2019s presidency again in 2006, but instead he was put on trial. His daughter, Keiko Fujimori, was a presidential candidate last year and vowed to release him if she got elected. But Pedro Castillo defeated her in a runoff election. Fujimori also faced charges stemming from his role in a 1990s government program in which many Indigenous women in poor communities said they were forcibly sterilized and for the murder of six farmers by a military death squad during his administration."

            "title": "South Korea\u2019s poisonous gender politics a test for next president",
            "date": "2022-03-07T02:58:47Z",
            "content": "The identity of South Korea\u2019s next leader will be determined this week by the economy, housing prices and incomes, but the road to the presidential Blue House will also be dotted with the wreckage of the country\u2019s poisonous gender politics. The successor to Moon Jae-in, who is restricted by law to a single five-year term, will not be able to ignore the fallout from a campaign defined by the culture war being waged in the world\u2019s 10th-biggest economy. On one side, a feminist movement that led the Me Too movement in Asia; on the other, young men whose resistance to the modest gains made by South Korean women has been exploited by the two main candidates. In 2018, women took to the streets in record numbers to call for government action against an epidemic of molka \u2013 the use of spy cams to secretly film women, often in public toilets \u2013 and helped bring down several public figures, including a candidate for the presidency, for sexual misconduct. A year later, they helped overturn a decades-old ban on abortion, and shone a light into the darkest corners of an entrenched culture of male chauvinism, unequal pay and the expectation that their careers will end when they have children. Despite the global success of its pop music and TV dramas, South Korea continues to perform poorly in international comparisons of women\u2019s rights. The 2021 World Economic Forum global gender gap report ranks it 102 out of 156 countries in an index that examines jobs, education, health and political representation. South Korea has by far the largest gender pay gap among OECD countries, at about 32%, while women account for just over 19% of MPs in the national assembly. Only 5.2% of Korean conglomerates\u2019 board members are female, and experts say the country\u2019s record-low birthrate proves how difficult it is for its women to combine careers with family life. Women have responded by challenging social norms, from refusing to wear bras and publicly destroying their makeup collections to vowing never to marry or have children or, in some cases, have sex with men. Five years after its first female president, Park Geun-hye, went on trial on corruption charges, South Korea\u2019s election campaign has brought the anti-feminist backlash into sharp focus. Online \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d groups have condemned hiring quotas, while calls to abolish the ministry of gender equality and family \u2013 created in 2001 \u2013 have been seized on by the frontrunner. The anti-feminist movement\u2019s list of grievances includes the weighty subject of military service exemptions but often finds expression in vicious personal attacks on prominent women. They include An San, the triple Olympic archery gold medalist, who was abused during last summer\u2019s Tokyo 2020 Games simply for having short hair. Last year, South Korea\u2019s biggest convenience store pulled ads for sausages after a a so-called men\u2019s rights group complained that a promotional image \u2013 a hand gesture commonly used to indicate something small \u2013 had once been used by a feminist group to exploit male anxiety over penis size. The misogyny contagion spread to the country\u2019s politics late last year, when Cho Dong-youn, a military specialist, was forced to resign just three days after she had been appointed co-chair of the ruling Democratic party\u2019s election committee. Cho, a Harvard graduate with successful military and academic careers behind her, stepped down after a YouTube channel and broadcaster questioned her suitability for office. Her crime: having a child out of wedlock during her first marriage. As the campaign enters its final stages, the conservative People Power party candidate, Yoon Suk-yeol, and his ruling Democratic party rival, Lee Jae-myung, have been accused of pandering to sexism to win the votes of young men who regard women\u2019s advancement as a threat to their financial security, amid a bleak job market and rising living costs. Many resent having to do 18 months of military service, a requirement for all able-bodied Korean men aged 18-28, while women are exempt. Hong Eun-pyo, who runs an anti-feminist YouTube channel, has tried to justify the gender pay gap, insisting that men work longer hours and do more difficult jobs. \u201cIf [women] want to reach as high as their male peers and be paid the same wages, they should keep working and not get pregnant,\u201d he said. Yoon, a former prosecutor general, has accused the gender equality ministry of treating men like \u201cpotential sex criminals\u201d and has promised to introduce tougher penalties for false claims of sexual assault \u2013 a step campaigners say will deter even more women from coming forward. In addition, scrapping the gender ministry could weaken women\u2019s rights and \u201ctake a toll on democracy\u201d, said Chung Hyun-back, an academic who served as gender equality minister under Moon. Yoon, 61, is said to be heavily influenced by his party chairman, Lee Jun-seok, a 36-year-old Harvard graduate and \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d advocate who has criticised hiring targets for women and other female-friendly policies as \u201creverse discrimination\u201d, and described feminist politics as \u201cblowfish poison\u201d. Even Lee, the potential liberal successor to self-proclaimed feminist Moon, has said he opposes \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against men, and cancelled an interview with a media outlet because of its supposed feminist leanings. Although he opposes Yoon\u2019s plans to abolish the gender equality ministry, he wants to drop the word \u201cwomen\u201d from its official Korean-language title. By the weekend, Yoon had established a small lead over Lee, after Ahn Cheol-soo, a minor party candidate, withdrew from the race and threw his support behind the People Power candidate. According to a Realmeter poll published on Wednesday, 46.3% of respondents said they would vote for Yoon, with 43.1% backing Lee. While the two frontrunners go out of their way to avoid offending young male voters, women say the election has plunged South Korea back into the dark ages. \u201cWe are being treated like we don\u2019t even have voting rights,\u201d said Hong Hee-jin, a 27-year-old office worker in Seoul. \u201cPoliticians are taking the easy path. Instead of coming up with real policies to solve problems facing young people, they are fanning gender conflicts, telling men in their 20s that their difficulties are all down to women receiving too many benefits.\u201d Agencies contributed reporting"
