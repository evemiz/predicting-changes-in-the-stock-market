            "date": "2022-11-23T08:00:03Z",
            "content": "Some of the best-known corporations in the US, including AT&amp;T, Boeing, Delta Air Lines and the Home Depot, collectively poured more than $8m into supporting election deniers running for US House and Senate seats in this month\u2019s midterm elections. A study by the non-partisan government watchdog organization Accountable.US, based on the latest filings to the Federal Election Commission, reveals the extent to which big corporations were prepared to back Republican nominees despite their open peddling of false claims undermining confidence in democracy. Though many were ultimately unsuccessful in their election bids, the candidates included several prominent advocates of Donald Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from him. At the top of the list of 20 corporations backing election deniers through their political action committees (Pacs) is a familiar name in the world of rightwing agitating \u2013 Koch Industries. According to the Accountable.US review, the Koch energy conglomerate spent $771,000 through its Pac on Republican candidates with a track record of casting doubt on elections. Koch Industries is the second-largest privately owned company in the US. It is notorious for using its largely oil-related profits to push conservative politics in an anti-government, anti-regulatory direction under its owner brothers, Charles Koch and David Koch, the latter of whom died in 2019. Close behind Koch is the American Crystal Sugar Company Pac, which spent $630,000 supporting election deniers running for federal office; the AT&amp;T Inc Employee Federal Pac, which contributed $579,000; and the Home Depot Inc Pac, which gave $578,000. Lower down on the list comes the media giant Comcast Corporation &amp; NBC Universal Pac, which contributed $365,000; and the Delta Air Lines Pac, which gave $278,000. The $8m contributed by the top 20 corporations was just a slice of overall corporate giving to election deniers in the 2022 cycle. An earlier analysis by Accountable.US found that, in total, election deniers benefited to the tune of $65m from corporate interests. The new study suggests that top corporations that chose to use their financial muscle to enhance the chances of election deniers waged a non-too-successful gamble. The Washington Post has chronicled how 244 Republican election deniers ran for congressional seats in the midterms, and, of those, at least 81 were defeated. Kyle Herrig, president of Accountable.US, said that the fact that election deniers at both the federal and the state level struggled at the polls should make corporations reconsider their strategies. Backing candidates who advanced conspiracy theories harmful to democracy could damage their public reputations. \u201cVoters\u2019 rejection of numerous election objectors at the polls should send a clear message to corporations that prioritizing political influence over a healthy democracy could threaten their own bottom line,\u201d Herrig said. The Guardian reached out to several of the top 20 corporate donors for their response. The Home Depot said that its associate-funded Pac supports candidates \u201con both sides of the aisle who champion pro-business, pro-retail positions that create jobs and economic growth\u201d. AT&amp;T and Delta did not immediately reply. The decision to support election-denier candidates stands in contrast with the strong public stance initially taken by several of the corporations in the wake of the 6 January 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. Boeing released a statement days after the insurrection in which it said it \u201cstrongly condemns the violence, lawlessness and destruction that took place in the US Capitol\u201d. In the 2022 cycle the Boeing Company Pac contributed $418,000 to support Republican candidates who had been vocal in forwarding lies questioning the validity of the 2020 presidential election. Boeing declined to comment. Among the individual candidates whose bid for federal office was supported by top corporations was Derrick Van Orden, who won a close race to represent a swing district in Wisconsin with backing from Koch Industries. Van Orden, a former Navy Seal, was inside the Capitol grounds on January 6. Scott Perry received support from the Kochs, AT&amp;T, Boeing and other corporations in his successful campaign to hold onto his House seat in Pennsylvania. Perry was deeply involved in attempts to block Biden\u2019s victory in 2020, and in the weeks after January 6 sought a presidential pardon from Trump."

            "date": "2022-11-09T17:57:05Z",
            "content": "Voters have rejected some of the most visceral election deniers in the US, rejecting Republican supporters of Donald Trump\u2019s stolen election lie in several key races though some critical results have yet to be called. Democracy was on the ballot in the midterm elections, with avid participants in efforts to subvert the outcome of the 2020 presidential contest vying to gain control of how votes are conducted in their states. Several of those candidates fell short on the night. In Pennsylvania, Doug Mastriano, the Republican candidate for governor, was convincingly defeated by his Democratic rival Josh Shapiro. Mastriano acted as Trump\u2019s front person in the state in attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential result and was present at the US Capitol on the day of the January 6 insurrection. Pennsylvania\u2019s governor has considerable powers over elections as they choose who will be the secretary of state \u2013 the top voting official. Several other races for secretary of state were among the most closely watched this cycle, given the prospect of anti-democratic candidates seizing control over voting procedures. That scenario has prompted jitters ahead of the 2024 presidential race in which Trump has indicated he wants to stand again. In Michigan, all three Democrats running for statewide office beat Republicans who questioned the 2020 election results. Governor Gretchen Whitmer was re-elected to a second term over Tudor Dixon, who declined to say Joe Biden won the state in 2020. Michigan\u2019s attorney general, Dana Nessel, also won re-election, defeating Matthew DePerno, a lawyer who became a key player in spreading election misinformation after the 2020 election. In an election night speech, Whitmer said the results affirmed \u201cfacts over lies and democracy over fascism\u201d. Jocelyn Benson, Michigan\u2019s current secretary of state who staunchly defended the 2020 election results, defeated Kristina Karamo, who rose to national prominence after she spread false claims about fraud in the Detroit count. \u201cWell, well, well, democracy has prevailed,\u201d Benson said as she took the stage at a Democratic victory party in downtown Detroit in the early hours of Wednesday. \u201cToday Michigan voters showed the world that they will vote for truth over lies, facts over conspiracy theories, real results over empty promises.\u201d Election deniers also lost races to be the top election official in New Mexico and Minnesota. The initial flurry of results will be met with relief from pro-democracy groups and election experts with some of the most potentially dystopian outcomes being averted. However, several races that have attracted much concern have yet to be finalized. Arizona has become the ground zero of election denial in the US since the eruption of toxic tussles over its 2020 count, and Mark Finchem, a state lawmaker, has become a national embodiment of the threat. On Wednesday morning Finchem\u2019s battle to become Arizona\u2019s secretary of state remained too close to call. With 62% of the vote counted, he was on 47% to his Democratic rival Adrian Fontes\u2019s 53%. Finchem spearheaded attempts to block the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory in 2020 and was at the US Capitol behind the barricades on January 6. Kari Lake, a former Phoenix area Fox TV anchor and another acerbic election denier, remained neck-and-neck with her Democratic rival Katie Hobbs in Arizona\u2019s gubernatorial race. Lake is among several Republican candidates who have hinted that they might not accept the results of their elections should they lose. In an echo of the volatile events of 2020, the outcome of Arizona\u2019s statewide contests may depend on legal challenges in Maricopa county, the most populous part of the state. Equipment problems were reported with vote counting machines and the Republican National Committee has launched a lawsuit which Lake and the Republican candidate for US Senate Blake Masters have joined. Another prominent election denier, Jim Marchant, is bidding for the secretary of state position in Nevada. Marchant, who has close ties to influential figures in the racist conspiracy theory QAnon, was tied with his Democratic rival Cisco Aguilar with 72% of the count done. There were further signs of voters growing alert to the Trump-inspired threat to democracy in other polls held on Tuesday. In a ballot measure, Michigan voters decided to bake into the state constitution an amendment that significantly expands voting access and makes it harder for partisan actors to overturn elections. It marked the first time the ballot initiative process had been used to explicitly counter attempts to overturn elections. But the longtime consequences of Trump\u2019s willingness to subvert the legitimate results of an election for personal political gain remain a danger. A survey by the New York Times found that by Wednesday morning some 210 Republicans who actively questioned the 2020 election result had won congressional or state races."

            "date": "2022-11-09T07:19:51Z",
            "content": "Before the first polls closed in Virginia and Georgia, CNN\u2019s John King stood in front of his infamous magic board to plead with viewers to avoid unconfirmed news: \u201cStay off social media, folks.\u201d Jake Tapper, who took over Wolf Blitzer\u2019s usual duties after a last-minute switch up, let out an uneasy laugh. Then King made a case for CNN\u2019s frantic coverage of 2022\u2019s midterm season: \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to figure out \u2018are there really issues with voting\u2019, trust your local officials and trust us here,\u201d he said. It was a line that conservative pundits would jump on as fear-mongering. (\u201cCNN in Panic mode,\u201d Turning Point USA\u2019s Benny Johnson tweeted.) Moments later, Tapper stood in front of a gigantic countdown screen, the much-less-fun cousin of Times Square\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve clock. A bold number 1 blazed across the screen in red. It represented the only seat Republicans needed to pick up to win back power in the Senate. The screaming, Super Bowl-esque graphic reminded us that cable news coverage of midterm results was back in all its frenetic excess. Such breathless, wall-to-wall coverage is enough to give anyone election stress. The New York Times suggested to its readers \u201cevidence-based strategies that can help you cope\u201d with the effects of doom-scrolling. It was helpful, if a bit unsettling, advice. \u201cBreathe like a baby,\u201d said one step. \u201cFocus on expanding your belly when you breathe, which can send more oxygen to the brain.\u201d Another tip skewed more Wim Hof: \u201cPlunge your face into a bowl with ice water for 10 to 30 seconds.\u201d Readers who came up for air would be rewarded with MSNBC\u2019s \u201cKornacki Cam\u201d, a loop that played in the corner of TV screens during commercials. It showed live, behind-the-scenes shots of the fan-favorite national reporter Steve Kornacki, only partially aware that he was being filmed. Kornacki took water breaks, had one-way conversations with his interactive district map, and gave viewers the perfect shot of his geek-chic brown khakis. Those pants, his beloved trademark, earned him a spot on People\u2019s Sexiest Men list in 2020. They remained a rare highlight of our fractured democratic process. \u201cHappy Steve Kornacki day for those who celebrate,\u201d read one tweet. As the reporter rifled through his notes on screen, another fan wrote, \u201cSteve Kornacki finding his documents during this stressful race is extremely relatable.\u201d Kornacki\u2019s data-driven approach represented to some a bastion of stability on otherwise crazed election nights. But head over to the rightwing outlet Newsmax, and things were a little more unpredictable: especially when Donald Trump took a moment to call in. The former president teased a \u201cbig announcement\u201d he plans to make at Mar-a-Lago on 15 November. This appears to be a thinly veiled promise of a 2024 election run. But why wait a week? Trump said he didn\u2019t want to \u201ctake away\u201d from the significance of election night \u2013 specifically, JD Vance\u2019s Ohio Senate race \u2013 but he seemed to be doing just that by opening his mouth. On Fox News, Tucker Carlson repeated conservative concerns about voter fraud and election integrity. \u201cWe\u2019re not really serious about democracy if we\u2019re using electronic voting machines,\u201d he said. Cable news producers have to fill their seven-hour-long slots with something, even if it\u2019s a whole lot of nothing. At about 9pm on Tuesday, as some polls were closing but results were not yet in, Savannah Guthrie and Lester Holt tried to stay cheery as they talked through a list of tight gubernatorial races. \u201cStop me if you\u2019ve heard this before: too early to call,\u201d Guthrie said. Pundits also found humor in the triumph of Maxwell Frost, the night\u2019s youngest winner and the first Gen Z member of Congress. Frost, who will represent Florida, is 25 years old. \u201cThat means he was born in 1997,\u201d MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said as her fellow anchors laughed in disbelief. \u201cI literally have liquor older than him.\u201d When the Republican surge some had predicted failed to materialize, MSNBC hosts started patting each other on the back. \u201cI looked at you weird earlier when you said Joe Biden was going to be one of the most successful presidents ever as measured by the midterm performance of his party,\u201d Rachel Maddow said to her colleague Lawrence O\u2019Donnell. \u201cI owe you not an apology, but a tepid climb-back.\u201d On Fox News, Karl Rove was wistfully talking about the hinterlands of Georgia with votes still to report, but there was a clear sense that things weren\u2019t quite going to plan any more."

            "date": "2022-11-07T18:39:01Z",
            "content": "The admission by the Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin that he has interfered in US elections and would continue doing so in future, is both unsurprising \u2013 not least because it has long been known to be true \u2013 and, perhaps, not to be taken entirely at face value. While it is the first such admission from a figure who has been formally accused by Washington over Moscow\u2019s efforts to influence American politics the timing of Prigozhin\u2019s comments ahead of the midterm elections are also significant. In comments posted by the press service of his Concord catering firm on Russia\u2019s Facebook equivalent VKontakte, Prigozhin said: \u201cWe have interfered [in US elections], we are interfering and we will continue to interfere. Carefully, accurately, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do.\u201d US prosecutors have previously alleged that Concord had funded an operation that had promoted Donald Trump during the 2016 US elections \u2013 an allegation which Prigozhin and the company strongly denied. But the public statement underlines the point of such interference operations \u2013 a point that is sometimes misunderstood. Put simply, a key point of Russian hybrid warfare \u2013 with its focus on political interference \u2013 is that it does not necessarily matter whether the interference actually succeeds in any meaningful way. Instead, a significant part of its function is actively to sow distrust about the health of democratic institutions \u2013 not least by suggesting an outsized reach and capability. By saying he is continuing to interfere \u2013 a day before the US midterm elections \u2013 he appears to be trying to shape the idea that the results cannot be trusted. And the public nature of his statement suggests that there may be other agendas at work than simply his feelings of enjoying impunity. Known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d because his catering company operates Kremlin contracts, the former convict has long been accused of sponsoring operations that seek to influence western politics and spread disinformation across the globe, attracting international sanctions. That has seen social media companies, including Meta and Twitter, move against Prigozhin\u2019s internet operations in Africa, which saw Facebook remove fake Prigozhin-linked accounts that have promoted Russian policies aimed Central African Republic and, to a lesser extent, Madagascar, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique and South Africa. In July, the US state department offered a reward of up to $10m for information on Prigozhin in connection with \u201cengagement in US election interference\u201d. This came after a 2020 report by US Senate intelligence committee which described how Russian operatives had worked online to disrupt the 2016 election. \u201cMasquerading as Americans, these operatives used targeted advertisements, intentionally falsified news articles, self-generated content and social-media platform tools to interact with and attempt to deceive tens of millions of social-media users in the United States,\u201d it said. However, in 2018 US Cyber Command claimed to have knocked Russian operatives offline during the 2018 US congressional elections, raising questions over the scale and impact of Moscow\u2019s continuing efforts. Prighozin\u2019s latest comments come as the previously publicity-shy Putin confidant has chosen to come out of the shadows in recent months. One possibility is that Prigozhin\u2019s remarks should be seen as part of his efforts to position himself in a more formal role in Vladimir Putin\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine in alliance with a faction of hardliners who blame Russian generals for bungling the prosecution of the war. But efforts being led by Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner Group mercenaries around the key Donbas town of Bakhmut are not much more impressive than Russia\u2019s conventional military and they have made imperceptibly slow progress. It is possible that Prigozhin himself needs to claim a success on the hybrid warfare front as his own fighting force has visibly underperformed. What is clear, however, is that, after years of denying his involvement with Wagner and with influence operations \u2013 to the point of pursuing journalists through the courts \u2013 Prigozhin now sees it more useful to emphasise his claimed usefulness to Putin in public. Or, just perhaps, he has done so with an eye to whoever might follow Putin."

            "date": "2022-11-08T07:02:43Z",
            "content": "\u201cI read this book called The Dictator\u2019s Handbook, and if Trump could read, I\u2019d have said he was going word-for-word from this book.\u201d I\u2019m talking with artist Phil Buehler, who recently installed a 50ft long banner called the Wall of Liars and Deniers, centered around Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig lie\u201d that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Comprised of the tens of thousands of lies Donald Trump has made since being elected president, and culminating in Trump\u2019s big lie, the project\u2019s aim is to break through the desensitization that has inevitably set in after years of wall-to-wall coverage of Trump\u2019s political career. \u201cIt\u2019s really corrosive on our democratic system, that people stop believing in free and fair elections,\u201d said Buehler. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a danger to our democracy.\u201d The Wall of Liars and Deniers is a successor to another wall of Trump lies that Buehler created and installed in summer 2020. Buehler\u2019s earlier project was called the Wall of Lies, and it documented some 30,000 lies Trump told while in office \u2013 it was an offshoot of a plan to spend a week reading out all of Trump\u2019s lies on Radio Free Brooklyn that had been shelved due to the Covid pandemic. The eventual 50ft Wall of Lies, installed on an unassuming street in Bushwick, became the center of much fanfare, even drawing at least one major politician. \u201cWe set up to do a live radio broadcast on the street as people came up to the wall. This old guy comes up, leans over, says \u2018who\u2019s in charge here?\u2019 It was Chuck Schumer! I look around, there\u2019s all these black cars and Secret Service around. He was looking for his own name, certain that it must be there somewhere.\u201d The original Wall of Lies looked a little like a pixelated abstract painting, with each color-coded lie comprising its own little rectangle. It towered well above the heads of onlookers, who would spend time poring over the lies and taking photos of them. Eventually it was vandalized with graffiti attributed to the Proud Boys, including the slogans \u201cVote Trump or Die\u201d and \u201cStand Back &amp; Stand By\u201d, which Trump famously said to the Boys during the 2020 presidential debates when asked to distance himself from the hate group. Resembling Trump\u2019s lies themselves, the new Wall of Liars and Deniers is recursive in nature: it\u2019s a reproduction of the original Wall of Lies, shot through with a fat white band with big block capitals in gray spelling \u201cLIARS AND DENIERS\u201d, comprised of all the lies Trump and others have made in service to the big lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. It was important to Buehler that this new wall feature not just lies made by Trump himself but also those made by others in support of his big lie. \u201cI really wanted to highlight the hundreds of deniers who are running for election,\u201d Buehler said. Many of the lies collected on the wall amaze for their sheer audacity. There\u2019s Trump ally Rudy Giuliani confidentially asserting that votes in the 2020 election were counted by Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. There\u2019s Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, wife of supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, calling the 2020 election \u201cthe greatest heist of our history\u201d. And of course there is Trump himself with his oft-repeated lie \u201cI won twice,\u201d despite in fact being routed by a good 7m votes in 2020 by Joe Biden. Buehler sees Trump\u2019s bie lie as emerging from the thousands of individual lies that former president was permitted to make while in office. Arguing that Trump\u2019s big lie has endangered American democracy because it has become \u201ca litmus test for any Republican running for office\u201d, Buehler sees it as radiating all throughout our political system, corroding everything around it. \u201cThese people have internalized that they can just keep saying these things. It\u2019s turning the Republican party into a bunch of opportunists. That\u2019s who Trump is attracting, the biggest opportunists out there, this whole generation of opportunists.\u201d Buehler hopes that in seeing the lies laid out there, voters will be able to overcome their sense of desensitization and reclaim a sense of shock and outrage. \u201cIn some ways, seeing it is believing,\u201d he said. \u201c30,000 is just a number. Like Stalin said, one death is a tragedy, 10m is a statistic. Remember when just one lie from a politician would make the news? It\u2019s kind of meaningless now. People can\u2019t catch Trump on things because people don\u2019t care any more. But when you see the wall, it\u2019s a dramatic display of the enormity of it.\u201d In addition to a tool to help restore some of the shock value of Trump\u2019s lies, Buehler\u2019s Wall of Lies and Wall of Liars and Deniers have become places of community processing and connection. Buehler stated that lots of people come up and tell him \u201cthank you\u201d and share feelings of anxiety around the election and the enormous numbers of voters who believe Trump\u2019s big lie that the election was stolen. \u201cSomeone told me, \u2018you hear about the big lie, but when you see how many people are spreading it, and on top of all the other lies Trump told, it hits you in a new way. You\u2019re not just reading it, it\u2019s visualized, that brings it to the forefront.\u2019\u201d As Buehler sees it, if there\u2019s any silver lining to the emergence of Trump as a political force, it\u2019s that his presidency has shaken off a sense of complacency. As evidence, he points to the art world, which he says has become much more political since Trump came into office. Buehler also believes that the generation that came of age during Trump has been permanently changed. \u201cThis has impacted a whole generation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is here forever, this concern about how our country can get hijacked.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-06T12:00:19Z",
            "content": "The man who could save free and fair elections in Nevada was rushing to finish his breakfast. No one seemed to notice him. It was this anonymity that belied the weight on the shoulders of Cisco Aguilar, a 45-year-old cherub-faced lawyer who is running to be Nevada\u2019s top election official. Aguilar, a Democrat, is in the final stretch of the secretary of state race against Jim Marchant, a former Nevada lawmaker who has been one of the most prominent leaders of a movement to question the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. If elected Nevada\u2019s top election official, Marchant, a Republican who is linked to the QAnon movement, has pledged that he and other like-minded secretaries will \u201cfix\u201d the country and secure a Donald Trump victory in 2024. He has also said elections in Nevada are run by \u201ca cabal\u201d and that Nevadans haven\u2019t really elected a candidate for office since 2006. And he\u2019s fueled distrust of voting equipment in the state, pushing rural Nevada counties to adopt costly and time-consuming hand counts of ballots. Recent polls have showed the race is extremely close. The contest in Nevada is one of several nationally that include candidates who have spread baseless conspiracy theories while running to be secretaries of state. Those offices have long been overlooked as inconsequential, but they play an enormous role in overseeing how elections are run and votes are counted. If Marchant and similar candidates win in states like Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 all key battleground states \u2013 there are deep concerns they could use their positions to try to block anyone who defeats Trump, presumably running for president in 2024, from taking office. Aguilar previously worked for tennis star Andre Agassi\u2019s charitable foundation and the Nevada Athletic Commission, but has never run for public office before. On the campaign trail, he doesn\u2019t quite have the formal polish of a politician. He\u2019s still getting used to occasionally getting recognized \u2013 when he\u2019s wearing suits, that is (his preferred footwear still appears to be colorful Nikes). He\u2019s also getting used to speaking to large crowds. \u201cI hate this,\u201d he said, after addressing thousands at a packed rally headlined by Barack Obama. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t scare anyone up there.\u201d But when he talks about the stakes of this election, his tone is serious. \u201cWe may end up with somebody who we didn\u2019t elect president as president,\u201d Aguilar said at breakfast. \u201cMarchant has stood on stage, standing next to Donald Trump, and said, \u2018If I am secretary of state, Donald Trump will be the president in \u201924,\u2019 unequivocally. And to hear somebody make such an absolute statement, without truly understanding what the will of the voters is, is scary. It\u2019s extremism at its greatest.\u201d Asked whether he expected Marchant to concede the race if he loses, Aguilar said he didn\u2019t know. \u201cThat\u2019s the least of my worries. He\u2019s not a serious candidate, but the threat he represents is extreme. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting \u2026 the threat he represents,\u201d he said. Election denialism is elsewhere on the ballot in Nevada. Adam Laxalt, a Republican in a tight race for the US Senate, was Trump\u2019s campaign co-chair in Nevada, spread election misinformation and helped lead legal efforts to try to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state. That severe threat to democracy is part of the pitch Barack Obama and Elizabeth Warren made to voters when they traveled here in the campaign\u2019s final days to campaign for Aguilar and other Democrats in close races. \u201cCisco\u2019s opponent wants to make it harder to vote. He\u2019s trying to one-up all the Republicans trying to peddle lies about the 2020 election by saying all elections in Nevada for the last 15 years have been fake. Really?\u201d Obama said at the rally in North Las Vegas. \u201cVote for somebody like Cisco, who believes that every vote should count. Full stop. Shouldn\u2019t be a radical idea.\u201d It\u2019s a theme that resonates with voters like Helga Lott, an 80-year-old retiree in Las Vegas. Standing on her porch one afternoon, she said that threats to democracy were \u201cthe only issue\u201d in this election. \u201cThis time around we have to vote Democratic no matter what. The democracy is at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you get Republicans into the state government, they control the elections, and then they can do what Trump has been trying to do for two years. \u201cEven if the secretary of state were not to my liking right now, I could not vote for a Republican. You can\u2019t vote for anybody who was an election denier who says it was stolen,\u201d she added. Despite that imminent danger, Aguilar acknowledged it can be difficult to get voters to pay attention to a secretary of state election. A number of Nevada Democrats are in highly competitive races this year, including contests for the US Senate and governor\u2019s seat. Aguilar\u2019s campaign has raised $2.3m \u2013 four times what Marchant has raised \u2013 but a small sum compared with that of a gubernatorial or senatorial contest. His campaign has three full-time staffers. \u201cFrom a very selfish perspective, I wish people were more engaged in the secretary of state\u2019s race. But we\u2019ve also had some amazing support as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have the resources that the governor and the senator have, but we know the reality of the situation. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had to work double-hard to continue to raise the resources we need to fight the battle we want to fight.\u201d Kevin Sebastian, 32, said he hadn\u2019t had much of a chance to pay close attention to the secretary of state\u2019s race, but he was concerned about the potential for a stolen election. \u201cThe bald-faced sort of denial of something that\u2019s been verified, it makes me think about ideas about truth, ideas about trust. It makes me concerned about how people view information,\u201d he said. One of the groups supporting Aguilar is the powerful local culinary union, which has been deploying canvassers on behalf of Democratic candidates. After hearing Aguilar speak briefly at their union hall on Tuesday, two of those canvassers, Rawanda Rogers, a guest room attendant at a hotel, and her son Amari Bryant, 18, knocked on doors in a quiet neighborhood on the east side of Las Vegas, making sure people had a plan to vote. After about an hour of canvassing, Bryant questioned how anyone could believe the election was stolen. \u201cWe work for it, like you see now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting in the work.\u201d Marchant and his campaign did not respond to several inquiries. But a vision of what elections could look like if Marchant is elected is already playing out in Nye county, a rural area of about 53,000 people and 34,000 active registered voters that Trump won easily in 2020. Earlier this year, Marchant appeared at a county meeting and convinced the commissioners to count their ballots by hand, falsely saying the machines could not be trusted. Experts have long warned that hand counts are less reliable than machine counts, take longer and are more costly. When the count began in late October, things did not go smoothly. There were numerous mismatched counts that had to be reconciled and a worker bemoaned that it took two hours to get through 50 ballots, according to the Associated Press. An observer from the ACLU was escorted out by an armed volunteer. The Nevada supreme court and secretary of state\u2019s office quickly stopped the effort, saying it ran afoul of Nevada law preventing the disclosure of election results before the polls close. \u201cThere are 60 random people touching my ballot and calling out who I voted for and I am livid,\u201d said Catherine Lilly, 57, who runs a pest control company. Outside of an early voting site in Pahrump, a desert town about an hour outside Las Vegas, some Nye county residents said a hand count was necessary to prevent cheating. Among them was Richard McDonough, a retired handyman, who said a hand count was needed \u201cto prevent the theft of an election\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to cheat with a hand count,\u201d he said, adding that he had been following news of the count on the far-right news networks like One America News, Real America\u2019s Voice and Newsmax. \u201cThe machines are criminal. They\u2019re produced by criminals, criminals buy them, criminals force us to use them.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see a problem with [a hand count]. It\u2019s less chance of somebody messing with it. Too many scammers, spammers, all those people that are trying to screw with things electronically,\u201d said Mike Zaman, 69. \u201cAs long as somebody\u2019s watching over them. People are watching the people that are counting.\u201d Tricia Martin, a high school social studies teacher, said she wasn\u2019t necessarily opposed to a hand count if it gave more people confidence in the results. \u201cI think if it makes people feel more secure that what\u2019s going on is decent and good, it\u2019s all right,\u201d she said. \u201cMy concern is just the naysayers that the minute they don\u2019t win, then it\u2019s sour grapes.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-06T03:19:51Z",
            "content": "A Boeing 757 plane halted on the runway with \u201cTrump\u201d emblazoned on the side in giant gold letters. Loudspeakers boomed Elvis Presley\u2019s Dixie, Village People\u2019s YMCA and Lee Greenwood\u2019s God Bless the USA. Donald Trump descended stairs to rapturous cheers and whistles from thousands of supporters. Officially, the former US president was rallying at a regional airport to support Republicans candidates in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. Unofficially, he was already accelerating down the runway of a 2024 campaign for the White House. But it was not quite takeoff. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say it right now,\u201d said Trump, bringing a tantalised crowd in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to their feet. \u201cSo, everybody, I promise you, in the very next \u2013 very, very, very short period of time, you\u2019re going to be so happy.\u201d He would like to do it, he added, but wanted to keep the focus on the party\u2019s candidates. Yet minutes earlier, he had given the game away. Two giant screens displayed a series of polls including one for the Republican primary nomination in 2024 that showed Trump at 71% and Florida governor Ron DeSantis at 10%. Trump said casually but pointedly: \u201cRon DeSanctimonious at 10%.\u201d The nickname branding exercise was classic Trump and effectively fired the starting gun for a race in which DeSantis is widely considered his most formidable primary challenger. On Sunday Trump will headline a rally in Miami, Florida, to bolster Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 but DeSantis, running for re-election as governor, is not invited. First, on Saturday, Trump was fighting old battles in Pennsylvania, where both his predecessor and successor \u2013 Barack Obama and Joe Biden \u2013 were also campaigning to tip the balance in a closely contested midterm race that could determine control of the Senate. Trump\u2019s rally was held at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport, named after a golfing great who learned to fly there. Supporters flew giant \u201cTrump 2024\u201d flags and wore caps and T-shirts with slogans such as \u201cTrump won\u201d, \u201cLions not sheep\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a Trump Girl: Get Over It\u201d. There were chants of \u201cUSA! USA\u201d, \u201cLet\u2019s go Brandon!\u201d \u2013 rightwing code for insulting Biden \u2013 and, at mention of Hillary Clinton, \u201cLock her up!\u201d The 45th president had come to throw his weight behind Mehmet Oz, candidate for the Senate, and Doug Mastriano, running for state governor, each hoping that the former president can help them turn out the base. Speaking with his \u201cTrump Force One\u201d plane and 10 US flags behind him, and two more giant flags suspended from cranes, Trump spoke of a country in decline under Democratic control. He hit familiar notes about rampant crime, an open border and a war on American energy. He railed against the media as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d. He lied about \u201cradical left\u201d Democrats cheating to rig elections. Wearing a red \u201cMake America great again\u201d cap, he argued during a two-hour speech: \u201cIf you want to stop the destruction of our country and save the American dream, then this Tuesday you must vote Republican in a giant way ... There\u2019s nothing good to say about what\u2019s happening in our country but on Tuesday night I think we\u2019re going to have very good things to say.\u201d Trump is not on the ballot but somehow he has, once again, made the midterm elections all about him. He insisted on playing kingmaker during the Republican primaries, making risky endorsements of extreme or inexperienced candidates that threatened to turn the votes into a referendum on his political power. Trump did indeed suffer setbacks, particularly in Georgia, but claimed the hugely symbolic victory of ousting Liz Cheney, the vice-chair of the House of Representatives select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol \u2013 an exercise he again denounced on Saturday. Now Trump\u2019s political capital is on the line again in Tuesday\u2019s midterms, with his favoured candidates \u2013 such as Herschel Walker in Georgia and JD Vance in Ohio \u2013 facing difficult contests that could end in defeat. But with current polls showing apparent momentum for Republicans, he is likely to score at least some victories. Brendan Buck, a political strategist and former aide to Republican House speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner, said: \u201cHe tends to look out for number one at all points and he\u2019ll take credit for the people who do win no matter how tenuous the reality of his involvement in those races. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be moving forward regardless. He will be hanging over everything that happens in Washington over the next two years; he tends to block out the sun. He\u2019s going to make it much more difficult to govern.\u201d Polls suggest that Trump\u2019s pick for governor of Pennsylvania will not succeed. Mastriano is a retired army colonel and far-right extremist who introduced a failed resolution after Trump lost Pennsylvania in 2020, falsely claiming that the Republican-controlled legislature had the power to determine which candidate received the state\u2019s electors\u2019 votes. He was seen outside the US Capitol during the January 6 insurrection. Trailing badly to the state attorney general, Josh Shapiro, Mastriano peppered his rally speech with \u201cculture wars\u201d talking points. \u201cDay one, no more critical race theory in our schools,\u201d he said. \u201cOn day one, woke is broke ... On day one, no more graphic porn in our schools.\u201d The Senate race between Oz and John Fetterman, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, appears tighter. Oz barely won the Republican nomination even after getting Trump\u2019s endorsement. The former president is hoping that the celebrity TV doctor, who counts former first lady Melania Trump as a fan, will help Republicans win over suburban women in the swing state. Rally attendee Bonnie Morgan, 54, acknowledged that Trump\u2019s backing of Oz had been controversial. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that he\u2019s conservative but I am voting for him because I don\u2019t want Fetterman to be a senator,\u201d she said. Morgan was wearing a \u201cWomen for Trump 2020\u201d cap and, around her shoulders, a flag that said \u201cTrump 2024: Make votes count again\u201d. She said: \u201cHe was one of our best presidents, right up there with President Reagan. Things were obviously better under President Trump.\u201d During a rally that culminated with music resembling a QAnon conspiracy movement song, Trump may have claimed to be holding back on announcing a third consecutive presidential bid so as not to distract from the midterm candidates, but there was little chance of that. While expressing admiration for DeSantis, attendees insisted that \u2013 in the event of a matchup \u2013 their loyalty was to Trump. Terrance Berry, 47, said: \u201cPresident Trump already has the experience with the establishment. He\u2019s brought out and brought forth the truth of what we\u2019ve been dealing with in politics that we never saw before. I appreciate Ron DeSantis and other candidates in the future but I believe that president Trump right now holds the line: he is pretty much the voice and face of the Republican party at this point. \u201cA lot of people agree. If you ask anybody, you\u2019d probably get more people who say: yeah, I\u2019m still voting for Trump. Even if it was him and DeSantis to run, we\u2019d still vote for Trump. We look to DeSantis maybe in 2028.\u201d John Sabo, 43, vice-president of an oil and gas company, agreed: \u201cI\u2019d like to see a businessman back in there, someone that\u2019s going to be pro-economy, to be able to get us going in the right direction on that side. I like him because a lot of the far left folks don\u2019t like him and then you get a lot of the Rino-type Republicans or country club Republicans don\u2019t necessarily like him either. \u201cWhat I\u2019m about, what a lot of people here about, are the working class people that are out there getting it done, moving the needle for the country. That, to me, is the appeal.\u201d Koury Barr, 64, a part-time newspaper editor, was also backing a Trump 2024 run. \u201cHe did great things for this country,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goodness, inflation was under control. Jobs were going crazy. He was just very good for this nation.\u201d Even so, some analysts believe that a series of defeats for Trump-anointed candidates on Tuesday could yet weaken his grip on the party, forcing it to reconsider whether a 76-year-old, twice-impeached, one-term president \u2013 facing multiple federal, state and congressional investigations \u2013 really is its best bet for regaining the White House. Jon Hudak, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, told the Guardian during a virtual press briefing: \u201cIn an odd twist, if you see the Senate seats in Wisconsin, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in Georgia go to Democrats, that ends up being a very, very, very good day for Ron DeSantis. \u201cRon DeSantis can say: \u2018Look, the candidates who I have campaigned for have won. I did not inject myself into some of these other races like the former president did.\u2019 And he\u2019s not going to have to say anything to come out of that looking well. Ron DeSantis might want Tim Ryan to win the Ohio Senate race more than Tim Ryan does because it could benefit him so much in 2024.\u201d"

            "content": "In the clearest signal yet that Ron DeSantis is preparing a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, it was announced on Wednesday that the rightwing governor of Florida will publish a campaign-style book, mixing memoir with policy proposals. The Courage to Be Free: Florida\u2019s Blueprint for America\u2019s Renewal, will be published by Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins, on 28 February. The governor, his publisher said, will offer readers \u201ca first-hand account from the blue-collar boy who grew up to take on Disney and Dr Fauci\u201d. DeSantis has not announced a 2024 run, but he is widely reported to be considering one. His victory speech after a landslide re-election this month met with chants of \u201cTwo more years!\u201d The cover of the governor\u2019s book shows him smiling broadly in front of a US flag. With Donald Trump under fire over disappointing midterms results, looming indictments and a controversial dinner with a white supremacist, possible Republican opponents are rapidly coming into focus. Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s vice-president, has released a campaign-focused memoir, seeking to balance appeals to Trump\u2019s supporters with distancing himself from the violent end to Trump\u2019s time in office. Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state, will release a book in the new year. Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador who released a memoir in 2019, is also edging up to the starting line. Announcing DeSantis\u2019s book, HarperCollins signaled a focus on the culture-war issues and theatrically cruel policy stunts that have propelled the governor to the front rank of potential candidates, alongside Trump in polls and sometimes ahead, prompting the former president to lash out. DeSantis clashed with Disney, a large employer in Florida, over legislation regarding the teaching of LGBTQ+ issues in schools, which was branded \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d by critics. DeSantis\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, through which Anthony Fauci has advised two presidents, remains highly controversial. Florida has recorded nearly 83,000 deaths, third among US states in a national death toll approaching 1.1m. HarperCollins said DeSantis would \u201creveal\u201d how he \u201caccomplished more for his state\u201d than any other \u201cAmerican leader\u201d. Citing DeSantis\u2019s graduation from Yale and Harvard, service in Iraq \u2013 as a navy lawyer \u2013 and election to Congress in 2012, the publisher said \u201cin all these places, Ron DeSantis learned the same lesson: he didn\u2019t want to be part of the leftist elite.\u201d \u201cSince becoming governor of the sunshine state, he has fought \u2013 and won \u2013 battle after battle, defeating not just opposition from the political left, but a barrage of hostile media coverage,\u201d it added. The announcement \u2013 which echoed numerous rightwing talking points on hot button social issues like Covid-19 and education \u2013 echoed DeSantis\u2019s strident speech in Tallahassee earlier this month, after his easy win over the Democrat Charlie Crist, in which he proclaimed Florida the state \u201cwhere woke goes to die\u201d. HarperCollins also promised to \u201cdeliver something no other politician\u2019s memoir has before: stories of victory\u201d. That might seem to some a curious claim, given, for just one recent example, the publication just two years ago of A Promised Land, Barack Obama\u2019s memoir of his rise to the presidency, significan legislative victories and preparations for his second presidential election win."

            "date": "2022-11-25T15:40:27Z",
            "content": "The disgraced rapper and designer formerly known as Kanye West has said he plans to run for president in 2024, amid a series of antisemitic tirades and new far-right associations. The declaration of his candidacy, which referenced several political figures and aides associated with US white supremacist and anti-democracy movements, would make him the second person to enter the race after Donald Trump. A day earlier, the sportswear giant Adidas announced it was launching an investigation into allegations he harassed former employees. Rolling Stone magazine reported claims by Adidas employees working on the rapper\u2019s Yeezy shoe line that he used \u201cporn, bullying and mind games\u201d to create a \u201ctoxic environment\u201d at the company. That revelation itself followed several fashion brands, including Adidas, Gap and Balenciaga, dropping the 45-year-old star over antisemitic comments he made online, including that he would go \u201cdeath con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE\u201d. That comment, after he wore a controversial \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d T-shirt during Paris fashion week, triggered mass condemnation of the rapper, and he was dropped by banker JPMorgan, his talent agent CAA, lawyers and record company. Ye later said he had lost \u201c$2bn in one day\u201d. Twitter and Instagram temporarily locked his accounts. Ye went on Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson Tonight and made further inflammatory comments, this time about his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, and the pop star Lizzo. He told former CNN anchor Chris Cuomo that his antisemitic comment was \u201cnot hate speech; this is the truth\u201d. Ye\u2019s faltering effort to distance himself from the remarks were further undermined when antisemitic demonstrators referenced Ye in signs raised over the 405 freeway in Los Angeles, California, and in Jacksonville, Florida. One sign reportedly read: \u201cKanye is right about the Jews.\u201d \u201cThis weekend\u2019s antisemitic protests in LA were disgusting and cannot be normalized or brushed aside. Words matter\u201d, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said in a tweet. The presidential run is Ye\u2019s second. During his first, in 2020, he qualified for ballot access in just 12 states, unsuccessfully sued for access to five more, gave up on four and missed registration deadlines on a further 29. He held one highly emotional rally in South Carolina in which he spoke of his anti-abortion views, funded two television ads and ultimately picked up just 70,000 votes across the entire US. Ye\u2019s announcement of a second run for the White House was made with a video of his campaign logo to social media captioned \u201cYe24\u201d. In it, he claimed to have asked Donald Trump to be his running mate, a suggestion that had \u201cmost perturbed\u201d the former president. \u201cThe thing that Trump was most perturbed about [is] me asking him to be my vice-president,\u201d Kanye said in a video posted on his recently unlocked Twitter account. \u201cI think that was, like, lower on the list of things that caught him off-guard.\u201d \u201cIt was the fact that I walked in with intelligence,\u201d Ye added. In the \u201cYe24\u201d Twitter post, the rapper said he\u2019d he advised Trump to \u201cgo and get these people that the media tried to cancel\u201d, with flashes of Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Roger Stone and InfoWars conspiracist Alex Jones. Several days ago, Ye was seen in the company of white nationalist Nick Fuentes at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago country club and home. In the subsequent video, titled \u201cMar-A-Lago Debrief\u201d, Ye said Trump \u201cstarted basically screaming at me at the table, telling me I\u2019m going to lose. Has that ever worked for anyone in history? I\u2019m like, \u2018Wait, hold on Trump, you\u2019re talking to Ye.\u2019\u201d Fuentes is known for virulently antisemitic opinions of his own, as well as extreme racism, misogyny and fascism. He started a white nationalist organization called America First Foundation. The Department of Justice has called him a white supremacist and he has been banned from multiple social media platforms. In the video Ye sang Fuentes\u2019s praises and called him a \u201cloyalist\u201d. Ye also recently told the far-right British commentator Milo Yiannopoulos that he was \u201cworking on the campaign\u201d, which Yiannopoulos said he took to be a campaign announcement. On Thursday, Ye indicated that he had enlisted Yiannopoulos as his 2024 campaign manager. Yiannopoulos has a long history of antisemitism, too, including donating $14.88 to a Jewish journalist, a figure that references the so-called \u201c14 Words\u201d white supremacist manifesto and 88, used by neo-Nazis as shorthand for \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d because H is the eighth letter of the alphabet."

            "content": "The firm building former US president Barack Obama\u2019s presidential library suspended operations after a noose was found at the construction site in Chicago and the police were called. A $100,000 reward was offered by the construction company to help find who was responsible. Lakeside Alliance, a partnership of Black-owned construction firms, said it reported the incident to police and \u201cwill provide any assistance required to identify those responsible\u201d. \u201cWe have zero tolerance for any form of bias or hate on our worksite. Anti-bias training is included in our on-boarding process and reiterated during site-wide meetings. We are suspending all operations onsite in order to provide another series of these trainings and conversations for all staff and workers,\u201d the firm said in a statement on Thursday. Obama\u2019s charitable foundation also released a statement on the library, part of a project to create the Obama Presidential Center. Obama was born in the US state of Hawaii but entered politics after becoming a community organizer in Chicago, passing through the state senate before becoming a US senator representing Illinois. He beat Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination for the presidency in 2008 and became America\u2019s first Black president when he won the election, then was re-elected for a second term in 2012. Having reached term limits, he handed the mantle to Clinton in 2016 and she lost the election in a shock defeat by Donald Trump. Presidents traditionally establish a presidential library at some point after leaving office. The construction firm\u2019s statement continued: \u201cThis shameless act of cowardice and hate is designed to get attention and divide us. Our priority is protecting the health and safety of our workforce.\u201d\u2019 The Chicago police department is aware of the noose and the matter is under investigation, said Sgt Rocco Alioto, a department spokesman. An alliance spokeswoman, Lara Cooper, said she could not comment on whether it suspects a worker at the site and how the pause will affect the work. City work to prepare for construction began in spring 2021 and the center is slated to open in 2025, located near the Obama family home."

            "date": "2022-11-02T10:00:01Z",
            "content": "Last month Kari Lake, a former local TV anchor on the Fox network, joined a rightwing podcast The Conservative Circus to discuss her bid to become Arizona\u2019s next governor. Lake, who has been endorsed by Donald Trump, began by complaining that Joe Biden had just made a speech about the threat to democracy posed by election deniers like herself who claim, without evidence, that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. The US president called them \u201cextremists\u201d and warned that they were preparing to repeat their subversion efforts in November\u2019s midterm elections. Moments later, when Lake was asked by the podcast host a direct question about whether she would concede were she to lose her own governor\u2019s race against the Democrat Katie Hobbs, she was evasive. \u201cI\u2019m not losing to Katie Hobbs. We have a movement. We are not losing to Katie Hobbs, so don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said. Earlier this month CNN put the same straightforward question to Lake: would she accept the results of her own election on 8 November? \u201cI\u2019m going to win the election and I\u2019m going to accept that result,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you lose, will you accept that?\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash pressed. \u201cI\u2019m going to win the election and I will accept that result,\u201d she robotically repeated. That an arch-election denier who has been at the forefront of attempts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory should refuse to state openly whether she will abide by the outcome of her own election has set alarm bells ringing. Lake is one of several prominent election deniers who have dropped hints \u2013 some subtle, others blatant \u2013 that they might mimic Trump\u2019s anti-democratic tactics in their own elections just days away. \u201cThere\u2019s great danger that the Trump \u2018big lie\u2019 is going to spread to states all over the country. If election deniers lose their elections by narrow margins we can expect that they will reject the results and refuse to accept them,\u201d said Fred Wertheimer, president of the non-partisan group Democracy 21. Almost two years after Trump launched his unprecedented election subversion push, culminating in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, the doubts he sowed around election integrity are now blossoming. A new poll from NBC News found that 65% of Republican voters still view Biden\u2019s presidency as illegitimate. \u201cThe cancer that former president Trump injected into our electoral system has spread in 2022 to any number of candidates for important positions. They\u2019re following the Trump playbook,\u201d Wertheimer said. Arizona is the ground zero of the 2022 threat of election subversion. All four of its Republican candidates in statewide races \u2013 Lake, together with the nominees for US Senate, attorney general and secretary of state \u2013 are out-and-out election deniers. Blake Masters, another Trump-backed Republican, has been pre-emptively sowing doubt about the outcome of his challenge to the incumbent Democratic US senator for Arizona Mark Kelly. Masters has been telling supporters on the campaign trail to look out for thousands of fraudulent votes that will snatch victory from him \u2013 a pre-election ploy deployed by Trump in both 2016 and 2020. Mark Finchem, the Republican running for secretary of state, led the push to decertify Biden\u2019s victory in Arizona and was present at the US Capitol on January 6. During the primary elections, he said he would refuse to concede. \u201cAin\u2019t going to be no concession speech coming from this guy,\u201d he said, suggesting the election could have \u201cimpropriety\u201d. Abe Hamadeh, the Republican running for Arizona attorney general, has claimed without evidence that mail-in voting is riddled with fraud \u2013 another pre-emptive move used by Trump in 2020. Similar signs of Republican candidates manoeuvring for possible mischief can be seen in other swing states that were at the epicentre of Trump\u2019s efforts to destroy democracy. In Michigan, the Trump-backed gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon, who is challenging the incumbent governor Gretchen Whitmer, has cast aspersions on the way the state\u2019s midterm elections are being conducted under a top election official who is Democratic. \u201cWe have to wonder what the secretary of state will do when it comes to the \u201922 election,\u201d she has said. In Wisconsin, another state that has become a hotbed of election denial conspiracy theories, both the Republican US senator Ron Johnson who is up for re-election and gubernatorial nominee Tim Michels gave opaque responses to the Wisconsin State Journal. Asked by the paper whether they would unconditionally accept the certified results of their races, Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cIt is certainly his hope that he can.\u201d Michels said he would live with the results \u201cprovided the election is conducted fairly and securely\u201d. Doug Mastriano, a virulent election denier who was at the Capitol on January 6 and helped to bus Trump supporters there, is running to be governor of Pennsylvania. He has declined to answer questions about whether he would concede peacefully should his Democratic rival Josh Shapiro win. It is impossible to predict what will come of the proliferation of election denial ideology in the aftermath of the 8 November elections. But the fact that so many candidates are already laying down objections in a repetition of Trump\u2019s 2020 tactics suggests there may be trouble ahead. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to know what we\u2019re dealing with until it happens, but we can expect chaos in a form that we have never seen in any midterm,\u201d Wertheimer said. Concern about possible attempts to disrupt election counts has led the Carter Center, the human rights group founded by former president Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn, to focus on this election. The center is regarded as an authority on global election integrity, having monitored 113 elections in Africa, Latin America and Asia since the 1980s. The center\u2019s democracy experts decided months before the 2020 election that the chaos surrounding then President Trump\u2019s campaign merited their attention. Since then they have been attempting to bring back home to the US the lessons they have learned about conflict resolution and how to strengthen democracy from around the world. \u201cOne of the things that was clearly of concern by the summer of 2020 were efforts to pre-emptively undermine the credibility of the result,\u201d said Nathan Stock, associate director of the Carter Center\u2019s conflict resolution program. As part of its 2022 work, the Carter Center is asking midterm candidates to sign up for five core principles to uphold trusted elections. One of those commitments is to accept the outcome of the vote once the results have been certified. \u201cWe are saying, \u2018Yes you get to have your day in court, but once the legal challenges are settled and the result is certified, you have got to accept the result,\u2019\u201d Stock said. Some 124 candidates in the November elections have so far pledged to adopt the principles. They include Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, and his Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams; and Georgia\u2019s current secretary of state Brad Raffensperger who helped rebuff Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the state\u2019s presidential outcome in 2020, and his Democratic challenger Bee Nguyen. Key election deniers, however, have yet to come on board."

            "title": "Arizona secretary of state sues after Republican officials refuse to certify county election results",
            "date": "2022-11-29T03:22:05Z",
            "content": "Republican officials in a rural Arizona county refused on Monday to certify the results of the 2022 midterm election, despite no evidence of anything wrong with the count from earlier this month. Some officials who have embraced voter fraud theories held out, defying a state deadline and setting the stage for a legal battle. The move came amid pressure from prominent Republicans to reject results showing Democrats winning top races, and the county was holding out in the afternoon of a nail-biting day that was the deadline for several counties to confirm results. In a lawsuit on Monday, the secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who narrowly won the race for governor, asked a judge to order county officials to canvass the election, which she said was an obligation under Arizona law. Lawyers representing a Cochise county voter and a group of retirees filed a similar lawsuit on Monday, the deadline for counties to approve the official tally of votes, known as the canvass. The two Republican county supervisors delayed the canvass vote until hearing once more about concerns over the certification of ballot tabulators, though election officials have repeatedly said the equipment is properly approved. The state elections director, Kori Lorick, wrote in a letter last week that Hobbs was required by law to approve the statewide canvass by next week and would have to exclude Cochise county\u2019s votes if they were not received in time. That would threaten to flip the victor in at least two close races, a US House seat and state schools chief, from a Republican to a Democrat. Hobbs\u2019s lawsuit asks the Cochise county superior court to order officials to certify the results by Thursday. Failing to certify them would undermine the will of the county\u2019s voters \u201cand sow further confusion and doubt about the integrity of Arizona\u2019s election system\u201d, lawyers for Hobbs wrote. \u201cThe board of supervisors had all of the information they needed to certify this election and failed to uphold their responsibility for Cochise voters,\u201d Sophia Solis, a spokeswoman for Hobbs, said in an email. A Democratic election attorney, Marc Elias, also pledged, via Twitter, to sue the county. Elsewhere, Republican supervisors in Mohave county postponed a certification vote until later on Monday after hearing comments from residents angry about problems with ballot printers in Maricopa county. Officials in Maricopa county, the state\u2019s largest, where the state capital, Phoenix, is located, said everyone had a chance to vote and all legal ballots were counted. Election results have largely been certified without issue in jurisdictions across the nation despite tub-thumping by rightwingers during their campaigns who sought to undermine public faith in US democracy. Many of the most extreme candidates lost. But it has been a rockier road in Arizona, which became a focal point for efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election and push false narratives of fraud, following Joe Biden\u2019s surprise win in the state \u2013 a result that was first called by Fox News, another fact that infuriated Trump as he railed against losing the White House. Arizona was long a GOP stronghold, but this month Democrats won most of the highest-profile races over Trumpist Republicans. Lake, who lost the governor\u2019s race to Hobbs, and Mark Finchem, the candidate for secretary of state, have refused to acknowledge their midterm election losses, however. They blame Republican election officials in Maricopa county for a problem with some ballot printers. David Becker, executive director of the non-partisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, said the officials delaying certification were breeding an illegitimate distrust in elections and disenfranchising voters. \u201cIn the last year, it\u2019s become an unprecedented dereliction of duty for county officials to violate their oaths of office and refuse to certify election results, citing \u2018gut feelings\u2019 or alleged problems in [other] jurisdictions,\u201d Becker said. Navajo, a rural Republican-leaning county, conservative Yavapai county and Coconino, which is staunchly Democratic, voted to certify on Monday. In Cochise county, GOP supervisors demanded last week that the secretary of state prove vote-counting machines were legally certified before they would approve the election results."

            "content": "How do the elections work? All 435 seats in the lower chamber of the federal congress, the House of Representatives, are re-elected every two years. (There are no term limits, and incumbents are often returned, so there is substantial continuity in the membership). House seats are broadly proportional to population, so California has lots of seats but Montana only a few. The upper chamber, the Senate, has 100 seats; two for each state, however populous. In every even-numbered year, roughly one-third of senators are elected for a six-year term. Legislation has to pass both chambers to become law. Senators have some additional responsibilities compared with their colleagues in the House; chiefly these have to do with confirming (or not) presidential appointments. Governors are not part of Congress. Their impact is mostly local to their own state, but because they can affect electoral law or practice, they can affect future federal elections. Going into the election the Democratic party of the president, Joe Biden, controlled both chambers of Congress, but by very narrow margins. In the Senate, a 50-50 split would mean a casting vote went to the vice-president, Kamala Harris. (In practice the casting vote more often went to Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator representing a largely Republican state). These elections are called midterms because they happen in the middle of a four-year presidential term. They are difficult for sitting presidents because the presidential party often does badly in them, and because losing control of Congress makes it more difficult for the president to pursue his or her agenda. About these results The results are provided by the Associated Press, or AP, who have rigorous criteria for \u201ccalling\u201d election races; that is, for reporting a winner. Redrawing of House districts this year following the 2020 census mean AP is not reporting \u201cflips\u201d, or seats where the sitting party changes. The redistricting means that in a few seats there are two incumbent representatives competing for a new district. It may also impact the change figures seen on the House results summary bar. It is possible that some seats will count 100% of votes without a winner becoming apparent because of laws that trigger an automatic recount in races that are very close. The seat totals for each party may not align with the seats called totals because in some seats the winning party will be known before the winning candidate is identified; this is particularly the case in California which has primary elections to whittle the candidates down to two, who may both be from the same party.

            "date": "2022-11-02T10:27:53Z",
            "content": "Denmark\u2019s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has won a nail-biting election that gave her left-leaning bloc a one-seat majority in parliament. But her pledge to build a broad left-right coalition may make it difficult for her to form a stable government. Exit polls on Tuesday night had suggested Frederiksen\u2019s five-party \u201cred\u201d bloc would lose its majority in the 179-seat parliament, but as the last votes were counted early on Wednesday it became clear that it had secured 87 seats in mainland Denmark. Three more seats from the autonomous overseas territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland gave it a total of 90 MPs \u2013 the slimmest possible majority \u2013 as Frederiksen\u2019s Social Democrats turned in their strongest showing in more than 20 years, winning 27.6% of the vote and 50 MPs. \u201cThanks to all Danes who have trusted us with your vote, it\u2019s a huge vote of confidence,\u201d the prime minister said on Wednesday. \u201cI know some of you have had doubts along the way \u2026 We are a party for all of Denmark.\u201d The result, however, leaves Frederiksen with a dilemma: she campaigned for a broad coalition of mainstream parties across the traditional left-right divide, arguing that political unity was needed at a time of domestic and international uncertainty. Her majority could make that more difficult to achieve, since most of her leftwing allies would prefer a traditional left-leaning alliance. \u201cShe could opt for a straight leftwing bloc, which would mean going back on her campaign promise of political unity, or she can keep her word and risk upsetting her traditional allies,\u201d said Sune Steffen Hansen, a public affairs consultant, pollster and former adviser to the Social Democrats. \u201cWhatever she does, she could disappoint a lot of people. In a parliament with 12 parties \u2013 a really fragmented political landscape \u2013 and with such big issues facing the country, holding a coalition together is not going to be easy.\u201d Frederiksen, 44, presented her government\u2019s resignation to Queen Margrethe on Wednesday morning and said she intended to push ahead with her plans. \u201cWhen the Social Democrats say something, we follow through,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must get through uncertain times together. The Social Democrats went to the polls to form a broad government. If a majority of parties point to me as prime minister I will see whether it can be done. That is what is good for Denmark.\u201d Frederiksen is expected to turn first to her centre-right predecessor, the former Liberal party leader Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, whose hopes of becoming kingmaker were dashed by his rival\u2019s majority but whose new centrist party, the Moderates, won 16 parliamentary seats, also with a call for a new left-right coalition. L\u00f8kke Rasmussen insisted on Tuesday night he still wanted to be \u201cthe bridge\u201d across the traditional divide in Danish politics. \u201cIt\u2019s not red or blue, it\u2019s about common sense,\u201d he said, adding that a new government was \u201ca certainty\u201d. However, although L\u00f8kke Rasmussen is certain to take part in Frederiksen\u2019s coalition talks and could even secure cabinet posts, analysts are not sure he can compromise enough for the left without drawing fire from the right, potentially forcing Frederiksen to revert to a more traditional leftwing coalition. In a bad night for the right, the opposition \u201cblue\u201d bloc \u2013 an informal liberal and conservative alliance supported by three populist parties \u2013 won 73 seats. The opposition leader, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, of the Liberal party, acknowledged the bloc\u2019s defeat after his party lost 19 of its 43 seats in parliament. Frederiksen was rewarded by a public vote of confidence in her handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and in her steady leadership in the face of high energy prices, rampant inflation and mounting insecurity fuelled by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. She had won praise for navigating Denmark through the pandemic, but her popularity slipped, partly over a decision to cull the country\u2019s entire captive mink population of 15 million animals for fear of a Covid-19 variant crossing over to humans. A parliament-ordered inquiry found the move was illegal and last month one of the parties propping up Frederiksen\u2019s minority government threatened to topple it unless she called elections. Denmark\u2019s stricter immigration policies slashed support for the far-right Danish People\u2019s party, but a new party, the Denmark Democrats, created by the former immigration minister Inger St\u00f8jberg, scored 8% of the vote."

            "date": "2022-11-02T16:58:42Z",
            "content": "An hour after the election exit polls predicted a comeback for former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday night, Israel\u2019s Channel 13 switched from vote count drama to its satirical late-night current affairs show, Wonderful Country. The host was immediately joined by a comedian sporting round glasses, a yellow tie, white kippah and bulging fake belly, made up to look like the country\u2019s new political kingmaker, the extremist Itamar Ben-Gvir. Brandishing a pistol \u2013 as Ben-Gvir did recently in a Palestinian neighbourhood of occupied East Jerusalem \u2013 he danced his way across the set before taking a seat. \u201cWe love democracy,\u201d the actor said, a grin on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss it.\u201d Israeli politics has been shifting rightwards for several decades, but Ben-Gvir\u2019s unprecedented success in this week\u2019s election marks a new, dangerous turn. Bereft of necessary coalition partners after breaking promises in the past, Netanyahu, leader of the Likud party, engineered a merger between three fringe far-right parties in 2021, ushering the new Religious Zionists slate into the political mainstream. In the short term, the move has paid off: his extremist allies have doubled their number of seats to 13 or 14. With 86% of the votes counted, Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing bloc has a 65 seat lead - more than enough for a relatively stable majority government in the 120-seat Knesset. Long term, however, Netanyahu may regret it. The Religious Zionists\u2019 list\u2019s chair, Bezalel Smotrich, is the co-founder of an organisation which pursues legal action against Palestinian building in Israeli-controlled areas of the occupied West Bank. He wants legislative reform to incorporate traditional religious Jewish law, and is virulently against Jewish-Palestinian co-existence and gay rights. Ben-Gvir, the slate\u2019s charismatic deputy with a large and youthful following, is a former follower of the far-right terrorist Rabbi Meir Kahane. He built a legal career defending Jewish extremists, and in the past called for the deportation of Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up 20% of the population. Other members of the list have set up armed militias, called for the reinstatement of the death penalty, and expressed support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir are advocates for politicising the Israeli judiciary and giving parliament power to override court decisions they don\u2019t like, which would benefit Netanyahu, who sees getting back into office as the best way to overturn his corruption trial. Netanyahu also opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state, but otherwise does not share most of his new partners\u2019 beliefs. Infighting during the campaign suggests he doesn\u2019t even like them: he is more used to presiding over coalitions with centrist and centre-left elements. But as the force which propelled him back into power, the debt to his new allies is sizeable. Even if Netanyahu can temper some of their more extreme ideas, the Religious Zionists are bound to drag the Likud\u2019s already hawkish policies further to the right. Both Smotrich and Ben-Gvir expect to receive important cabinet positions, and have already lobbied for control of the justice, defence, finance, and public security ministries. In the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s election, Israel\u2019s fifth in just four years triggered by the country\u2019s inability to decide on Netanyahu\u2019s suitability to govern, many disillusioned Arab Israelis and brutalised Palestinians observed the campaigning with indifference. On Wednesday morning, the enormity of what transpired was sinking in. By some measures, this year is already the deadliest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 2005; fighting in the north of the West Bank between Palestinian militias and the Israel Defence Forces has been raging since March. A return to peace talks now belongs in the realm of fantasy. A Religious Zionist politician said on Wednesday afternoon that he \u201ccertainly thinks and hopes\u201d that the new coalition will change the status quo on Jerusalem\u2019s sensitive Temple Mount \u2013 an issue that helped spark war as recently as last year. \u201cMaybe the far right getting in will be a good thing. These people don\u2019t sugarcoat racism and violence the way other Israeli politicians do. The fig leaf will be gone,\u201d said Prof As\u2019ad Ghanem, a political sciences lecturer at the University of Haifa and co-author of Israel in the Post Oslo Era. \u201cThey might take steps against Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank and the Negev, yes. But liberal governments around the world who say they care about Palestinian rights will not be able to stand aside anymore. A fully rightwing Israeli government will expose what is already there.\u201d A major voting demographic for the Religious Zionists are hardcore Israeli settlers, living illegally in the West Bank. They attack Palestinian children on the way to school, appropriate land, burn olive trees and steal sheep. In short, their aim is to make life for Palestinians unbearable. With their representatives likely to take up the mantle of government in a few weeks\u2019 time, the question now troubling people on both sides of the Green Line is: how much worse do things have to get before they get better?"

            "content": "That\u2019s it from me today! Thank you for reading on several midterm election races happening across the country. Here\u2019s a summary of everything that happened: For Democrats, Tuesday\u2019s midterm election races could mean losing control of Congress. Several closely watched Senate races could determine the outcome of which party will control Congress for the rest of Joe Biden\u2019s first term in office. John Kerry, the US climate envoy, has vowed that Joe Biden\u2019s administration will press ahead on climate action regardless of the outcome of today\u2019s midterm elections, which are expected to go badly for Democrats. Kerry delivered that promise while speaking at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt. The Guardian caught up with a number of voters across several key states, including Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. Many spoke about a number of issues that were motivating them to cast a ballot today, including the state of democracy and abortion access in the US. The first set of exit polling from CNN spells dismal results for Democrats, as a majority of the US electorate is angry and dissatisfied with the state of the country. GOP lawsuits challenging voter rules have caused hold ups in some districts, including Philadelphia, as election judges are now required to go through an extra checking process to monitor for double voting, a process that could take three days. Another lawsuit caused mail-in ballots in Philadelphia that have inaccurate or missing dates to be rejected, causing thousands to show up and recast their ballots. The Florida state department sent a letter to the US Department of Justice saying that federal election monitors won\u2019t be permitted inside the state\u2019s polling places. The letter comes as several key races are happening in Florida, including the election for Florida governor. Donald Trump cast a ballot at a polling place in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump gave some brief comments to media waiting outside the polling place, and confirmed that he voted for incumbent governor Ron DeSantis. You can follow this blog, which will update as polling places across the country begin to close. If you\u2019re in line to vote, stay there! Have a great night and happy election day, everyone! John Kerry, the US climate envoy, has vowed that Joe Biden\u2019s administration will press ahead on climate action regardless of the outcome of today\u2019s midterm elections, which are expected to go badly for Democrats. Kerry, speaking at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt, said that he hoped there would be a Congress would act on the climate crisis but \u201ceven if we don\u2019t, folks, president Biden is more determined than ever to continue what we are doing.\u201d \u201cMost of what we are doing cannot be changed by anyone else coming along,\u201d Kerry added, noting that cities and states across America banded together to commit to the Paris climate agreement when Donald Trump removed the US from the pact when president. US officials in Egypt hope that the inflation reduction act bill passed in August, which contains more than $370bn in climate spending and called \u201cone of the single most important pieces of legislation over the past 50 years or so\u201d by Kerry in his speech, will drive deep cuts in emissions regardless of the midterms. But Kerry conceded it was possible that Republicans could \u201claunch an assault\u201d on Biden\u2019s climate agenda if they win at least one house of Congress in the elections. The GOP has decried what it calls Biden\u2019s \u201cradical green agenda\u201d and could stall or hamper the rollout of measures aimed at boosting renewable energy deployment. Biden arrives at Cop27 on Friday, potentially in a downcast mood following the outcome of the elections. The Guardian\u2019s Aben\u00e9 Clayton, reporting on the California gubernatorial race from Los Angeles It may have been one of the least anxiety-inducing midterm races in the nation. California governor Gavin Newsom is expected to cruise to re-election and easily beat Republican state senator Brian Dahle to serve his second term at the helm of the US\u2019 most populous state. Last year, Newsom survived a recall attempt driven by critics of his handling of the pandemic. This year, with re-election in deep blue California all but secure, he took his message to the national stage, spending millions of dollars on ads addressing issues like gun control and abortion rights in states including Mississippi and Texas. Newsom\u2019s national effort has sparked speculation among political analysts and officials he\u2019s considering a run for president -- a rumor Newsom has consistently denied. But as my colleague Maanvi Singh wrote a few weeks ago: \u201cDenial is the tradition of pretty much every politician who has flirted with chief executive ambitions.\u201d More reporting on voting in Michigan, from the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine Taylor Morgan, 26, cast her vote Tuesday just a few blocks from the main campus of the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. A driving force getting her to the polls is Proposal 3, an effort to enshrine abortion protections in the Michigan constitution. \u201cReproductive rights and reproductive freedom are super important to me as a Black woman in Michigan,\u201d she said just before she cast her ballot. \u201cI just want to make sure that those rights are maintained. I feel like if that\u2019s not something that you believe in or support, you have that right. But you don\u2019t have the right to tell the people what they can do with their bodies.\u201d Morgan said she\u2019s concerned about efforts to overturn the election, but hopes that the margin will be so wide, any efforts will quickly fall apart. \u201cMy hope is that a lot of people turn out so everything is indisputable,\u201d said Morgan, a medical student. Abby Anderson, a senior at the University of Michigan studying performance art management, said she also was motivated by the abortion proposal. \u201cI\u2019m very pro-choice. It\u2019s a cause that I care a lot about. Particular since I\u2019m not from Michigan, and I could have chosen to vote in the state that I\u2019m from, but I felt that my vote had more of an impact here because it\u2019s more of a swing,\u201d she said. There\u2019s some concern about potentially low turnout from young voters, but both Morgan and Anderson said they thought young people would vote in high numbers. Some of her professor had even said it\u2019s OK if students couldn\u2019t make it to class on Tuesday because they needed to vote, Anderson said. \u201cI\u2019m young and a lot of my friends, they\u2019re very adamant about coming out to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like a lot of people are lining up to go to the on campus polling places. I feel like young people are starting to realize what they stand for and what they don\u2019t stand for. So you\u2019re gonna see a lot of young people coming out in droves to make their voices heard. At least that\u2019s what it looks like to me,\u201d Morgan said. CNN has published its first set of exit polls. The poll readings spell fairly dismal news for Democrats ahead of midterm election results, with polls showing that the majority of the American electorate are angry with the state of the country under Biden\u2019s presidency. While all eyes are on New York\u2019s gubernatorial race, the outcome of New York\u2019s 21st Congressional District contest might speak to the staying power of MAGA-style politics\u2014or whether voters have grown weary of Trump\u2019s inflammatory politics. Republican incumbent Elise Stefanik is running against Democrat Matt Castelli, a former CIA officer who served on the national security council. Stefanik became the No. 3 House Republican after Liz Cheney was kicked out of the role of conference chair amid the Wyoming congresswoman\u2019s ongoing criticism of Trump. While Stefanik was a moderate when she entered the House in 2015, the congress member has increasingly moved right. Some consider Stefanik to be a potential 2024 vice-presidential candidate. Not everyone in Stefanik\u2019s district is enthused by her political ascent\u2014including her statements relating to baseless claims that there were sweeping \u201cirregularities\u201d in the previous national election, per CNN. Jennifer Mann, a Castelli campaign volunteer and chair of the Brunswick, New York Democratic Committee, decried Stefanik\u2019s statements about the 2020 election. \u201cShe does not support democracy. She voted against supporting the results of the election even though she knew\u2014 she had information\u2014there was no fraud. I find that terrifying.\u201d Mann, who cast her ballot early, said that many in the district are worried about affordable healthcare and prescription drugs; Stefanik, she said, \u201cvoted against their interests every single time.\u201d Like many other voters, Mann voiced frustration over polarization, saying: \u201cI\u2019m tired of the parisian politics.\u201d As for the governor\u2019s race, Mann said: \u201cHochul is not my ideal candidate, I\u2019m not going to lie. She is at least somebody who will support the democratic process.\u201d \u201cShe will make sure that women\u2019s rights are guaranteed for us\u2014not having the government take it from us,\u201d Mann said. Stefanik was among the some 80 Republicans supporting national legislation that would prohibit most abortions after 15 weeks. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing I really dislike about Stefanik: She wants to take away states\u2019 rights by sponsoring this nationwide abortion ban.\u201d In New York, the Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, and Republican challenger Lee Zeldin are making their last-minute pitches to voters in the gubernatorial race. While the Cook Political Report predicts that the governor\u2019s race will \u201clikely\u201d be for Democrats, her lead over Zeldin has slimmed dramatically\u2014from a double-digit margin to just four points over the course of several weeks, according to CNBC. \u201cThis city is back and I want to lead this state into the next four years and possibly beyond with a sense of optimism we have not had here in a long time,\u201d Hochul said during a campaign stop on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side Tuesday, according to the New York Post. \u201cThat will start first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d Zeldin, who like most Republicans across the US has made crime a key tenet of his platform, tried to hammer Hochul on public safety during a campaign stop at the Nassau County, Long Island Republican headquarters. \u201cIf you go and ask a lot of Democrats who are inside of New York City who are fed up, they don\u2019t want to be told that the crime in the subway is just a perception. They should just look away, there\u2019s nothing to see here,\u201d the Post quoted Zeldin as saying. Democrats outside of New York have taken notice of Zeldin\u2019s rise in the polls and appear to be considering him a serious threat. President Joe Biden appeared alongside Hochul on Sunday to encourage voters to cast their ballots in what has become an unexpectedly tight race. \u201cNew York, you have two days to make sure the rest of New York knows the good that they have in Kathy Hochul,\u201d Biden said, according to Politico. \u201cTwo days until the most important election in our lifetime.\u201d Philadelphia voters have encountered some issues while trying to cast their votes, both mail in ballots and in-person votes on Tuesday. Thousands of mail-in ballots were recast in the Brotherly Love city following a ruling on a GOP lawsuit that invalidated mail-in ballots that had missing or inaccurate dates. The decision, made last Tuesday, launched a mass volunteer effort in the city on Monday night to alert those impacted about their ballots. On Tuesday, election officials were also mandated to check for double voting, thanks to a separate GOP lawsuit. The checking process could take several days and slow down the vote count process. From the Washington Post: The process, known as \u201cpoll book reconciliation,\u201d is a way to prevent double voting that Philadelphia implemented in 2020 amid a dramatic expansion of mail ballots in the state. It requires that election workers interrupt ballot counting to scan poll books so that the lists of voters who returned mail ballots can be compared to those who voted in-person. The process generally takes three days, court records show. Here\u2019s some helpful context for Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections and what it could mean for Democrats\u2019 control of Congress, from the Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal and Joan E Greve The Biden administration was braced for a bad night on Tuesday as the US midterm election results threatened to rob the Democrats of control of Congress, just as former president Donald Trump appears ready to announce another run for the White House. But the Democrats were holding out hope that they might just retain control of the US Senate if a handful of closely fought races fell their way. The final results, which will determine control of Congress for the remainder of Biden\u2019s first term as president and further constrain his legislative agenda, could take days or even weeks in some closely fought Senate races. Delayed results are likely to fuel legal challenges and conspiracy theories about vote-rigging, particularly if the remaining seats determine control of the Senate. The ground was already being laid in Pennsylvania, where a close US Senate race is being fought between Mehmet Oz, a Trump-backed Republican, and Democrat John Fetterman, who has been battling to assure voters he is fit for office after a stroke. Earlier on election day on Tuesday, the agency overseeing the voting in Philadelphia said it will delay counting thousands of paper ballots because of a Republican lawsuit that said the process was open to duplicate voting. Dozens of Republican candidates for the Senate, the House of Representatives and other major offices have refused to confirm that they will accept the result if they lose amid a swirl of false claims of fraud, stemming from Trump\u2019s assertion that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and kept alive by the Republican party leadership.

More reporting on Californians voting on Proposition 30, from the Guardian\u2019s Maanvi Singh Californians are voting today on a ballot measure that would tax the state\u2019s richest residents in an effort to get more electric vehicles on the road. The measure, Proposition 30, would hike taxes by 1.75% on those earning $2m or more annually to raise between $3bn and $5bn annually to subsidize households, businesses and schools; buy zero-emission cars, trucks and buses; fund infrastructure to charge electric vehicles; and bolster wildfire prevention efforts. Proponents of the measure, including the coalition of environmental and labor groups that developed it, say the tax would provide urgently needed funds to hasten the transition to zero-emission vehicles, and reduce the disproportionate burden of pollution on low-income, minority communities across the state. Detractors, including the California governor, Gavin Newsom, claim the proposal is a corporate carve-out for Lyft, the ride-hailing company that has backed the measure and helped fund its campaign. Read more about Proposition 30 and the fraught battle over it here: The latest on Los Angeles\u2019 mayoral race, from the Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett By the time Los Angeles residents headed to polls on Tuesday, mayoral hopeful and billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso had poured more than $100m of his own fortune into his campaign to become the city\u2019s next leader. Caruso, who\u2019s battling Congresswoman Karen Bass in a closely contested race, has backed his own campaign with $101m as of late last week, campaign ethics filing show, outspending his opponent by more than 10 to one. The developer, who is running a pro-police, tough-on-crime campaign, came in second to Bass, a former community organizer and leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, in the city\u2019s June primary. But Bass\u2019 strong lead over Caruso in recent weeks evaporated, according to a recent poll of likely voters, with her 45% to 41% lead over Caruso within the poll\u2019s margin of error. Caruso, who has an estimated net worth of $5.3bn, is nearing a mayoral campaign record set by billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who spent $109m of his own money to win his third term as mayor of New York City in 2009. Total political spending of more than $120m on a mayoral race is a striking sum, especially for a contest in which the key issue is LA\u2019s homelessness. There are at least 41,000 unhoused people in Los Angeles county, many of them unsheltered, and living, in tents, cars, RVs and makeshift structures. Bass has repeatedly attacked Caruso\u2019s campaign spending, saying that if she had $90m or $100m to spend, she would spend it on affordable housing. Concerns over the spread of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms are a recurring theme of each election but with the recent mass layoffs at Twitter following Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of the platform civil liberties groups are particularly on high alert. The company laid off a reported 50% of the workforce or an estimated 3,700 workers last week just days before the midterms. Twitter\u2019s head of safety and integrity, Yoel Roth said that layoffs affected 15% of the company\u2019s trust and safety team which is charged with moderating content including combating misinformation. That has the leaders of civil liberties groups such as Color of Change, Free Press and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who met with Musk to discuss how Twitter will deal with hate speech, convinced that the company will not be sufficiently staffed to handle attempts to mislead voters today. \u201cRetaining and enforcing election-integrity measures requires an investment in the human expert staff, factcheckers, and moderators, who are being shown the door today,\u201d said Jessica J Gonz\u00e1lez, co-CEO of Free Press. While it\u2019s still early in the day, months-old viral videos and tweets falsely claiming Republicans were being barred from the polls have already been recirculated today, according to the Washington Post. Pennsylvania is at the heart of the battle for control of Congress and key governorships across the country. To get a sense of Democrats\u2019 political fortunes in this consequential battleground, I spoke to Ed Rendell, a former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania. Rendell is bullish on the governor\u2019s race, where Democrat Josh Shapiro has maintained a consistent lead over his Republican opponent, the election-denying conservative Doug Mastriano. But he has jitters about the Senate race between John Fetterman, the Democrat, and Mehmet Oz, the Republican, which is rated a toss up. Key to the race, he says, is Black voter turnout in cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. If Democrats fail to mobilize this crucial constituency, it will be hard, if not impossible, for them to eke out a win in a close contest. Rendell is hopeful Obama\u2019s visit to the state on Saturday will have a \u201cdramatic impact\u201d on turnout, especially among Black voters, by reminding voters of the stakes and making the affirmative case for electing Democrats. And he does not believe, as some in his party do, that Biden\u2019s campaign appearance in Philadelphia on Saturday, alongside Obama, Fetterman and Shapiro, will hurt the Democratic ticket, In fact, he said it\u2019s possible that the enduring affection for Biden in places like Scranton, where the president was born, may help boost support for Democrats in that industrial corner of the state. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like Joe Biden and you want to send him a message ... you vote against him, but not because he appears with Fetterman,\u201d Rendell said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change anybody\u2019s mind.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Aben\u00e9 Clayton, reporting on voting conditions from Los Angeles A winter storm has brought days of rain, snow and flood warnings to southern and northern California, and while it may have ended California\u2019s fire season it also has led midterm election hopefuls to implore voters to defy the conditions to cast their ballots. There are more questions than clear answers around the impact that weather has on voter turnout and ultimately the results of an election, but candidates aren\u2019t leaving anything up to chance or people\u2019s instincts to stay dry, warm and off of wet roads. \u201cSince we don\u2019t like rain, I have to make sure that people vote. We can\u2019t lose this election because of the rain. That would be crazy,\u201d Karen Bass, the progressive candidate for mayor of Los Angeles, said during a pre-election day Instagram live interview with the actor Rosario Dawson. On the other side of the state, Brooke Jenkins, San Francisco\u2019s interim district attorney who is running to retain her seat, is calling on people to come out to the polls, \u201crain or shine\u201d. Matt Gunderson, a Southern California state senate candidate whose campaign promises include repealing laws that downgrades crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. Donald Trump, who lost Arizona in 2020, has weighed in on the tabulation machine issues in Maricopa county. Trump posted on Truth Social, saying the machine problems were mostly affecting conservative or Republican areas. It\u2019s not clear exactly which sites have been experiencing the tabulation problems, but voters around the county have reported them. \u201cCan this possibly be true when a vast majority of Republicans waited for today to Vote? Here we go again? The people will not stand for it!!!\u201d Trump wrote. Earlier on Tuesday, election officials in Maricopa County reported that about 20% of polling places in the county were experiencing problems. The Guardian\u2019s Erum Salam reports on the voting situation in Texas Things are heating up in Texas, one of the most difficult states to cast a vote. Reports have emerged of voters being turned away from eight polling sites in Bell county, an area north-east of Austin, after check-in machines malfunctioned because of an issue relating to the time change. Bell county election officials requested an additional hour for voting from the Texas secretary of state due to the issues. At a time when doubt is being unnecessarily cast on the integrity of the American electoral process, Bell county does not inspire confidence in those already skeptical, but county officials told the Guardian that the issue with the machines only affected voters\u2019 ability to check in, not their ability to vote. Bell county\u2019s public information officer, James Stafford, said: \u201cFor some reason, computers at those eight locations did not automatically update to the new time. As a result, the central computer, recognizing a discrepancy, would not allow those devices to come online, and we were unable to open those sites to voters. The critical issue that we want to communicate is that we have not had any issues related to ballots or tabulation machines. The issue was limited to those check-in devices. I also would say that, seeing the work and the passion of both our elections and technology services staff as they worked diligently to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible.\u201d Confidence in the electoral process is integral to the preservation of democracy and boosting that confidence has been the primary objective of some. The US Department of Justice announced yesterday it will send federal monitors to polling sites across the country, including three counties in Texas, to ensure smooth sailing on election day. During early voting, the Beaumont chapter of the NAACP alleged Black voters were being harassed and intimidated by election workers in Jefferson county. Jessica Daye, a local voter, alleged she witnessed other Black voters being shadowed by election workers who demanded they say their addresses out loud, despite already being checked in to vote. On Monday, Daye, the NAACP and The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed a lawsuit and a federal judge issued an order prohibiting the discriminatory behavior. On the morning of election day, the Election Protection coalition \u2013 the nation\u2019s oldest and largest non-partisan voter protection coalition \u2013 held a virtual press conference \u201coutlining resources and guidance available to voters in need of information or facing intimidation at the polls\u201d. On the call were leaders from the Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Texas Civil Rights Project, and top of the agenda was addressing any voting incidents at polling sites or ballot drop boxes in key states across the country. Lawyers\u2019 Committee For Civil Rights Under Law called the incident in Beaumont \u201ca gross instance of invasion of privacy and voter intimidation\u201d. In the call, the Texas Civil Rights Project said it received more reports of machine malfunctions, voter intimidation, polling sites opening late, poll workers dressed in partisan attire in a few places, and issues with mail ballots that were either not received or rejected. Voting in Texas ends at 7pm central. As millions across the country voted on Tuesday, Joe Biden tweeted an encouragement for people to participate in elections. Behind the scenes, Biden also spoke with a number of key leaders in the Democratic party. From the White house press office: This afternoon, the President spoke individually by phone with Democratic Governors Association Chair Roy Cooper, DCCC Chair Sean Patrick Maloney, DSCC Chair Gary Peters, and DNC Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond. He also spoke jointly to DNC Chair Jaime Harrison and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Carlisa Johnson reports on Joy to the Polls, an arts-based voting initiative in Georgia In Georgia, young voters make up 17% of the state\u2019s voting population. However, young voter turnout remained lower than in previous elections at the end of early voting. Now, the final get out the vote efforts are happening to capture young voters. Throughout the state, voting rights organizers are taking to the streets to help voters get to the polls, cast their votes and have their voices heard. Today, Joy to the Polls, an arts-based initiative, is making eight stops throughout the metro area to encourage voters to head to the polls and celebrate the joy of voting. At its third stop of the day, Joy to the Polls featured a performance by recording artist Tate \u201cBaby Tate\u201d Farris in East Atlanta. Farris, a Georgia native, said she came out to remind young people to vote. \u201cYoung people have power. This is the opportunity to take that power that [they] have and use it by being active in the election process.\u201d This initiative, which originated in 2020, creates party-like atmospheres at polling places throughout the state, hoping to ease the stress of the voting process. Kaelyn Kastle, co-host of the East Atlanta stop, believes events like Joy to the Polls are critical in places like Georgia, where elections are won by thin margins. \u201cWe all know that the system is broken, and things need to be changed,\u201d said Kastle. \u201cYoung people have to understand that their vote does matter because we\u2019ve seen how close elections in Georgia can be.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Andrew Lawrence reports from Decatur, Georgia Long voter queues were hard to come by, a sign that can be taken one of two ways: either most residents are already part of the giant early turnout, or simply got turned around. \u201cBecause the polling places are different from the early voting locations, that\u2019s caused some confusion,\u201d says Karen \u201cMix\u201d Mixon, vice-chair of the DeKalb County Democratic Committee. On a cloudless 75F day, Mixon stood outside an early voting location in the South Dekalb Mall to redirect voters toward their assigned polling place. With SB 202, the aggressive voter suppression law President Biden dubbed \u201cJim Crow 2.0\u201d, finally baring its teeth on election day, Mixon notes mobilizer groups have to be extra careful about extending help this election cycle. \u201cThe law is you have to be 150ft from the building where people are voting, or 25 feet from voters who are standing in line to wait to vote,\u201d Mixon says. \u201cWe ordered tape measures that are 150ft long and spray chalk, and we mark that off so that we are following the law.\u201d With mobilizing groups forbidden from approaching voters to make sure they\u2019re at the right place (much less offer them water), volunteers can basically only wave and smile and yell and hope lost voters approach them. Mixon made herself easy enough to find outside the mall with a sign urging passers by to remind friends to vote. The Guardian\u2019s Andrew Lawrence reports from Atlanta Mike South cast his ballot at Grace International Church with the economy top of mind. \u201cMy retirement has shrunk by 50%,\u201d he said. To say he worked hard for it barely tells the story. After launching a decade long career at Nasa as computers expert following the Challenger explosion, South, 64, pivoted to directing and acting in adult movies before cementing his legend as an industry gossip columnist. In 2013, CNBC pronounced him one of porn\u2019s 10 most powerful people. Porn drove his political engagement. \u201cThere was a time when free speech would\u2019ve been an issue, especially in Atlanta,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the people in my business are hardcore Democrats, but I kinda stand out because I\u2019m more libertarian \u2013 which I would expect them to be.\u201d South says he voted for libertarian candidates whenever possible, including in the senate race between Herschel Walker and Raphael Warnock. (\u201cThe truth is I don\u2019t like either one of them,\u201d he quipped, as his support dog Lola heeled.) Third-party voters could have a significant impact on that race, which is trending closer toward another senate runoff. A new Warnock ad tips voters to the possibility of having to return to the polls again over the holiday season. After being barraged with campaign ads for the past seven years, in the country, South winces at the thought of yet another trip to the polls. \u201cI\u2019m over it.\u201d Election officials in Georgia\u2019s largest county removed two workers from a polling site on the morning of Tuesday\u2019s midterm races after their colleagues shared social media posts of the pair at the US Capitol attack on 6 January 2021. Fulton county elections officials told media outlets that they fired the workers \u2013 a mother and her son \u2013 about 15 minutes before the polls opened Tuesday morning. They had been assigned to a polling site at a library in the community of Johns Creek. The mother and son fell under scrutiny after the woman made a comment that caught the attention of a colleague while they were at an event for poll workers, Fulton county\u2019s interim elections director, Nadine Williams, told the local news station WSB-TV. Colleagues of the woman also found social media posts by her which were reported to the county, WSB-TV added. Williams would not elaborate on the nature of the posts. But the Washington Post reported that it was provided with copies of the social media screeds in question, and they showed the woman\u2019s family forming part of the mob of Donald Trump supporters who staged the Capitol attack. According to the newspaper, one of the posts read: \u201cI stood up for what\u2019s right today in Washington DC. This election was a sham. [Trump vice-president] Mike Pence is a traitor. I was tear gassed FOUR times. I have pepper spray in my throat. I stormed the Capitol building. And my children have had the best learning experience of their lives.\u201d Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in a failed attempt to prevent the congressional certification of the former Republican president\u2019s defeat to his Democratic rival Joe Biden in the 2020 election. One of the mob\u2019s stated aims was to hang Pence after it falsely accused him of failing to avail himself of the ability to single-handedly prevent Biden\u2019s certification. Officials have linked nine deaths to the insurrection, including suicides by law enforcement officers traumatized after successfully defending the building from the pro-Trump mob. Hundreds of participants have been charged criminally in connection with the attack, and many have either pleaded guilty or otherwise have been convicted over their roles. During the 2020 presidential race, Fulton county experienced long lines at the polls, administrative mistakes and death threats against election workers. The Washington Post reported that the turmoil during the election two years earlier prompted Fulton county to prepare for Tuesday\u2019s midterms \u2013 which many regard as a referendum on American democracy \u2013 by assigning police to more than half of its 300 or so polling places, with other officers patrolling between sites. Georgia is holding some of Tuesday\u2019s most-closely watched elections, including the race between incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker that could determine which political party controls the US Senate. A rematch from the 2018 electoral showdown between incumbent Republican governor Brian Kemp and Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams is also being watched nationwide on Tuesday. When Jeff Zapor showed up at his polling place in South Lyon, in the Detroit suburbs, on Tuesday, the most pressing race on his mind was the contest for secretary of state, the elected official who oversees voting and elections in Michigan. That in itself is extraordinary. Long overlooked downballot races, there has been an enormous amount of attention on secretary of state races since the 2020 election, when their role in overseeing vote counting came into focus as Donald Trump tried to overturn the election. Michigan is one of several states where the Republican nominee for secretary of state questioned and tried to overturned the results of the 2020 race. Standing outside his polling place, an elementary school, Michigan, Zapor said he voted for Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, who is running for a second term. She leads her opponent Kristina Karamo, a community college professor, in the polls. \u201cI think election deniers on the ballot is a very dangerous thing,\u201d Zapor, a 46-year-old mental health counselor said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running on a platform of complete abject falsehoods, to me, that shows a complete lack of character. And you\u2019re running for the exact wrong reason.\u201d Zapor added that he was concerned that there could be a repeat of efforts to overturn the election, like there were in 2020. \u201cI think it\u2019s a certainty. I\u2019m very concerned. Both in Michigan and in the nation, in 2024, I guess even in this election, will continue to be divisive and to see violence would not surprise me. I really hope I\u2019m wrong, but that\u2019s what I think,\u201d he said. South Lyon is a competitive area in Oakland county, a battleground in Michigan. Another voter, who would only give his middle name, Alex, said he was also deeply concerned about election denialism. \u201cI\u2019m concerned in general that the truth in general has eluded us and many will continue to leverage what happened in 2020 and for false information in general,\u201d he said. Another voter, who would only give his first name, Tom, said he voted for Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, because she was the \u201clesser of two evils.\u201d He said he also voted for Benson, who sees the state\u2019s motor vehicle offices in addition to elections, because he recently had a quick appointment renewing his driver\u2019s license. \u201cShe did what she said he was going to do,\u201d he said. In Michigan, students are coming out for Slotkin in Lansing, whether they like her or not. \u201cI don\u2019t like much about Slotkin, but everyone else was worse,\u201d said Kathryne Ford, 26, a biochemistry PHD candidate at Michigan State University outside of the Don Johnson Fieldhouse this morning. Ford called Slotkin a \u201ccop\u201d, with reference to her career as a CIA analyst, but lists abortion restrictions as her top concern this election cycle. \u201cAbortion is a human right. The government should not be able to control what happens to your own body,\u201d she said. Camille Mikolas, 25, wore braids and a big smile as she went to cast her vote for Slotkin. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have a baby!\u201d she laughed. Talking about her support for the referendum looking to enshrine abortion rights in Michigan\u2019s state constitution, she added \u201cConservatives are pretty good at saying my body my choice when it comes to vaccines or whatever, but not when it comes to this. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\u201d Mikolas said she\u2019ll be voting Democrat down the ticket today. But the issue runs both ways for other voters. \u201cI like Elissa,\u201d said Belinda Fitzpatrick, 59, a swing voter. \u201cBut I voted against her. My biggest issue is the abortion thing. People are just using it like contraception,\u201d said Fitzpatrick, who said she will also be voting against the proposal to enshrine abortion rights. Fitzpatrick will vote Republican down the ticket, as Michiganders also choose their governor and attorney general today. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for Republicans to have the power back,\u201d she said. Trump briefly stopped to speak with reporters outside the polling place, confirming that he did vote for incumbent Florida governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican. Donald Trump has cast his vote during today\u2019s midterm election, with photos captured of him and Melania Trump outside a Florida polling place. Over in Kentucky, Ona Marshall, who is a co-owner of one of the last two abortion clinics left in Kentucky, said the line was overflowing at the polling location where she went to vote today in Louisville, around 11am. \u201cNot even in a presidential year have we seen that number of people, and this is mid-morning,\u201d she said. Of course, there\u2019s no way of knowing whether those voters were out in favor of or against Amendment 2, the ballot proposal looking to restrict abortion in Kentucky. But Marshall said she is hopeful. \u201cWhatever happens, for our country and democracy, it\u2019s extremely important that we have a higher turnout at the polls for every election, so to see it in a midterm election is definitely hopeful,\u201d she said. Maggie Acosta, an organizer door-knocking for Democratic candidates with the hospitality union Unite Here, noted she has heard from many fellow Arizonans who are outraged over the supreme court\u2019s recent decision to overturn Roe v Wade. \u201cInstead of going forward, I\u2019m being pushed back,\u201d Acosta said. \u201cSo it\u2019s time that we stand up and fight for what we deserve.\u201d The results of today\u2019s election could have sweeping implications for abortion access in Arizona, which has a pre-Roe abortion ban still on the books. If Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs cannot win today, Republican lawmakers may move to enforce that law, which has become the subject of court battles. Vice-President Kamala Harris touched on those stakes yesterday, when she participated in a virtual reception with Unite Here organizers. Acosta had the chance to pose a question to Harris, and she asked the vice-president for her message to young women who are devastated by the end of Roe. \u201cKnow your power,\u201d Harris replied. \u201cSo many of our movements that have been about progress have been led by young leaders, and we need them now. We need them to lead.\u201d Carlisa Johnson reports for the Guardian in Georgia: Georgia voters will decide between Democrat Stacey Abrams and the incumbent Republican governor, Brian Kemp. This race has received immense national attention as it set the stage for the rematch of Abrams and Kemp this election season. However, the gubernatorial race isn\u2019t the only race receiving national attention. Georgia\u2019s Senate race could determine which party holds power next year in the nation\u2019s capital. Current Senator Raphael Warnock is facing off against controversial Republican candidate Herschel Walker. Coleman Williams, a voter in Avondale Estates, Georgia, said he feels the weight of this election as a Georgia voter. \u201cI\u2019ve watched the debates, and there\u2019s just so much at stake for everyone,\u201d said Williams. \u201cI\u2019m feeling nervous but hopeful because Georgia knows that we have to get out there, and we clearly have.\u201d Maggie Acosta has been knocking on the doors of her Arizona neighbors for months, trying to convince them to support Democrats in the midterm elections. Acosta, a member of the hospitality union Unite Here, has participated in campaign work since 2017, and she said the stakes feel particularly high this time around. \u201cThis is very important \u2013 not only for me, but for my future, my kids, my grandchild,\u201d Acosta said. This election cycle, Unite Here\u2019s organizers have been on the ground in four battleground states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Collectively, the union\u2019s members have knocked on 2.7 million doors, including 750,000 in Acosta\u2019s home state of Arizona. Unite Here\u2019s work builds on their momentum from 2020, when the union knocked on 3 million doors after developing a contactless canvassing plan to keep organizers safe from coronavirus. Acosta, a cancer survivor, had her concerns about door-knocking in 2020, but she chose to do so in part because of her outrage over Republicans\u2019 handling of the pandemic. Now she has returned to her post, in the hopes of electing Senator Mark Kelly and gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs, both of whom are locked in closely contested races. \u201cNo house is going to be left unknocked,\u201d Acosta said. \u201cI feel like being out there and talking to people face to face is the only way that we\u2019re going to make a difference.\u201d Typically, a party\u2019s soul searching begins after the polls close and the results are in. But not this year. Democrats, anticipating heavy losses after a seesaw election season, were already pointing fingers. It began weeks ago. In an op-ed for the Guardian, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the party\u2019s progressive standard-bearer, blamed Democrats for failing to deliver a strong economic message that addresses the pocketbook concerns of most Americans. \u201cIn my view,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit would be political malpractice for Democrats to ignore the state of the economy and allow Republican lies and distortions to go unanswered.\u201d Meanwhile, many top Democrats say their party mishandled the issue of crime and public safety. Stanley Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, argued in the American Prospect that the party had badly mishandled the issue of crime and public safety, writing that the 2022 midterms would be remembered \u201cas a toxic campaign, but an effective one in labeling Democrats as \u2018pro-crime.\u2019\u201d But others say Democrats\u2019 challengers are much deeper. A policy memo released on the eve of the election, the centrist Democratic think-tank Third Way concluded that the party\u2019s brand had become toxic to swing voters. \u201cDespite a roster of GOP candidates who are extreme by any standard, voters see Democrats as just as extreme, as well as far less concerned about the issues that most worry them,\u201d it stated. Progressives wholeheartedly disagree. A pre-election memo from the Working Families Party national director, Maurice Mitchell, credits progressives for pushing Biden to deliver on key parts of his economic agenda. \u201cDemocrats\u2019 passing big and popular legislation and Republican extremism have kept many races much closer than the normal midterm patterns would dictate,\u201d Mitchell wrote. But he warned: \u201cIf Democrats face significant losses, those failures of governance and the Democrats who blocked a pro-working-class agenda will bear much of the blame.\u201d It\u2019s just after 12pm here in New York, which means that voting is well under way in most places across the country. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s happening at polling locations across the US. In Columbus, Ohio, Jeffrey Weisman voted for the bestselling author and Republican candidate for the US Senate, JD Vance. But not with great enthusiasm. \u201cI vote Republican pretty much all the way and that is my main reason why,\u201d he said. Vance has a slim lead over his Democratic rival, Tim Ryan, in a state that has come to give large majorities to Republican candidates. The tight race in part reflects the strength of Ryan\u2019s campaign for a seat that may decide whether Democrats retain control of the Senate. But it\u2019s also a reflection of voter doubts about Vance\u2019s sincerity after he dramatically shifted from slagging off Trump as a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cmoral disaster\u201d to becoming a fervent supporter in order to win his endorsement in the Republican primaries. Weisman, who owns a retail jewellery store, said it didn\u2019t matter that Vance was endorsed by former president Donald Trump. \u201cI like the Republicans\u2019 stuff when it comes more to the economy. I\u2019m a business owner and I feel that things are not going in the right direction with the Democrats in charge. I\u2019m hoping that maybe the Republicans in charge will get things going a little better economy wise,\u201d he said. Weisman twice voted for Trump in the presidential elections. But with the former president apparently on the brink of announcing another run for the White House, Weisman would prefer he stayed out. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one. I like his politics. His mouth scares a lot of people. So I personally do not think he can win because of the mouth, the controversialness of him. And so I think that would be a tough road for him,\u201d he said. Dani Anguiano is reporting for the Guardian in Las Vegas: The fate of the Senate could lie in the hands of voters in Nevada where incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto is locked in a close race with Adam Laxalt, the Republican former state attorney general who aided in efforts to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state. The contest between Cortez Masto, the first Latina senator and successor to the late Democratic leader Harry Reid, and Laxalt has been neck and neck. Laxalt has received the endorsement of Donald Trump, the NRA and Ron DeSantis, while Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and 14 members of Laxalt\u2019s family have backed Cortez Masto. The race, said to be among the closest of this year\u2019s contests, is crucial for Democrats to maintain control of the Senate. Laxalt has sought to appeal to voters by focusing on the economy, which more than one in four voters have said is the most important issue facing the state, and tying Cortez Masto to Joe Biden, who has low approval rates in Nevada. Democrats rallying for the senator have critisized Laxalt for his opposition to reproductive freedom and argued he is in the pocket of big oil as the state sees record high gas prices. \u201cSo you see, gas prices going up, grocery prices going up \u2013 that takes a bite out of your paycheck. It\u2019s no joke. It hurts. The question, though, you should be asking is \u2013 who\u2019s going to actually try to do something about it?\u201d Obama said at an event for Cortez Masto. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t forgotten where she came from. Which is why she\u2019s gone after big oil for high gas prices, why she takes on pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug costs.\u201d Cortez Masto has the backing of the local Culinary Workers Union, which is running a campaign to knock on one million doors by election day. Canvassers with the union say the voters they talk to are concerned about growing housing costs and inflation. \u201cEveryone is working side hustles to be able to live a normal life,\u201d said Arlett Tovar, a canvasser with the union. \u201cVegas used to be such a great affordable place to live and it\u2019s not anymore.\u201d Sam Levine is reporting for the Guardian in Detroit, Michigan: I\u2019m here at Greater Grace temple, a polling site in north-west Detroit. About 400-500 people have voted here so far, the polling site manager told me. Many voters have already cast their ballots by mail, the manager said. There were some glitches with the e-poll books used to check in voters this morning, but those have been fixed. Among other issues, the system was showing that some voters had already cast a mail-in ballot. She also said there haven\u2019t been any incidents involving intimidation or poll watchers, which has been a big concern in Michigan. Xhosoli Nmumhad, 35, said she\u2019s only voted twice before, once in 2008 and then again in 2012 for Barack Obama. But she said she kept seeing political commercials on television and was motivated to vote on Tuesday to support a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would dramatically expand voting rights in Michigan. \u201cI believe everyone should be able to vote,\u201d she said. Ruth Draines, 72, another voter here, said she always voted in elections. This cycle, she said she was motivated by another proposal on the ballot that would amend the state constitution to protect access to abortion. \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that they want to take away a woman\u2019s right. Because some women get raped and they don\u2019t want to be reminded of that,\u201d she said. So basically that\u2019s one of the big motivator.\u201d Draines said she wasn\u2019t particularly concerned this cycle about efforts to overturn the election. \u201cI think that\u2019s all just hype,\u201d she said. She added that she thinks Michigan\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat on the ballot for re-election today, has been doing a \u201cpretty good job\u201d. \u201cI just hopes she keeps up the good work,\u201d she said. Residents of a New Orleans suburb who were casting ballots for the midterm elections Tuesday were navigating more than their fair share of hurdles to exercise their right to vote. A bomb threat to a school in Kenner, Louisiana, which was a polling site for a couple of precincts in the city of about 65,000 people, on Tuesday morning forced vote workers to relocate the site, John Tobler \u2013 a spokesperson for the state\u2019s top elections official \u2013 told the Guardian. The threat to the Kenner Discovery school displaced the polling site set up there to the campus of Audubon elementary about a mile and a half away, Tobler said. Kenner\u2019s police chief, Keith Conley, confirmed to the Guardian that officers were investigating a bomb threat to Kenner Discovery, which was closed for class to allow to the school to serve as a polling site. But officials said there was no indication the threat, which affected more than 2,500 voters across two precincts, was politically motivated. Louisiana\u2019s top elections official, the secretary of state R Kyle Ardoin, said the early findings of an investigation into the threat suggested the motive was unrelated to politics. Conley added that it was the second similar threat to Kenner Discovery in the last five days. Local reports said the earlier threat on 3 November \u2013 which came in when there were no election-related activities at the school \u2013 demanded payment in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Though it has a significant population of Black and Latino residents, Kenner\u2019s white majority tends to overwhelmingly side with Republican political candidates. Much of the city \u2013 including the Kenner Discovery polling site \u2013 sits in the congressional district of the Republican House whip, Steve Scalise, who is projected to cruise to re-election in Tuesday\u2019s midterms. Officials nationwide have been concerned about political violence in general in recent years after cases such as the US Capitol insurrection on 6 January 2021 and the attack that left House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul Pelosi, critically injured on 28 October. Tuesday\u2019s threat at Kenner Discovery came after Ardoin\u2019s office announced that a mobile app, an online portal and a telephone hotline containing polling place and ballot information for Louisiana voters were all \u201cexperiencing technical difficulties\u201d within hours of the polls opening Tuesday. Ardoin, a Republican, later said the technical issues had been resolved. Carlisa Johnson reports for the Guardian in Georgia: In Georgia, election day has started without issue. Voters are experiencing limited wait times across the state as they vote in person. Many attribute this to the record-breaking early voting the state saw last month. Still, Georgia\u2019s polling locations are seeing a steady stream of concerned voters making their voices heard in this critical election. Georgia\u2019s secretary of state reports that Georgians are accessing their voter information in record numbers. This morning, voters accessed their \u201cMy Voter Page\u201d \u2013 which confirms a voter\u2019s registration and polling location \u2013 on the Secretary of State website at a rate of 19,215 users a minute. SB202, Georgia\u2019s new election law, eliminated access to provisional ballots for voters who go to the wrong polling location on election day. Voting advocates throughout the state are working diligently to remind voters of this change and the importance of confirming their polling locations. Mariah Headman is a Dekalb county resident and a Georgia teacher. While she has voted absentee in the past, voting in person on election day was more convenient for her this year. She says she is voting with her students in mind. \u201cFor me, voting means the difference between well-funded public schools or underfunded ones,\u201d said Headman. \u201cThis election is huge, and Georgia has to pull through.\u201d Outside a voting station at the largest Greek Orthodox church in Ohio, Ashley Sica said her vote for the Democrat Tim Ryan in the election for the US Senate was decided by the US supreme court ruling striking down abortion as a constitutional right. \u201cI voted based off of my values, and maybe not necessarily what I would do, but just thinking globally of choices that other people should be able to have. I don\u2019t think that government officials should be in charge what people do with their own bodies,\u201d she said. Sica, a nurse, said that the removal of the right to abortion motivated a lot of women to vote in the midterms who might not usually turn out. Sica said she was also frightened by the Republicans\u2019 blocking of tighter gun control laws even after a series of school massacres. \u201cMy children\u2019s daycare is just a mile from here. There was an issue with someone shooting a gun around their daycare. So that\u2019s another thing that kind of brought me out to vote for stricter laws in regards to guns. Having kids that are of school age now really brings that kind of thing into focus, thinking about their safety and the safety of others,\u201d she said. The US Senate election in Pennsylvania is expected to be one of the closest in the country, as John Fetterman, the state\u2019s Democratic lieutenant governor, takes on Mehmet Oz, a Republican celebrity doctor. Fetterman held a commanding lead in the polls for months, but in the days ahead of the vote Mehmet Oz has closed the gap, and the race appears to be a toss-up. Fetterman had a stroke in May, and continues to have issues with speaking and processing the spoken word \u2013 something that was laid bare in a difficult debate performance two weeks ago. Fetterman and his team have insisted he is fit and able to work, but his health and recovery has been cruelly mocked by Oz\u2019s campaign. \u201cI liked Fetterman, except for the man had a stroke,\u201d said Steve Schwartz, who had just cast his vote for Oz in Beaver county, 30 miles north-west of Pittsburgh. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if he can drive to work yet. You don\u2019t wanna hire him and then he\u2019s going to be on disability for a little bit. I don\u2019t think his health allows him to do what he\u2019s doing right now.\u201d Schwartz, who also voted for the Republican candidates for governor and the US House, said he would have \u201cseriously considered\u201d Fetterman, were it not for the stroke. Beaver county, named after the Beaver River, which is named after either the Lenape chief King Beaver or the animal the beaver, voted for Trump in 2020 and 2016, but Trump\u2019s margin of victory was smaller here than in other counties. Mike Moore, a 41-year-old loan closer, said he had voted for Fetterman for Senate. \u201cI like the way he is, I\u2019ve met him a couple of times, he seems like a real genuine guy. I kind of don\u2019t like Dr. Oz, because he doesn\u2019t live in Pennsylvania \u2013 and that\u2019s kind of like: \u2018How can he represent me?\u2019\u201d Moore said, referencing Oz\u2019s long-term residency in New Jersey. Oz lived in a mansion in New Jersey for decades, but has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020. The most important issue for Moore, he said, was \u201cbipartisanship\u201d, something that seems unlikely to spring from this midterm cycle. \u201cThis country is so polarized now, it\u2019s a shame. You know, we got to work together. We got to be Americans.\u201d This midterm election is already the most expensive in history, and depending on how today goes, it could get even more pricey. Spending on this election season has exceeded $16.7bn across federal and local candidates \u2013 over $2bn more than the 2018 midterms. Federal candidates have spent over $8.9bn while state candidates, party committees and ballot measure committees have spent $7.8bn, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks campaign spending. The arrival of election day doesn\u2019t mean the spending will stop, especially if runoff elections have to take place. The race for a Georgia Senate seat between incumbent Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker \u2013 a race that has been riddled with controversy \u2013 could lead to a runoff in December if neither candidate gets over 50% of the vote. Both parties have already spent over $241m on the race \u2013 what the Wall Street Journal calculated is $30.83 for each of the state\u2019s 7.8 million registered voters. In Ohio, one of the most important races for Republican leaders is to take full control of the state supreme court. Control because candidates for the bench run not on their judicial qualifications but on party tickets with an implicit commitment to make decisions in line with their political values. Republicans have technically controlled the court since 1986, holding four of the seven seats. But one of the judges, the outgoing chief justice, Maureen O\u2019Connor, is widely regarded by the party leadership as having gone rogue by siding with Democrats in some politically sensitive cases including over gerrymandering. And now the highly contentious issues of abortion is likely to be on the agenda following the US supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade. The three conservative candidates, already on the court and seeking reelection, in recent days joined a Republican bus campaign tour alongside the party\u2019s contenders for the US Senate and state governor. No separation of powers there. At a stop in Columbus, one of the judges, Pat Fischer, told a rally that it was important to keep the court out of the hands of \u201cactivist judges that are Democrats\u201d. Not activist judges as such, just ones who are Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that the three of us win this race and we go back to having a conservative Ohio supreme court,\u201d he told the rally. The new state supreme court is expected to decide whether to let stand the state\u2019s ban on abortion beyond six weeks of pregnancy, brought in after Roe v Wade was overturned. A lower court blocked the measure last month. Although the three Republican contenders for the court all say they will apply the law and not political judgements, each has already made clear their opposition to abortion. Another of the Republican judges, Sharon Kennedy, is running to become chief justice. She has indicated that she would not enforce previous court rulings to stop Ohio\u2019s Republican legislature from gerrymandering elections. The Florida state department sent a letter to the US Department of Justice saying that federal election monitors won\u2019t be permitted inside the state\u2019s polling places. Florida\u2019s state department said that the monitors \u201cwould be counterproductive and could potentially undermine confidence in the election\u201d. The justice department regularly sends monitors to states on Election Day in an attempt to curb voter intimidation at polling places. Yesterday, the department said it would send out workers to 64 jurisdictions across 24 states. In 2020, the department sent out workers to 44 jurisdictions. The states include key swing districts in Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania. \u201cMonitors will include personnel from the Civil Rights Division and from US attorneys\u2019 offices,\u201d the department said in a statement. Florida\u2019s state department said the DOJ did not \u201cdetail the need for federal monitors\u201d in the state. \u201cNone of the counties are currently subject to any election-related federal consent decrees. None of the counties have been accused of violating the rights of language or racial minorities or of the elderly or disabled,\u201d the letter said. While Louisiana isn\u2019t expected to see many surprises during today\u2019s midterm elections, voters there were among those enduring technical difficulties to cast their ballots. The secretary of state, R Kyle Ardoin, Louisiana\u2019s top election official, said a mobile app, an online portal and a telephone hotline containing polling place and ballot information were all \u201cexperiencing technical difficulties\u201d within hours of the polls opening Tuesday. Ardoin, a Republican, by midday said the technical problems had been resolved. Before the issues were taken care of, Ardoin had directed residents to call the registrar of voters office in their parish \u2013 which is the term Louisiana uses for county \u2013 or to email his office at elections@sos.la.gov to ask any necessary questions. Ardoin\u2019s announcement came after officials in Virginia reported technical difficulties with equipment that verifies\u2019 voter information and poll staff in Texas said they were having problems with check-in machines. The Republican party\u2019s whip in the US House of Representatives, Steve Scalise, is among those up for re-election in Louisiana on Tuesday. So is Republican US Senator John N Kennedy. Both are expected to cruise to re-election. Outside the Eastern high school athletic club in Lansing, Michigan on a small patch of neatly trimmed grass, Elissa Slotkin \u2013 a congresswoman running in the most expensive house race in the country, spoke to reporters. She cast her vote alongside a steady stream of voters around 9am. Slotkin seemed disturbed but prepared for attempts already being made to undermine election results in Michigan \u2013 on Monday, a judge dismissed an attempt by Republicans to toss out votes in Detroit as lacking a \u201cshred of evidence\u201d. \u201cThis is what happens when a leadership climate is set in our country, trying to undercut democracy when one side loses. It\u2019s unclear what my opponent will do if he loses. The good news is, we\u2019ve seen this movie before \u2013 in 2020 \u2013 we were prepared,\u201d said Slotkin. She said it was undeniable that inflation has been on everybody\u2019s mind in Michigan, but added that ballot initiative to protect abortion in Michigan is a \u201ccountervailing wind\u201d. \u201cI was at the Michigan State rally last night with campus organizers, and Roe v Wade is really motivating students,\u201d she said. A few polling places have reported technical issues this morning. The Virginia elections department confirmed that there were issues with polling books, which verifies voters\u2019 information. The department said the issue has been resolved, though one poll worker told Kelly Avellino of local news station NBC12 that they were still have issues with their poll books. In Temple, Texas, some elections staff noticed technical issues with their check-in machines. \u201cAt this time, it is possible that some sites will experience delays this morning, but election officials are confident that the problem has been isolated and should be resolved quickly,\u201d James Stafford, a local official, said in a news release. Elections departments are under heavy pressure to ensure smooth sailing at the polls today as some conservatives have essentially said they will fight election results if they lose, taking a page from Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 playbook. Reports of voter and election workers intimidation have also been seen recently, like people video-taping ballot drop-off boxes and tabulation offices in Arizona. An estimated 8.3 million young Americans are eligible to vote for the first time this election. The question remains how many of them \u2013 and other young voters \u2013 will turn out to the polls. When it comes to younger voters, the stakes are higher for Democrats than Republicans: 57% of young Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 favor a Democrat-controlled Congress over Republican control. But younger voters also tend to vote less than older voters (though more voted in 2020 than ever before). Early data has shown that young voters have been turning out in smaller fractions compared to the 2020 election. But young voters are less likely to vote early or by mail, so it\u2019s too early to tell exactly what their turnout will be today. Still, amid the uncertainty, some young voters have already visited the polls today. One mom in Georgia, Christy Houchins, an immigrant from Laos who became a citizen, brought her daughter to the polls today, according to Greg Bluestein of the Atlanta Journal Constitution. This is Lauren Aratani taking over for Martin Belam. More polls have opened up around the country, and many voters have already casted their ballots this morning. Here are some pictures that have been taken at polling places around the country as election day gets rolling. In the past, midterm elections have been kind of predictable. The president is slightly unpopular, his party loses some seats and most voters disappear for two years until they turn up in greater numbers for the main show. This year might not buck any of those long-term trends. The Democratic president Joe Biden has watched his popularity slump from 53% to 42% over the past year. Polls suggest that Republicans will win the House of Representatives and might even win the Senate too (though if they do, it\u2019s likely to be by a narrower margin). And even though turnout is looking set to be historically high by midterm standards, it\u2019s unlikely to beat the numbers in 2020. So, it\u2019s all pretty much electoral business as usual, right? Not quite. Here are some of the factors that could shape the votes that come in over the next few days \u2013 and, as a result, shape the country over the next few years. Redistricting Under Trump, gerrymandering and other anti-democratic measures scaled up. There have been concerns about the way that kind of partisan redistricting might play out in this year\u2019s elections \u2013 where the electoral district is purple, this is likely to work in Republicans\u2019 favor including parts of Texas and Florida. But, as the New York Times pointed out in September, this might not wind up being such a huge advantage for Republicans. While it\u2019s true that the map does work in their favor, the edge isn\u2019t insurmountable for Democrats (and it certainly isn\u2019t irreversible either). Restrictions In the space of just six months, 22 new laws were passed in 2021 that restricted people\u2019s access to vote in 14 states. Research from the Brennan centre has indicated that voter suppression is at its worst level in over a decade. Whether those laws make it hard to count mail-in ballots or make it difficult to vote in person, their overall effect tends to disenfranchise those who are already disempowered by other systems in the country \u2013 whether it\u2019s people with disabilities or people of color who are more likely to be affected by voter ID laws. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that laws like these are uncommon in most other countries that call themselves democracies. Republicans have led these efforts in the hopes that voter access laws will work in their favor. Abortion and the economy Sure, there are the same ideological arguments about immigration and the economy that show up in any election but this year feels different. There is a general atmosphere of distrust fueled by attacks on election officials and lies about \u201cstolen\u201d ballots that has led some to feel that they are voting about democracy itself. And, since the supreme court\u2019s 1973 Roe v Wade decision was overturned in June, this year\u2019s vote has for many felt like a vote about abortion access. Even the economy has taken on a greater urgency than in recent midterms with rising consumer prices squeezing many US household budgets. Lastly, polling is still deeply problematic so all predictions about the House and the Senate should be treated with caution until the votes are counted. A Wall Street Journal survey that found white suburban women are switching parties was based on just 297 respondents (which, shockingly, is actually a pretty good response rate for such a specific slice of the country). That kind of research is not only imprecise but it has the potential to be undemocratic when headlines tell voters what the future looks like before they have even had their say. Read more of Mona Chalabi\u2019s analysis here: Officials in Philadelphia have said that counting votes will take longer than expected after a last minute u-turn to reinstate what is known as poll book reconciliation. The process, described as \u201ctime consuming and labor-intensive\u201d by the Philadelphia Inquirer, is used to flag mail ballots submitted by voters who also voted in person. City officials had agreed last week not to use it, but following a flurry of Republican lawsuits at an emergency meeting this morning just as polls opened, they reversed the decision. It could have an impact on how quickly the Pennsylvania senate race can be called. Jason Lange is in Washington for Reuters and he has a warning \u2013 be ready for a long night and maybe days of waiting before it is clear whether Republicans or President Joe Biden\u2019s Democrats will control Congress. He reports that with dozens of races expected to be close and key states like Pennsylvania already warning it could take days to count every ballot, experts say there\u2019s a good chance America goes to bed on election night without knowing who won. \u201cWhen it comes to knowing the results, we should move away from talking about election day and think instead about election week,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, who publishes the nonpartisan newsletter Inside Elections. Because Democrats vote by mail more often than Republicans, states that let officials get an early jump on counting mail ballots could report big Democratic leads early on that evaporate as vote counters work through piles of Republican-leaning ballots that were cast on election day. In these \u201cblue mirage\u201d states - which include Florida and North Carolina - election officials are allowed to remove mail ballots from their envelopes before election day and load them in vote counting machines, allowing for speedy counting. States including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin don\u2019t allow officials to open the envelopes until election day, leading to a possible \u201cred mirage\u201d in which Republican-leaning election day ballots are reported earlier, with many Democratic-leaning mail ballots counted later. Experts like Joe Lenski, co-founder of Edison Research, which will be tracking hundreds of races on Tuesday and supplying Reuters and other media organizations with results, will keep an eye on the mix of different types of ballots each state is counting throughout the night. \u201cBlue mirage, red mirage, whatever. You just have to look at what types of votes are getting reported to know where you are in that state,\u201d said Lenski. A number of candidates will make history if they prevail in their races today. In particular, the departure of 46 members from the House of Representatives has created an opening for a new class of young and diverse candidates to seek federal office. Two House candidates, Democrat Maxwell Frost of Florida and Republican Karoline Leavitt of New Hampshire, would become the first Gen Z members of Congress if they win their elections. Leavitt would also set a record as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress if she can defeat Democrat Chris Pappas in their hotly contested race, which is considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report. In Vermont, Democrat Becca Balint is favored to win her House race, which would make her the first woman and the first openly LGBTQ+ politician to represent the state in Congress. If Balint wins, all 50 US states will have sent at least one woman to Congress, as Vermont became the sole outlier on that metric in 2018. Some House races will even make history regardless of which party\u2019s candidate prevails. In New York\u2019s third congressional district, either Democrat Robert Zimmerman or Republican George Devolder-Santos will become the first openly gay person to represent Long Island in the House. As Republicans look to take back the House, their playbook has relied upon nominating a diverse slate of candidates in battleground districts that will probably determine control of the lower chamber. The strategy builds upon the party\u2019s momentum from 2020, when Republicans flipped 14 House districts where they nominated a woman or a person of color. Overall, Republicans have nominated 67 candidates of color in House races, according to the National Republican Congressional Committee. Those candidates could allow the party to dramatically expand its ranks of members of color, given that just 19 non-white Republicans serve in the House now. With Republicans heavily favored to take back the House, many of those candidates of color could join the new session of Congress in January. Read more of Joan E Greve\u2019s report here: Midterm elections \u2013 the candidates who will make history if they win Here are some of the earliest images we\u2019ve been sent over the newswires of people voting in-person as polling gets underway in today\u2019s crucial midterm elections in the US. Paul J Webber and Acacia Coronado have been in Austin, Texas for Associated Press, and report on a trio of US House races in South Texas which carry high stakes. For decades Republicans rarely bothered to compete along the US-Mexico border, but have made the heavily Hispanic region a priority in their pursuit of retaking control of Congress. The unusually competitive atmosphere in South Texas, including for Democratic US Rep Henry Cuellar, underlines the shifting political winds in an important stronghold for Democrats \u2014 and the ramifications beyond this election. For Republicans, victories by any of three Latina candidates running for House seats in the region \u2014 Rep Mayra Flores, Monica De La Cruz and Cassy Garcia \u2014 would deepen inroads the Republican party is making nationally with Hispanic voters, and demoralise Democrats in a place that has long been their turf. In a sign of Republican optimism, Gov Greg Abbott was hosting his Election Night party in the border city of McAllen, reflecting Republican eagerness to show conservatives are expanding their territory. The Republicans unleashed an aggressive play for South Texas after counties up and down the border swung toward former president Donald Trump in 2020, stunning Democrats who viewed the region safe and creating a new battleground overnight. Millions of dollars have since poured into the region, and all three Republican House candidates out-raised their Democratic opponents this summer. Underscoring the intensity of the races heading into Tuesday, former president Bill Clinton swung through South Texas on Monday to campaign for the Democratic party. Big-name Republicans have also swooped into the region, including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy over the weekend. The most widely seen competitive race was in the 15th Congressional District, where De La Cruz and Democrat Michelle Vallejo were competing to represent one of the two new US House districts that Texas was awarded last year following the release of new census figures. Neither candidate was running to the middle with their policy platforms. De La Cruz has defended abortion restrictions, promised tougher border security measures and drew praise from Trump during a recent rally in Texas. Vallejo has courted liberal voters in a progressive campaign that has called for a $15 an hour minimum wage and challenged conventional wisdom that Democrats along the border are more moderate. Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University and host of the podcast America Explained, and he writes for the Guardian today to argue that the future of American democracy is at stake in the midterm elections: Never before in American history has there been an organized movement which was only one vote away from having the motivation and opportunity to make that election America\u2019s last. Never that is, until now. Today\u2019s anti-democratic movement is propelled not by genuine controversy or scandal, but rather by their commitment to ending competitive elections in the United States. There is no other way to interpret their belief that only one side, the Republicans, can legitimately be considered to win, and the plans that they hold to make this belief a reality. The problems can be expected to start this November, when Republican candidates who lose will question the validity of the results and try to stir unrest. State officials who do win will begin to act on their plans to sabotage future polls by centralizing power in their own offices, de-registering millions of voters, and moving to error-prone hand-counting systems. Then, if voter suppression doesn\u2019t prevent a Democratic win in 2024, they\u2019ll just suppress the evidence instead and announce that they are sending Republican electors to the electoral college. Meanwhile, the majority of Republican House candidates in 2022 are election-deniers, and a Republican-controlled Congress might attempt to sabotage the certification of the presidential vote on 6 January 2025. Each of these potential points of failure threatens the integrity of the 2024 presidential election. The breadth and depth of the anti-democratic movement also means that they are likely to pose other problems which are difficult to anticipate. Whatever means they find of sabotaging the vote, it would be foolish to rely on the conservative-dominated supreme court to stop them, particularly if the country has been plunged into civil unrest and violence. Read more here: Andrew Gawthorpe \u2013 The future of American democracy is at stake in the midterm elections If you would like something to listen to about the US midterm elections, then Today in Focus is for you. Today\u2019s edition is called US midterms: is it still the economy, stupid? and it features the Guardian\u2019s Washington correspondent Lauren Gambino talking to Michael Safi. She tells him that the Democratic party has learned the hard way to keep its election campaigns laser-focused on the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d a slogan used in Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, has resonated down the ages. But Democrats have spent much of the past few months campaigning on women\u2019s rights after the seismic supreme court decision removing the constitutional right to abortion. And Joe Biden used his final major speech of the campaign to warn voters of the threat to democracy itself. Democrats go into these elections lagging in the polls, she says, and it\u2019s left some hardened campaigners, such as Bernie Sanders, wondering if the party has neglected its most famous mantra. You can listen to it here: Joe Biden had a late night last night, after appearing at a rally in Maryland, where he said \u201cOur lifetimes are going to be shaped by what happens the next year to three years. It\u2019s going to shape what the next couple decades look like.\u201d Joan E Greve was in Bowie, Maryland for the Guardian, and reported that Biden repeated his promise to shore up abortion rights if Democrats expand their congressional majorities. The president and his wife, Dr Jill Biden, arrived back at the White House at around 1.20am. The Philadelphia Inquirer this morning has been touting a series of quotes from voters in the area which highlight the different priorities of Republican and Democratic party voters. Here are four quotes that they picked for their newsletter today: \u201cIt feels like a critical time. We\u2019ve got to pick a path, and the path that we\u2019re on is not right,\u201d Nate DeFazio, a small business owner worried about inflation, said outside of a Mehmet Oz rally. \u201cIf we do not maintain a majority in the Senate, Roe falling will be just the beginning,\u201d Ronna Dewey, 54, said at a John Fetterman rally. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to me to be able to graduate high school and enter adulthood in a state of having all my rights intact and not feeling like, \u2018Oh, I wish I\u2019d graduated 10 years ago,\u2019\u201d said Jordan Bailkin, a Democratic high school senior who is voting for the first time. \u201cPersonal freedom and the freedom to dissent \u2013 I feel that both of those things are under attack,\u201d Jason Dekker, a conservative from York County said. Overnight Stephen Collinson at CNN offered this analysis of how \u2013 and why \u2013 he expects things to pan out in favor of the Republicans in the next few days. He writes: It\u2019s too early for postmortems. Forty million Americans have already voted. And the uncertainty baked into modern polling means no one can be sure a red wave is coming. Democrats could still cling onto the Senate even if the House falls. But the way each side is talking on election eve, and the swathe of blue territory \u2013 from New York to Washington state \u2013 that Democrats are defending offer a clear picture of Republican momentum. A nation split down the middle politically, which is united only by a sense of dissatisfaction with its trajectory, is getting into a habit of repeatedly using elections to punish the party with the most power. That means Democrats are most exposed this time. If the president\u2019s party takes a drubbing, there will be much Democratic finger-pointing over Biden\u2019s messaging strategy on inflation \u2013 a pernicious force that has punched holes in millions of family budgets. Just as in last year\u2019s losing off-year gubernatorial race in Virginia, Democrats are closing the campaign warning about democracy and Trump\u2019s influence while Republicans believe they are addressing the issue voters care about most. We probably won\u2019t know the winners on election night In many races, we\u2019re not going to know who won on election night. After the polls close, candidate vote totals are likely to shift as local officials continue to count ballots. Once the polls close, election workers tabulate the votes in each precinct and transmit them to the county\u2019s central election office. Each county reports their results to the state. Vote totals are likely to shift throughout the evening as well as in the days that follow election day as votes continue to be counted. That shift isn\u2019t unusual and can be explained by two dynamics, said Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at MIT who specializes in election administration. First, he said, the places that report their votes first tend to be smaller, Republican jurisdictions. Second, many places report their in-person election day vote first and their mail-in absentee vote later. Those votes tend to skew towards Democrats. Because these totals can change, there should be deep skepticism of attempts to claim victory before votes are counted. Projections about which candidates will win are separate from official results As officials report election results, news organizations, including the Associated Press and major television networks, scrutinize data to try to make projections about which candidate will win. This process is independent of the official election efforts to count votes. In some races, experts are able to quickly make a projection about who is going to win a race. If a candidate from one party has consistently won a race, for example, and the voting patterns on election night appear to immediately be in line with previous elections, news organizations may feel confident in making a projection with only a fraction of the vote counted. But in competitive races where there\u2019s a slim margin between the candidates, and a lot of the vote hasn\u2019t been reported yet, experts are much more cautious and will not make a prediction. As the vote count continues, forecasters compare the margin separating the candidate with where in the state there are still votes outstanding. Once they feel confident that there\u2019s no path to victory for one candidate, they will declare a winner. Some will claim that they see election errors (and most will turn out to be false) Every election day, there are voters who claim to see something amiss at the polls or during the vote counting process. In 2020, many of those claims were loudly amplified by Donald Trump and continue to live on today, even though they\u2019ve been debunked over and over again. In 2022, we\u2019re likely to hear similar claims. Each one of those should be taken with a \u201cgiant grain of salt\u201d, David Becker, the founder and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said. \u201cI would look at any claim from anyone saying that, regardless of party of election, highly skeptically. \u201cThese things are largely driven by losing candidates or candidates that expect to lose,\u201d he added. The claims, he said, are \u201calmost always proven to be false. Or easily explainable.\u201d In 2020, for example, there were claims from observers about ballots being wheeled into a central counting facility in Detroit late during election night. Those ballots had already been verified by the local election office and there was nothing wrong with their late arrival time. The claim was nonetheless touted by those who sought to sow doubt about the election results. You can read more from Sam Levine\u2019s explainer here: When will we know who won US midterm races \u2014 and what to expect on election day If you missed it last night, here is the clip of former US president Donald Trump, speaking at a rally in Ohio, saying he will be making a \u201cbig announcement\u201d on 15 November, hinting that he will mount a 2024 presidential run. \u201cI\u2019m going to be making a very big announcement on Tuesday, 15 November at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida,\u201d Trump told supporters at the rally for Republican Senate candidate JD Vance. Trump declined to elaborate, saying he did not want to \u201cdetract from tomorrow\u2019s very important, even critical election\u201d. Polls have opened in some parts of the US for the 2022 midterm elections, so called because they fall halfway through a president\u2019s \u2013 in this case, Joe Biden\u2019s \u2013 presidency and so are often seen as a referendum on the incumbent. Many voters have already cast their ballots, with more than 41 million people taking part in early voting. At stake are all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 35 seats in the 100-member Senate, 36 state governorships, along with numerous other races for local officials and mayors. Republicans need to gain five seats to win a majority in the House and only one to take the Senate. Typically, an incumbent president\u2019s party expects to lose House seats in the midterms, but this year\u2019s races are being closely watched for any gains for election-denying candidates: Republicans who still believe the lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election, some of whom actively worked to overturn the result that put Biden in the White House. In 36 states, other issues are on the ballot, including laws on abortion in California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont. We will have all the news and results on our live blog, so stay tuned. Nimo Omer spoke to David Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Washington DC bureau chief, about why these midterms matter so much and what the results could mean for America: There are a number of contests that everyone is keeping a very close eye on. Perhaps the biggest is Georgia: \u201cThe rule used to be whichever way Florida goes, so goes the nation,\u201d says David, but \u201cGeorgia has, in many ways, replaced Florida as the pivotal state in the nation.\u201d Georgia\u2019s senate race is extremely important. Raphael Warnock\u2019s win in 2021 was key to the Democrats securing control of the senate. Now Warnock faces off against Herschel Walker, a former football player who \u201chas no discernible political experience or qualifications\u201d, David says. Walker has been embroiled in controversy for a year as stories of his affairs, extramarital children and allegations of domestic violence came to light. Most recently, a former girlfriend asserted that he paid for for her to have an abortion, despite Walker running on a hardline anti-abortion platform. And Georgia is also where Democratic favourite (and Star Trek\u2019s president of a United Earth), Stacey Abrams, will again try to wrestle the governership from Brian Kemp. A victory for Abrams would ensure voting and abortion rights are bolstered in the state. Other races to watch out for are Ohio, where author of Hillbilly Elegy, Trump critic turned sycophant JD Vance is running: \u201cIf Democrats win in a state that has really been trending Republican in recent years, there\u2019ll be a lot of blame on Vance and perhaps Donald Trump for backing him,\u201d David says. Pennsylvania, home of Joe Biden, is another crucial state with TV personality Dr Mehmet Oz running against the 6\u20198\u201d tattooed lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, in the senate race. Oz secured a Trump endorsement, as did Doug Mastriano, who is running for governor of the same state. Mastriano was part of the effort to overturn the 2020 elections and appeared outside the US Capitol during January 6 riots. He could be a key part of a Trump presidential run in 2024. \u201cIt feels as if there are two separate campaigns and conversations happening, that are operating on different planets,\u201d David says. \u201cIn the past, at least, there was a shared set of issues, and both parties would be looking to be the best on inflation or healthcare.\u201d Republicans have focused on inflation, specifically petrol prices, and the cost of living crisis. They have also made characteristic campaign points about crime and other culture war topics such as immigration. Conversely, Democrats have been focused on reproductive rights following the supreme court decision to overturn Roe v Wade, as well as the threats to democracy, voting rights and the climate crisis. \u201cA lot of opinion polls are suggesting that Republicans\u2019 issues are likely to win the day, because so often, people vote according to their pocketbook and the economy,\u201d says David. Read more of Nimo Omer\u2019s conversation with David Smith in today\u2019s First Edition: Tuesday briefing \u2013 What you need to know ahead of US midterms Hello and welcome to our coverage of the US midterm elections. As my colleague Nimo Omer wrote in today\u2019s First Edition newsletter, ballots will be cast for senators, representatives and local officials in one of the most important contests in recent years. She added that it has become tiresome to describe every American election as uniquely significant, but there is a lot at stake with these midterms as the chasm between Democrats and Republicans grows ever wider, and the supreme court decision to no longer protect abortion rights hangs in the air. The result of the election also has global implications, as concerns are expressed that a Republican win might dampen US enthusiasm for pouring financial and military aid into Ukraine\u2019s war for survival against the latest Russia invasion of its territory. And the outcome will set the stage for the presidential election battle to come during the next two years \u2013 a race which looks likely now to feature a certain Donald J Trump. We will have non-stop rolling live coverage of the election over the next couple of days, so I hope you will join us."

            "date": "2022-11-18T13:01:28Z",
            "content": "Malaysians are voting in a tightly contested general election on Saturday, after two weeks of fierce campaigning in which politicians have sought to woo millions of young voters by embracing Instagram and TikTok trends. Saturday\u2019s election is the first since constitutional changes lowered the voting age to 18 and automatically registered voters, meaning there are 6 million more voters than at the previous election in 2018. It is believed to be the first time people under 40 make up the majority of the electorate. More than 9,000 polling centres will open for 10 hours on Saturday but there is concern about voter turnout. On top of widespread flooding and forecasts of further rain, many voters are weary after years of political infighting. The government that won power in 2018 collapsed in less than two years, and the country has had three different prime ministers in four years. The current prime minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, of the UMNO party, called the snap election in October in an attempt to strengthen his Barisan Nasional (National Front) alliance. He is up against two other coalitions vying to form a government: Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), led by the reformist opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and Perikatan Nasional (National Alliance), led by the former prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin. UMNO had dominated Malaysian politics for decades, before it was ousted in the 2018 elections \u2013 a result driven by popular anger over the multibillion-dollar 1MDB financial scandal. Najib Razak, a former prime minister, was imprisoned recently for 12 years on charges related to 1MDB. Analysts say it is unlikely there will be a clear majority \u2013 which requires a minimum 112 of 222 parliamentary seats \u2013 after Saturday\u2019s vote. \u201cThe question will be which coalition will have the bigger number of seats with a strong negotiating position,\u201d said Dr Azmil Tayeb, a political analyst. A new battleground In the battle to win over first-time voters, politicians have embraced social media, with TikTok emerging as a new battleground in the race to secure youth votes. There are now 1.4 million 18- to 21-year-olds who are newly eligible to vote, out of a total voting population of 21.1 million. Muhyiddin Yassin, 75, the chair of Perikatan Nasional (PN), is among those to have tapped into TikTok trends during campaigning. In one video that has been liked hundreds of thousands of times, he swipes away the logos of rival political coalitions to the strains of the song Swipe by the Singaporean hip-hop artist Alyph. Syed Saddiq, who became Malaysia\u2019s youngest minister after the 2018 elections, is especially active on social media, posting clips of campaign speeches, pleas for young people to vote \u2013 as well as clips of his two cats. In one video, he does 60 seconds of press-ups (the time it takes to register for postal voting) to persuade people how quick the process is. Divya Latha Ramesh, 23, a student and first-time voter, said that in the run-up to the election her social media feeds had been saturated with politics. \u201cRecently all my fyp [For You page] recommendations are about politics,\u201d she said. \u201cSocial media is a huge platform to attract young voters\u2019 attention.\u201d Divya Latha wants a government that will bring about a more equal society, reduce poverty and put an end to affirmative action policies that have for decades benefited the Malay majority over ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities in areas such as education. \u201cI hope for a government that cares about its own people regardless of their race, age and skin colour,\u201d she said. Raja Nur Arissa, 21, also voting for the first time, said while she had some friends who supported UMNO, young people were more likely to be conscious of the 1MDB scandal. \u201cThere are not many from the younger generation that still support [Najib],\u201d she said. Arissa, a student and a social media influencer, said she wanted a government that cared about human rights, and that would take weather-related disasters seriously. Some of her friends were affected during recent flooding, not once but twice, due to failures of the government warning system, she said. She hopes that, soon, younger leaders could also emerge. \u201cAlthough they say experience makes a great leader, we should also give a chance to the younger ones to prove that the next generation can be better. Many youth now are struggling to make a living.\u201d Azmil, the analyst, said that on social media the three major coalitions had focused on promising stability and economic prosperity. \u201cEspecially for young people\u2019s jobs, high cost of living, student debt, access to education, these are the typical promises. It resonates a bit more now as we have a global recession.\u201d On the brink of power Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition leader and former deputy prime minister, has drawn huge turnouts at his events, according to Azmi Hassan, a senior fellow at Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research (NASR). But he said the atmosphere was more subdued than in 2018, when Anwar\u2019s coalition benefited from huge public anger over the 1MDB scandal. Anwar has promised reforms such as limiting the prime minister\u2019s term to 10 years, and making assistance needs-based rather that race-based. He has been on the brink of power several times during his turbulent political career . It was Anwar\u2019s reformist coalition \u2013 an unlikely alliance formed with his former rival Mahathir Mohamad \u2013 that defeated Barisan Nasional in 2018. Mahathir had promised Anwar he would succeed him as prime minister, but he resigned from office before the promise could be fulfilled. Dr Oh Ei Sun, a political analyst and a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said loyalty among UMNO voters should not be underestimated this year. \u201cI think a party such as UMNO has the ability, an uncanny ability, to mobilise their voters to still come out to vote, therefore flooding would benefit UMNO,\u201d said Ei Sun."

            "title": "Hebron\u2019s Jewish settlers take heart from far-right polls surge in Israel",
            "date": "2022-11-12T17:00:46Z",
            "content": "In 1968, a year after Israel\u2019s victory in the Six Day War that marked the beginning of the occupation of the Palestinian territories, about 60 messianic Jews posing as Swiss tourists travelled to a hotel in the holy West Bank city of Hebron, where they celebrated a Passover seder. Later, the group visited the Cave of the Patriarchs \u2013 known to Muslims as al-Ibrahimi Mosque \u2013 where Abraham and his kin are supposedly buried. They never left. The trip is now widely viewed as the birth of the modern settler movement, which sees restoring the historical land of Israel as a religious calling which will hasten the coming of the Messiah. Hebron today is a striking manifestation of what that vision means for the Palestinian population. The 30,000 or so Palestinians living in the part of the city under Israeli control are not even allowed to walk on certain streets, while roughly 800 Israeli settlers, under the protection of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), have steadily taken over Palestinian homes and businesses since the 1990s. On a cold, wet day last week, soldiers at checkpoints and a group of young Jewish boys splashing in puddles were the only signs of life in what used to be a thriving economic centre. The divided city has long been a magnet for followers of the anti-Arab terrorist Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was banned from politics before being assassinated in 1990. In 1994, a member of his Kach movement entered al-Ibrahimi mosque, gunning down 29 people at prayer. The perpetrator is buried in the neighbouring Kiryat Arba settlement, and his grave has become a de facto shrine. Three decades later, Kahanism has not just survived: after Israel\u2019s election this month, it has become the third largest political force in the country, and Kahanist politicians will have important portfolios in former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s new government. A total of 88% of the Jewish community here and 67% of 3,000-strong Kiryat Arba voted for one of their own \u2013 Kiryat Arba resident, former Kahane disciple and rising star of the Religious Zionist party, Itamar Ben-Gvir. \u201cI\u2019m not a religious person. I don\u2019t cover my hair or anything, I have LGBT friends,\u201d said Elinor, a 24-year-old single mother who works at Kiryat Arba\u2019s supermarket. \u201cLike everyone else I voted for Netanyahu in the past and switched to Ben-Gvir this time because of the security situation. \u201cI think he\u2019s become so popular because the rest of the country is starting to understand how dangerous it is and what we are going through here.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s bloc of far-right and religious parties won a majority on 1 November, and he will in all probability return to office in a few weeks at the head of the most rightwing government in Israel\u2019s history. He was able to end Israel\u2019s four-year political crisis, triggered by his ongoing corruption trial, by persuading three far-right fringe parties to merge into one list called the Religious Zionists before the 2021 election, pushing them over the electoral threshold and into the Knesset. This time, Ben-Gvir\u2019s rocketing popularity helped the slate more than double their seats to 14. Six of them are settlers, living in the West Bank despite the fact it is illegal under international law and Israeli settlements \u2013 growing all the time \u2013 negate the possibility of a two-state solution. His fiery speeches calling for immunity for Israeli police and soldiers who harm Palestinians, the reinstatement of the death penalty for terrorism offences and the deportation of \u201cdisloyal\u201d citizens have resonated during an election cycle marred by spiralling violence. A total of 21 Israelis and 121 Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank have been killed so far in 2022 \u2013 a 16-year record. A former member of the Kach terrorist group, with a conviction for inciting racism, Ben-Gvir supports altering Israel\u2019s legal code, which could help Netanyahu in his corruption trial. Other members of the slate also want an end to Palestinian autonomy in areas of the West Bank, legislative reform to incorporate traditional religious law, and a roll back of gay rights. Coalition horse-trading is under way, and Ben-Gvir is lobbying to be minister of public security, a role that would put him in charge of the police. Israel\u2019s security services would then be in the extraordinary position of being asked to share intelligence with an individual on their watchlist. Many political observers thought that as part of recent efforts to soften his image, Ben-Gvir would stay away from a memorial in Jerusalem on Thursday night marking the anniversary of Rabbi Kahane\u2019s death. Instead, he arrived to deliver a glowing tribute. \u201cI think that the main characteristic of Kahane was love. Love of Israel without compromise and without any other considerations,\u201d he said. In the past, Kahanist meetings would have the aura of an underground gathering. Now, emboldened by their mainstream success, media were invited and the audience even booed when Ben-Gvir said he does \u201cnot support the expulsion of all Arabs\u201d. For the 20% of the Israeli population which identifies as Palestinian, as well as those living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the far right\u2019s elevation to a major government coalition partner in the Knesset means an already difficult situation is about to get much worse. Issa Amro, a Palestinian human rights activist in Hebron, knows Ben-Gvir and his supporters well. Amro has been a target of settler violence for years. In the past fortnight, however, the pressure has been relentless. Gangs of young Jewish men and boys have set fires on his land and attacked friends and family who came to help with this year\u2019s olive harvest. In video footage of several of these incidents, the IDF stands by, allowing the violence to continue. \u201cI think they are definitely more confident now. Their representatives are the government. They don\u2019t think they have to hold back any more,\u201d he said during the Observer\u2019s visit to Hebron last week. After Amro complained, the Israeli army declared his house a closed military zone, forbidding anyone except him from entering the property in what he says is a transparent attempt to make him isolated and vulnerable. Asked for comment, the IDF said: \u201cOn Tuesday 1 November, following a number of confrontations in the area, it was decided to temporarily declare the area a closed military zone. The order was valid for one day only and was not extended.\u201d Soldiers stationed on the street, however, continued to block access to the activist\u2019s house for around 10 days. Amro said: \u201cI want to live, but I\u2019m not going anywhere, because I want the Palestinian voice to be heard. \u201cWe are not slaves, we deserve to live with rights and dignity. If they can do this to me, someone well connected with lawyers and the international community, I do not want to think about what will they do to the other people living in Hebron \u2026 I think dark times are ahead.\u201d One of Ben-Gvir\u2019s favourite turns of phrase, repeated in every public appearance, is: \u201cWe are the masters of this house.\u201d A question he and his fellow religious Zionists have not answered is: Are there such things as masters without slaves?"

            "date": "2022-11-01T21:25:12Z",
            "content": "The former Israeli prime minster, Benjamin Netanyahu, may have scraped a razor-thin election win with the help of new far-right allies, according to exit polls in the country\u2019s fifth vote in four years. His Likud party is projected to win 30 or 31 seats, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster and two private channels said when polls closed at 10pm (8pm GMT) on Tuesday. The longtime leader\u2019s rightwing religious bloc is set to win 61 or 62 seats overall \u2013 just clinching a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. Netanyahu appeared to strike a cautious tone in the early hours of Wednesday, saying that his party is \u201calive and kicking\u201d but supporters would need to wait until final results arrived to celebrate. The longtime premier\u2019s main rival, incumbent prime minister Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid, was predicted to win 24 seats, with his camp at 54 seats overall. Another four seats would go to a pro-Arab rights alliance, which may or may not lend its support to Lapid\u2019s centre-left bloc. Worried about turnout among an exhausted electorate, all 36 parties engaged in an energetic last campaigning push to encourage voters to leave the house during the 15-hour voting window on Tuesday. A surge for Netanyahu\u2019s new partners, the rightwing extremist Religious Zionist party, might be what propels him to a third term as prime minister. The Religious Zionists appear to be set for unprecedented success, with 13 or 14 seats, up from six in the 2021 vote. The polls are preliminary, however, and final results could change as votes are tallied in the coming hours. In Israel\u2019s fragmented politics, no single party wins a parliamentary majority, and coalition-building is necessary to govern. A struggling Arab nationalist party appeared to be approaching the electoral threshold, Israeli media reported an hour after the exit poll, which would give it four seats and erase Netanyahu\u2019s narrow projected margin. Coalition horse-trading in the next few days could also paint a very different final picture. Turnout on Tuesday was higher than it had been in decades in the high-stakes contest, as voters attempted to break the paralysing political deadlock of the past few years. Election officials said that by 8pm local time (6pm GMT) \u2013 two hours before the polls closed \u2013 turnout stood at 66.3%, over five points higher than the same hour in the 2021 election and the highest since 1999. As with the four previous elections since 2019, Tuesday\u2019s poll was largely a single-issue vote on whether the scandal-plagued Netanyahu is fit for office. Final polls published on Friday suggested that the race was once again too close to call, with neither the pro- nor anti-Netanyahu camps predicted to win a majority. Many Israelis were already bracing for a sixth election next year. At lunchtime at a voting station in Talpiot Mizrach, a gentrifying Jewish neighbourhood in Jerusalem, many of those who had cast ballots said they had voted for Lapid. His coalition does not have a clear path to remaining in power unless turnout in the disillusioned Arab 20% of the population, still not fully counted, is high enough to counter the Netanyahu bloc\u2019s slight edge. \u201cWe are worried about a far-right government, and supporting Yesh Atid seems like the best way to keep them out,\u201d said Laura Solomon, 55, who moved to Israel from the US last year. \u201cHonestly though, it feels better voting here than in the US. Here there is at least a plurality of voices, and it feels like your vote really matters.\u201d Ze\u2019ev, 66, a greengrocer from Jerusalem\u2019s middle-class Beka neighbourhood, said he would be voting for Netanyahu\u2019s Likud: \u201cHe\u2019s experienced and successful. Other people are jealous and try to bring him down.\u201d The scene at a school in the Arab neighbourhood of Beit Safafa was much quieter: of 5,600 registered voters in the area, only 100 had showed up by lunchtime, said Rami Ghita, who voted for the Arab nationalist Ta\u2019al party. According to a forecast from the aChord Center at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, based on samples from the Central Election Committee, Arab Israeli turnout stood at 44% at 8pm, which means Ta\u2019al\u2019s slate, a small anti-occupation voice in Israeli politics, should be able to clear the Knesset threshold. Ghita\u2019s friend Ibrahim Kamal said he was not going to vote. \u201cThey\u2019re all thieves, it doesn\u2019t make any difference,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery election, one party pops up and incites hatred against the Arabs to get votes. This time it\u2019s Itamar Ben-Gvir.\u201d Perhaps the only major change in the political stalemate gripping Israel for the last four years is the rise of Ben-Gvir, the top candidate of the Religious Zionists. A former follower of the banned Kach terrorist group, with a conviction for inciting racism, he has promised to support legislation that would alter the legal code, which could help Netanyahu evade a conviction in his corruption trial. As a senior member of a rightwing coalition government, Ben-Gvir would also lobby for the deportation of \u201cdisloyal\u201d Palestinian citizens of Israel. His rocketing popularity has horrified the Israeli mainstream as well as international allies: the US and the UAE have reportedly warned the Likud that giving the Religious Zionists cabinet minister roles would damage bilateral relations. Netanyahu, however, has said such a choice cannot be made by outsiders. Writing in the Yediot Ahronot daily on Tuesday, the columnist Nahum Barnea said such a rightwing coalition would threaten Israel\u2019s future. \u201cNetanyahu nurtured [Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, the slate\u2019s leader] and persuaded them to run together because he thought of them as the messiah\u2019s donkey: he\u2019s the messiah, and they will do his bidding. He may soon come to discover that they are the messiah, and he is their donkey \u2026 That same combination produced fascist movements in Europe,\u201d he wrote. The closing chapter of Lapid\u2019s campaign had focused on urging voters to block the far right. \u201cThese elections are [a choice] between the future and the past. So go out and vote today for our children\u2019s future, for our country\u2019s future,\u201d he said after voting in his upmarket Tel Aviv neighbourhood. Lapid was the architect of the \u201cgovernment of change\u201d, a broad coalition of eight parties that banded together to remove Netanyahu from power in June 2021 but collapsed a year later because of infighting. After the votes are tallied, the parties have nearly three months to thrash out a coalition configuration. If they cannot, Israel will head to yet another election. Anna, 19, from Baka, cast a vote for the first time on Tuesday, opting for the Labor party, which governed the country for decades but is now part of a shrinking leftwing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to sit this out but my friends with similar politics are still undecided on who to vote for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s grating that my first election is the fifth one in four years. I hope we don\u2019t have to keep doing this again and again.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s election is being held amid a particularly bloody chapter of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the UN warning recently that 2022 is on course to be the deadliest year for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since the organisation started tracking fatalities in 2005. A total of 25 people have been killed in attacks on Israel and Israeli settlements."

            "date": "2022-11-26T19:00:35Z",
            "content": "Twenty years ago, a youngish economist destined to become a household name in Australia issued a warning to central banks everywhere. \u201c[L]owering rates or providing ample liquidity when problems materialise but not raising rates as imbalances build up, can be rather insidious in the longer run,\u201d he said. \u201cThey promote a form of moral hazard that can sow the seeds of instability and of costly fluctuations in the real economy.\u201d So said Philip Lowe, the future Reserve Bank governor, in a paper he co-authored while on secondment at the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland with senior BIS economist Claudio Borio. The two presented their report to a March 2002 conference hosted by BIS \u2013 dubbed \u201cthe bank for central banks\u201d \u2013 on how risks could grow even over times of apparent calm. Of specific concern were financial imbalances, such as asset bubbles, that might emerge during stints of low inflation. In some circumstances, it would be appropriate for banks to take pre-emptive action \u201cto preserve both financial and monetary stability\u201d. How central banks should act \u2013 and what they actually do \u2013 is at the heart of a fascinating if somewhat alarming new book by UK-based economic commentator Edward Chancellor. The Price of Time explores the history and role of interest rates. Central banks, much like the nursery rhyme about \u201can old lady who swallowed a fly\u201d, seem inured to solve each bout of market turmoil in a way that begets bigger instability in the future. The warning by Borio and Lowe that authorities should be alert to the dangers of speculation \u2013 and the moral hazards that result when bad decision-makers get used to being rescued \u2013 is a constant theme running through the book. The work is also timely, as an independent panel is halfway through a review of the RBA and its operations, due for completion in March. That interest rates might be climbing in Australia, the US, New Zealand and elsewhere doesn\u2019t diminish Chancellor\u2019s case. As he notes, nominal rates may be off the record lows set during the Covid pandemic but they remain well below inflation, leaving them negative in real terms. A favourite quote for the author is by Jeremy Stein, a Harvard University economist who served one term on the board of governors of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Firm regulation of markets was all very well but monetary policy \u201cgets into all the cracks\u201d, Stein said. Excessively low interest rates pump up all manner of asset bubbles as investors desperate for some return on their money snap up property, shares, and until lately, cryptocurrency. \u201cAll these extraordinary low interest rates [have] got into everything,\u201d Chancellor told Guardian Australia. \u201cAnd if we say we have the everything bubble, it sort of follows then that you\u2019re going to have the everything bust.\u201d It\u2019s perhaps surprising the purpose and perils of interest rates continue to confound experts and public alike. Most of us can grasp intuitively that somebody lending money or another asset to somebody else deserves a reward for the temporary transfer. Ancient Mesopotamians \u201ccharged interest on loans before they discovered how to put wheels on carts\u201d, Chancellor writes. Clay tablets dating back more than 4,000 years reveal borrowers offered up collateral \u2013 from homes, land and slaves to even the wife of an ancient borrower \u2013 as surety for repayment. While the history of interest down the millennia is fascinating, the book\u2019s main point is to highlight the snowballing challenges of the past quarter century. In September 1998, Long-Term Capital Management, a giant US hedge fund with exposures some estimate at $US1tn ($A1.5tn), blew up. To prevent market contagion, the Fed cut its interest rate in what became a template for later responses by central banks to such stresses as the global financial crisis and the supply shocks of the Covid pandemic. \u201cThe total calculated cost of each crisis is greater than the previous ones,\u201d Chancellor says. And \u201cthe geographical reach of them is more extensive\u201d. It is China, however, that prompted the author to examine the genesis of market distortions and the role of interest rates. By keeping interest rates artificially low for decades but particularly after the GFC in 2008, China has engineered the biggest expansion of lending in history. It has alone accounted for as much as half of global investment since then, Chancellor says. As the Guardian has noted recently, the value of property in China is now double that of the US and triple Europe\u2019s. That\u2019s despite China having annual economic output of only about three-quarters as large as those two regions. Forests of new apartment blocks destined to remain empty have sprung up, while increasingly costly tunnels and high-speed railways to remote regions hint at the economic waste. \u201cBecause interest rates neither reflect the return on capital nor credit risk, China\u2019s economy has suffered from the twin evils of capital misallocation and excessive debt,\u201d Chancellor wrote. People may have overlooked the risks in China because of the increasing role of the state in the economy and its tight grip over banks. Or, \u201csimply because China was able to sail through the last crisis without too much apparent damage\u201d. Chancellor is not in the practice of making predictions but China, he says, has set itself on \u201ca highly unsustainable path\u201d. The challenges facing Xi Jinping as the Chinese president tries to revive confidence in a slumping real estate market while navigating the economy though rolling Covid-related lockdowns are formidable. And as for that Borio-Lowe paper, Chancellor says they were on the money: \u201cIf you looked at real estate booms and credit booms, and put them together, you get what [they call] high-cost recessions.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019d be interesting to confront [Lowe] with this research that he wrote,\u201d he says, noting that the RBA under Lowe had likely acted in a way \u201ccontradictory\u201d to his research with Borio on the dangers of allowing asset bubbles to inflate. As to where Lowe now stands on the issue of overly low interest rates \u2013 the cash rate sat at a record low of 0.1% for 18 months until May 2022 \u2013 a spokesperson provided a short answer: \u201cWe are unable to help on this one.\u201d \u2022 The Price of Time, The Real Story of Interest by Edward Chancellor is published by Penguin ($55)"

            "title": "Action is needed right now to end sexual violence in conflict  | Angelina Jolie",
            "date": "2022-11-28T06:30:17Z",
            "content": "Almost a decade ago, more than 150 countries joined the global declaration of commitment to end sexual violence in conflict. They promised to bring perpetrators to justice, to put survivors\u2019 needs first, and to take other practical steps to end impunity. These were lofty goals and there has been some progress, including a few prosecutions at the national level, the adoption of the Murad Code and the establishment of the Global Survivors Fund. But it has not been nearly enough to meet the needs of survivors, or to deter perpetrators from using rape as a weapon of war in almost every new conflict in the past decade. Despite the commitments governments made, we have not seen significant, lasting action at the global level. This is deeply painful and frustrating. Conflict-related sexual violence has been reported in at least 18 countries in the past year alone, from the Americas to Asia and from Europe to Africa. We are speaking about crimes of extreme brutality. Assaults on women and men in front of their families. The gang-rape of children \u2013 who were the victims in nearly half of all the cases the UN verified last year. Sexual violence in conflict makes peace harder to achieve \u2013 and less stable. It increases the risk of domestic violence. It drives displacement. It stops girls going to school. It leaves scars of trauma and stigma that affect whole societies and cross generations. We meet and discuss these horrors and agree that they should never be allowed to happen again. We promise to draw \u2013 and to hold \u2013 that line. But when it comes to hard choices about how to implement these promises, we run into the same problems time and again. We run into some security council members abusing their veto power, such as in the case of Syria. We run into economic and political interests being put first, treating some conflicts as more important than others. And we run into a lack of political will, meaning that governments in recent years have downgraded the importance of efforts to combat war-zone sexual violence, despite the direct link to international peace and security. For all our awareness of these crimes, less than 1% of humanitarian relief is spent on preventing or responding to sexual and gender-based violence, even though sexual violence is endemic in situations where people are displaced by conflict or disaster. Survivors and advocates have highlighted this funding gap for years, and addressing it was one of the promises of the global declaration. The creation of a permanent international body that can help fill the accountability gap has also been discussed for years without any progress. A new, permanent, international commission to document and investigate sexual violence in conflict could support national and international investigators, prosecutors, and accountability and justice mechanisms in their work. It could act as a professional body, a repository of knowledge and data, and provide training for people involved in investigating atrocities and war crimes. When human beings are physically assaulted in this way, there has to be a decisive global response. When there isn\u2019t, a message is sent to both the victim and the perpetrator that we don\u2019t truly regard this as a significant crime that has to be punished and prevented. Over the next two days, government ministers, academics, civil society practitioners and survivors will come together in London for a conference to renew global political will to prevent sexual violence in conflict. It should take a hard look at what has succeeded \u2013 and what has not. At the last conference, in London in 2014, survivors and NGOs came forward with information and solutions to impunity, from reforming militaries to developing local capacity and ensuring medical care, trauma care, livelihood support and reparations for survivors. The conference should not be another moment when survivors have to come forward to explain their pain and suffering again, and to show their willingness to work with governments, only for countries to be unwilling to act on their commitments over the long term. Governments and international efforts come and go. Those who remain and who fight and struggle for decades are local people \u2013 in this case, the survivors of rape, and people such as the Congolese gynaecologist and Nobel prizewinner Dr Denis Mukwege. He has treated tens of thousands of survivors of rape, despite attacks on his life, for decades. If global leaders were willing to be even a fraction as brave and committed as Dr Mukwege \u2013 and as survivors are \u2013 then we could perhaps finally find a way to meet this crime with the response it deserves.

            "date": "2022-11-28T07:00:19Z",
            "content": "This epic historical drama could have been called Once Upon a Time in Asia Minor or Once Upon a Time in Turkey, depending on which side of the Greek-Turkish divide you sit. That thorny geopolitical entanglement is what it attempts to unpick, sometimes too forcefully, in telling the story of the one-time melting pot of Smyrna (now \u0130zmir). It culminates in a shockingly raw depiction of the 1922 massacre and ethnic cleansing of the Greek and Armenian population by Kemal Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s irregulars after they entered the city. Filio Baltatzis (Mimi Denissi) is the matriarch of a Greek olive oil family in Smyrna, relaxed in their affluence in the Levantine port even as first world war storm clouds encroach. Greece is neutral but her husband Dimitris (Leonidas Kakouris) thinks it should join the Allies and unseat the Ottomans. His brother Spyros (Krateros Katsoulis) is more practical, not wanting to antagonise the ruling Turks. Dimitris should probably have paid more attention, as there are a fair few Turks among his servants, including Halil (Burak Hakk\u0131), who has taken a shine to Ataturk \u2013 then a politically ambitious military figure. Director Grigoris Karantinakis matches Merchant Ivory in his richly sketched depiction of this bustling hub, heavy on the coffee, baklava and the zither. The ensemble is large, in the film\u2019s attempt to cast a net over the city\u2019s many factions, from the English toffs to whom the Baltatzises hope to marry their daughter off, to the local orthodox bishop. (Slightly improbably, a squad of veteran British faces \u2013 Susan Hampshire, Jane Lapotaire, Rupert Graves \u2013 put in an appearance.) The tactic is successful to some degree, especially in spotlighting the divided allegiances of their Turkish intimates: Halil warns his employers that the young Turks plan to assassinate Dimitris. But the desire to fully map out this polyglot world has a tendency to reduce many characters to walking Wikipedia entries. There\u2019s also a faint but unsettling Greek bias here, especially in continued assertions that the ancient Hellenic presence means \u201cAsia Minor\u201d is truly theirs. The intransigence is understandable in the light of the later bloodshed but it\u2019s at odds with the film\u2019s supposed multiculturalism and prevents a more rounded grasp of history (such as reflecting on the irony that Atat\u00fcrk, responsible for this nationalistic sanitising, was born in Greece). Smyrna catches the intoxication and panic of the moment, but its longer-term perspective \u2013 as seen in its overarching recipe-book conceit \u2013 is sickly sweet. \u2022 Smyrna is in UK cinemas on 4 December for one night only."

            "date": "2022-11-12T23:06:57Z",
            "content": "Two historical military planes collided and crashed to the ground Saturday during a Dallas airshow, federal officials said, sending plumes of black smoke billowing into the sky. Officials didn\u2019t immediately make clear how many people were on board the aircraft or if anyone on the ground was hurt. Nonetheless, an ABC News producer \u2013 citing reporting from a colleague \u2013 said on Twitter that at least six people, all crew members, were feared dead after the crash. Anthony Montoya saw the two planes collide. \u201cI just stood there. I was in complete shock and disbelief,\u201d said Montoya, 27, who attended the airshow with a friend. \u201cEverybody around was gasping. Everybody was bursting into tears. Everybody was in shock.\u201d Emergency crews raced to the crash scene at the Dallas Executive airport, about 10 miles from the city\u2019s downtown. Live news footage from the scene showed people setting up orange cones around the crumpled wreckage of a bomber, which was in a grassy area. The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra collided and crashed at about 1.20pm, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement. The collision occurred during the Commemorative Air Force Wings Over Dallas show. The B-17, an immense four-engine bomber, was a cornerstone of US air power during the second world war. The Kingcobra, a US fighter plane, was used mostly by Soviet forces during the war. Most B-17s were scrapped at the end of the second world war and only a handful remain today, largely featured at museums and airshows, according to Boeing. Several videos posted on Twitter showed the fighter plane appearing to fly into the bomber, causing them to quickly crash to the ground and setting off a large ball of fire and smoke. The Dallas mayor, Eric Johnson, said the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had taken control of the crash scene, with local police and fire providing support. \u201cThe videos are heartbreaking,\u201d he said on Twitter. Wings Over Dallas bills itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s premier world war II airshow\u201d, according to a website advertising the event. The show was scheduled for 11-13 November, Veterans Day weekend, and guests were to see more than 40 second world war-era aircraft. Hank Coates, president of the Commemorative Air Force, later told reporters that the families of crew members involved in the disaster \u2013 as well as witnesses \u2013 would be offered support, including emotional counseling. He declined to say exactly how many people were feared dead by officials, but he said the B-17 typically carried four to five crewmembers while the P-63 had a seat only for the pilot. \u201cPlease \u2026 if you have it in your mind, express prayers and thoughts for the crews that were involved today, for the people that saw it, for the family members,\u201d Coates said. \u201cObviously, this is a very challenging time for those families.\u201d The FAA and the NTSB were launching investigations. Preliminary reports may come out in the coming several days, but final findings may not be issued for more than a year. The Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2022-11-26T09:02:02Z",
            "content": "It will be the moment that Imran Khan has been building up to for weeks. On Saturday, Pakistan\u2019s toppled prime minister and former superstar cricketer will bring his \u201clong march 2.0\u201d to the city of Rawalpindi as he continues to push for early general elections. If a vote is called, Khan insists he will win overwhelmingly. Khan\u2019s appearance will be his first public outing since an assassination attempt earlier this month, when he was shot in the leg as his march travelled through Punjab. He remains unable to walk so will address the crowds from a wheelchair. According to security agencies, there remains a high risk of another assassination attempt, so Khan will be shielded within a cube of bulletproof glass. On Saturday, a video was circulating of aides posing with a now-removed blue cast that Khan wore on his right leg after the shooting. Since Khan was removed as prime minister in April in a vote of no confidence, his popularity has gone from strength to strength just as Pakistan has spiralled further into a state of political crisis. The former PM \u2013 known to thrive as an opposition agitator \u2013 has mobilised hundreds of thousands of people at his rallies and made speeches filled with incendiary rhetoric. Khan accused the US government of being behind a conspiracy to remove him from power, though he has recently backtracked and accused the new coalition government led by Shehbaz Sharif of being \u201cimported\u201d and corrupt. But it is Khan\u2019s decision to go up against Pakistan\u2019s mighty military establishment that has gripped the people and left the country reeling. Khan and the senior aides in his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), have not only accused the military of being responsible for pushing him out of office, but also for having a role in the assassination attempt. Khan unsuccessfully tried to file a police report naming Sharif, the interior minister, Rana Sanaullah Khan, and the senior army general Faisal Naseer as the three conspirators. \u201cIt is no secret that the [military] establishment played a huge role in removing Imran Khan from power, by forcing our allies to abandon him,\u201d said Fawad Chaudhry, a PTI spokesperson. The government and the military have denied this, and the shooter held responsible has said he acted alone. Khan\u2019s outspoken position is all the more extraordinary given his once entrenched relationship with the military establishment, who have a long history of keeping a stranglehold over Pakistani politics and in the past have taken power through coups. Yet many believe Khan is once again looking for their backing to return him to power. Khan\u2019s huge appeal, particularly when compared with the declining popularity of the Sharif government, remains his trump card. Zahid Hussain, a political analyst, said: \u201cKhan is hugely popular while the army position has been weakened and they are on the defensive so they may cave to pressure and talk to him. The military is not neutral, it has never been neutral.\u201d Khan was dealt a significant blow on Thursday when it was announced that the new army chief, arguably the most powerful position in Pakistan, will be Gen Asim Munir, whom Khan fired from a senior post in 2019. Munir is reported to be apolitical but, said the former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, \u201cto remain out of politics will be a big challenge for the new chief. The army has so much influence in governmental matters, it is so ingrained in the system, that it is difficult and complicated for this to just end\u201d. For years, Khan was described as the \u201cblue-eyed boy\u201d of the generals. Though he denies it, many within his party say he was elected in 2018 with the help of the military, who are accused of pressuring MPs to join the PTI and rigging the election in his favour. One senior PTI leader, who is still close to Khan so spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: \u201cThe military is cunning and they brought him in power in a way that they could also get him out easily as we were not given the majority.\u201d Khan\u2019s government operated as a so-called hybrid regime where the military interfered directly, though behind the scenes. \u201cOur politics was outsourced, it was run by ISI,\u201d said the PTI leader, referring to Inter-Services Intelligence, an agency controlled by the military. Noor Alam Khan, who left the PTI in April having joined from the Pakistan People\u2019s party, said: \u201cThere used to be interference from the establishment, lots of calls to politicians forcing them to join a certain party [PTI], vote a certain way.\u201d Since Khan was removed from power, the interference has stopped. Even Khan recently stated that while in power he received help from military agencies and could not pass bills without their support. Under the hybrid regime, the army cracked down on media freedom and Khan\u2019s political opponents were imprisoned. Pakistan\u2019s ranking in the Transparency International corruption index slipped a record 20 places from 2019-21 due to \u201cstate capture\u201d and an \u201cabsence of rule of law\u201d, despite Khan\u2019s election promise to clean up politics. In 2021, the relationship between Khan and the military, and in particular with the army chief, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, began to fray over the generals\u2019 concerns that Khan was running the country\u2019s economy into the ground, as inflation soared and the government spent wildly on subsidies on fuel and power. Khan\u2019s erratic approach to foreign policy, alienating allies such as the US and Saudi Arabia, was also a cause of consternation. The relationship broke down completely after the military refused to back Khan\u2019s candidates in regional elections, then decided against Khan\u2019s will to transfer Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the head of the ISI who was helping him run the country. Despite Khan\u2019s best efforts to prevent a vote of no confidence, it went ahead in April 2022 and he was removed after swathes of his own PTI MPs as well as coalition allies voted against him. Some credited not only the military\u2019s withdrawal of support but also the alleged rampant corruption and disastrous economic policies that had left them unable to face their constituents. \u201cImran Khan has two faces,\u201d said Noor Alam Khan. \u201cHe is not clean, he is not sincere to the nation and he does not believe in democracy.\u201d The ferocity with which Khan has since turned against the military appears to have taken the establishment by surprise. Khan criticised the military in speeches, in particular the powerful army chief Bajwa. On Wednesday night, Bajwa, who retires from his post next week, took the highly unconventional step of openly admitting military interference in politics for the past 70 years. In what appeared to be a pointed response to Khan, Bajwa criticised those building a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d and said the army had made the decision \u201cit would never interfere in any political matter\u201d. This was met with scepticism among analysts and politicians. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that too at times before and too many times it simply hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, a senior associate for south Asia at the Wilson Center thinktank in the US. \u201cGiven how deeply entrenched the military is in Pakistan\u2019s political fabric, it would be almost impossible for there to be such a sharp shift.\u201d Instead, Khan\u2019s fate is likely to rest on whether Munir, the new military chief, is willing to come to the negotiating table. \u201cUltimately the army wants to deal with the terrible political mess in the country,\u201d said Kugelman. \u201cSo the big question now is, do they think that involves some kind of reconciliation with Khan?\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-16T01:50:24Z",
            "content": "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s most prominent accuser faced a grueling cross-examination on Tuesday, as Weinstein\u2019s defense attorney hammered her on details, casting doubt on her memory and demanding clarification on the most graphic details of the alleged rape. It was the second day of testimony from Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary film-maker and the wife of California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, and the most high-profile woman so far to take the stand against the Hollywood producer. On Tuesday, she faced a tough cross-examination from Weinstein\u2019s defense team. More than an hour in, as defense attorney Mark Werksman was asking her to define the word \u201cacquiesce\u201d, Siebel Newsom compared the relentless questioning to her interaction with Weinstein himself. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing today is exactly what he did to me,\u201d she told Weinstein\u2019s lawyer. Weinstein\u2019s defense team focused on differences in how Siebel Newsom described the alleged assault over interviews with prosecutors in 2020 and in grand jury testimony in 2021, including asking her why she had not immediately told prosecutors that she had touched Weinstein\u2019s penis during the assault. Siebel Newsom said she did not recall what parts of her experience she had described at different times. \u201cI had everything in a box, and I\u2019ve been slowly sharing a little bit at a time, because this is so painful,\u201d she said. When she initially met with a detective and a prosecutor in LA in 2020, Siebel Newsom testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be considered a victim because I thought I was out of the time period.\u201d She teared up as she said, \u201cI offered to talk to detectives initially to support other women, not to be up here on the witness stand.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s defense attorneys spent hours going through nearly 70 emails Siebel Newsom exchanged with Weinstein in the months and years after the alleged attack. They contrasted her bright tone and multiple requests for in-person business meetings with Weinstein in New York and at film festivals in Toronto and Cannes with her testimony that she had felt fear in her subsequent interactions with Weinstein, and that she had not interacted with him much after the assault. He also highlighted multiple emails she sent out to groups of people, including Weinstein, asking for campaign contributions for Gavin Newsom, her now-husband, during his tenure as mayor of San Francisco. Werksman noted her signatures on different emails Weinstein received, including \u201cwarm regards\u201d and \u201cxx\u201d, and flagged that she had once responded within eight minutes to an email from Weinstein about finding a time to meet in New York. Siebel Newsom said she simply did not remember sending most of the emails. \u201cI send hundreds of thousands of emails to people,\u201d she testified. \u201cHe ruined my life, I put it in a box, and I was not going to not pursue my entertainment career because of what happened,\u201d she said. Continuing to email Weinstein for normal business meetings to network and promote her films was a way \u201cto take control back from someone who had harmed me and violated me\u201d, she said. \u201cI was trying to not feel like a victim and be able to live my life.\u201d The emails she sent him were not flirtatious, Siebel Newsom said. The text of several of her emails to him suggested setting up meetings with him and a third person, including friends of hers and his wife. Siebel Newsom, who had delivered graphic and tearful testimony on Monday about her alleged rape at a Los Angeles hotel in 2005, was visibly tired on Tuesday, often asking for the last question to be repeated and a few times sighing deeply into the microphone. But she also contested some lines of questioning, saying her words were being taken out of context. Weinstein\u2019s attorney was interrupted by objections that his questioning was too argumentative or not relevant, which Judge Lisa Lench often sustained. In a pointed moment, Werksman asked Siebel Newsom to clarify the nature of sexual \u201cnoises\u201d she made during the alleged assault, which she said were intended to get Weinstein to end the attack. When Werksman continued to press her about what the noises sounded like, Siebel Newsom pushed back, saying she would not. \u201cThis is not When Harry Met Sally, I\u2019m not doing that,\u201d she said. Before ending his cross-examination, Werksman took a moment to consult quietly with Weinstein himself, who sat silently in the courtroom, before saying he had no further questions. Siebel Newsom did not look in Weinstein\u2019s direction during her testimony. Late in the afternoon, when a prosecutor asked Siebel Newsom to once again confirm whether she had consented during different stages of the alleged assault, Siebel Newsom broke down, saying, \u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d to each question and sobbing. She was still sobbing as the judge dismissed her and she strode quickly from the room. Elizabeth Fegan, an attorney for Siebel Newsom, said in a statement after the testimony that Weinstein\u2019s defense team had \u201cruthlessly tried to discredit her\u201d but that her client \u201cstood firm\u201d. Siebel Newsom \u201cknew that it might have been easier to keep the memory of her 2005 assault buried\u201d but \u201cshe felt an obligation to herself, her family, and most important, to the woman who came forward as well as the women unable to speak out publicly\u201d, Fegan said. Her testimony came as the judge overseeing the Los Angeles trial dropped four of the 11 sexual assault charges against Harvey Weinstein after prosecutors said they would not proceed with the counts involving one of his accusers. Superior court judge Lisa Lench dismissed two counts of forcible rape and two counts of forcible oral copulation against the 70-year-old Weinstein. The move had appeared likely since the trial\u2019s opening statements three weeks ago, when prosecutors only mentioned four women Weinstein was charged with assaulting, leaving out the accuser identified in an indictment as Jane Doe 5. The prosecutors at first kept the charges in place and left open the possibility that the woman would testify, while Weinstein\u2019s defense had sought a definitive decision on the issue. The Los Angeles county district attorney\u2019s office has not provided an explanation for why they opted to leave the woman out of the trial. The remaining charges against Weinstein, who is serving a 23-year sentence for a conviction in New York, are two counts of rape and five other sexual assault counts. He has pleaded not guilty.

            "content": "The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Thursday any nuclear attack on the US or its allies by North Korea would \u201cresult in the end of the Kim regime\u201d. Kim Jong-un\u2019s government in Pyongyang has in recent days mounted a number of missile tests. The South Korean military said a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday may have ended in failure. Japan called the launch \u201coutrageous and absolutely intolerable\u201d. According to a joint communique released by the US Department of Defense, during his meeting with the South Korean defense minister, Lee Jong-sup, Austin said: \u201cAny nuclear attack against the United States or its allies and partners, including the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, is unacceptable and will result in the end of the Kim regime.\u201d Similar language was included in the US National Defense Strategy, which was released last week. That document said, in part: \u201cOur strategy for North Korea recognises the threat posed by its nuclear, chemical, missile and conventional capabilities, and in particular the need to make clear to the Kim regime the dire consequences should it use nuclear weapons \u2026 there is no scenario in which the Kim regime could employ nuclear weapons and survive.\u201d Austin, a retired US army general and the first African American secretary of defense, spoke to reporters at the Pentagon alongside Lee. \u201cMinister Lee and I had an outstanding discussion today,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe talked about how the DPRK [North Korea] has continued provocations and destabilising actions, and at this time of heightened tension, our alliance is ironclad. \u201cThe United States remains fully committed to the defense [of South Korea]. Our extended deterrence commitment is firm and includes a full range of our nuclear and conventional and missile defense capabilities.\u201d He said the two countries planned to return to large-scale military exercises on the peninsula. The Biden administration has taken such steps after four years in which Donald Trump placed unprecedented stress on relations between Seoul and Washington, saying he wanted South Korea to pay for US military assistance in place since the Korean war of 1950-53. Trump, whose cavalier treatment of matters of nuclear policy has been extensively reported, met repeatedly with Kim, staging high-profile summits that produced little tangible benefit. At the Pentagon, Austin said the US was \u201ccommitted to building on on [the Biden administration\u2019s] efforts to strengthen integrated deterrence and to ensure that this alliance continues to bolster security and stability on the Korean peninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific\u201d."

            "title": "Jeremy Hunt\u2019s austerity budget: necessity or political choice?",
            "date": "2022-11-15T06:00:15Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt is preparing to wield the axe over public spending this week and raise taxes for everybody in an autumn statement that will be long on pain and short on good news. After Liz Truss\u2019s short and catastrophic premiership, the \u201cabacus economics\u201d she despised is back in the ascendancy under Rishi Sunak. The message from the government is that Britain has to live within its means, which Hunt and Sunak say requires action to reduce government borrowing and ensure that the national debt starts to fall as a share of national income. Failure to do so, they say, will lead to a \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances that will spook the financial markets and lead to higher borrowing costs for companies and households. Yet some experts have cautioned that there is nothing inevitable about the new era of austerity Hunt appears to be preparing to usher in, and that there are other ways both of raising money and of keeping the markets sweet. Is there a black hole? Many left-of-centre economists challenge the idea of a measurable \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances, pointing out that its existence is only created by whatever fiscal rules the government has set itself \u2013 and that estimates of its size are highly sensitive to economic forecasts. Economist Jo Michell, a co-author of a paper for the Progressive Economy Forum highlighting the \u201cdangerous fiction\u201d of a fiscal black hole, says the economic backdrop is highly uncertain, making this the wrong moment to draw up concrete plans for spending cuts. \u201cThe sensible thing is to wait and see, for a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cThings are changing so rapidly: we\u2019re moving into recession, US inflation looks like it may be on the down-slope, gilt yields have come down substantially since the mini-budget and may continue to come down. These are all turning point signals.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a rush from a \u00a345bn fiscal loosening, with the Truss budget, to a \u00a360bn tightening being floated with the current government,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a \u00a3100bn swing in fiscal policy, in response to a set of bond market moves that we don\u2019t fully understand.\u201d Hasn\u2019t the Truss experiment made austerity inevitable? Proponents of austerity point to the dramatic sell-off in sterling and government bonds, in the aftermath of Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s tax-cutting mini-budget, as evidence that financial markets are effectively demanding deep spending cuts. But Michell highlights the technical issues in pension portfolios that amplified the gilts sell-off (prompting the Bank of England to step in). Other economists have pointed to the wider context of Kwarteng\u2019s statement, including the sacking of the Treasury veteran Tom Scholar as permanent secretary, and Kwarteng\u2019s offhand promise of more tax cuts to come. Carsten Jung, a senior economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) also warns against learning the wrong lesson from Truss\u2019s mauling at the hands of the markets. He argues it was fears of surging inflation, as higher government spending fed into demand, that really spooked investors, pushing up bond yields and, in turn, mortgage rates. \u201cIt is portrayed as a fiscal credibility crisis; whereas really it was an expectation that inflation would be higher,\u201d he says, adding that Germany has announced a generous energy support package without being penalised by investors. Is the government attacking the right target? Jung is the co-author of an IPPR report setting out the thinktank\u2019s alternative to renewed austerity. The plan \u2013 which is conditioned on avoiding rocketing inflation, instead of closing a \u201cblack hole\u201d \u2013 includes generous spending on helping households through the cost-of-living crisis, and protecting public services from rapid increases in costs. The IPPR suggests these and other urgent priorities could entail an extra \u00a3120bn in spending, much of it temporary. To avoid this short-term splurge exacerbating inflation, they recommend tax increases worth \u00a340bn \u2013 which could include reversing the recent cut in national insurance contributions, for example. Does a doom loop loom? The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell warns that the current policy mix \u2013 with the Bank of England raising interest rates and the government preparing to cut spending \u2013 risks exacerbating the economic downturn and leading to a cycle of cuts, weaker growth, a bigger-than-planned deficit, and still more cuts. \u201cThe Bank of England pushing up policy rates, the government introducing austerity \u2013 inevitably the result is recession. In technical language, I think it\u2019s barmy,\u201d McDonnell says. \u201cEven if you accept that there is a gap that needs to be filled, all you need is a relatively mild plan for redistribution, in order to avoid austerity,\u201d he adds. \u201cI think the problem that Sunak and the others have is that they\u2019ve got themselves into an ideological trench, where they\u2019re fighting old wars.\u201d How about taxing wealth? Tax Justice UK recently set out proposals for up to \u00a337bn a year in tax increases, as an alternative to what it called \u201causterity 2.0\u201d. These included taxing the wealth of the super-rich \u2013 anyone with more than \u00a310m in assets \u2013 at 1% a year; aligning capital gains tax with income tax, so that unearned income is taxed as heavily as pay; and applying national insurance to investment income. Or borrowing more? The political economist and chartered accountant Richard Murphy agrees a wealth tax should be considered, arguing that rich people have the capacity to pay more. \u201cAlternatively, the government could borrow more. The best way to do this would be by cutting out the financial markets as a middleman. National Savings and Investments already provides the government with \u00a3210bn of funding. If interest rates on their products were more competitive they could raise very much more and still lower the overall cost of government borrowing. \u201cOr, given that austerity is apparently required to keep financial markets happy, the chancellor could call those markets\u2019 bluff and simply say he\u2019ll buy back the bond holding of anyone who is unhappy with the programme of additional spending and investment we need right now using the quantitative easing programme. That would also keep interest rates down.\u201d"

            "title": "An industry-friendly budget? Don\u2019t get your hopes up",
            "date": "2022-11-13T00:05:02Z",
            "content": "Looming recession, soaring inflation, worker shortages and evaporating business confidence provide a fairly sobering backdrop for Jeremy Hunt\u2019s autumn statement this week. As the government goes back to the drawing board after Liz Truss\u2019s botched mini-budget, most of the problems that Britain\u2019s economy faced under her leadership are either still a big worry for company bosses or have been amplified. However, business leaders worry that the chancellor\u2019s tax and spending update on Thursday will do little more than stop the rot. Beyond balancing the books, industry leaders aren\u2019t betting on any major tax or spending announcements to help reboot economic growth. The story goes that the chancellor thinks Britain must take its medicine before any conversation about economic growth can start. After the disaster of the mini-budget, restoring faith in financial markets and tackling inflation is the only game in town. Then, and only then, can a path to prosperity be considered. \u201cI am under no illusion that there is a tough road ahead,\u201d Hunt said last week. \u201cTo achieve long-term, sustainable growth, we need to grip inflation, balance the books and get debt falling. There is no other way.\u201d However, worried captains of industry think more could be done next week to support companies. Rather than this fatalist approach, could there not be steps within the government\u2019s power to at least soften the edges of the recession? \u201cYou can chew gum and walk at the same time,\u201d one business chief remarked. Hunt is expected to use his autumn statement speech to outline tax rises and spending cuts totalling \u00a360bn, including at least \u00a335bn in cuts to public services. Corporation tax, one of the biggest revenue raisers open to the government, is expected to rise from next April. This had been planned by Rishi Sunak during his time as chancellor (before Truss\u2019s failed bid to cancel that increase). However, another element of Sunak\u2019s old plans is now expected to be dropped. The prime minister had been considering giving companies billions of pounds in tax breaks, by offering them relief on the cost of any productivity-boosting capital investments. This would have helped to soften the blow of the headline corporation tax rise, while taking a carrot-and-stick approach to business investment. However, such is the concern over the damage the mini-budget did to Britain\u2019s credibility with global investors that this plan is quietly being abandoned. Under one proposal outlined by Sunak, it could have cost more than \u00a311bn a year. With tax and spending support probably off the table, company bosses are looking for Hunt to announce \u201ccost-free\u201d measures that could give businesses some help. In the face of severe labour shortages, rising costs and a weaker economy, firms are pushing in particular for a relaxation of immigration rules. Looser planning rules and closer ties to the EU to minimise trade disruption are also on their wishlist. Whether businesses will get much at all from Sunak and his chancellor is another matter. Immigration, planning and the EU are totemic issues for the Conservatives: it could prove difficult for the prime minister to tweak them without a backlash. With the government boxed in by its own party, and fearful of a rerun of the markets\u2019 reaction to the mini-budget, business leaders worry there will be little positive action to buoy Britain\u2019s sinking economy. For millions of businesses struggling as economic growth falters, it will spell a tough few years ahead. However, companies are demanding more than just an austerity reboot. \u201cThe autumn statement must learn the lessons of the 2010s: fiscal sustainability and lifting trend growth are both immediate priorities,\u201d said Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at the CBI lobby group. \u201cAlongside reassuring markets and protecting the most vulnerable, the government should safeguard capital spending and investment allowances to drive private sector growth.\u201d"

            "content": "There has never been a better time in budget beauty. It\u2019s broadly true that in 2022, \u201cbad\u201d products as we once knew them have all but vanished from high-street and department-store shelves. In fact, research, innovation and technology in beauty have advanced so fast that a cheap beauty product launching now is likely to be of materially higher quality than a luxury product launched 10 years ago. The dramatically improved performance of modern beauty products made this year\u2019s bargain special an even bigger joy to compile \u2013 and given the financial climate, a more useful and necessary endeavour. What we do spend on must work. As co-founder of the Beauty Banks charity, I know which products struggling families actually need to stay functioning: shampoo, soap, shower gel, nappies, sanitary protection, toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant and the like. The selections in this rundown represent something altogether different: little extras that work either as well as or even better than their premium or luxury equivalents. They are for those in the fortunate position of being able to treat themselves with beauty, but perhaps looking to cut back their spending in leaner times. This absolutely can be done with little difference in performance. Every one of the items that follow \u2013 for body, skin and hair \u2013 is outstanding in its field and well worth your precious spare cash. Body Palmer\u2019s Retexture Renew body lotion 400ml, \u00a36.99 What was already, hands down, the best affordable body lotion for treating bumpy upper arms and flaky shins is now even better. Exfoliating lactic acid lifts dead skin and smooths texture, while cocoa butter and coconut oil moisturise beneath. Smells weird but works great. I won\u2019t be without it. Marks &amp; Spencer Provenance Greek olive bath &amp; shower gel 500ml, \u00a35.25 In general, my daily showers are cheap and functional \u2013 my less-frequent baths are a more decadent and luxury affair \u2013 but this newish gem from M&amp;S combines the two. Bubbles abundantly, doesn\u2019t strip skin, smells delicious and comes in a huge bottle that lasts for ages. A guiltless luxury at the end of a fraught day. Sainsbury\u2019s Sun Protect sensitive skin spray 200ml, \u00a34.50 Sunscreen is vital for all families, but the cost stacks up. Sainsbury\u2019s makes very good, non-irritating, fairly priced sun protection that I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to slather on my own kids. Soft Ventilate gel heel socks, two pairs \u00a39.99 If you suffer from dry, cracked heels that cause discomfort or pain or even bleed, these will change your life. Just pull on at night whenever your heels are suffering, or simply in preparation for sandal weather, either over bare skin or a foot cream like Flexitol. The difference in just a couple of nights\u2019 wear is dramatic. Machine washable. St Moriz Professional tanning mousse, 200ml, \u00a34.99 St Moriz makes the best budget self-tan by a mile. In fact, it\u2019s better than many brands costing four times the price. This mousse is easy to apply (always exfoliate and moisturise dry bits first) and gives a good, even golden glow, lasting around three days. Apply with a cheap mitt to avoid orange wrists. Garnier Intensive 7 Days shea butter probiotic extract body lotion for dry skin 400ml, \u00a32.62 An excellent, nicely fragranced, well-absorbed body lotion for non-problem skins in need of moderate daily moisture. The very dry-skinned will crave more oil, but balanced types who find lardy ointments a turn-off will love its non-greasy, cushiony, softness. Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Repair body lotion 400ml, \u00a35.99 If this time of year sees your normally happy skin dry up and flake out, this classic richer moisturiser offers just the right level of escalation. Hugely versatile, it works as a hand cream, foot cream, body treatment and even - at a push on dry skins - a face moisturiser. Apply daily after showering and you needn\u2019t wait long to get dressed. Steinder Precision foot file, \u00a39.99 You can buy all the foot creams and book all the pedicures in the world, but without regular filing away of hard, dead skin, your feet will never look their best. This rasp style works fastest and most effectively, if you can exercise restraint and stop filing when you reach virgin skin. Once every 7-14 days should be enough, after which you can maintain the smoothness with a pumice stone if needed (less likely to chip your nail polish). Skin Simple Water Boost micellar cleansing water 400ml, \u00a34.66 I\u2019ve said it before and I stand firm: spendy micellar water makeup removers are an absolute waste of your cash. Cheaper micellar water is every bit as good as expensive, and Simple micellar water is better than them all. This is the one I buy and use myself for shoot days, late nights, festivals and anywhere one might need a water-free makeup change or face cleanse (hospital, for instance). Great on very sensitive skin, too. Garnier Ambre Solaire Super UV anti-age/anti-dryness face protection cream SPF50 50ml, \u00a38 Two very affordable sunscreens \u2013 one for balanced/combination skins, one for dry. Both offer high sun protection, a smooth base for makeup, no stinging or eye watering, more sustainable packaging and a comfortable, bouncy finish. I got through three tubes of the anti-dryness version in one summer, despite having expensive alternatives to hand. CeraVe SA smoothing cleanser with salicylic acid 236ml, \u00a312.50 If your skin or that of your tween or teen child is oily, congested, flaky, moderately spotty or dotted with blackheads, this is a great first step. Can be used on the face or body (it\u2019s good on oily teen backs) and lathers up without stripping skin dry. The price may not seem that low, but the quantity of product is around double the expected cleanser size. Byoma hydrating/clarifying serum 30ml, \u00a310.39 I admire this brand, founded by the creators of (the much more expensive but equally great) Tan-Luxe, because it concerns itself first and foremost with the health of the skin\u2019s barrier function, while many of its high-street competitors seem happy to batter it with high-concentration actives. There are few duds here, but these two serums \u2013 for dehydrated and oily skins, respectively \u2013 are my picks. Superdrug Vitamin E hot cloth cleanser 200ml, \u00a34.99 Still the best budget cleansing cream in town. Creamy, skin-softening and easily removed with a warm flannel, it\u2019s a pleasure to use. Not sturdy enough for makeup removal, but perfect as a second cleanse afterwards, or as a morning cleanse. My only annoyance is the tiny, pointless muslin included in the box. Time to retire it. Q+A oat milk cream cleanser 125ml, \u00a35.62 I love this bargain British range of straightforward, honest skincare. It\u2019s a great place to start for those on a budget. I picked this super gentle cleanser for any skin type (including sensitive), but it\u2019s hard to make a bad decision anywhere in the lineup. Bior\u00e9 Aqua UV Aqua Rich protect lotion SPF50 70ml, \u00a311.81 The Japanese beauty industry is famed for its featherlight textures, and there are few categories in which this is more greatly appreciated than sun protection, which has a tendency to be too greasy for oily types. This elegant, hydrating facial sunscreen can barely be felt once applied, leaves no white or ashy cast on deeper skin tones, and gives hi-tech protection against UVA and UVB rays. The best at any price. Burt\u2019s Bees natural moisturising lip balm 45g, \u00a35.99 for a duo-value pack A perfect, all-natural lip balm from an ethical company that puts plenty back into the community. Has everything I require: no jammy-textured, hair-catching gloss; a stick rather than a fingernail dipping (and clogging) pot, several hours\u2019 of comfortable moisture, and a smell that is never Haribo-adjacent. Ticks every box for a very reasonable three quid a tube. Olay Regenerist retinol 24 max 50ml, \u00a319.99 The RRP of this excellent entry-level, non-irritating retinol is technically over my self-imposed \u00a320 threshold, but I\u2019ve included it because every time I look, it\u2019s on offer somewhere for \u00a319.99. Retinoids remain by far the most well-evidenced treatment against signs of skin ageing (wrinkles, uneven tone and texture, loss of firmness), and if you\u2019d like to try them, this is a perfect place to start your journey. La Roche-Posay Cicaplast baume 100ml, \u00a312 (special offer) For grazes, burns, bites, roughness, irritation, sensitivity, adverse reaction to a product and general dryness, reach for this. I think of it as a sticking plaster in a tube and my home is never without it. Gallin\u00e9e perfume-free cleansing bar, \u00a313 This gynaecologist-formulated, milky, lightly sudsing cleanser is gentle enough for intimate washing without risking UTIs or vulval irritation (if you know, you know). I can also confirm that it works perfectly well on sensitive faces and bodies, too. Garnier Pure Active SOS anti-blemish stick 10ml, \u00a35.99 A break-glass-in-case-of-emergency treatment for occasional spots. Includes everything one needs in a breakout: salicylic acid to exfoliate and de-grease, niacinamide to soothe and zinc to control oil production. Dab directly on to a clean spot and repeat every few hours. Cur\u00e9l Intensive Moisture facial cream 40g, \u00a319.50 Japan\u2019s favourite dry skin brand, Cur\u00e9l, sets itself apart from western counterparts by delivering very rich, super-moisturising ingredients such as ceramides in very light, finely textured creams and lotions. Everything in the range, from foaming cleansers to eye cream, is terrific. But if your face craves all the moisture and none of the grease, you\u2019ll want to start with this. Bondi Sands self-tanning drops 40ml, \u00a39.99 If your skin, whatever its tone, lacks warmth or becomes ashy in autumn and winter, bronzing drops are a great solution. Twice a week, I mix a couple of drops into any daily moisturiser and massage in the whole cocktail in one go, washing hands after use. Within a couple of hours, I look more alive. These are the best of the budget offerings. Towelling wash mitts, \u00a310.95 for 10 Brands vary and are broadly unimportant, but I now buy all my cotton flannels in mitt form (giving greater purchase for product removal and skin exfoliation) in quantities of 10, from hotel suppliers or Amazon. Take a fresh one each morning for your cleanse, use again for your nighttime makeup removal and any face masks, then throw in the wash and repeat. Kose Softymo speedy cleansing oil 60ml, \u00a34.59 Korean and Japanese brands make extremely sophisticated budget skincare products, and this oil cleanser from Kose is among my favourites. Fast, gentle, thorough, luxurious makeup removal with no greasy after-feel. Remove with the towelling mitt. Makeup NYX Professional slim lip liner pencil, \u00a34 Pencils are generally a good place to save money, and these are as good as those at four times the price. They don\u2019t drag or scratch and are proper pencils, sharpened with a sharpener, not those twist-up plastic things that are permanently too blunt. Just Nude Pink and Hot Red will cover you for most lipstick choices. L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris brow artist plumper, \u00a38.99 There\u2019s stacks to love at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris counter, but I include this because it\u2019s largely overlooked. An easy-to-apply tinted brow gel that plumps up each hair, then sets without crispy flakiness. Ideal for fluffy, modern-looking brows. e.l.f Halo Glow liquid filter, \u00a314 A versatile glow-giver to add non-glittery gleam under foundation, on the high planes like cheek and brow bones, or alone as a fresh-looking complexion improver on casual days. Outstanding value and one of my products of the year. L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris True Match nude plumping tinted serum, \u00a314.99 This terrific light-coverage base delivers moist, natural-looking glow via sponge, brush or careless fingertips. Looks as appropriate under a faceful of evening makeup as when worn alone on a Sunday-morning dog walk. Ideal for anyone who seeks even, smooth, polished coverage without traditional, skin-masking foundation. Morphe Blush Balm soft-focus cream blush, \u00a312 Morphe is unarguably among the very best budget makeup brands (check out its palettes and lipsticks too), but this relative newcomer to the stable is a standout. Soft, effortless and moisturising, it doesn\u2019t slide off as fast as it goes on, like too many other budget cream blushers, and gives an instant, natural, healthy-looking flush. e.l.f. No Budge shadow sticks, \u00a36 To have a crayon or two of cream eyeshadow in one\u2019s handbag is to never be more than three minutes from a dressed-up makeup look. These bargain sticks sit alongside those by Bobbi Brown, Vieve and Laura Mercier in my makeup bag, and more than hold their own. Scribble on to lids, then soften the edges with a clean, fluffy eye brush. And you\u2019re done. Glossier Solar Paint luminous bronzer cr\u00e8me, \u00a317 Is Glossier technically a budget brand? Granted, no. Is this fantastically good value for a high-end cream bronzer in an inclusive, flattering, gleaming, orange-free shade range, delivered via a handy wand applicator that a small child could master? Absolutely, yes. Bourjois Healthy Mix anti-fatigue foundation, \u00a311.99 The greatest high-street foundation in history, in my humble opinion. Versatile, buildable, medium coverage for all skin types. A nation mourned at its 2020 withdrawal from the UK market, then rejoiced at its 2022 return (exclusively to Superdrug). Beauty Pie Superluminous Undereye Genius, \u00a310 to Beauty Pie members I have deliberately limited Beauty Pie to just one entry, since this bargain beauty buyers\u2019 club does involve an annual membership fee. The competition was fierce, but this made the grade because it goes on my face every day, almost without fail. Instant brightening for dark undereye circles. Just dab on very sparingly with finger or brush. Essie Gel Couture nail polish, \u00a39.99 When it comes to nail varnish, I\u2019d always recommend salon brands over makeup brands \u2013 whether high street, designer or luxury. Essie\u2019s main competitors, OPI (much more expensive in the UK than in the US) and CND (trickier to buy retail) are terrific too, but Essie\u2019s combination of accessibility, ease of application, colour range, affordability and staying power makes it the easy winner here. Bourjois Rouge Velvet lipstick, \u00a39.99 For those who like their lips drenched in bold, vibrant pigment that stays matte without sacrificing comfort, this remains best in class. Kiko Lasting Precision automatic eyeliner and khol, \u00a38.99 Italian brand Kiko makes the best, most vibrant and longest-lasting eye pencils on the high street. There are several types in their portfolio, but this one is, for me, the most impressive, for its shade lineup and integrated smudger. My only gripe is that it\u2019s not wooden and therefore sharpen-able, but for a smudgy, smoky (as opposed to precise) line, this is immaterial. NYX Professional ultimate shadow palette \u2013 warm neutrals, \u00a316 Huge eyeshadow palettes can be a false economy, since several shades can go unused while others wear down to the pan. This extremely wearable, easy-to-blend set of neutrals suits everyone, works for any occasion and comes from the best budget eyeshadow brand on the high street. Superdrug makeup sponges, \u00a37.99 for a pack of two I\u2019m baffled by expensive makeup sponges. I\u2019d no sooner pay \u00a316 for a disposable foam egg than I would for a cup of tea. These, at four quid a sponge, are more acceptable, and indistinguishable from luxury versions. Use damp and in a bouncing motion to blend foundation, cream or liquid bronzers and blushers. Keep in an airy place. If it starts to smell or perish (three to four months is likely), swap for new. got2b Glued for Brows, \u00a35 This takes an iron fist to the sort of lawless brows that drop within an hour of setting and is the best thing for those fluffy, slightly spiky arches that have largely replaced the sharp, filled-in brows of pre-pandemic social media. Essentially, this mascara wand glues hair transparently into place and doesn\u2019t let up until bedtime. Takes a good five minutes to dry, so get it on early. Isehan Heroine Make Long &amp; Curl mascara waterproof black, \u00a316.44 The best high street mascaras are by Maybelline and L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, but I draw your attention to this because it simply does not budge \u2013 however rich your skincare, hot your flashes, wet your home climate, active your lifestyle or teary your mood. Designed with (typically more straight) east Asian lashes in mind, this gives superior curl and lightweight volume that lasts. * * * Hair Schwarzkopf got2b Glued blasting freeze vegan hairspray 300ml, \u00a35 Yes, we all know L\u2019Or\u00e9al Elnett hairspray is the best for flexible hold, but if you want your blowout, scrunch-dry or up-do to have as much give as a granite worktop, reach no further than for this. None shall pass. Boots mini brush, \u00a31 One. Single. Pound. Which means I\u2019ve now spent a total of four quid to ensure I am never caught anywhere without one. An absolute essential, because nothing takes someone from bedraggled to groomed more instantly than a hairbrush. Philips touch-up pen trimmer for body and face, \u00a318.99 This nifty gadget has almost faded the psychic scars from upper-lip threading (truly, I\u2019ve had easier labours). What I use for any unwanted fuzz on small areas. Couldn\u2019t be any faster or easier, and with no adverse long-term effects. Shrine Drop It hair drops, \u00a39.99 If you have blond, grey or white hair and like to switch up the tone or shade without commitment, these will change your life. Essentially a food colouring for the hair, these concentrated drops are mixed into your usual conditioner, left for 10 minutes, then rinsed out as normal, to tint light hair for three to five washes. Brunettes: save your money. Josh Wood Colour Miracle Mask, \u00a319 Squeaking just under the price threshold, but worth it, this conditioning mask for colour-treated hair somehow manages the extremely rare feat of adding plenty of moisture without flattening like a swimcap. Keeps colour vibrant and roots wholly ungunked. SheaMoisture Strengthen &amp; Restore Jamaican black castor oil hair treatment mask 355ml, \u00a38.66 (special offer) This black-owned brand makes, in my view, the best hair-conditioning masks on the high street. This one \u2013 the richest and most potent \u2013 is designed to soften and strengthen textured hair. Leaves curls lustrous and defined. The smell is an acquired taste but I love it. Pantene Cheat Day dry shampoo foam 50ml, \u00a34.99 Never have my expectation-v-reality levels been so out of whack. This is truly brilliant for days when you don\u2019t have time to wash and blow-dry your hair and need to fake it fast. Massage a golfball-sized amount into dry roots, then blast upwards with a hairdryer for a minute or two for less oil and more volume. That\u2019s it. Tiny effort, huge difference. Naturelab Tokyo Perfect Volume blowout jelly 120ml, \u00a313 For when you do have time to wash and blow-dry, this extremely fine, fragrant Japanese hair gel gives serious volume and bounce to flat, fine hair. Rub a tiny amount between palms and rake hands through damp roots before drying upside-down with a dryer. Sounds pricey, lasts an age. Hershesons Almost Everything cream 50ml, \u00a312 Called \u201cAlmost Everything\u201d because it doesn\u2019t stand in for dry shampoo or hairspray, but turns its hand to pretty much anything else. This peachy-scented, award-winner defrizzes, adds smoothness, texture and shine, defines curls and coils, softens beards, protects against heat and even works as a conditioning mask. Add to any hair type, wet or dry \u2013 the finer your hair, the less you should use (a pea-size amount is plenty for me). Boots Everyday curly hair mousse 200ml, \u00a31.50 I\u2019ve raved lots about the regular version of this laughably cheap hair mousse, but the formula has seemingly, and needlessly, changed for the worse. This sister product for curly hair appears to remain unspoilt for now. Prices correct at time of going to press"

Gen Mark Milley also suggested that as many as 40,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed after being caught up in the conflict. The figures provided by Milley \u2013 which could not be independently confirmed \u2013 are the most precise to date from the US government more than eight months into the war. His remarks offer the highest US estimate of casualties in the nearly nine-month conflict to date, and came as Ukraine and Russia face a potential winter lull in fighting that experts say could offer an opportunity for some kind of negotiations. \u201cYou are looking at well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded,\u201d Milley said in remarks at the Economic Club of New York. \u201cSame thing probably on the Ukrainian side.\u201d Asked about prospects for diplomacy in Ukraine, Milley said the early refusal to negotiate in the first world war compounded human suffering and led to millions more casualties. \u201cSo when there is an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved: seize the moment,\u201d Milley said. Milley\u2019s comments came after Russia ordered its troops to withdraw from the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine \u2013 a big blow to Moscow\u2019s military campaign. But officials in Kyiv reacted with caution, saying the Russian army was unlikely to leave the strategic city without a fight, while the US president, Joe Biden, suggested the retreat was evidence that Moscow has \u201creal problems\u201d on the battlefield.

            "date": "2022-11-12T23:06:57Z",
            "content": "Two historical military planes collided and crashed to the ground Saturday during a Dallas airshow, federal officials said, sending plumes of black smoke billowing into the sky. Officials didn\u2019t immediately make clear how many people were on board the aircraft or if anyone on the ground was hurt. Nonetheless, an ABC News producer \u2013 citing reporting from a colleague \u2013 said on Twitter that at least six people, all crew members, were feared dead after the crash. Anthony Montoya saw the two planes collide. \u201cI just stood there. I was in complete shock and disbelief,\u201d said Montoya, 27, who attended the airshow with a friend. \u201cEverybody around was gasping. Everybody was bursting into tears. Everybody was in shock.\u201d Emergency crews raced to the crash scene at the Dallas Executive airport, about 10 miles from the city\u2019s downtown. Live news footage from the scene showed people setting up orange cones around the crumpled wreckage of a bomber, which was in a grassy area. The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra collided and crashed at about 1.20pm, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement. The collision occurred during the Commemorative Air Force Wings Over Dallas show. The B-17, an immense four-engine bomber, was a cornerstone of US air power during the second world war. The Kingcobra, a US fighter plane, was used mostly by Soviet forces during the war. Most B-17s were scrapped at the end of the second world war and only a handful remain today, largely featured at museums and airshows, according to Boeing. Several videos posted on Twitter showed the fighter plane appearing to fly into the bomber, causing them to quickly crash to the ground and setting off a large ball of fire and smoke. The Dallas mayor, Eric Johnson, said the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had taken control of the crash scene, with local police and fire providing support. \u201cThe videos are heartbreaking,\u201d he said on Twitter. Wings Over Dallas bills itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s premier world war II airshow\u201d, according to a website advertising the event. The show was scheduled for 11-13 November, Veterans Day weekend, and guests were to see more than 40 second world war-era aircraft. Hank Coates, president of the Commemorative Air Force, later told reporters that the families of crew members involved in the disaster \u2013 as well as witnesses \u2013 would be offered support, including emotional counseling. He declined to say exactly how many people were feared dead by officials, but he said the B-17 typically carried four to five crewmembers while the P-63 had a seat only for the pilot. \u201cPlease \u2026 if you have it in your mind, express prayers and thoughts for the crews that were involved today, for the people that saw it, for the family members,\u201d Coates said. \u201cObviously, this is a very challenging time for those families.\u201d The FAA and the NTSB were launching investigations. Preliminary reports may come out in the coming several days, but final findings may not be issued for more than a year. The Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2022-11-26T09:02:02Z",
            "content": "It will be the moment that Imran Khan has been building up to for weeks. On Saturday, Pakistan\u2019s toppled prime minister and former superstar cricketer will bring his \u201clong march 2.0\u201d to the city of Rawalpindi as he continues to push for early general elections. If a vote is called, Khan insists he will win overwhelmingly. Khan\u2019s appearance will be his first public outing since an assassination attempt earlier this month, when he was shot in the leg as his march travelled through Punjab. He remains unable to walk so will address the crowds from a wheelchair. According to security agencies, there remains a high risk of another assassination attempt, so Khan will be shielded within a cube of bulletproof glass. On Saturday, a video was circulating of aides posing with a now-removed blue cast that Khan wore on his right leg after the shooting. Since Khan was removed as prime minister in April in a vote of no confidence, his popularity has gone from strength to strength just as Pakistan has spiralled further into a state of political crisis. The former PM \u2013 known to thrive as an opposition agitator \u2013 has mobilised hundreds of thousands of people at his rallies and made speeches filled with incendiary rhetoric. Khan accused the US government of being behind a conspiracy to remove him from power, though he has recently backtracked and accused the new coalition government led by Shehbaz Sharif of being \u201cimported\u201d and corrupt. But it is Khan\u2019s decision to go up against Pakistan\u2019s mighty military establishment that has gripped the people and left the country reeling. Khan and the senior aides in his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), have not only accused the military of being responsible for pushing him out of office, but also for having a role in the assassination attempt. Khan unsuccessfully tried to file a police report naming Sharif, the interior minister, Rana Sanaullah Khan, and the senior army general Faisal Naseer as the three conspirators. \u201cIt is no secret that the [military] establishment played a huge role in removing Imran Khan from power, by forcing our allies to abandon him,\u201d said Fawad Chaudhry, a PTI spokesperson. The government and the military have denied this, and the shooter held responsible has said he acted alone. Khan\u2019s outspoken position is all the more extraordinary given his once entrenched relationship with the military establishment, who have a long history of keeping a stranglehold over Pakistani politics and in the past have taken power through coups. Yet many believe Khan is once again looking for their backing to return him to power. Khan\u2019s huge appeal, particularly when compared with the declining popularity of the Sharif government, remains his trump card. Zahid Hussain, a political analyst, said: \u201cKhan is hugely popular while the army position has been weakened and they are on the defensive so they may cave to pressure and talk to him. The military is not neutral, it has never been neutral.\u201d Khan was dealt a significant blow on Thursday when it was announced that the new army chief, arguably the most powerful position in Pakistan, will be Gen Asim Munir, whom Khan fired from a senior post in 2019. Munir is reported to be apolitical but, said the former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, \u201cto remain out of politics will be a big challenge for the new chief. The army has so much influence in governmental matters, it is so ingrained in the system, that it is difficult and complicated for this to just end\u201d. For years, Khan was described as the \u201cblue-eyed boy\u201d of the generals. Though he denies it, many within his party say he was elected in 2018 with the help of the military, who are accused of pressuring MPs to join the PTI and rigging the election in his favour. One senior PTI leader, who is still close to Khan so spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: \u201cThe military is cunning and they brought him in power in a way that they could also get him out easily as we were not given the majority.\u201d Khan\u2019s government operated as a so-called hybrid regime where the military interfered directly, though behind the scenes. \u201cOur politics was outsourced, it was run by ISI,\u201d said the PTI leader, referring to Inter-Services Intelligence, an agency controlled by the military. Noor Alam Khan, who left the PTI in April having joined from the Pakistan People\u2019s party, said: \u201cThere used to be interference from the establishment, lots of calls to politicians forcing them to join a certain party [PTI], vote a certain way.\u201d Since Khan was removed from power, the interference has stopped. Even Khan recently stated that while in power he received help from military agencies and could not pass bills without their support. Under the hybrid regime, the army cracked down on media freedom and Khan\u2019s political opponents were imprisoned. Pakistan\u2019s ranking in the Transparency International corruption index slipped a record 20 places from 2019-21 due to \u201cstate capture\u201d and an \u201cabsence of rule of law\u201d, despite Khan\u2019s election promise to clean up politics. In 2021, the relationship between Khan and the military, and in particular with the army chief, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, began to fray over the generals\u2019 concerns that Khan was running the country\u2019s economy into the ground, as inflation soared and the government spent wildly on subsidies on fuel and power. Khan\u2019s erratic approach to foreign policy, alienating allies such as the US and Saudi Arabia, was also a cause of consternation. The relationship broke down completely after the military refused to back Khan\u2019s candidates in regional elections, then decided against Khan\u2019s will to transfer Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the head of the ISI who was helping him run the country. Despite Khan\u2019s best efforts to prevent a vote of no confidence, it went ahead in April 2022 and he was removed after swathes of his own PTI MPs as well as coalition allies voted against him. Some credited not only the military\u2019s withdrawal of support but also the alleged rampant corruption and disastrous economic policies that had left them unable to face their constituents. \u201cImran Khan has two faces,\u201d said Noor Alam Khan. \u201cHe is not clean, he is not sincere to the nation and he does not believe in democracy.\u201d The ferocity with which Khan has since turned against the military appears to have taken the establishment by surprise. Khan criticised the military in speeches, in particular the powerful army chief Bajwa. On Wednesday night, Bajwa, who retires from his post next week, took the highly unconventional step of openly admitting military interference in politics for the past 70 years. In what appeared to be a pointed response to Khan, Bajwa criticised those building a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d and said the army had made the decision \u201cit would never interfere in any political matter\u201d. This was met with scepticism among analysts and politicians. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that too at times before and too many times it simply hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, a senior associate for south Asia at the Wilson Center thinktank in the US. \u201cGiven how deeply entrenched the military is in Pakistan\u2019s political fabric, it would be almost impossible for there to be such a sharp shift.\u201d Instead, Khan\u2019s fate is likely to rest on whether Munir, the new military chief, is willing to come to the negotiating table. \u201cUltimately the army wants to deal with the terrible political mess in the country,\u201d said Kugelman. \u201cSo the big question now is, do they think that involves some kind of reconciliation with Khan?\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-03T14:00:17Z",
            "content": "Two former defence leaders are being paid close to $800,000 combined to carry out a major review for the Albanese government, including a confidential update delivered this week. Contract records show the former chief of the Australian defence force Sir Angus Houston is being paid $470,000 for his work on the defence strategic review, while the former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith will receive $306,496. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup Both were appointed in August and signed eight-month contracts with the government. When this work is finished early next year, Smith will take up a new posting as Australia\u2019s high commissioner to the United Kingdom. The review will spell out the defence capability needed by Australia to respond to \u201cthe increasingly challenging geostrategic environment\u201d, as China pursues its military buildup and becomes more active in the Pacific. Houston and Smith met the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, on Thursday to provide an interim update, but the initial report was expected to remain confidential. Houston and Smith were weighing up the ADF\u2019s posture and structure and where the government should prioritise its spending. The government views the review as a significant and necessary piece of work and plans to publish the final report next year. It believes the review, combined with looming decisions on how Australia will acquire nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus partnership, will lay the foundations for the country\u2019s defence policy for decades to come. So far, Houston and Smith have received submissions from 150 entities or individuals. They have consulted a raft of defence contractors including BAE, Boeing, Navantia, Thales, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Andrew Shearer, director general of the Office of National Intelligence, and the heads of several government departments and agencies have provided input. A spokesperson for Marles said it \u201cwould be inappropriate to pre-empt the outcome or recommendations of the review\u201d. \u201cThe defence strategic review will make recommendations in relation to Defence force structure, force posture, and preparedness over the next decade and beyond; and on any other matters which are deemed appropriate to the review\u2019s outcomes,\u201d the spokesperson said. Thinktanks consulted include the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the United States Studies Centre and the Perth USAsia Centre. Houston and Smith have also heard from former defence ministers Kim Beazley (Labor) and David Johnston (Liberal). Johnston infamously said in 2014 that he would not trust the government\u2019s shipbuilder ASC to \u201cbuild a canoe\u201d \u2013 but later expressed regret over the \u201crhetorical flourish\u201d. The Coalition\u2019s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, said Australia must take seriously the risk that China may initiate military action against the self-governed democracy of Taiwan this decade. \u201cThe window is closing fast,\u201d he said. Given that Australia will not have the nuclear-powered submarines in the water in the near future, Hastie said Smith and Houston must consider how Australia could \u201chedge against the risk of conflict arriving sooner rather than later\u201d. \u201cWe need to build strike capabilities that can hold an adversary at risk beyond the archipelago to our north,\u201d he said. He said these options could include \u201cstrike bombers, precision guided missiles, and unmanned autonomous vehicles in the skies and in the seas below\u201d. While Labor has committed to annual defence spending of at least 2% of economic output, Hastie said the strategic circumstances meant that it \u201cmust be well above\u201d that benchmark. Hastie said the Australian government had \u201ca moral obligation to the Australian people to build and maintain a strong deterrent to any regional aggressor, to show that there is a great cost for any unilateral military adventurism\u201d. Marles is likely to give a broad sense of the government\u2019s direction when he addresses the Sydney Institute on 14 November, but any major decisions are expected to be made next year. The review will take into account the separate but related work on the nuclear-powered submarines, which is also due by March. Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead is head of a taskforce that is working with counterparts in the US and the UK to advise the government on how to deliver that project. A key part of that work will be determining how long before the submarines can be operational \u2013 and whether there is a \u201ccapability gap\u201d that needs to be filled in the meantime. It has been widely assumed that the first submarines may not be operational until the late 2030s. Last week\u2019s budget largely continued the defence policies of the former government amid an increasingly bleak economic outlook. The cost of the nuclear-powered submarines has not yet been factored into the budget. They were listed as a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d in the budget papers."

            "date": "2022-11-03T03:56:57Z",
            "content": "North Korea\u2019s launch of a suspected new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) may have been a failure, military chiefs in South Korea have said. The missile was one of three fired on Thursday morning. The ICBM was fired from the suburbs of Pyongyang but then appeared to have failed during normal flight after the separation of the propellant and warhead sections, defence sources told multiple South Korean media outlets. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s ICBM launch is presumed to have ended in failure,\u201d said the South Korean military, according to the Yonhap news agency. The long-range missile reached a maximum altitude of 2,000km (1,200 miles) and flew about 750km (460 miles), said Japanese defence minister Yasukazu Hamada, before it \u201cdisappeared\u201d from radar over the Sea of Japan, known in Korea as the East Sea, about 1,100km off the coast of Japan. The launches, between 7.30am and 9am local time, sparked emergency warnings in northern Japan to shelter indoors \u2013 in the prefectures of Miyagi, Yamagata and Niigata \u2013 and temporarily halted trains over fears one of the missiles would pass overhead. Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida said the launches were \u201coutrageous and absolutely intolerable\u201d. The government\u2019s chief spokesperson said Japan had lodged an immediate protest with Pyongyang via Beijing. US state department spokesperson Ned Price condemned the launch of an ICBM, saying it was a clear violation of multiple UN security council resolutions, and \u201cdemonstrates the threat the DPRK\u2019s [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea\u2019s] unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs pose to its neighbours, the region, international peace and security and the global non-proliferation regime\u201d. Wendy Sherman, the US deputy secretary of state, said she had spoken to her South Korea counterpart, adding: \u201cOur commitment to the security of the ROK [Republic of Korea] and Japan remains ironclad, and we\u2019ll partner to address DPRK provocations and other shared challenges.\u201d Seoul said the launches consisted of a long-range missile fired from Pyongyang, and two short-range missiles from Kaechon, north of the capital. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, told the New York Times: \u201cGiven the lack of prior notification and the experimental nature of North Korea\u2019s missiles, there are dangers that a test on a threatening trajectory could be interpreted as an attack or that a projectile could malfunction and hit a populated area.\u201d North Korea flew a missile over Japan in October in what it described as test of a new intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM), which experts said would potentially be capable of reaching Guam, a major US military hub in the Pacific. That launch forced the Japanese government to issue evacuation alerts and halt trains. The government and military in Japan are on alert for further missile launches on Thursday following the unprecedented flurry from North Korea the previous day. On Wednesday, Pyongyang fired 25 missiles of various kinds \u2013 including one that landed close to South Korea\u2019s waters, in what President Yoon Suk-yeol said was effectively \u201ca territorial invasion by a missile\u201d. It was the first time since the 1945 division of the peninsula that North Korea weapons had landed so close to South Korea, 26km beyond the northern limit line. Wednesday\u2019s launches were the most North Korea has ever fired in a single day. One of the missiles flew in the direction of a populated South Korean island, triggering air raid sirens and forcing residents to evacuate. South Korea quickly responded by launching guided air-to-surface missiles from jet fighters over the maritime border with the North. North Korea has said it is responding to Washington and Seoul mounting the largest joint military drills in its history, known as Vigilant Storm. These exercises, designed to deter North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, involve 240 warplanes \u2013 including advanced F-35 stealth fighters \u2013 conducting about 1,600 sorties. The large-scale drills began on Monday and will run until Friday."

            "content": "In an overcrowded diplomatic nuclear space, the last thing the west needed to hear was that North Korea was back in business. It fired 25 missiles of various kinds on Wednesday \u2013 including one that landed close to South Korea\u2019s waters, in what President Yoon Suk-yeol said was effectively \u201ca territorial invasion by a missile\u201d. It was the first time since the 1945 division of the peninsula that North Korea weapons had landed so close to South Korea, 26km beyond the northern limit line. With the New York Times reporting that US intelligence had picked up Russian military chatter about the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and the talks to prevent Iran building a nuclear bomb at a total impasse, a third nuclear front just adds to the sense of a world on the brink. The possibility, now confirmed by Washington, that North Korea is also providing missiles to the depleted Russian forces in Ukraine only adds to the sense it will be hard to continue to park North Korea in the overflowing pending tray. North Korea insists there is a rational logic to its actions, saying it was responding to Washington and Seoul mounting Vigilant Storm, the largest joint military drills in its history. These exercises, designed to deter North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, involve 240 warplanes \u2013 including advanced F-35 stealth fighters \u2013 conducting about 1,600 sorties. The large-scale drills began on Monday and will run until Friday. It now seems likely that North Korea will test a nuclear bomb for the first time since 2017, prompting some to argue that it is time for the US to recognise that North Korea is a nuclear weapons state. North Korea lives in fear of an invasion, and it is not as if Kim Jong-un has hidden how he plans to prevent one. Last year he set out a five-year plan, explaining all new weapons that North Korea planned to develop. This included smaller battlefield nuclear bombs and the short-range missiles to carry them. The recent round of tests and drills shows he is earnest in his intent, and there is nothing internal or external that is going to make him change his plans. Analysts of North Korea, one of the most opaque countries in the authoritarian world, often disagree whether the leadership\u2019s nuclear ambitions are driven by internal or external factors. One argument is that Kim\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a crisis he can offer to defuse in return for concessions on sanctions or trade deals. The other school says this underplays the extent to which North Korea\u2019s leaders are driven by fear of domestic economic failure. The Peterson Institute of International Economics on 28 September reported that North Korea was locked in the worst crisis of food insecurity since the great famines of the mid-1990s and concluded that in the most recent harvest cycle, a mixture of inadequate water and Covid restrictions meant North Korea had \u201cprobably fallen below the level of minimum human needs\u201d, partly due to rises in the price of grain. Whatever the motive, it leaves Yoon\u2019s \u201caudacious plan\u201d unveiled on 15 August, setting out the benefits North Korea would receive in return for a denuclearisation programme, looks even more of a dead letter. There had been high hopes for the plan: to distinguish it from previous incarnations, the Yoon government had indicated that South Korea could offer food aid in the early stage if North Korea returned to the denuclearisation talks even before it took concrete steps. The immediate US backing for South Korea\u2019s plan added another incentive, raising the hope that some kind of partial sanction relief could be possible for North Korea. But the plan was rejected by Pyongyang on the grounds that it was largely a recycling of previous offers that would have denuded the country of its security. No-one would trade away their destiny for corn cake, Kim Jong-un\u2019s sister, Kim Yo-jong, decreed. So Washington is waiting to see if North Korea will revive its nuclear test programme, and has only limited options if it does. The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, said last week: \u201cEverybody is holding its breath about this, because another nuclear test would be yet another confirmation of a programme which is moving full steam ahead, in a way that is incredibly, incredibly concerning, Further tests, of course, means that they are refining the preparations and the construction of their arsenal.\u201d So the world now faces the prospect of one rogue state in Asia, and another theocratic state in the Middle East coming closer to possessing a nuclear bomb than ever before, and at the same time a cornered nuclear superpower actually threatening to puts its arsenal to use. It is not the best backdrop for Joe Biden\u2019s run-in to the midterm elections."

            "date": "2022-11-04T16:05:32Z",
            "content": "Xi Jinping and Olaf Scholz have condemned Russia\u2019s threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, with both leaders expressing their desire for the conflict to end. The Chinese president stressed the need for greater cooperation between China and Germany in what he referred to as \u201ctimes of change and turmoil\u201d, and said both leaders \u201cjointly oppose the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,\u201d although he stopped short of criticising Russia or calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops. The German chancellor said Russia was in danger of \u201ccrossing a line\u201d in the international community if it used atomic weapons, in what was the first meeting with his Chinese counterpart. Scholz\u2019s inaugural one-day visit on Friday was the first by a leader of a G7 nation to China in three years, and was viewed as testing the waters of relations between Beijing and the west after years of mounting tensions, analysts say. Observers said Scholz\u2019s visit was being viewed in China as a welcome development as the country\u2019s leadership looks to consolidate its relations with the outside world after years of isolation during the pandemic. For his part, Scholz was looking to achieve greater market access at a time when the German economy is struggling with inflation and an imminent recession, largely fuelled by the energy crisis. Scholz defended his decision to travel to China with a group of industrial representatives, which has been viewed with controversy at home, telling journalists: \u201cIt is good and right that I am in Beijing today.\u201d He said in time of crisis, such as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, bilateral meetings were all the more important. In a meeting with China\u2019s outgoing premier, Li Keqiang, Scholz said he had urged Xi to use China\u2019s influence as a permanent member of the UN security council on Russia to bring an end to the invasion of Ukraine. \u201cI told president Xi that it is important for China to exercise its influence on Russia,\u201d he said. During their meeting, which was held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi said that as large nations with influence, China and Germany should work together all the more during \u201ctimes of change and turmoil\u201d for the sake of world peace, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. \u201cAs long as the principles of mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, exchanges and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation are upheld, the general direction of bilateral relations will not be deviated, and the pace of progress will be stable,\u201d Xi was quoted as saying by CCTV. \u201cAt present, the international situation is complex and changeable. As influential powers, China and Germany should work together in times of change and chaos to make more contributions to world peace and development.\u201d Over lunch Scholz told Xi it was important both leaders were meeting in person during tense times, with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine creating problems for the rules-based global order, according to a Reuters reporter accompanying Scholz\u2019s delegation. At a news conference after his meeting with Li, Scholz said he had raised the issue of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory over which it will not exclude using weapons in order to bring it under its control. \u201cLike the US and other countries, we are pursuing a one-China policy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have made equally clear that any change in Taiwan\u2019s status quo must be peaceful or by mutual consent.\u201d The two leaders also discussed Europe-China relations, the climate crisis and global hunger, as well as how to develop China-Germany economic ties, which Scholz said had \u201cbecome more difficult for German companies recently\u201d because of China sealing off access to many of its market sectors. Li nominally has responsibility over China\u2019s economy. According to German media who accompanied him, Scholz indirectly admonished China over its failures to protect minorities in China. He told Xi that human rights were universal, especially the rights of minorities and pledged to \u201cwant to remain in discussion\u201d with China about the situation in the province of Xinjiang, which is allegedly home to hundreds of interment camps in which more than 1 million Uyghurs are believed to be held. China\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy and growing tensions with the west have made it unfeasible for leaders of major western powers to visit China. Xi himself has only just resumed foreign trips. Scholz\u2019s visit is probably a welcome development for China\u2019s leadership, which will be looking to shore up relations with the outside world after the conclusion of the 20th party congress, where Xi consolidated his status as the core of the ruling Communist party. In the run-up to the visit, there had been criticism from within the EU and the German government coalition, mainly from the Green party and the Liberals. With Reuters and Associated Press"

Beijing\u2019s readout from the long-awaited meeting in Bali differed slightly and did not mention the pair agreeing on opposing Russia\u2019s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war. Biden said Kherson was a significant victory for Ukraine and that he was confident Russia would not occupy Ukraine as it intended. The US president said it was hard to tell at this point what the victory would mean, but that the US would continue to support Ukraine.

Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed the claim as \u201cthe height of fakery\u201d and posted a video of Lavrov sitting reading documents at his hotel. The governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a checkup. The White House confirmed that the CIA director, William J Burns, was in Ankara in Turkey on Monday to speak with his Russian counterpart. A White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations, and was conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. Rishi Sunak called Russia a \u201cpariah state\u201d on the eve of the G20 summit in Indonesia. The UK prime minister said he would take every opportunity at the talks to confront Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who is attending in Vladimir Putin\u2019s absence. The US has announced fresh sanctions, targeting a transnational network that has been working to procure technology to support Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The latest sanctions target 14 individuals and 28 entities, including family members of the Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, as well as people that it says worked as financial facilitators in Kerimov\u2019s network. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has announced it has banned entry to 100 Canadians in the latest in a series of tit-for-tat measures. They include the actor Jim Carrey and the author Margaret Atwood. The EU and its member states have so far provided weapons and military equipment worth a total of at least \u20ac8bn (\u00a37bn) to Ukraine, according to the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. A pro-Russia tank gunner who was accused of firing into residential buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason, according to Ukraine\u2019s state security service (SBU).

That\u2019s it from me, L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for following along. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The UN\u2019s general assembly has approved a resolution calling for Russia to be held accountable for its invasion of Ukraine, including by making reparations to Kyiv. The resolution, supported by 94 of the assembly\u2019s 193 members, recognises that Russia must be held accountable for violations of international law in or against Ukraine. Russia \u201cmust bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts\u201d, the resolution reads. Ukraine\u2019s state railway service, Ukrzaliznytsia, has begun repairing damaged rail tracks and infrastructure on the Kherson line, according to the country\u2019s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov. Family members of a former Russian prison inmate who defected to Ukraine after being recruited by the Kremlin-linked private military group Wagner have expressed \u201chorror\u201d after a gruesome video emerged on Friday that showed him being killed by repeated blows with a sledgehammer. Footage of the killing of Yevgeny Nuzhin was posted over the weekend by the Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone. In the video, Nuzhin was shown lying down with his head taped to a brick wall as an unidentified man in combat clothing hit him with a sledgehammer. Nuzhin, 55, had been serving a 24-year prison sentence for a murder he committed in 1999, but was freed in July and conscripted into Wagner, a notorious military group run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful Russian businessman and a close ally of Vladimir Putin. Following his capture by Ukrainian forces in September, Nuzhin gave a series of interviews in the country, in which he said he had joined the Wagner group to get out of prison and that he had quickly hatched a plan to surrender to Ukraine. In the interviews, he also criticised the Russian leadership and expressed his desire to join the Ukrainian forces and fight against Moscow. Ilya Nuzhin, Yevgeny\u2019s son, confirmed to the Guardian on Monday that the man in the video was his father but declined to give further comments, citing \u201csecurity concerns\u201d.

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels, he said this was about 45% of what the US has supplied to Kyiv. Borrell added that the EU would \u201ccontinue isolating Russia internationally\u201d and continue imposing \u201crestrictive measures\u201d against Russia\u2019s economy. Rishi Sunak has called Russia a \u201cpariah state\u201d on the eve of his first meeting of the G20 in Indonesia, where he has vowed to confront Moscow\u2019s representative in public and on the sidelines of the summit. The UK prime minister said he would take every opportunity during the summit to confront Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who is attending in Vladimir Putin\u2019s absence, and said that would be not only in the hall itself but at any opportunity if the two came face-to-face. \u201cRussia is becoming a pariah state and he\u2019s [Putin] not there to take responsibility for what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Sunak told reporters on the plane before the meeting in Bali, where he will meet Lavrov for the first time. But I\u2019m going to use the opportunity to put on the record my condemnation of what they\u2019re doing. I will do that in the hall, I will do that if I see him elsewhere, and that\u2019s the right thing to do. Sunak said his opening words at the G20 would be to condemn Putin\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine and said there was no suggestion the Russians were prepared to restart peace negotiations. Read the full story here: Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has announced it has banned entry to 100 Canadians, including the actor Jim Carrey and author Margaret Atwood, in the latest in a series of tit-for-tat measures. In a statement, it said the Canadians added to its sanctions list included officials, business leaders and people involved with \u201cmedia and financial structures that are directly involved in the formation of an aggressive anti-Russian course\u201d. The list includes Danielle Smith, the premier of the province of Alberta; journalists at the public broadcaster CBC; and several members of the Canada-Ukraine Foundation. The announcement comes after Canada announced a new round of Russia-related sanctions on police officers, investigators, prosecutors and judges. The Russian ministry said it had decided on the new round of sanctions \u201cin response to the practice, implemented by Justin Trudeau\u2019s regime, of imposing sanctions against the Russian leadership, politicians and parliamentarians, business representatives, experts and journalists, cultural figures\u201d. The UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said he is \u201chopeful\u201d Russia will extend the Black Sea graininitiative. The UN is \u201cworking non-stop\u201d to renew the \u201cessential\u201d deal that gives safe passage to Ukrainian grain shipments, Guterres said during a press conference at the G20 summit in Bali. Talks over the last week had delivered \u201ca lot of progress\u201d on the deal, which is set to expire on Saturday, he added. He said: We need urgent action to prevent famine and hunger in a growing number of places around the world. The Black Sea grain initiative, and efforts to ensure Russian food and fertilisers can flow to global markets, are essential to global food security. The US has announced fresh sanctions targeting a transnational network that has been working to procure technology to support Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The sanctions target 14 individuals and 28 entities, including family members of the Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, as well as people that it says worked as financial facilitators in Kerimov\u2019s network. In a statement, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: The United States will continue to disrupt Russia\u2019s military supply chains and impose high costs on President Putin\u2019s enablers, as well as all those who support Russia\u2019s brutality against its neighbour. The US treasury department also blacklisted Milandr, a Russian microelectronics company that it says is part of Moscow\u2019s military research and development structure. It has also imposed sanctions on major military industrial companies in Russia. The US commerce department has cut off exports of American-made components and US technologies that have been used in some of Russia\u2019s military hardware. It\u2019s 6pm in Kyiv and Moscow.

Some people waved Ukrainian flags and others had the flag draped over their shoulders as Zelenskiy addressed the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m really happy, you can tell by the reaction of the people, their reaction is not staged,\u201d said Zelenskiy, who was flanked by heavily armed security guards. \u201cThe people were waiting for the Ukrainian army, for our soldiers, for all of us.\u201d The US president, Joe Biden, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war \u201cshould never be fought\u201d, in a long-awaited meeting in Bali earlier today, the White House said. The pair shook hands in front of the US and Chinese flags before the three-hour meeting on the resort island and \u201cspoke candidly\u201d about a range of issues, including key regional and global challenges, the White House said in a statement. China\u2019s readout from the meeting differed slightly, with the New York Times reporting: \u201cUnlike the White House\u2019s account, the Chinese account did not mention Xi and Biden agreeing on opposing Russia\u2019s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war.\u201d In remarks to the media after his meeting with China\u2019s president, Biden said that Kherson was a significant victory for Ukraine. Biden said it was hard to tell at this point what the victory would mean, but that the US would continue to support Ukraine. He said he was confident that Russia would not occupy Ukraine as it intended. According to Russian media sources, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of Herois\u2019ke, in the Kinburn peninsula in the southern part of Kherson, after an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region. Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. \u201cInvestigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,\u201d he said on Sunday.

In the video, Lavrov says: \u201cThis is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful \u2013 they need to write the truth\u201d. However, the governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a checkup. The White House confirmed that the CIA director, William J Burns, was in Ankara in Turkey on Monday to speak with his Russian counterpart. A White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations, and he was conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. The Kremlin has confirmed talks between US and Russian officials took place in Ankara today, Russian state-owned news agency Tass has reported, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Here are some more images from the newly liberated city of Kherson that have been sent to us over the newswires. Zambia has asked Russia to explain how one of its citizens who had been serving a prison sentence in Moscow ended up on the battlefield in Ukraine where he was killed, Zambia\u2019s foreign affairs minister said on Monday, Reuters reports. Stanley Kakubo said in a statement that Russia had notified Zambia about the death in September of the 23-year-old, but did not provide details. The Zambian student was serving a jail sentence at a medium security prison on the outskirts of Moscow after being convicted of contravening Russian law, Kakubo said, without specifying the offence that occurred in April 2020. \u201cThe Zambian government has requested the Russian authorities to urgently provide information on the circumstances under which a Zambian citizen, serving a prison sentence in Moscow, could have been recruited to fight in Ukraine,\u201d Kakubo said. It was not clear how the prisoner was recruited and by whom. Reuters could not independently verify the details surrounding his death. Russia\u2019s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Canada will provide Ukraine with a further $500m (\u00a3425m) in additional military assistance in addition to sanctions on nearly two dozen more Russians, prime minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement on Monday as the G20 summit began. Reuters reports the funding is additional to the $3.4bn Canada has given to Kyiv so far for its defence against Russia\u2019s invasion and will help fund military, surveillance and communications equipment, fuel and medical supplies, the statement said. Monday\u2019s sanctions target 23 Russian individuals \u201cinvolved in gross and systematic human rights violations against Russian opposition leaders\u201d, including police officers, prosecutors, judges and prison officials, Trudeau\u2019s office said. Chris Buckley at the New York Times is reporting that China\u2019s readout of the meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping differs slightly for the US account. Buckley writes: Unlike the White House\u2019s account, the Chinese account did not mention Xi and Biden agreeing on opposing Russia\u2019s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war. According to the Chinese account, Xi said that \u201cChina is highly concerned with the current situation in Ukraine\u201d. Xi also said that \u201ca complicated issue does not have a simple solution,\u201d and that \u201cconfrontation between major powers must be avoided.\u201d In remarks to the media after his meeting earlier with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, the US president, Joe Biden, has said that Kherson is a significant victory for Ukraine. Biden said it is hard to tell at this point what the victory will mean, but that the US will continue to support Ukraine. Reuters reports he said he is confident that Russia will not occupy Ukraine as they intended. The White House has confirmed that the CIA director, William J Burns, is in Ankara in Turkey to speak with his Russian counterpart. Reuters reports that a White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, and that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations. A national security council spokesperson told CNN: We have been very open about the fact that we have channels to communicate with Russia on managing risk, especially nuclear risk and risks to strategic stability. As part of this effort, Bill Burns is in Ankara today to meet with his Russian intelligence counterpart. He is not discussing settlement of the war in Ukraine. He is conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. He will also raise the cases of unjustly detained US citizens. US president Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war \u201cshould never be fought\u201d in a long-awaited meeting in Bali earlier today, the White House said. The pair shook hands in front of the US and Chinese flags ahead of the three-hour meeting on the resort island and \u201cspoke candidly\u201d about a range of issues, including key regional and global challenges, the White House said in a statement. It said: President Biden raised Russia\u2019s brutal war against Ukraine and Russia\u2019s irresponsible threats of nuclear use. President Biden and President Xi reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won and underscored their opposition to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The two leaders held their first face-to-face talks since Biden took office on the sidelines of the G20 summit. The US and China shared the responsibility to show the world that they can \u201cmanage our differences, prevent competition from becoming conflict\u201d, Biden said. Britain\u2019s prime minister Rishi Sunak, who is in Bali for the G20 summit, said he would use the opportunity to \u201cunequivocally condemn\u201d Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. He told broadcasters: I\u2019m going to use this opportunity to unequivocally condemn Russia\u2019s hostile and illegal war in Ukraine. And I know that other allies will as well because it\u2019s right that we highlight what is going on and hold Russia to account for that and I won\u2019t shy away from doing that you accept. Sunak appeared to acknowledge that the G20 was divided on the issue of explicitly condemning Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine: The G20 is a very different forum to the G7 for example. The G7 is a group of like-minded liberal democracies with similar values. The G20, we have to acknowledge, is a different grouping. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t be engaged in it. We should make our voices heard and constructively work with people where we can to make a difference for people at home as well. And you saw that recently, when it came to migration, the ability to talk to other countries can have benefits for people at home and that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to deliver. A pro-Russian tank gunner who was accused of firing into residential buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason, according to Ukraine\u2019s state security service (SBU). The pro-Russian militant, nicknamed \u201cPhil\u201d, had fired \u201cat least 20 shots at residential high-rise buildings in Mariupol\u201d, the SBU said in a statement. The statement said: The Security Service of Ukraine collected indisputable evidence of crimes committed by the militant of the \u2018DPR\u2019 [Donetsk People\u2019s Republic] terrorist organisation nicknamed \u2018Phil\u2019. The evidence allowed the court to imprison him for 12 years. The man was captured by Ukrainian forces near the eastern village of Rivnopil in April after his tank came under attack. He was found guilty of high treason and the \u201ccreation of unauthorised armed groups or participation in its activities\u201d, the SBU said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spent 30 minutes on Monday morning visiting Kherson, days after Russian troops withdrew. Addressing Ukrainian soldiers in front of the administration building in the main square, Zelenskiy said: We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country. The president sang the Ukrainian national anthem as the country\u2019s blue and yellow flag was hoisted in the southern city. According to Russian media sources, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of Herois\u2019ke, in the Kinburn Peninsula, following an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region. On Sunday, there were \u201cunconfirmed reports\u2019\u2019 that Ukrainian forces were about to launch a \u201csmall-scale amphibious operation\u201d on the peninsula, in Biloberezhia Sviatoslava national park, which connects to Russian-occupied territory on the eastern side of the Dnipro River. Ukrainian troops are likely to continue consolidating control of the western bank in the coming days. A draft resolution by the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, seen by Reuters, calls on Russia to cease all actions against Ukraine\u2019s nuclear facilities including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The draft of what would be the third resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) 35-nation board of governors reads: (The board) calls upon the Russian Federation to abandon its baseless claims of ownership of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, to immediately withdraw its military and other personnel from the plant, and to cease all actions against, and at, the plant and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine. The wording of the draft is similar to that of the two previous resolutions passed in March and September. Both resolutions were passed with large majorities, with only Russia and China opposing them. We have just arrived in a small, coastal village, named Kobleve, in the region of Mykolaiv, facing the vast Black Sea. Crimea is \u201conly\u2019\u201d 140km away from here. Just yesterday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy suggested that Crimea, illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, is an active Ukrainian military target and that, after the liberation of Kherson, the Ukrainians could try to take it back. \u201cWe will definitely reach our state border \u2013 all sections of the internationally recognised border of Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskiy said. The beach and sea are infested with hundreds of mines placed by both sides in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, posing a serious threat to people. The Ukrainian government has banned coastal bathing. Experts agree it will take years to de-mine the Black Sea. The Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s aim is to \u201cleave Ukraine cold and dark this winter\u201d, Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Russia\u2019s withdrawal from Kherson demonstrates the \u201cincredible courage\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, the military alliance chief said during a press conference with members of the Dutch government in The Hague. It is up to Ukraine to decide what terms are acceptable for negotiations to bring an end to the war, he said, adding Nato\u2019s role was to support Kyiv. Stoltenberg said: We should not make the mistake of underestimating Russia. The Russian armed forces retain significant capabilities, as well as a large number of troops and Russia has demonstrated the willingness to bear significant losses. They have also shown extreme brutality. He added: The coming months will be difficult. Putin\u2019s aim is to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter. So we must stay the course. Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s chief of staff, has shared a video showing the Ukrainian president singing the national anthem as the flag of Ukraine is raised over the city of Kherson. Kirill Stremousov was in the mood for a chat. A political marginal on the fringes of society just six months ago, he was clearly relishing the newfound attention he was receiving as the public face of Russia\u2019s occupation of Ukraine\u2019s Kherson region. \u201cI am on a constant high,\u201d the Moscow-installed official told the Guardian in a phone interview in August. We have won. I am living in a dream. Russia is in Kherson for ever. That \u201cfor ever\u201d ended abruptly on Wednesday, when Stremousov, 45, was killed in a car crash as he was speeding away from Kherson. By that time, he was already fully aware that his dream of a Russian Kherson would soon be torn apart as Ukrainian troops were closing in to liberate the city. On Friday evening, in remarkable scenes, crowds of jubilant residents greeted Ukraine\u2019s armed forces as they reached the centre of Kherson. Stremousov\u2019s rise and fall is a story of how one man\u2019s ruthless opportunism and ideological fantasies can play out in a war-torn country. It also serves to demonstrate how thuggish and unsavoury characters thrive in Russia today as the country\u2019s leadership embraces anti-western hysteria. Read the full story here: On Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. He said: Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered. After two nights of jubilation after the liberation of their city, on Sunday Kherson residents began to assess the extent of the damage wreaked by eight long months of Russian occupation, with many homes still without electricity and water. A Turkish official has declined to comment on a report that Russian and US delegations were holding talks in the Turkish capital, Ankara. The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that officials from the two countries were meeting today, citing a source. The paper claimed that Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russia\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency, was reportedly part of the Russian delegation. The Kremlin said it could neither confirm nor deny the story. Hello everyone. I\u2019m L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy spent 30 minutes on Monday morning visiting the newly liberated city of Kherson, days after Russian troops withdrew from the city over the River Dnipro to the southern portion of the Kherson region. Addressing troops in front of the administration building in the main square, the president said: \u201cWe are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.\u201d Russian forces destroyed key infrastructure in Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Kherson before retreating, Zelenskiy had said in his nightly address. Russia troops \u201cdestroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity\u201d, he said. Kherson\u2019s mayor said the humanitarian situation was \u201csevere\u201d because of a lack of water, medicine and bread. Zelenskiy said authorities had dealt with nearly 2,000 mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Ukrainians hailed Russia\u2019s retreat from Kherson as Kyiv said it was working to de-mine the strategic southern city and restore power across the region. In the formerly occupied villages of Pravdyne and Snihurivka, outside Kherson, returning locals embraced returning troops and their neighbours, some unable to hold back tears. \u201cVictory, finally!\u201d one said. The head of Kherson\u2019s regional state administration said everything was being done to \u201creturn normal life\u201d to the area. Speaking from Kherson city in a video poster to social media, Yaroslav Yanushevych said that while de-mining was carried out, a curfew had been put in place and movement in and out of the city had been limited. Zelenskiy added that 226 settlements in the Kherson region will be restored, encompassing more than 100,000 local residents. Ukraine can \u201cfeel the approach of our victory\u201d he added in his latest national address. Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. \u201cInvestigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,\u201d he said on Sunday. There was confusion after it was reported that Russia\u2019s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had been hospitalised after arriving in Bali for the G20 summit. Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed the claim as \u201cthe height of fakery\u201d, and posted a video of Lavrov sitting reading documents at his hotel. In the video, Lavrov says: \u201cThis is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful \u2013 they need to write the truth\u201d. However, the governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a check-up. The EU\u2019s top diplomat has said Ukraine will decide when to enter talks with Russia, amid growing speculation that western capitals will pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, said: \u201cUkraine will decide what to do. Our duty is to support them.\u201d He was arriving for the monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers, which will be focused on the war in Ukraine. Borrell said the Russian retreat and recapture of Kherson by Ukraine was \u201cvery good news\u201d and showed the EU\u2019s strategy of military support was the right one. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back with you later on. L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly. Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters this morning that the Russian president would not be going to Bali to the G20 summit because \u201ccircumstances dictate the priority of the president being in the Russian Federation\u201d, according to a report from the state-owned Tass news agency. The Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spent 30 minutes on Monday morning visiting the newly liberated city of Kherson, days after Russian troops withdrew from the city over the River Dnipro to the southern portion of the Kherson region. Reuters reports that he addressed troops in front of the administration building in the main square. He said: \u201cWe are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.\u201d He thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia and said the delivery of high-mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) from the US had made a big difference to Ukraine\u2019s war effort. Parents with children, some pushing baby strollers, also gathered in the main square in front of the administration building that until recently was occupied by Russian forces. Some people waved Ukrainian flags and others had the flag draped over their shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m really happy, you can tell by the reaction of the people, their reaction is not staged,\u201d said Zelenskiy, who was flanked by heavily armed security guards. \u201cThe people were waiting for the Ukrainian army, for our soldiers, for all of us.\u201d He said it was important to visit Kherson to show support for residents who endured about eight months of Russian occupation and to demonstrate to them that \u201cwe are really returning, we really raise our flag\u201d. Asked by reporters where Ukrainian forces might advance next, he said: \u201cNot Moscow \u2026 We\u2019re not interested in the territories of another country.\u201d Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, despite not controlling the territory. On his official Telegram channel, Zelenskiy posted a series of images from the trip, accompanied with the simple messages \u201cKherson \u2013 Ukraine \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\u201d and \u201cOur heroes \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a series of photographs of his visit to Kherson on his Telegram channel with the simple message \u201cKherson \u2013 Ukraine \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6\u201d in Ukrainian and English. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has tweeted that the EU is increasing the amount of money it is devoting to supporting food security, saying: \u201cPutin\u2019s war is bringing millions to the brink of starvation.\u201d Here is a short video clip of the Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kherson. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has just posted a video to her Telegram account that appears to show Sergei Lavrov working at a table outside his hotel suite in Bali and reacting to the news that he is reported to be in hospital. Reuters reports that in the video, Lavrov says: \u201cThis is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful \u2013 they need to write the truth.\u201d However, the governor of Bali has said that Lavrov was in good health, and had been in hospital for a check-up. While there continues to be some confusion about Sergei Lavrov in Bali, it is definite that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Kherson, and we have just received some images from his trip. According to Reuters, it is Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova who has dismissed the claim that Sergei Lavrov was hospitalised in Bali. \u201cThis, of course, is the height of fakery,\u201d Reuters report her saying. Reuters is reporting that the Russian foreign ministry has dismissed the earlier Associated Press claim that Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was hospitalised in Bali as \u201cfake news\u201d. More details soon \u2026 Russian media including RIA Novosti and Tass are this morning carrying allegations of mistreatment of Russian prisoners of war by their Ukrainian captors. In particular, they are carrying quotes from the press service of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation in which a Russian soldier alleges he was buried alive as part of an interrogation. According to the RIA report, the committee alleges: One of the released soldiers said that the Ukrainian servicemen tied his hands and feet, put a bag over his head and did not take it off for several days. During this time he was beaten. In addition, due to dissatisfaction with the answers to their questions, the nationalists put a gun to his head and threatened to shoot and bury him. \u201cThey fulfilled the last threat by throwing the prisoner to the bottom of the trench and covering it with earth. The threat of deprivation of life was so real that only after lying in this position for about five hours did he realise that he would live,\u201d the department noted. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the newly liberated city of Kherson, days after a Russian troop withdrawal from the southern Ukrainian city after months of occupation, a Reuters witness said. \u201cWe are moving forward,\u201d he told troops. \u201cWe are ready for peace, peace for all our country.\u201d He thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia. Associated Press have a quick snap to say that according to Indonesian officials, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was taken to hospital after arriving for the G20 summit in Bali. More details soon \u2026 Reuters has a quick snap that Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the newly liberated city of Kherson. More details soon \u2026 Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv, has posted to Telegram to say that in the last week de-mining efforts in the region had removed 377 explosive objects. The Chernihiv region is to the north of Kyiv, and was one of the areas Russia attacked in February from Belarus in its failed attempt to capture Ukraine\u2019s capital city. Jennifer Rankin reports for the Guardian from Brussels: The EU\u2019s top diplomat has said Ukraine will decide when to enter talks with Russia, amid growing speculation that western capitals will pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, said: \u201cUkraine will decide what to do. Our duty is to support them.\u201d He was arriving for the monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers, which will be focused on the war in Ukraine. Borrell said the Russian retreat and recapture of Kherson by Ukraine was \u201cvery good news\u201d and showed the EU\u2019s strategy of military support was the right one. He claimed that EU military support was greater than some reports suggested, amid growing frustration from EU capitals that the bloc\u2019s efforts are not being recognised vis-a-vis US aid. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to put the right figures on the table,\u201d Borrell said, promising further details later. EU foreign ministers are set to agree further sanctions against prominent Iranians, in response to the violent crackdown on human rights and will also discuss Teheran\u2019s role in supporting Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Borrell said the bloc had no evidence Iran was supplying Russia with missiles, although there is some concern this may be the case. Last month, the EU sanctioned four Iranians involved in supplying lethal drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine. Here are some more images from the newly liberated city of Kherson that have been sent to us over the newswires. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Donetsk, reports that overnight in the areas of the region controlled by Ukraine, two people were injured, and that one house, seven high-rise buildings, a kindergarten and an administrative building were damaged by shelling from pro-Russian forces. Donetsk is one of the regions of occupied Ukraine that Russia has claimed to annex following a \u201creferendum\u201d, despite not fully controlling the territory. In the FT this morning, Henry Foy and Mercedes Ruehl have a bleak assessment of the likelihood of unity over the war in Ukraine at the G20 summit in Bali this week. They write: \u201cThis really is the first G20 to take place after the end of the post-cold war era. You know, this is a new world,\u201d said Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think-tank. \u201cWe\u2019re back in a global landscape in which there is militarised rivalry between the west and Russia. And that rivalry is now extending to China. And as a consequence, the ability of the G20 to function as a co-operative body is very much called into question.\u201d \u201cI would not want to be the Indonesians in the sense that you really are hosting a meeting that is taking place against the backdrop of a level of ideological and geopolitical division that we haven\u2019t seen since the Berlin Wall came down,\u201d said Kupchan, who was special assistant to former US president Barack Obama. \u201cThere will be no agreement on language condemning Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine,\u201d said a senior German official of the G20, echoing downbeat assessments from other western delegations. In closed-door meetings to draft the summit communiqu\u00e9, China has maintained its strong support for Russia, stymying efforts by western officials to include language condemning the war. Hanna Arhirova is in Kherson for Agence France-Presse, and she has spoken to 73-year-old Yevhen Teliezhenko. He and his wife have been driving around the city, flying their Ukrainian flag and asking the soldiers who liberated them to autograph it. \u201cThey were fighting for us. We knew we were not alone,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally freedom!\u201d said 61-year-old Tetiana Hitina, Teliezhenko\u2019s wife. \u201cThe city was dead.\u201d Karina Zaikina, 24, said that in the final days before they finished their pullout last week, Russian troops grew increasingly nervous and rumours flew around the city \u201cThey were stealing and morally pressuring us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was clear that they were scared because they all walked only in groups.\u201d \u201cI woke up calm today,\u201d she added. \u201cFor the first time in many months, I wasn\u2019t scared to go to the city.\u201d The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, interviewed on Sky News, has absolutely ruled out normalising the country\u2019s relationship with Russia during the course of the G20 summit. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. I will be with you for the next few hours. Winter will bring a change in conflict conditions, including fewer offensives and more static defensive frontlines and a greater risk of weapon malfunctions, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Changes to daylight hours, temperature and weather will present unique challenges for fighting soldiers. A reduction in daylight hours will result in fewer offensives and more static defensive frontlines, the latest British intelligence report suggests. Night vision capability will also be a precious commodity, further exacerbating the unwillingness to fight at night. As temperatures drop, forces lacking in winter weather clothing and accommodation are highly likely to suffer from non-freezing cold injuries, the ministry adds. Additionally, the \u201cgolden hour\u201d window in which to save a critically wounded soldier is reduced by approximately half, making the risk of contact with the enemy much greater. An increase in rainfall, wind speed and snowfall will provide additional challenges to the already low morale of Russian forces and also present problems for kit maintenance. Basic drills such as weapon cleaning must be adjusted to the conditions and the risk of weapon malfunctions increase. New Zealand will send a further 66 defence force personnel to the UK to help train Ukrainian soldiers. New Zealand has a team of 120 defence force (NZDF) personnel training Ukrainians in the UK but this deployment was due to end. The deployment will run from 30 November until July 2023, a government statement said. \u201cI am pleased the NZDF infantry can offer the skills and experience for further training. This deployment also provides an opportunity for NZDF personnel to gain valuable experience,\u201d said Peeni Henare, minister of defence, on Monday. The New Zealand government has also said it would extend the NZDF\u2019s existing intelligence contribution, redeploy four NZDF staff to help with the logistics hub in Europe and provide eight people to support those deployed in the region. No NZDF staff will be sent into Ukraine. The government said it will donate NZ$1.85m ($1.13m) to the World Food Programme to help address global food security and NZ$1.85m to the Nato Trust fund. Images of local residents embracing returning Ukrainian soldiers as they celebrated the liberation of towns and villages throughout Kherson have emerged on our newswires today. Many were reunited for the first time since Russian troops occupied the region in southern Ukraine. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said the US will impose fresh sanctions on a transnational network of individuals and companies that have been working to procure military technologies for Russia\u2019s war effort in Ukraine. Yellen told reporters on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali the sanctions would target 14 individuals and 28 entities, including financial facilitators, but she declined to provide details on where they were located. She said the announcement was scheduled for later on Monday, according to Reuters. This is part of our larger effort to disrupt Russia\u2019s war effort and deny equipment it needs through sanctions and export controls,\u201d Yellen told reporters. She declined to provide details on which technologies the sanctions would target in an effort to cut off Russian purchases. The US Treasury has sanctioned major military industrial firms in Russia and the Commerce Department has cut off exports of American-made components and US technologies that have been used in some of Russia\u2019s military hardware. A family of four, including an 11-year-old child, has reportedly been killed after the car they were travelling in run over a landmine in the Kherson region. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, reported the deaths on Sunday evening in a post on his Telegram channel. Tymoshenko said the family hit a landmine in the village of Novoraisk on Sunday, resulting in the fatal explosion. Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to return basic services to those living in Kherson after the retreating Russian army blew up all major infrastructure, leaving residents without electricity and water. Russian troops \u201cdestroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity\u201d president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest national address. Kherson\u2019s mayor said the humanitarian situation was \u201csevere\u201d because of a lack of water, medicine and bread while Zelenskiy said authorities were dealing with thousands of mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Roman Golovnya, an adviser to the city\u2019s local administration, said: \u201cRussian occupying forces and collaborators did everything possible to make those people who remained in the city suffer as much as possible during these days, weeks and months of waiting.\u201d The head of Kherson\u2019s regional state administration said everything was being done to \u201creturn normal life\u201d to the area. Speaking from Kherson city in a video poster to social media, Yaroslav Yanushevych said that while de-mining was carried out, a curfew had been put in place and movement in and out of the city had been limited. Retreating Russian forces reportedly destroyed Kherson city\u2019s communications, electricity, water, heat, a 100-metre-tall TV tower and at least four bridges. Ukrainians also accused Russians of blowing up dozens of schools across the province, further damaging the prospects of children who have already missed nine months of lessons. Zelenskiy added that 226 settlements in the Kherson region will be restored, encompassing more than 100,000 local residents. On Sunday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,\u201d he said. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I\u2019m Samantha Lock and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to de-mine the strategic southern city of Kherson and restore power across the region after the retreating Russian army blew up all major infrastructure, leaving residents without electricity and water. Kherson\u2019s mayor said the humanitarian situation was \u201csevere\u201d because of a lack of water, medicine and bread while Zelenskiy said authorities were dealing with thousands of mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Volodymyr Zelenskiy also accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. \u201cInvestigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,\u201d the Ukrainian president said. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: Russian forces destroyed key infrastructure in Ukraine\u2019s southern city of Kherson before retreating, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Russia troops \u201cdestroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity\u201d, he said in his latest national address. Kherson\u2019s mayor said the humanitarian situation was \u201csevere\u201d because of a lack of water, medicine and bread. Zelenskiy said authorities had dealt with nearly 2,000 mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Ukrainians hailed Russia\u2019s retreat from Kherson as Kyiv said it was working to de-mine the strategic southern city and restore power across the region. In the formerly occupied villages of Pravdyne and Snihurivka, outside Kherson, returning locals embraced returning troops and their neighbours, some unable to hold back tears. \u201cVictory, finally!\u201d one said. The head of Kherson\u2019s regional state administration said everything was being done to \u201creturn normal life\u201d to the area. Speaking from Kherson city in a video poster to social media, Yaroslav Yanushevych said that while de-mining was carried out, a curfew had been put in place and movement in and out of the city had been limited. Zelenskiy added that 226 settlements in the Kherson region will be restored, encompassing more than 100,000 local residents. Ukraine can \u201cfeel the approach of our victory\u201d, he added in his latest national address. Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. \u201cInvestigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,\u201d he said on Sunday. Significant new damage to the major Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, which the Russians attempted to blow up during their withdrawal from nearby Kherson, was seen via satellite imagery from US company Maxar. Ukrainian authorities are trying to assess the damage and it is not clear if the structural integrity of the reservoir is at risk. With a water volume of 18.2 cubic km, the reservoir could flood a huge area, including the city of Kherson, if destroyed. Pro-Moscow forces are putting up a fierce fight in the eastern Donetsk region. \u201cBattles in Donetsk region are just as intense as they have been in previous days,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. \u201cThe level of Russian attacks has not declined. And the level of our resilience and courage is at its highest. We will not allow them through our defence.\u201d The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said some sanctions on Russia could remain in place even after any peace agreement with Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported. Yellen said that any eventual peace agreement would involve a review of the penalties the US and its allies have imposed on Russia\u2019s economy, according to the Journal. \u201cI suppose in the context of some peace agreement, adjustment of sanctions is possible and could be appropriate,\u201d Yellen said in an interview in Indonesia, where she is attending the G20 summit. Russia\u2019s education minister, Sergey Kravstov, has said that military training will return to Russian schools next September, according to the latest update by the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence. The programme is supported by Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defence, which states that no less than 140 hours per academic year should be devoted to this training. Ukraine will decide on the timing and contents of any negotiation framework with Russia, according to a readout of a meeting between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, at the Asean summit in Cambodia in Phnom Penh. Vladimir Putin has spoken to his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, by phone and both leaders placed emphasis on deepening political, trade and economic cooperation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Saturday. The discussion of \u201ca number of topical issues on the bilateral agenda\u201d also including the transport and logistics sector, the Kremlin said. It did not say when the phone call took place and made no mention of Iranian arms supplies to Moscow. Russia said there was no agreement yet to extend a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain via the Black Sea, repeating its insistence on unhindered access to world markets for its own food and fertiliser exports, Reuters reported. Ukraine has used the Cop27 climate talks to address how Russia\u2019s invasion is causing an environmental as well as humanitarian catastrophe, with fossil fuels a key catalyst of the country\u2019s destruction."

            "date": "2022-11-25T14:30:45Z",
            "content": "An unspoiled, spirit-enhancing countryside view celebrated by the 19th-century critic and poet John Ruskin as one of the most beautiful in the world is under threat unless \u00a31m can be raised. It was after a visit in 1875 that Ruskin described the view over the River Lune from the churchyard of St Mary\u2019s in Kirkby Lonsdale as \u201cone of the loveliest in England, therefore in the world\u201d. He wrote: \u201cWhatever moorland hill, and sweet river, and English forest foliage can be seen at their best is gathered there. And chiefly seen from the steep bank which falls to the stream side from the upper part of the town itself \u2026 I do not know in all my own country, still less in France or Italy, a place more naturally divine, or a more priceless possession of true \u2018Holy Land\u2019.\u201d The view was painted by JMW Turner in 1822 but it was already famous, with the poet William Wordsworth describing it as a place not to be missed in his 1810 Guide to the Lakes. It is the reason why many tourists visit the small Cumbrian market town, but if they do so today they will come across a locked gate. The issue, according to Mike Burchnall, the chair of the town council, is that the footpath is on an embankment and when the Lune below is high it cuts into the bank. Work was done in the mid-1980s to try to reinforce the bank but a lot of that was washed away during Storm Desmond in 2015, \u201cand we\u2019ve had big storms ever since then so the whole bank is eroded\u201d. It is a big job to resolve the problem and will cost an estimated \u00a31m. The council, which was given the land in the 1800s, is putting in \u00a3100,000 and has given itself until this time next year to raise the money. \u201cThe problem with the Lune is that you can only do the work between June and September so we want to try to do the work in 2024,\u201d said Burchnall. \u201cEach year we don\u2019t raise the money, the footpath will be closed and we\u2019ve got a longer timescale to do the work. We\u2019ve got to try and get the money in as soon as we can.\u201d The council hopes to bid successfully for Heritage Fund lottery money and raise the rest through donations. The local brewery has made an 1822 ale from which 10 pence a pint goes to the fund and shopkeepers have put out collecting boxes. \u201cIt is a big ask,\u201d said Burchnall. \u201cBut failure isn\u2019t a possibility because if we do fail then the footpath may disappear into the River Lune. We\u2019ve really got to do it. Having it closed off has been very difficult for tourists who come here. The view is completely blocked and we\u2019ve had to put metal gates up to close the whole of the footpath because it is unstable.\u201d It is also a nuisance for local people, many of whom walk their dogs there or want a quick route to the rugby club. \u201cIt is a very important link in the town which has been closed off for more than a year. There has been quite a lot of concern and opposition but I think most people realise it had to close and we\u2019ve got to do something about it,\u201d Burchnall added."

            "content": "I do not share your enthusiasm for the \u201cgood news\u201d that Sizewell C is believed to be safe from Jeremy Hunt\u2019s budgetary cuts (\u201cBritain can\u2019t afford to waver over nuclear power \u2013 soon it will be too late\u201d, Editorial). \u201cOn a freezing cold, windless, winter\u2019s evening\u201d, Britain\u2019s grid will indeed need an alternative power source to wind or solar, but why is it assumed that only nuclear can provide an alternative base load? And at the cost of how many billions? And how many decades of lead time? Geothermal could do the job faster, more safely and cheaply \u2013 for about a quarter of the cost. Geothermal power plants operate already in the United States, Italy and Iceland. And nothing is more certain and regular than the tide twice a day; sea turbines already operate in tidal flows off Orkney and Shetland and are another safe source of energy baseload. Let us not be blinkered by nuclear. Wendy Fowler Carnac-Rouffiac, France Your leader on Sizewell C ignores a couple of factors that are key to our local objections. First, the coastline on which Sizewell A and B are built and Sizewell C is proposed is disintegrating at an increasingly alarming rate \u2013 just two weeks\u2019 ago a building at nearby Thorpeness had to be demolished due to collapse of the cliffs. Second, there is insufficient water in Suffolk to build and operate Sizewell C, which was one of the main reasons the government\u2019s own planning inspectorate advised against it recently. Water is planned to be found through the construction of desalination plants \u2013 these require huge amounts of energy, but more importantly the waste salt and other minerals from the extraction process will be put back into the sea, poisoning the waters around for miles. There are other reasons why this is a disastrous location: it is a site of special scientific interest and an area of outstanding natural beauty and the prototype for this type of reactor has yet to be proved at Flamanville \u2013 still not operational, years over schedule and way over budget. Nuclear has moved on since the design of these reactors. The government should think again. Rosie Hoare Saxmundham, Suffolk No wonder we Irish are off \u201cThere\u2019s not many left,\u201d noted Peggy O\u2019Donoghue, a long-time Irish resident in your highly revealing article (\u201cBritain\u2019s dwindling Irish community mourn the fading of a great migration\u201d, Focus). But what your article didn\u2019t ask is what is the attraction of the UK to young Irish people in 2022? England is no longer the land of opportunity it once was. Brexit and the negative media attitudes that painted a picture of a country that didn\u2019t welcome foreigners only encouraged young people to emigrate to America, Australia, South Africa and Europe. Ireland has emerged from the shadow of a colonial power and the grip of the Catholic church and developed into a well-educated, diverse and globalised society. Like many others, I left Ireland in 1990 because of a lack of opportunities at home. Today, the opportunities on offer to school leavers in Ireland are much improved. Ireland is not without its problems, such as a lack of affordable housing and unequal income distribution, but at least we have a generation who have hope for their country. I don\u2019t see that in England today. Stuart Finegan Lewes Get Brexit undone I do not agree with your correspondent Tanya Firth when she says that the Labour party did not support remain in the EU referendum (Letters). As an ordinary Labour party member, I canvassed, telephoned and door-knocked to stay in the EU following a six-point question list from national Labour. It was a deeply unpleasant experience and many of my colleagues stopped because of the nightly racist comments. One night it was against Poles, the next Romanians. When Boris Johnson announced the Turks were coming, they were the target. We can see the same today with the hatred being generated against asylum seekers. Steven Bowditch Stanwix, Carlisle I wholeheartedly agree with David Mitchell\u2019s critical analysis of politics as the art of the possible when concluding that \u201creversing Brexit would be the most significant geopolitical choice that Britain could make in its own interests\u201d and a goal that Labour should embrace (\u201cLabour should reverse on not reversing Brexit\u201d, New Review). Reversing the Brexiters\u2019 winning election slogan and campaigning vigorously to \u201cGet Brexit Undone\u201d would be a powerful means. Mick Beeby Westbury on Trym, Bristol The way to net zero Keir Sarmer rightly points out the gap between rhetoric and reality that has characterised the UK\u2019s response to the climate emergency over the last 12 years (\u201cRishi Sunak is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age\u201d, Comment). It should not be the case that the biggest backers of our potentially \u201cworld-leading\u201d renewable energy technologies have been ordinary investors putting their money where their mouth is via regulated crowdfunding platforms such as Abundance Investment. Labour should also be celebrating those local councils that have engaged their citizens directly, by issuing or pledging to issue Local Climate Bonds, including Labour\u2019s newly won council of Westminster. These raise funds directly from residents, paying a fair return to fund council efforts to decarbonise their economy, ranging from solar energy to EV charging, biodiversity to waste recycling. They are democratic finance in action and can transform the political narrative of the transition to net zero. The chaos of the last few months has offered Labour a unique opportunity to bring a consistent and clear message to consumers, businesses and markets that the transition to net zero is not a cost to be borne, but an opportunity to seize. Investment in green infrastructure and support for green businesses (and the solutions they are creating) is the route to sound money and sustainable growth. Bruce Davis, co-founder and joint managing director, Abundance Investment Cirencester, Gloucestershire Books for all Iranian refugee Ali in Reading is quoted as saying: \u201cAll I want is an actual book to read but there are none here and there is no way I can afford them\u201d (\u201cEnglish people try to help. Their government does not\u201d, News). He will find a free public library in Abbey Square in that town and many others throughout Berkshire and, despite terrible cuts since the Conservatives came to power, all over the UK. Everyone is welcome in their local public library and in the one where I work, and in many others, we have made particular provision for refugees (eg recently buying books in Ukrainian).

            "date": "2022-11-28T15:00:24Z",
            "content": "For the second time since moving to the US 15 years ago, I had to call 911 this week. The first time, six years ago, was when smoke poured into the elevator from a fire in the laundry room and four fire trucks arrived within minutes. This week, it was to request an ambulance for a sick neighbour. Between dialling the number, and a gurney and two paramedics materialising in our hallway, was approximately seven minutes. I found myself thinking something I used to think about the NHS: what an amazing service. My understanding, at this distance, is that most ambulances in the UK do not show up in under 10 minutes, even when the emergency is dire. A friend who had a heart attack in the street in London this year was, he told me, lying on the pavement for 40 minutes before the ambulance showed up. This is terrifying, and yet still marginally less terrifying than the common American experience of emergency care, in which gratitude for efficiency is undercut by the dim but thrilling possibility of losing one\u2019s house when the invoice arrives. All of which is at the forefront of my mind as we slog through the season of healthcare renewal. I have to stop going on about this, I know. Short of moving to Canada, or joining a powerful union I don\u2019t qualify for, there is nothing to be done about it. Still, the sheer punitive opacity of the system has never shocked me so much as it is currently doing, when, after years of renewing an existing policy, I finally decide to go shopping. \u201cDo you know how this works?\u201d says a sales agent. I have just asked if she can send me a breakdown of coverage and exclusions for a policy that costs in the region of $10,000 a year. \u201cHow it works is we can send you the full policy details after you\u2019ve signed and paid, and then if you want to cancel, you have 30 days.\u201d There is a pause while I digest this. \u201cIsn\u2019t that \u2026 quite weird?\u201d I say. She laughs nervously. \u201cI mean \u2026 it\u2019s just how it works.\u201d Brightening, she says, \u201cBut you can ask any question about the policy and I\u2019ll answer it!\u201d After calling three other agents expecting a different response, I understand that no one here is acting in bad faith; this is, as she says, just how it is: an Alice in Wonderland system in which you only know what you\u2019re buying after you\u2019ve bought it. And so we grind through the preliminaries. No pre-existing conditions; nobody smokes; no interest in maternity cover. All of which cheers the agent no end, as it results in a relatively attractive quote. I ask the single question it is vital to ask in New York when buying health insurance for your family. \u201cIf someone gets cancer, can we get into Sloan Kettering?\u201d Her voice sharpens instantly. \u201cDoes someone have cancer?\u201d \u201cNo. No one has cancer.\u201d \u201cWell, then, yes. It\u2019s a PPO (preferred provider organisation), it\u2019ll be accepted everywhere.\u201d But of course, this isn\u2019t the whole story, and when I ask why the provider she\u2019s flogging isn\u2019t listed on my doctor\u2019s table of accepted insurance, she gets tetchy. \u201cWe\u2019re accepted by 80% of medical providers in the US.\u201d Ah. You can guarantee, in this scenario, that the 20% of doctors who don\u2019t accept this sketchy insurance are in New York, where you can\u2019t cough without someone sending you a bill for $350 (\u00a3290). In the middle of all this, I visit my wonderful primary care doctor for my annual medical. She commiserates with me and tries to find a workaround to foil my existing insurers. In the US, public health policy recommends routine colonoscopies for everyone over 45 \u2013 ha, you wouldn\u2019t get that in Britain, I thought, when she told me about it last year, before checking my policy to find it wasn\u2019t covered. A colonoscopy costs upwards of $5,000 (\u00a34,130) in New York. \u201cThey just want you to die,\u201d says my doctor lugubriously, a starker statement than I was expecting. But I guess at some level, true. So there you have it. Broken Britain or this hellscape? It\u2019s a tough call. Today, I will get on the phone again to try to find a loophole in the system, a unicorn policy that covers both routine screenings and major medical events; one that, in the event of an emergency, will bring an ambulance to my door inside of 10 minutes \u2013 assuming I\u2019m not too terrified to call for it.

Having worked as a therapist in a community mental health unit attached to a small general hospital in west London during the late 1980s, the die was cast for floundering patterns to eventually flourish apace. The then Thatcher government was ruthlessly bent on urgently closing residential units across the nation, under the fallacious guise of promising comprehensive community support that never effectively materialised. It was simply a funding cut measure, totally oblivious to the obvious, ie that viable community care is even more expensive than residential. Thus the on-street debilitation continued apace, cultivating a protracted problem that has come home to roost. The case for wholesome, vibrant community care is both patent and blatant, and would go a long way to reduce the many drawbacks inherent in delivery of residential care, as Watts highlights. Sadly, appropriate funding for this is still not forthcoming. More\u2019s the pity. Jim Cosgrove Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland \u2022 I think it\u2019s important to highlight that in the 1980s all the in-house psychiatric hospitals were reduced, due to financial constraints. There was a promise of more community-based care to supplement the lack of in-house care. Since then it could be argued there has been a direct link between homelessness and the reduction of beds. An understanding of the context and history of this problem is important. Elizabeth Sarah Thurston, Suffolk \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "date": "2022-11-19T07:00:52Z",
            "content": "A patient dies in a chair awaiting treatment. Other patients wait all night in ambulances. Hospitals are so understaffed they tell the public to stay away. One hospital suspends emergency general surgery. Another week, another slew of headlines about Northern Ireland\u2019s healthcare crisis, by some measures the worst in the UK. And the drumbeat of bad news is expected to continue this weekend when family doctors vote on radical proposals \u2013 such as levying fees to visit GPs \u2013 to try to save an overstretched system from collapse. Several GP surgeries have closed, with more closures expected. The region\u2019s shambolic healthcare became so parlous that it eclipsed other concerns such as the cost of living, Stormont\u2019s political stalemate and the Northern Ireland protocol. A decade of underfunding and policy dysfunction paved the way for a crisis that on Friday left politicians and healthcare providers trading blame. The latest flashpoint was the South West acute hospital in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which suspended unplanned emergency surgery after a consultant surgeon resigned. Geraldine McKay, the director of acute services at the Western trust, said it had not been able to hire enough consultants. \u201cThe trust is therefore now unable to maintain the required workforce to sustain and deliver a safe emergency general surgical service,\u201d she said. Local politicians and community activists condemned the announcement. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the town hall, some holding placards. \u201cThe trust don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to have a rural hospital, travel is not acceptable,\u201d one protester, Dermot Browne, told the BBC. However, Barry McAree, a consultant colorectal and general surgeon, welcomed the announcement as overdue. \u201cI believe that this should have happened a long time ago, as do many others,\u201d he said. McAree said the Bengoa review \u2013 a 2016 report about the region\u2019s health service \u2013 had recommended consolidating services, which meant shutting and restricting some departments. \u201cThe fact is that surgeons and patients are better looked after in bigger units with longer travel times even taken into the mix.\u201d He accused politicians of \u201cparish pump\u201d politics. All major parties have accepted the need to restructure healthcare but balked at unpopular measures, leaving resources scattered piecemeal across the region. The collapse of devolved government has compounded the policy paralysis. Michelle O\u2019Neill, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s putative first minister, called for the Stormont executive to be restored after meeting nurses. \u201cThey feel exhausted and demoralised. They are crying out for support and for help, just to do their jobs,\u201d she said. Waiting lists have been building since 2013. Nearly a fifth of Northern Ireland\u2019s population are waiting for a first appointment, and more than half of those have been waiting for more than a year. Groups representing people with cancer, multiple sclerosis and other conditions say the delays are having devastating consequences. The number of people waiting more than a month to start cancer treatment has quintupled over the past decade. An elderly patient died on 11 November while awaiting treatment at Belfast\u2019s Royal Victoria hospital, which was under extreme pressure at the time with more than 60 patients awaiting admission. Patients\u2019 relatives have complained about long waits at other hospitals. One elderly woman with a fractured kneecap waited eight hours outside Antrim area hospital. Last month, a court jailed a former patient for assault at the same hospital. Paul Parks, 59, told a nurse who was treating him to \u201cfuck off or I\u2019ll show you what I can do\u201d, before stubbing out a cigarette on her hand."

Sunday\u2019s protest, coordinated by neighbourhood groups, medical unions and leftwing political parties, was held to defend public healthcare against creeping privatisation and to express concern over the regional government\u2019s restructuring of the primary care system. The central government\u2019s delegation to Madrid put attendance at 200,000, but organisers said more than 650,000 had joined the demonstration. Some medical staff are already on strike over the new model for non-hospital emergency health centres, while almost 5,000 GPs and paediatricians in the region are set to join them later this month because of \u201cthe excess workload, the endless appointments and a lack of time for seeing patients\u201d. Madrid\u2019s populist regional president, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, responded to the large turnout, and growing public anger, with a characteristically eccentric speech in which she reflected on the fall of the Berlin Wall, dusted off the ghost of the defunct Basque terrorist group Eta, and accused Spain\u2019s socialist-led coalition government of conspiring to create a \u201cde facto federal, secular republic\u201d. Ayuso said the event had been organised at a time when the centre-left Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party was being eclipsed by its rivals further to the left in the M\u00e1s Madrid party. \u201cYesterday\u2019s demonstration wasn\u2019t held in defence of public healthcare,\u201d said Ayuso, who is one of the most high-profile members of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP). \u201cIt was held to find new far-left leadership for the Madrid region because of the collapse the Socialist party is going to suffer. If it had solely been a demonstration about public healthcare, don\u2019t be in any doubt that 2 million madrile\u00f1os would have attended.\u201d Ayuso also suggested that critics of the region\u2019s public health system did not know what they were talking about as they probably had private healthcare. \u201cInstead of pursuing solutions through agreement and negotiation, instead of seeking a national agreement to solve the shortage of doctors, which is a real problem that affects the whole of Spain, the left has chosen to politicise the difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a destabilising strategy from an irresponsible left that is trying desperately to cling to power or to gain power \u2013 as is the case in Madrid \u2013 through confusion, agitation and dirty tricks.\u201d A spokesperson for the Madrid PP was blunter still, describing the protest as a \u201cresounding failure\u201d because \u201c99%\u201d of the region\u2019s people had not supported it. \u00c1ngela Hern\u00e1ndez, a surgeon and general secretary of Madrid\u2019s AMYTS medical association, said the PP was ignoring reality. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to hear people from the Madrid regional government saying yesterday was a failure,\u201d she told the Antena 3 TV channel. \u201cI saw deniers when it came to the pandemic and the virus, but I wasn\u2019t expecting to see deniers when it came to yesterday\u2019s demonstration.\u201d M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda, a doctor and spokesperson for M\u00e1s Madrid, announced on Monday that her party had filed an official complaint with the public ombudsman over what she termed a \u201cconstant attack\u201d on Madrid\u2019s public health system. \u201c[The PP] think that when you go to a health centre and find a tablet instead of a doctor, that\u2019s a success,\u201d said Garc\u00eda. \u201cAnd yet when 600,000 people come out to defend a right as basic as the right to health, they call that a failure.\u201d Others, meanwhile, had anticipated Ayuso\u2019s response to the protest. \u201cRight now, Ayuso\u2019s team will be weighing up various options to try to cover up what happened today,\u201d Pablo Echenique, a senior Podemos MP, tweeted on Sunday night. \u201cThey\u2019ll put on a hood and announce the return of Eta using a distorted voice; they\u2019ll say public healthcare is communism, or they\u2019ll say the Spanish flag is a million years old.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-07T14:00:04Z",
            "content": "A federal government decision to defund a not-for-profit organisation that has been educating consumers about safe healthcare and medicines for more than two decades will leave people susceptible to medical misinformation and harm, experts say. Prior to the federal election in May, the former government planned a complete cut to funding for NPS MedicineWise. Health and medical groups lobbied Labor during the election campaign to review the decision. After being elected, the government commissioned audit firm Deloitte to conduct a rapid review into the decision. After receiving Deloitte\u2019s advice, it upheld the cut. NPS MedicineWise\u2019s commonwealth funding amounted to more than $25m in the 2021/22 budget. In a statement, NPS MedicineWise said the decision was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. The chair of NPS, Dr Andrew Knight, said the organisation had \u201cno choice\u201d but to cease operations after 31 December. \u201cWe believe it will prove to be a poor decision, and will make the safe and wise use of medicines in Australia much harder to achieve,\u201d he said. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (ACSQHC) will absorb some of NPS MedicineWise\u2019s functions, while other services will be put out to tender. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup But Dr Barbara Mintzes, an associate professor with the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Centre and School of Pharmacy said while the commission \u201c\u2026 does excellent work setting guidelines for care in public hospitals, it has little expertise in the type of evidence-based behaviour change strategies in primary care that NPS has perfected\u201d. \u201cNPS MedicineWise\u2019s work leads to a net savings in drug, medical services and hospitalisation costs \u2013 with an estimated $1.1bn saved over the last 20 years \u2013 more savings than it costs to fund it,\u201d Prof Mintzes said. \u201cThis is not taking into account suffering from harmful medicine use prevented. It\u2019s also unclear what will be dropped and how much will go out for tender \u2013 the Consumer Medicines Information Line, a phone line people could call about their own medicines \u2013 is already out for tender.\u201d The director of the Institute for Evidence-Based Healthcare, Prof Paul Glasziou, said the trust that NPS had with GPs \u201cwill not be easily or quickly replaced\u201d. \u201cThat puts some of the quality usage programs in jeopardy, as well as being a morale blow for GPs,\u201d he said. Prof Glasziou is also chief investigator with the Australian-New Zealand General Practice Respiratory Infections Network. Its members wrote a letter to the health minister, Mark Butler, urging him to reconsider the funding cut. The letter describes how NPS educates the public and clinicians about overuse of antibiotics to avoid the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance. \u201cThe work by NPS has been important to contain the growth in overuse, but needs to be strengthened rather than cut,\u201d members wrote. Butler did not respond to a request for comment, but referred Guardian Australia\u2019s questions to the federal health department. A department spokesperson said ACSQHC \u201cis very well-positioned to deliver the program in future, as it is already responsible for leading quality and safety in healthcare\u201d. The director of the University of Sydney\u2019s Health Literacy Lab, Prof Kirsten McCaffery, said she and her colleagues had also written to the minister asking him to reconsider and said the decision to uphold the funding cuts was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. \u201cMy research often involves interviewing and surveying patients about their healthcare and understanding the impact on their lives when healthcare or medicines are delivered inappropriately,\u201d Prof McCaffery said. \u201cThis can have devastating and life changing consequences for patients. For example: an unnecessary scan could lead to unnecessary surgery, or the wrong medicine or dose could lead to dizziness, a fall and hospitalisation. NPS worked to prevent these things from happening, and I fear we will be worse off without it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-11T07:00:14Z",
            "content": "The number of active Covid cases has exploded across the country as Australia enters its fourth wave, prompting renewed warnings to protect vulnerable aged care residents. Jurisdictions collectively recorded more than 58,000 new cases of Covid in the past week, with some states reporting a doubling in the number of people hospitalised with the virus. New South Wales recorded 19,800 new cases in the past seven days, Victoria had 16,636 new cases, and Western Australia recorded more than 8,000. South Australia had 6,867 new cases in the past week, Queensland recorded 5,828, and the ACT and NT had 1,194 and 369 new cases respectively. Tasmania was yet to publish its weekly case numbers by 3.30pm on Friday. NSW\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said it was clear the country was now in its fourth wave. Chant expected that the wave would probably peak before Christmas given its current trajectory. \u201cThe wave is taking off with some trajectory, it will be quite a steep wave and hopefully the decline will be equally as steep,\u201d she said on Friday. \u201cThere is a sense that the wave may well peak before Christmas and we may be on the decline [by then]. \u201cBut the message is clear \u2026 this is an increased risk period for Covid, so please, now is the time to take those protective behaviours.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In Queensland, where hospital bed occupancy had almost doubled, the chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, said the state had moved to an \u201camber alert\u201d for the fourth wave. \u201cThis was always expected and we continue to see waves of Covid-19 in the coming months and even longer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we have devised the traffic light system so that Queenslanders can know when we are entering a wave and, equally important, when we are leaving a wave, so they might modify their behaviour appropriately.\u201d He said the average age of Covid cases had increased with each successive wave in Queensland this year. In the first wave, the average age was 33. The average so far in this wave has been 47, he said. \u201cWe know that older people have been less likely to get Covid during the course of the year because they have been protecting themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with each wave, we are seeing more and more older Queenslanders acquire infection.\u201d Victoria said it had recorded an 18.1% increase in hospitalisations, and that the average daily number of new cases was 2,377 this week, up from 1,471 last week. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said the increasing hospitalisations had been driven by the emerging Omicron subvariants including BQ.1 and XBB. \u201cThere is currently no evidence to suggest these subvariants cause more severe disease,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, hospitalisation rates are likely increasing due to waning immunity from past vaccination and the ability of these new subvariants to escape immunity from past infection.\u201d The aged care sector is also warning Australians to take extra precautions to protect vulnerable residents. The Aged &amp; Community Care Providers Association chief executive, Tom Symondson, urged anyone who was entering an aged care home to take a rapid test or wear a mask, and he urged staff who have tested positive to stay away from residents. \u201cAged care providers are well equipped and prepared with supplies of PPE and their IPC protocols to manage Covid outbreaks, but we must continue to do everything we can to keep our residents and clients safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ask visitors to support staff in ensuring their loved ones are protected and remember to show your appreciation for their commitment in incredibly challenging circumstances.\u201d Health department data shows the proportion of Australians with a fourth vaccine dose is about 42.1%. The vast majority (89.6%) have had two doses or more and 72% have had their third dose booster. The vast majority of aged care residents have had four doses or more, and 99% of aged care staff have had at least two doses."

            "content": "A new wave of Covid-19 infections is looming in New South Wales, the state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has warned, with transmission of the virus predicted to increase in coming weeks. It follows Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, making a similar announcement last week, with Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and XBB tipped to overtake BA.5 as the dominant variants throughout Australia. \u201cWe are starting to see an increase of Covid-19 cases and changes in the variants circulating in NSW, which tells us we are entering the next Covid wave,\u201d Chant said on Thursday in a video on the NSW Health Facebook page. \u201cBy looking at all the local information we have and what\u2019s happening overseas we believe Covid cases will rise in the coming weeks.\u201d Chant reiterated the importance of getting booster doses and again urged those most at risk of severe disease to plan ahead by talking to their doctor about the antivirals available to reduce the severity of infection. She also urged people to stay home if they have cold or flu-like symptoms and asked those who must leave the house while unwell to wear a mask when indoors or on public transport. They should avoid large gatherings and high-risk settings, such as hospitals and aged or disability care facilities, for at least seven days. Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and XBB are driving significant cases and hospitalisations overseas due to their ability to escape immunity from past infection \u2013 and due to waning immunity from past vaccination. The World Health Organization does not consider the two subvariants as different enough from other circulating Omicron subvariants to warrant their classification as new variants of concern. But the two sublineages remain part of Omicron, which is a variant of concern. The WHO has said there is no epidemiological data to suggest an increase in disease severity due to the variants. \u201cCases of reinfection were primarily limited to those with initial infection in the pre-Omicron period,\u201d a WHO statement published on 27 October said. \u201cAs of now, there are no data to support escape from recent immune responses induced by other Omicron lineages.\u201d Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup The latest NSW respiratory diseases surveillance report, published on Thursday, found data indicated the start of a new wave of Covid infections. There were 9,707 people diagnosed with Covid in the week ending 29 October, an increase of 11.4% since the previous week, the report said. Emergency department presentations requiring admission increased to 118 from 96 in the previous week. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, said on Thursday \u201cthere is evidence of a small increase at this stage in case numbers \u2026 coming off a very big decline that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring that very, very closely,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to reiterate really, the advice of Kerry Chant this morning, the NSW chief health officer, that this is a timely reminder to get your booster, to make sure that you are up to date with your vaccination.\u201d There are 5 million Australians over the age of 16 who are eligible for a third dose but have not yet had it, Butler said. \u201cFor many of them, it will be more than 12 months since they had their second dose.\u201d On Saturday, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said fluctuations in case numbers would continue and \u201cCovid will be with us in one form or another for quite a long time\u201d. \u201cBut we are treating it in a different way now because you\u2019ve got to move beyond this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see Covid numbers go up and down. Whether it\u2019s a wave or whether it\u2019s a spike, I\u2019ll leave that for others to determine. This era of Covid exceptionalism has to end, and it has. National cabinet has made those decisions.\u201d Meanwhile, results from two complementary national serosurveys, one in children and adolescents and one in adults, were published on Thursday to provide a snapshot of the extent of infections across Australia to the end of August. Serosurveys involve conducting tests on blood samples taken from thousands of Australians across various age groups, geographical locations and target populations. Researchers look for antibodies to the virus in the blood to determine the extent a population has been affected. The children and adolescents survey found at least 64% of 0 to 19-year-olds in Australia had been infected with Covid-19. Dr Archana Koirala, an infectious disease specialist at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance and paediatric study lead, said: \u201cOverall, this study tells us that at least two-thirds of children in Australia have had Covid-19.\u201d \u201cThis is more than double the number of cases reported based on nose and throat swab testing for the virus,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is expected since many children have either mild or no symptoms and are therefore not tested for the virus.\u201d In children aged one to four years old, approximately eight out of 10 had evidence of past infection. This group was not eligible for vaccination at the time of the serosurveys; however, high-risk, severely immunocompromised children aged six months to four years became eligible for vaccination from September. The adult study found at least 65% of adults in Australia had been infected by the virus, similar to the proportion of children and adolescents."

            "date": "2022-11-11T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "An American man has returned 19 antiquities to the four countries they came from after reading reports in the Guardian about the repatriation of looted antiquities. John Gomperts, who lives in Washington, realised that the ancient pieces worth up to \u00a380,000 \u2013 including two seventh- and eighth-century BC Cypriot vases \u2013 that he had inherited from his grandmother could have come from illicit excavations because they have no collecting history. He wanted to do the right thing legally and ethically by returning the items to Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Pakistan respectively. After an agreement with his two siblings, he has returned them. He said: \u201cIt seemed like the right thing to do \u2026 I read stories on repatriation and I thought: we have these pieces that are 2,500 years old from other countries; we should explore whether we can give them back.\u201d But with no idea how to repatriate antiquities, he was initially worried that he could be in trouble with the authorities for having potentially looted the artefacts in his possession. In those Guardian reports, he noticed that Prof Christos Tsirogiannis, a former senior field archaeologist at the University of Cambridge and a specialist in antiquities and trafficking networks, had been quoted, and so he reached out to him for advice. Based in Cambridge, Tsirogiannis is the head of illicit antiquities trafficking research for the Unesco Chair on Threats to Cultural Heritage at the Ionian University in Corfu, Greece. Over 15 years, he has identified more than 1,600 looted artefacts within auction houses, commercial galleries, private collections and museums, alerting police authorities and governments and playing a significant role in repatriating antiquities. They include an ancient Greek bronze horse, which Sotheby\u2019s in New York was due to sell in 2018 until Tsirogiannis notified the authorities of its links to a disgraced British antiquities dealer. In 2020, Sotheby\u2019s lost its legal challenge and Greece\u2019s culture minister hailed the court\u2019s ruling as a significant victory for countries fighting to reclaim antiquities. Tsirogiannis said Gomperts was setting an extraordinary example. \u201cHe reached out to me, which is a first for an owner of unprovenanced antiquities, asking for advice to do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful case of a person who did so because he had read the Guardian articles. It shows how such publications are raising awareness and bringing actual results. He sent me photos of the antiquities, which were clearly authentic.\u201d He identified each antiquity, indicating the country to which it should be returned. \u201cTwelve objects belong to Greece, four to Italy, one to Pakistan, and two to Cyprus. I advised him to give them back,\u201d he said. \u201cI told him: \u2018If you follow my advice then you will have no problems and also become an example for other people to follow. You wrap them in a box for each country and go to their embassies. Please use my name \u2013 this will protect you. The most honest way is the straightforward way.\u2019\u201d The items included two fourth-century BC ceramic plates decorated with acrobats by south Italian painters \u2013 an \u201cunusual subject\u201d, he said \u2013 a lebes gamikos, a fourth-century BC vase used in ancient Greek marriage ceremonies, and a stone relief fragment showing the followers of Buddha, carved in the second or third century BC. Gomperts is an adviser to non-profit organisations. His German-Dutch grandmother Gisela Schneider-Herrmann died in 1992, aged 98. She was active in various excavations, particularly in Italy and Greece in the 1950s and 1960s, and published scholarly papers. Her grandson said: \u201cI have no idea how she actually acquired these objects. She was a prim and proper person. But there were different norms of the day. These objects were her obsession, her entire existence.\u201d A couple of the objects came with receipts, but Tsirogiannis realised their links to known Greek dealers of illicit antiquities in the 1950s and 1960s. \u201cSo this alerted me even more for him to repatriate them immediately,\u201d he said. Gomperts said: \u201cI knocked on embassy doors and said \u2018I have a delivery\u2019. I said: \u2018I want to repatriate these things.\u2019\u201d The countries showed their appreciation, with notes of thanks to Gomperts and Tsirogiannis. Tsirogiannis said: \u201cThis case will show others who want to do something that they can be protected when doing the right thing.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 November 2022.

            "date": "2022-11-20T15:40:42Z",
            "content": "The government must not politicise plans to memorialise the Covid-19 pandemic, the chair of the UK commemoration commission has said, as she urged more people to submit ideas on how to remember the nation\u2019s experience. Nicky Morgan, a former Conservative cabinet minister, said ministers would be \u201cunwise\u201d to put any political spin on plans when they decide on what form memorials will take. Amid calls to make permanent the Covid memorial wall opposite parliament that was instigated by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, the UK Commission on Covid Commemoration is due to submit the results of its consultations to government ministers next spring. The recommendations will land as current and former ministers prepare for cross-examination at the public inquiry module examining central government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, which has pledged to identify any \u201cwrongful decision-making and significant errors of judgment\u201d. Morgan told the Guardian that the commission had not faced any \u201cpushing one way or the other\u201d, but said: \u201cAny government would be ill served if they did try to politicise the commemoration process, and the remembrance process.\u201d Already, the national Covid memorial wall in London, which features more than 200,000 red hearts \u2013 one for each person who died in the UK with Covid \u2013 was proving popular with members of the public who had responded to the consultation, Morgan said. \u201cI think it is a remarkable tribute \u2026 how that is reflected and the part that that wall has to play \u2026 is still being debated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think the fact it\u2019s organic, grassroots upwards, makes it truly remarkable.\u201d Asked if the wall should be preserved, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s been mentioned in pretty much every single engagement that any of us have had.\u201d Other commissioners include the former Cond\u00e9 Nast publisher Sir Nicholas Coleridge, the former Labour health minister Caroline Flint, and Ndidi Okezie, the chief executive of the national charity UK Youth. The memorial wall was conceived in part as a rebuke to the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Matt Fowler, a co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: \u201cThe government must put politics aside and support us in our efforts to have the wall made a permanent memorial.\u201d So far, more than 2,000 members of the public have answered a questionnaire on what form pandemic commemoration should take. But with that representing a small proportion of the UK\u2019s population of 67 million, Morgan called for more responses, particularly from men and people from ethnic minorities, who are currently under-represented. Morgan said it was unlikely that a single memorial would be sufficient. Her commission has been examining other memorials, from the 9/11 memorial in lower Manhattan to the Bali bombing memorial in Indonesia, as well as Covid memorials already built around the UK. She said there was a consensus emerging about a desire for \u201cspaces, and they like the idea of green memorials\u201d, in part because getting outdoors during lockdowns was a way of coping. Lord True, the leader of the House of Lords, who established the commission as a Cabinet Office minister, has previously said there was consensus in the upper house about the value of planting trees. Consultees are showing enthusiasm for an emblem to mark the pandemic \u2013 the way red poppies are used to remember military conflicts \u2013 with yellow and red hearts already being used to represent all people who died in the pandemic and those who died from Covid respectively. An annual memorial day also appears popular, although there is \u201cno particular consensus emerging\u201d on the date, Morgan said. A suggestion of a memorial coin, as has been struck in Italy, has been less enthusiastically welcomed. Unlike for the first world war, which led to a programme of local war memorials, there was no national memorial in the UK for people lost to the 1918 Spanish flu, prompting some commentators to wonder if that contributed to the country\u2019s lack of preparedness. \u201cPeople are really keen that we should think about how do you learn lessons for the future,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cNow, we\u2019re not the inquiry \u2026 But people are saying to us when you\u2019re thinking about your recommendations, thinking about looking to the future is going to be important for us.\u201d The commission\u2019s terms of reference task it with exploring how to commemorate \u201cloved ones who perished\u201d, \u201cthe heroism of those who have saved lives\u201d and \u201cthe courage of frontline workers\u201d, as well as \u201cthe genius of those who created the vaccines\u201d and \u201cthe small acts of kindness and the daily sacrifice of millions who stayed at home\u201d. It is intended to \u201cshape a broader national conversation and create deep and broad public ownership of recommendations\u201d."

            "content": "Jeremy Hunt\u2019s autumn statement will result in extending wage stagnation for Britain\u2019s workers to two decades as the chancellor\u2019s tax-heavy budget piles more pressure on the nation\u2019s \u201csqueezed middle\u201d, a thinktank said. The Resolution Foundation said on Friday that the dire economic outlook meant that real wages were not expected to return to 2008 levels until 2027. Hunt\u2019s austerity budget will extend the real wage recovery lag to 19 years. If pay had continued to grow at the same rate as before the financial crisis hit in 2008, then by 2027, workers would be \u00a3292 a week \u2013 or \u00a315,000 annually \u2013 better off. Figures published alongside Jeremy Hunt\u2019s autumn statement on Thursday by the Office for Budget Responsibility said the UK was in a recession that would wipe out eight years of growth, with British households set to face the biggest fall in living standards since records began. The Resolution Foundation said Hunt had put further pressure on the \u201csqueezed middle\u201d, with the autumn statement set to bring about a permanent 3.7% income hit to typical households. It said the move to maintain a boost benefits in line with inflation next year represented the biggest rise since 1991, making a huge difference to those on low-to-middle incomes. Households on universal credit will receive a boost of \u00a3244 on average next year. However, the scaling back of support for soaring energy bills next April will mean that the government will help households offset only 30% of the rises expected over the next two years. About one in eight families \u2013 3.3m homes in total \u2013 will be paying more than \u00a32,000 more for energy than they did last year. However, the poorest fifth of UK households will be covered for 48% of the expected rises because of the government\u2019s targeted lump sum payments plan. \u201cAs an energy importer during an energy price shock, Britain is getting poorer,\u201d said James Smith, a research director at the Resolution Foundation. \u201cDeciding how we do so was, to a significant extent, the choice facing the chancellor. He has decided that households will do so with higher energy bills, higher taxes and worse public services than previously expected. Whether or not making the choices was tough, the reality of living through the next few years will be.\u201d Speaking on Friday morning, Hunt said: \u201cPeople will feel like even despite the hardship they can do things like go to the pub. We want people to feel the government is helping them through the recession. There is a plan, we\u2019ll get through it, bring inflation down and growth the economy healthily when we get to the other side.\u201d \u2022 The headline and text of this article were amended on 18 November 2022. An earlier version said that \u201cworkers will miss out on pay rises worth \u00a315,000 over the next five years\u201d. The \u00a315,000 figure relates to how much higher the Resolution Foundation estimates salaries in 2027 would have been if pay had continued to grow at the same rate as before the financial crisis in 2008. This has been corrected."

Marking the annual United Nations 16 days of activism against gender-based violence, Camilla hosted survivors and their families as well as Ukraine\u2019s first lady Olena Zelenska; Queen Rania of Jordan, the home secretary Suella Braverman; Carrie Johnson; former Spice Girl Mel B and the health secretary Steve Barclay. In a speech she said over that period of 16 days more than 2,000 women will be killed worldwide by a partner or family member, while in England and Wales alone, police will record the rapes of more than 3,000 women. \u201cWe are uniting today to confront what has rightly been called a global pandemic of violence against women. Faced with such challenges, it can be hard to know what practical steps we can take to even begin to make a difference,\u201d Camilla said. Two of the most powerful ways in which to help were \u201cto remember and to listen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe remember those women who have lost their lives at the hands of a stranger, or the person who should have loved them best. In so doing, we refuse to be desensitised by cold facts and figures and we resolve to keep the names and the memories of these women alive. \u201cWe remember Brenda Blainey, Mariam Kamara, Lucy Powell, Samantha Drummonds, Yasmin Begum, Sally Turner, Hina Bashir, Jillu Nash and her 12-year-old daughter Louise, to name but a very few of those who have been killed this year alone. And we remember \u2013 because we cannot forget \u2013 all the other women and girls who died in similarly horrific circumstances. \u201cThese women, tragically, can no longer speak for themselves. But we listen to those who can,\u201d she added, saying she had spoken to countless survivors in her previous role."

            "date": "2022-11-30T22:21:00Z",
            "content": "The UK is not in a significantly better place to deal with a new pandemic, the former vaccine taskforce chief has said, as a leading public health expert suggested Covid infections may be on the rise again. Dame Kate Bingham, the managing partner at the life sciences venture capital firm SV Health Investors, headed the UK\u2019s vaccine taskforce between May and December 2020. The taskforce played a key role in securing the country\u2019s backing of, and access to, a wide portfolio of potential Covid jabs \u2013 a move that has been credited with putting the UK on the front foot for early deployment of vaccines during the pandemic. However, speaking to a joint session of the Commons health and social care committee and the science and technology committee, about lessons learned during the pandemic, Bingham said many of the initiatives set up by the taskforce had been dismantled, while key recommendations it had provided had not been acted upon. \u201cTo begin with, I thought it was lack of experience of officials since we don\u2019t have a lot of people within Whitehall who understand vaccines, relationships with industry, all of that, but actually, I\u2019m beginning to think this is deliberate government policy, just not to invest or not to support the sector,\u201d she said. Among her concerns, Bingham cited the failure to create bulk antibody-manufacturing capabilities in the UK and the proposed termination of the NHS Covid vaccine research registry through which the public could indicate their willingness to participate in clinical trials for Covid vaccines. The decision by the National Institute for Health and Care Research to close the registry was eventually reversed after Robert Jenrick, then a health minister, stepped in. \u201cI am baffled as to the decisions that are being made,\u201d she said. Bingham also raised concerns about the length of time it is taking to agree a contract with Moderna \u2013 a US-based company that produces mRNA Covid vaccines \u2013 to create a research and development, and manufacturing, facility in the UK. At present only an agreement in principle, known as a heads of terms, has been struck. \u201cGoodness knows it does not take six months to go from a heads of terms to a binding contract,\u201d she said, adding she also had doubts about the UK\u2019s progress in pandemic preparedness. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are in a much better place to deal with a new pandemic. I think we\u2019re marginally better.\u201d Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and an early member of the government\u2019s vaccine taskforce, also raised concerns. \u201cI have seen an absolutely dramatic reversion to what existed before the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the pandemic we had this amazing environment for testing and evaluating vaccines, drugs, testing and the likes. It was the best in the world. And now our clinical research environment is actually much, much worse than it\u2019s ever been in my living memory.\u201d A key problem, said Bingham, was the lack of an expert leader to coordinate activities ranging from vaccine innovation and scale up to the understanding of new variants and potential pandemic viruses. \u201cAll of that has gone,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s somebody secret out there that that is doing that, but not as far as I can see..\u201d But Dr Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which has taken over the vaccine taskforce\u2019s role in vaccine supply, said the agency was continuing the latter\u2019s work, with the creation of a vaccine development and evaluation centre among its recent moves. \u201cShe may not be seeing everything that\u2019s happening,\u201d Harries said of Bingham. Neil O\u2019Brien, the minister for primary care and public health, also pushed back against criticisms of the time it was taking to finalise the Moderna deal, stressing it did not relate to buying a single product. \u201cWe have, let\u2019s be clear, agreed a lot of this \u2013 we agreed that construction of this facility will start next year, we have agreed that vaccine manufacturing in the UK will start in 2025,\u201d he said. But, he added: \u201cBecause we are buying a very flexible tool, that is a fundamentally complicated negotiation.\u201d Harries said data tentatively suggested Covid was on the rise in the UK, fuelled by variants of the BQ family, but the focus was on preventing severe disease. \u201cWe are not trying to prevent total transmission. We are trying to manage the disease as we do for other respiratory infections,\u201d she said. Bell agreed: \u201cI think we will need to have annual injections, particularly for the elderly where their immune systems don\u2019t work that well anyway, in the form of boosters, and let the rest of the population muddle on with you know, the odd head cold or the odd episode of flu-like illness into the future.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-14T18:00:11Z",
            "content": "The pandemic is still taking its toll on UK university students\u2019 mental health, experts are warning, as figures show that growing numbers are seeking help from peer-run helplines for anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. Nightline, which is staffed by anonymous student volunteers, said it had recorded a 51.4% increase in calls in 2020-21, and that this has grown since, with early data suggesting numbers for 2021-22 were 30% higher, and up a further 23% since the new academic year began. The helpline, which has been running for more than 50 years, said there had been a significant increase in callers discussing stress and anxiety, reaching 10.9%. This has risen to 17% since September, including a rise in calls from students worried about their finances. Despite a small reduction in calls from students attempting suicide, Nightline recorded an increase in the number expressing suicidal thoughts, which has risen even higher this year, reaching 7.4% of calls. Jennifer Smith, the policy manager at the charity Student Minds, said \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of students had experienced \u201csignificant disruption in their lives\u201d, missing out on key social, academic and personal milestones, which had left them feeling \u201cgrief, loss, uncertainty and a lack of confidence\u201d. \u201cCurrent students experienced the transition into higher education very differently from their predecessors, and may feel underprepared for university life,\u201d she said, adding that the pandemic remained a \u201creal, very current challenge\u201d for immunocompromised students, carers and those on healthcare courses. Matt Jones, a PhD student at Loughborough University who has depression, anxiety and autism, called Nightline six months ago because he felt \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the barrage of stressful world events and readjusting to socialising after two years of reduced contact and isolation. \u201cI\u2019ve sat down with friends and we\u2019ve all said \u2018The pandemic screwed us.\u2019 Suddenly we don\u2019t know how to deal with [normal life],\u201d he said. \u201cLocking everyone away for a year had a wide impact on people\u2019s ability to connect interpersonally. If you look at freshers, they lost their 15- to 17-year-old years, which is when you do a lot of growth \u2013 you lose all those experiences.\u201d Jones, who runs his university\u2019s Nightline service, thinks we live in an especially anxiety-inducing era for young people, as social media makes them feel more connected with world events \u2013 for example, watching TikTok clips shifting from pictures of murdered Ukrainian soldiers to videos of friends. He said there was also pressure to have well-informed opinions on everything, or risk social media shaming. \u201cThere\u2019s this feeling of \u2018We\u2019re fed up of living through history.\u2019 We\u2019re fed up of living through big events, whether it\u2019s Covid or the January insurrection or the war in Ukraine. If you talk to students, more than anything else, it\u2019s \u2018Can we have a year where nothing happens? Can we have a year of sanity and calmness?\u2019\u201d He added that more students phoning Nightline was also a positive sign. \u201cSometimes [my generation] can come across as being more needy, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, we\u2019re just better at understanding what we need to do to help ourselves and communicating our needs.\u201d Dominique Thompson, an NHS doctor and author of student wellbeing books, said most studies of students\u2019 emotional wellbeing post pandemic showed higher anxiety and increased loneliness. She said anxiety and suicidal thoughts tended to reflect feeling out of control of your life and future \u2013 all of which had been heightened by the pandemic, recession and cost of living crisis. \u201cAnxiety continues to be driven by uncertainty about the world they live in, whether that is future opportunities, eco anxiety or political concerns, alongside day-to-day worries about cost of living, academic pressure and making friends. We cannot underestimate how important all these issues are for young adults, and how powerless they feel when faced with such huge challenges,\u201d she said. Rachel Sandby-Thomas of the Association of Heads of University Administration said universities were aware of the impact the pandemic has had on students, and were developing and improving mental health support, including staff training on spotting warning signs early, and partnering with the NHS on professional treatment.

            "date": "2022-11-14T07:00:33Z",
            "content": "The farm is quiet. Martin Merrild is sweeping leaves. Behind him is a row of 20 large sheds \u2013 all empty. Two years ago, his farm near Hjerm in West Jutland had been home to 15,000 mink, a small carnivorous mammal bred by farmers in individual cages before being skinned for its fur. Since he started mink farming almost 40 years ago, Merrild\u2019s life had revolved around a yearly cycle. It would start with a smaller population of female and male mink. In early March, the females would be ready for breeding and Merrild and his staff would have just a few weeks to ensure they got a mate. From late April, mink the size of a thumb would be born. Martin Merrild has been farming mink since the 1980s, until an outbreak of Covid in 2020 saw his entire herd culled. He hasn\u2019t reared a mink since These would grow quickly over the summer months to about 3-4kg. They would be killed and skinned for their fur in November, with the cycle repeated the following year. Across Denmark, more than 15 million mink were bred every year on farms like Merrild\u2019s. Denmark was the world\u2019s biggest producer of mink fur, at one point producing 40% of the world\u2019s supply, mostly exported to Asia. But on the morning of 4 November 2020, the industry came to a standstill as the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, announced the culling of the country\u2019s entire farmed mink herd: 15 million animals. Merrild\u2019s mink sheds and cages lie empty Twelve people had become infected with a Covid-19 mutation that originated in mink and Frederiksen feared the mutation, if left unchecked, could jeopardise future vaccines. Soon after the announcement, veterinary officials came to kill Merrild\u2019s animals. His sheds have remained largely untouched ever since. Merrild plans to sell his farm once he receives compensation to dismantle and remove his mink sheds \u201cWe\u2019re lucky as we\u2019ve had other things to do on the farm,\u201d says Merrild, who also grows food crops and has a flock of poultry. \u201cBut there are men who\u2019ve only ever worked with mink their whole lives. They were on a mink farm every day. And now nothing for two years.\u201d Half an hour south of Merrild\u2019s farm is a collection of large warehouses emblazoned with the illustration of a mink. They belong to a company that had been feeding 3 million mink across the region, trucking out hundreds of tonnes of feed to farms every day during the peak summer months. Much of the supporting industry, including companies who produced feed for the mink, have been mothballed since the Danish government shutdown the industry Today, it feels like a half-empty museum without any visitors. Staff at the site have found other jobs, but the buildings and machinery remain mothballed as the owners await the outcome of a compensation claim. \u201cI just wish it would end. The business is over so we just want to be able to move on now,\u201d says the company\u2019s former chairman. More than 1,000 former mink farmers are still waiting on the outcome of their compensation claims There are more than 1,000 former mink farmers, like Merrild, who are still waiting on the outcome of their compensation claims. Unable to dismantle their barns, they are farming ghosts. Aase Rask had worried for the health of her husband, Ejner, then 68, as his mink were taken away and killed. He had known nothing else since the early 1980s, with their son lined up to take over the farm near Holstebro, West Jutland. They see few viable alternatives for making the farm profitable and their son is now trying to forge an alternative career in machinery. Aase and Ejner Rask had been solely farming mink on their farm near Holstebro, Denmark since the early 1980s But Ejner has at least found a new and unlikely passion: growing strawberries. Over the past two years, four of his sheds have been filled with berries, along with a small amount of peppers, potatoes and other vegetables. The couple sell them during the summer months on a stall by the roadside. Even now, with the onset of winter, the mink cages are partly hidden by the green leaves of the plants. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a hobby and just about keeps my brain active, so I\u2019m not just sitting down,\u201d says Ejner. \u201cIt has been cheaper than going to a psychologist. At least strawberries don\u2019t bite and everyone likes them.\u201d The Rasks have taken to growing tomatoes and peppers since mink farming was halted The Danish government recently agreed to allow mink farming to restart after an official inquiry found its shutdown lacked legal justification. Although there were outbreaks of Covid in farmed mink across the world, Denmark was the only country to order a wholesale cull and shutdown its industry. But after two years, many of the 5,000-plus vets, feed manufacturers, auctioneers and advisers involved have moved on, with just a handful of farmers expected to pick up where they left off. Everyone else is just waiting to see their cages removed. The Rasks had about 27,000 mink on their farm before the animals were culled \u201cWe knew quickly that the mink would not be coming back. The infrastructure supporting the industry has gone now. It\u2019s over,\u201d says Merrild. At 67, the delays to compensation have left him feeling too old to consider replacing the mink with something else. \u201cThe best thing for the value of the farm [if we sell it] is to get the mink stuff away now,\u201d he says. Ejner Rask says growing strawberries keeps his brain active and that \u201ceverybody likes strawberries\u201d You can send us your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com"

            "date": "2022-11-24T06:00:20Z",
            "content": "From \u00a3658,989 owed to Thurrock council, to an art shop in east London left \u00a333,804 out of pocket, to 12,000 people whose furniture never arrived, the details of the creditors who collectively lost almost \u00a3187m from the demise of sofa website Made.com are a snapshot of the pain caused by the bursting of the online retail bubble. Made was among a flurry of stock market listings that raised billions of pounds for founders and private equity backers on the belief that the scale of the Covid-19 switch to buying online would be permanent \u2013 only to have those hopes dashed. Between September 2020 and June 2021, a clutch of digital specialists including Deliveroo and Victorian Plumbing floated on the London market, raising almost \u00a32bn for investors and a further \u00a31bn to pump into their companies, despite many of them making a loss. \u201cThere must have been a stampede to get the valuations they got,\u201d says one retail boss. \u201cPeople bought into the [notion] that Covid had caused a permanent shift in the way people were shopping and a level of excitement built up so that the valuations achieved were absolutely crazy.\u201d Less than two years on, those stock market darlings have turned to flops. As high streets reopened, along came the cost of living crisis, forcing shoppers to rein in spending. Analysts at GlobalData predict the 26% peak of online sales reached during lockdown will not be achieved again for more than four years. Made is the standard-bearer for the unhappy troupe of digital dogs. Floated at a valuation of \u00a3775m in June last year, it raised almost \u00a398m for selling shareholders and handed \u00a310.2m in fees to its advisers. Just 16 months later, earlier in November, the group dived into administration with the loss of more than 300 jobs. Having promised at its float that booming trading during the pandemic marked \u201can inflexion point for the sector\u201d Made admitted on administration that it \u201ccould not pivot fast enough\u201d to deal with changing consumer demand, inflation and a more unreliable supply chain. Among the other pandemic punts offered on the London Stock Exchange, online makeup retailer THG, which at \u00a35.4bn was one of the biggest London tech floats, has held takeover talks after slumping in value to about \u00a3814m, with question marks over its growth story. Key shareholder SoftBank of Japan wrote off \u00a3450m after selling its stake to founder Matt Moulding and Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. At the other end of the scale, minnow Parsley Box, the Scottish ready meals company, is already planning to quit the stock market and is trying to raise cash less than two years after joining the Aim market. Digital DIY retailer Victorian Plumbing, the biggest-ever listing on the junior market when it joined in June last year at a valuation of \u00a3850m, is now worth less than a quarter of that after a dive in profits. Virgin Wines, takeaway app Deliveroo and consumer electronics website Music Magpie have also seen shares dive by 63%, 77% and 88%, respectively, after trading got tougher when pandemic restrictions eased. Industry insiders say many listed consumer-facing companies are now looking at leaving the public markets if they possibly can \u2013 although finding alternative sources of funding is proving difficult. More casualties could follow Made \u2013 and not just among those who sell online. Fashion retailer Joules went into administration last week after over-investing on hopes that its strong pandemic sales would continue, while others seeking new funding include cut-price clothing chain Matalan. \u201cThese [retail] businesses are burning cash and are very fragile in an environment [where] trying to raise cash right now is nigh-on impossible. For a credit committee to lend to consumer business it is just too uncertain and there\u2019s too much risk so it is causing a real hiatus. It is really, really tough,\u201d says a retail expert. Then there are the punters who fell for the dream of unending growth. Deliveroo coaxed an estimated 70,000 people to buy shares via its takeaway app, persuading them to spend \u00a350m on the stock market debut. Their joint investment would now be worth just over \u00a312m, with the average investor\u2019s stake falling in value from \u00a3714 at float to \u00a3170 this week. At THG, cornerstone investors including BlackRock, which bought \u00a3300m of stock on flotation taking a 15% stake, and Janus Henderson, which bought \u00a3100m in shares, have now slashed their holdings after seeing the value dive. At Made, blue-chip investors including Majedie Investments, Axa Investment Managers and the NFU pension fund bought into the float, splashing out \u00a350m, \u00a330m and just over \u00a322m, respectively, on shares, according to the prospectus, only to see their investments slump. There were, however, rich pickings for the small army of lawyers, bankers and accountants who serviced the float. Made\u2019s advisers JP Morgan Cazenove, Morgan Stanley and Liberum Capital, as well as boutique house OGG Consulting, shared fees of \u00a310.2m. JP Morgan also clocked up a chunky payout as a key adviser on the floats of Deliveroo and THG, where banks and other advisers shared more than \u00a362m in fees. Since then Deliveroo shares have fallen by three-quarters and Deliveroo by 86%. Goldman Sachs was on board at both of those deals, alongside Numis. Made.com founders Ning Li and Brent Hoberman\u2019s By Design fund sold almost \u00a38m and \u00a35m of shares each, according to the prospectus. Moulding, the chief executive of THG, cashed out a hefty \u00a354m and secured rights over properties for which he could collect \u00a319m a year in rent, while Victorian Plumbing\u2019s founder Mark Radcliffe took out \u00a3212m and Music Magpie founders Steve Oliver and Walter Gleeson \u00a322m. Private equity and venture capital firms also did well. Made\u2019s tech fund backers Level Equity from the US and Partech from France cashed out \u00a318m between them on the float \u2013 although they went on to see the rest of their investment fall to dust. At THG, private equity group KKR sold its entire 20% stake in the float for \u00a3448m, while a string of private investors also did well including former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, who cashed in \u00a317m of shares. Music Magpie raised \u00a395m for backers led by private equity group NVM, which cashed out nearly \u00a340m. \u201cObviously they thought it was a good time to sell. There must have been an element of cynicism,\u201d says one seasoned executive, who says he turned down at least one role on the board of a new stock market entrant as he did not believe in its growth story. \u201cAnybody sensible would take a view that there is a risk that it is not sure this [kind of growth] is really sustainable and asked if this is a flash in the pan during the pandemic.\u201d Patrick O\u2019Brien of GlobalData says that while there was \u201cirrational exuberance towards online retail shares\u201d during the pandemic, it was a confusing time for companies and investors. \u201cIt was really difficult to understand how consumer behaviour was going to change at the time. We didn\u2019t have any visibility on how long [the pandemic] was going to last.\u201d He says that the current collapse in online retail share prices is based on another misplaced belief, that the high street will permanently grab back sales from the internet. One senior retail figure agrees that investors should be wary of learning the wrong lessons from the collapse of the pandemic punts. \u201cOne of the huge mistakes of all bubbles is that they lump lots of very different businesses together. There are some brilliant pure plays and some terrible ones. The fact they trade mainly online is not going to be what distinguishes them [as] being good or bad.\u201d"

            "content": "Your article on challenge trials raises fascinating questions, as the world seeks to address the risk of new pandemics (Should we give people diseases in order to learn how to cure them?, 31 October). It refers to Edward Jenner, who did indeed \u201cchallenge\u201d his patient James Phipps, the eight-year-old boy he had test-inoculated with cowpox (the process that would become known as vaccination), by subsequently having him inoculated with live smallpox to ensure he was immune to the disease. However, by the time he did so in 1796, the latter technique was a widely used and highly successful procedure which, conducted safely by experienced practitioners, had a negligible risk. Arriving in Britain from Turkey in 1721, and used for centuries in India, China and parts of Africa, inoculation involved giving healthy individuals a minute dose of smallpox virus via a scratch on the skin, leading to a mild dose of the disease and then lifelong immunity. Thomas Dimsdale, the Essex-born Quaker physician featured in my book The Empress and the English Doctor, reported having inoculated about 6,000 patients with just one death at the time he went to St Petersburg to treat Catherine the Great and her son. The empress underwent the procedure in 1768 to show her subjects how safe it was. Jenner learned of the apparent protective property of cowpox, a cousin virus of smallpox, from farming communities in his native Gloucestershire, who found that when they underwent preventive inoculation, they were already immune. His world-changing leap forward was to formally trial the theory that a mild disease could protect against a lethal one, and then to test it by \u201cchallenging\u201d the patient using conventional inoculation, an entirely routine preventive procedure.

            "title": "Australia approves new Covid vaccine as hospitalisations surge",
            "date": "2022-11-15T00:55:42Z",
            "content": "Covid hospitalisations have increased by 11% in the past week, the federal health minister Mark Butler said, as he announced new vaccines have been approved to boost supply. However, a fifth vaccine dose has not been recommended by the Australian Technical Advisory Group of Immunisation [Atagi] for the general population at this time, Butler said. However, he said this may change next year ahead of winter, particularly if other variants emerge. Butler said the Omicron subvariant XBB, now present in Australia, led to a \u201cshort and small\u201d wave of infections in Singapore, with severe disease and death very rare for people who had at least two vaccine doses. This was part of the evidence that led to Atagi\u2019s decision not to recommend a fifth vaccine dose, he said. Atagi has recommended an Omicron-targeting vaccine from Pfizer be added to the booster doses available, and it will be available for people aged 18 and over from 12 December. Meanwhile the paediatric vaccine from Pfizer for children aged six months to five years will be available in limited circumstances for vulnerable children. A Moderna paediatric vaccine is already available, as is an Omicron bivalent vaccine from Moderna. The chief health officer Prof. Paul Kelly said it was vulnerable people who must be prepared by accessing antivirals as soon as they tested positive, and ensuring they had received third and fourth vaccine doses. \u201cI can absolutely assure everyone that we do have plenty of supply of antivirals,\u201d he said. \u201cA person over 70 who has had three or four doses of vaccine, can half their risk of death by taking the tablets.\u201d He said the current Covid wave \u201chas been going up for the last few weeks \u2026 it should peak soon and drop quickly.\u201d In the meantime, he urged immunocompromised and other vulnerable people in particular to consider wearing masks. But \u201cconfused rules\u201d around mask-wearing and social distancing in hospitals pose a major health risk, the president of the Australian Medical Association, Prof Steve Robson, said. He said rules on masks in hospitals and other health settings have \u201cbecome a bit hard to interpret\u201d, calling for state and territory health departments to step up. \u201cA lot of hospitals have relaxed or removed mask requirements, and that\u2019s a concern,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that puts visitors and also patients and staff at risk. You need staff to run a hospital. So if we have increased rates of staff being infected, either in the community or worse still, in the workplace, that degrades the hospital\u2019s capacity to provide care quickly.\u201d Robson said he is also concerned about waning immunity given \u201cthere\u2019s been a huge stall in third and fourth vaccination rates around the country\u201d. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got new variants arriving that seem to evade immunity. We\u2019ve got a situation where the overall population is at risk of Covid infection, and we\u2019ve also just got a huge backlog of work that hospitals were unable to do during the mid-year and earlier waves, and a lot of staff who have not had any capacity to take leave for a while. \u201cWe think all these things together pose a very major risk over the holiday season when people will be on holidays and there will also be huge amounts of travel.\u201d Personal protection equipment has been deployed to aged care homes, and a surge workforce was prepared to step in if required, Butler told Guardian Australia earlier on Tuesday. \u201cThe government has been on the front foot to help protect older Australians most at risk of Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cThis includes supporting the aged care sector by continuing to prioritise booster vaccinations [and] ensuring access to lifesaving oral anti-viral treatments. They\u2019re safe, they\u2019re effective and they\u2019re available for everyone aged over 70 and other high-risk groups.\u201d He said the government continues to fund coronavirus support grants to help providers with the costs of outbreaks, and to provide financial support for casual workers to not attend work if they are Covid-positive. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But the aged care director for the United Workers Union, Carolyn Smith, said tackling year after year of Covid had taken a toll on aged care staff, who were still not being properly paid. Burnout and fatigue are ongoing concerns, she said. \u201cThe toll taken by Covid on aged care residents earlier this year was devastating, and continues to be a deadly threat in many aged care providers,\u201d she said. \u201cAged care workers carry the emotional burden of a higher number of deaths of residents, while facing continuous understaffing and low pay that contribute to a workforce exodus. \u201cThe whole aged care system has been on the verge of collapse this year, and a fresh round of Covid will continue to place enormous pressure on aged care workers.\u201d She welcomed the federal government\u2019s commitment to mandated care-time reforms but said many aged care workers who worked through the pandemic, covering lifestyle, catering, cleaning and laundry, were yet to see any pay rise out of the work value case. \u201cSo these workers get a renewed Covid surge, so far no pay rise, understaffing at ridiculous levels \u2013 it\u2019s been a tough year for them,\u201d she said. Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and XBB are driving significant cases and hospitalisations overseas due to their ability to escape immunity from past infection \u2013 and as immunity wanes from past vaccination. But Butler said in Australia, a \u201csoup\u201d of variants is driving new cases. \u201cThis increase in cases is complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not being driven by any one strain.\u201d In the meantime, people are being asked to stay home when sick and to keep up-to-date with their vaccinations."

            "date": "2022-11-25T11:05:46Z",
            "content": "A universal flu vaccine that protects against all strains of the virus could be available in the next two years, according to a leading scientist. An experimental vaccine based on the same mRNA technology used in the highly successful Covid jabs was found to protect mice and ferrets against severe influenza, paving the way for clinical trials in humans. Prof John Oxford, a virologist at Queen Mary University in London, who was not involved in the work, said the vaccine developed at the University of Pennsylvania could be ready for use the winter after next. \u201cI cannot emphasise enough what a breakthrough this paper is,\u201d Oxford told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme. \u201cThe potential is huge, and I think sometimes we underestimate these big respiratory viruses.\u201d Researchers have been working on universal flu vaccines for more than a decade, but the latest breakthrough, published in Science, is seen as a major step towards a jab that could help protect humans from a potentially devastating flu pandemic. Seasonal flu vaccines, which protect against up to four strains of the virus, are updated every year to ensure they are a good match for flu viruses in circulation. The new vaccine is designed to prime the immune system against all 20 subtypes of influenza A and B, potentially arming the body to tackle any flu virus that arises. The world last experienced a flu pandemic in 2009 when a virus that jumped from pigs to humans spread around the world. While that outbreak was far less lethal than health officials feared, the 1918 flu pandemic demonstrated how dangerous new strains could kill tens of millions of people. Giving people a \u201cbaseline\u201d level of immunity against the full range of flu strains could lead to far less illness and fewer deaths when the next flu pandemic happens, said Dr Scott Hensley, a researcher on the team in Pennsylvania. Experiments in mice and ferrets found that the mRNA flu vaccine provoked high levels of antibodies that were stable for several months and protective against the virus. While the results from the animal tests are promising, clinical trials are needed to see whether the vaccine protects humans in the same way without causing problematic side-effects. The vaccine raises questions for regulators around whether to approve a shot that could protect against viruses with pandemic potential, but which have not yet actually emerged. \u201cThis vaccine has only been tested in animals to date and it will be important to investigate its safety and efficacy in humans,\u201d said Dr Andrew Freedman, a reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University. \u201cIt does seem a very promising approach to the goal of producing a universal flu vaccine as well as vaccines that protect against multiple members of other viral families such as rhino- and corona-viruses.\u201d Adolfo Garc\u00eda-Sastre, the director of the Institute for Global Health and Emerging Pathogens at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, said current influenza vaccines did not protect against influenza viruses with pandemic potential. \u201cThis vaccine, if it works well in people, would achieve this.\u201d \u201cThe studies are preclinical, in experimental models,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are very promising and, although they suggest a protective capacity against all subtypes of influenza viruses, we cannot be sure until clinical trials in volunteers are done.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-17T15:00:38Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s first vaccine to treat deadly cancerous brain tumours can potentially give patients years of extra life, a global clinical trial has concluded. A senior NHS doctor who was one of the trial\u2019s chief investigators said the evidence showed DCVax had resulted in \u201castonishing\u201d enhanced survival for patients. The breakthrough could benefit the 2,500 people a year in the UK who are diagnosed with glioblastoma , the commonest form of brain cancer and also one of the most aggressive. People with the disease live on average just 12-18 months after diagnosis, some for even less. One patient in the 331-person multicentre global study lived for more than eight years after receiving DCVax. In Britain, 53-year-old Nigel French is still alive seven years after having it. \u201cThe total results are astonishing,\u201d said Prof Keyoumars Ashkan, a neurosurgeon at King\u2019s College hospital in London who was the European chief investigator of the trial. \u201cThe final results of this phase three trial \u2026 offer fresh hope to patients battling with glioblastoma. The vaccine \u201cwas shown to prolong life and interestingly so in patients traditionally considered to have poorer prognosis\u201d, such as older people and people for whom surgery was not an option, he added. If approved by medical regulators, DCVax would be the first new treatment in 17 years for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients and the first in 27 years for people in whom it had returned. Trial researchers found that newly diagnosed patients who had the vaccine survived for 19.3 months on average, compared with 16.5 months for those who received a placebo. Participants with recurrent glioblastoma who had had DCVax lived on average for 13.2 months after receiving it, compared with just 7.8 months for those who did not. Overall 13% of people who received it lived for at least five years after diagnosis, while just 5.7% of those in the control group did so, according to the results of the trial, which were published on Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology. The vaccine is a form of immunotherapy, in which the body\u2019s immune system is programmed to track down and attack the tumour. It is the first developed to tackle brain tumours. \u201cThe vaccine works by stimulating the patient\u2019s own immune system to fight against the patient\u2019s tumour. It provides a personalised solution, working with a patient\u2019s immune system, which is the most intelligent system known to man,\u201d said Ashkan. \u201cThe vaccine is produced by combining proteins from a patient\u2019s own tumour with their white blood cells. This educates the white cells to recognise the tumour. \u201cWhen the vaccine is administered, these educated white blood cells then help the rest of the patient\u2019s immune system recognise the tumour as something it needs to fight against and destroy. Almost like training a sniffer dog.\u201d The vaccine is not yet available on the NHS. But Northwest Biotherapeutics, the US company that makes it, plans to seek regulatory approval so it can become available. The charity Brain Tumour Research said \u201cpatients who have been starved of new clinical options for too long\u201d needed to be able to access the treatment to prolong their lives. \u201cDCVax represents the first emerging therapy proven effective in treating glioblastoma since temozolomide chemotherapy in 2005 and what the brain tumour community hopes is for it to become affordable, possibly becoming standard of care \u2013 so available on the NHS,\u201d said Dr Karen Noble, the charity\u2019s director of research, policy and innovation. \u201cThe average survival time for glioblastoma is devastatingly short \u2013 just 12 to 18 months. Stories like Mr French\u2019s are rare but incredibly welcome. We are very encouraged by the final results of this trial,\u201d she added. Twenty of the 331 patients in the eight-year trial were in the UK, either at King\u2019s or at University College London hospital. Overall 232 participants had DCVax and 99 a placebo. All 331 had surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy to remove as much of their tumour as possible, which is the standard treatment for glioblastoma. Dr Henry Stennett, research information manager at Cancer Research UK, said, \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly exciting is that [the vaccine] can improve outcomes for people who don\u2019t usually respond well to therapy. While it still needs to pass stringent regulatory approval, it could be a big step forwards in beating this type of brain tumour.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-14T18:00:11Z",
            "content": "The pandemic is still taking its toll on UK university students\u2019 mental health, experts are warning, as figures show that growing numbers are seeking help from peer-run helplines for anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. Nightline, which is staffed by anonymous student volunteers, said it had recorded a 51.4% increase in calls in 2020-21, and that this has grown since, with early data suggesting numbers for 2021-22 were 30% higher, and up a further 23% since the new academic year began. The helpline, which has been running for more than 50 years, said there had been a significant increase in callers discussing stress and anxiety, reaching 10.9%. This has risen to 17% since September, including a rise in calls from students worried about their finances. Despite a small reduction in calls from students attempting suicide, Nightline recorded an increase in the number expressing suicidal thoughts, which has risen even higher this year, reaching 7.4% of calls. Jennifer Smith, the policy manager at the charity Student Minds, said \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of students had experienced \u201csignificant disruption in their lives\u201d, missing out on key social, academic and personal milestones, which had left them feeling \u201cgrief, loss, uncertainty and a lack of confidence\u201d. \u201cCurrent students experienced the transition into higher education very differently from their predecessors, and may feel underprepared for university life,\u201d she said, adding that the pandemic remained a \u201creal, very current challenge\u201d for immunocompromised students, carers and those on healthcare courses. Matt Jones, a PhD student at Loughborough University who has depression, anxiety and autism, called Nightline six months ago because he felt \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the barrage of stressful world events and readjusting to socialising after two years of reduced contact and isolation. \u201cI\u2019ve sat down with friends and we\u2019ve all said \u2018The pandemic screwed us.\u2019 Suddenly we don\u2019t know how to deal with [normal life],\u201d he said. \u201cLocking everyone away for a year had a wide impact on people\u2019s ability to connect interpersonally. If you look at freshers, they lost their 15- to 17-year-old years, which is when you do a lot of growth \u2013 you lose all those experiences.\u201d Jones, who runs his university\u2019s Nightline service, thinks we live in an especially anxiety-inducing era for young people, as social media makes them feel more connected with world events \u2013 for example, watching TikTok clips shifting from pictures of murdered Ukrainian soldiers to videos of friends. He said there was also pressure to have well-informed opinions on everything, or risk social media shaming. \u201cThere\u2019s this feeling of \u2018We\u2019re fed up of living through history.\u2019 We\u2019re fed up of living through big events, whether it\u2019s Covid or the January insurrection or the war in Ukraine. If you talk to students, more than anything else, it\u2019s \u2018Can we have a year where nothing happens? Can we have a year of sanity and calmness?\u2019\u201d He added that more students phoning Nightline was also a positive sign. \u201cSometimes [my generation] can come across as being more needy, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, we\u2019re just better at understanding what we need to do to help ourselves and communicating our needs.\u201d Dominique Thompson, an NHS doctor and author of student wellbeing books, said most studies of students\u2019 emotional wellbeing post pandemic showed higher anxiety and increased loneliness. She said anxiety and suicidal thoughts tended to reflect feeling out of control of your life and future \u2013 all of which had been heightened by the pandemic, recession and cost of living crisis. \u201cAnxiety continues to be driven by uncertainty about the world they live in, whether that is future opportunities, eco anxiety or political concerns, alongside day-to-day worries about cost of living, academic pressure and making friends. We cannot underestimate how important all these issues are for young adults, and how powerless they feel when faced with such huge challenges,\u201d she said. Rachel Sandby-Thomas of the Association of Heads of University Administration said universities were aware of the impact the pandemic has had on students, and were developing and improving mental health support, including staff training on spotting warning signs early, and partnering with the NHS on professional treatment.

            "content": "Taking grandchildren to playgroups and picking them up from school can help stave off loneliness, research has found. The study, a review of previous studies involving nearly 200,000 participants in 21 countries, suggested that looking after grandchildren regularly tends to have a positive impact on mental wellbeing, including feeling less isolated and greater fulfilment. By contrast those who looked after a spouse with an illness or disability were linked to increased feelings of loneliness, highlighting the additional burden on older unpaid carers. Samia Akhter-Khan, a PhD student at King\u2019s College London and first author of the study, said: \u201cWe see these quite clear consistent findings that grandparenting or caregiving to non-kin children has this positive effect whereas spousal caregiving had a negative effect on loneliness.\u201d The team reviewed 28 previous studies involving 191,652 over-50s in 21 countries, including the UK, and examined the link between loneliness and unpaid care. One study showed that adults aged over 60 years who spent on average 12\u2009 hours each week looking after grandchildren were 60% less likely to feel lonely than non-caregivers, and other research revealed similar trends. \u201cWhile caregiving for grandchildren may include some of the same time-intensive activities as caregiving for an older adult, such as bathing and feeding, children are integrated in a care network that usually involves parents and institutions, such as schools,\u201d the authors write. Volunteering across a range of activities, including social and environmental causes, was also linked to lower levels of loneliness. By contrast caring for an ill spouse or relative was consistently linked to higher levels of loneliness and isolation. The authors suggest that looking after a partner could be isolating when faced with \u201can absence of support from other people or organisations\u201d and often people do not have a choice whether to become a caregiver in this scenario. It can also be \u201ca preparation to transitioning into widowhood\u201d. The authors highlight \u201cthe stark contrast between different realities of care\u201d, where in some contexts it is a costly and burdensome activity and in others rewarding and meaningful. They add that the role of older adults as caregivers needed to be given greater recognition. \u201cOlder people are usually portrayed as the care receivers and a cost to society in terms of money for pensions and health problems,\u201d said Akhter-Khan. \u201cBut they\u2019re really important contributors in terms of caregiving and volunteering. They\u2019re really valuable for our society.\u201d The findings are published in the journal Aging and Mental Health."

            "date": "2022-11-14T17:13:59Z",
            "content": "Mental health problems may more often be a factor in homicides than gang membership, with most killings potentially preventable, a study suggests. The research for London\u2019s violence reduction unit, published on Monday, is the deepest look at homicides in the UK so far, project leaders believe. Fifty killings were selected from confidential murder case files held by the Metropolitan police. Behavioural insight experts looked for patterns about those killed, their attackers and, most crucially, why. It is hoped that researchers will be able to work out how many could have been prevented and by what means. Ed Bradon, the director of the project, said the work so far suggested most homicides may be preventable: \u201cEvery single one of these 50 homicides could have been prevented at some point. It may not be immediately visible.\u201d In one case of a domestic homicide, neighbours heard shouts from the home where a woman was killed, but were used to hearing them and so did not call the police. Bradon said: \u201cA lot of unusual stuff has to happen for someone to be murdered.\u201d Six factors were identified by studying the 50 cases in depth. Police had already identified key factors behind them but the behavioural insight experts reassessed them. The key factors for either the victim or killers were mental ill health, a factor in 29 cases; drugs, which were a factor in 26 killings; alcohol, a factor in 16 cases; gangs, a factor in 14 cases; and social media, a factor in 14. Also identified as a factor was the length of time it took for events to escalate into a killing after a trigger event. In domestic homicides that could be someone deciding to end a relationship, or in a gang killing the robbery of a rival\u2019s drugs. One or more of these factors were identified in the 50 cases examined. Bradon said: \u201cMental health appears to be more of a factor than previously realised.\u201d Some killers had withdrawn from treatment, while others had mental health problems and had never been treated. Mental health, as well as the other key factors, can make the victim more vulnerable to violence, the study says. Most victims \u2013 28 of those studied \u2013 knew their killer, compared with those fatally attacked by a stranger, which happened in seven cases. Lucy Makinson, who managed the project, said different factors posed a greater risk for different age groups, such as gang involvement for younger people and mental health for older people. The report calls for young people to be offered help if they face social media threats or taunts, which can be part of the lead-up to a homicide. Makinson said: \u201cSocial media is being used to build up tension and is much more common with gang cases.\u201d Det Supt David Kennett from the Met police said: \u201cThis new framework shows tremendous promise, and means for the first time we can truly influence the criminal justice system by identifying where the risks lie. \u201cThere are many contributing factors to each homicide. This new framework will help us work towards preventing homicides from both a policing and partner perspective.\u201d Some if not most of the extra prevention work would not fall to the police but to other agencies. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who funded the study as part of violence reduction work, said: \u201cPart of our approach is better understanding why homicides happen, and that\u2019s why my VRU funded and commissioned this groundbreaking framework. If we are to continue reducing violence in London, it\u2019s crucial that we identify more opportunities to intervene early, because I firmly believe that violence is preventable, not inevitable.\u201d London averages about 130 to 150 homicides a year, and the Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has said he hopes to cut that number to below 100. The study found each killing costs the police and criminal justice system more than \u00a3800,000, and in total over \u00a3100m a year in London alone. The next stage of the research will examine 300 cases of homicide. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 November 2022. Ed Bradon said that \u201ca lot of unusual stuff\u201d has to happen for someone to be murdered, not \u201ca lot of usual stuff\u201d as an earlier version said."

            "date": "2022-11-10T10:18:42Z",
            "content": "We have made great progress in England when it comes to acceptance and knowledge around mental health issues. But have our basic services also improved in tandem? We are told that clinical approaches to mental health are getting better: that the coercive control of the asylum era is over, heralding care in the community; that the blossoming of interest in wellbeing means psychiatric care is no longer the second-class citizen of medicine. But some facts, unfortunately, tell a more harrowing story, reflecting a problem as much with ideology as funding. In the past few months, scandal after scandal has shone a light on the appalling state of mental health inpatient care (meaning those who have to stay at least one night). First, we had a Panorama investigation into the Edenfield Centre, a secure psychiatric hospital run by the NHS in Manchester, which alleged that vulnerable patients were ridiculed and inappropriately restrained. Then a Dispatches undercover investigation showed wards in Essex where patients appeared to have been cruelly treated, despite repeated inquiries into a series of suicides between 2004 and 2015, hauntingly represented in the ongoing agony of interviewed family members. In the past week, we\u2019ve heard of more than 20 teenagers alleged to have been mistreated in wards managed by the private sector Huntercombe Group, followed by an independent investigation into a Middlesbrough hospital, describing the failures preceding the suicides of three young women. The same themes occur again and again. The overuse of restraint, which can spill over into the violence of being dragged down corridors; arbitrary and, at times, punitive boundaries being set; a lack of understanding of autism, eating disorders and self-injury; suicidal patients left at high risk; a lack of compassion. It is easy to blame \u201cbad apples\u201d to protect our collective fantasy of angelic NHS staff. But life is more complicated than this, as are the dynamics in health systems. Teams can and do become toxic, caught up in coercive and cruel practices into which new members become socialised. We are all vulnerable to these processes, though it scares us to think so, and never more so than in a brutally underfunded, over-pressurised system. England has fewer psychiatric beds than ever before, with numbers having fallen by a quarter since 2010, from 23,447 to 17,610. Such a drop would always be catastrophic, let alone at a time of increasing demand and with community services drastically underfunded. The wellbeing agenda, with its focus on milder problems, can lead to great statistics in a way that doesn\u2019t work for severe mental illness; longer-term needs get sidelined and our patients increasingly lurch between neglect in the community and poor treatment in wards. Good care has simple principles that we too quickly forget. As patients, we benefit from a trauma-informed environment \u2013 a paradigm shift from our obsession with labelling what is wrong to asking: \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d \u2013 that is welcoming and not too sensorily overwhelming. We need a kind word and an open ear from familiar staff who know us. We need medication, at times, to dampen pain or galvanise our mood; activity or bed rest, depending on the state we have arrived in and nourishing soul food. Lacking the ethos to provide this kind of care, staff get caught up in increasingly brutal protocols aimed at extinguishing surface problems rather than deeper exploration. Everyone loses in this equation. I am in touch with two fellow activists who are inpatients and they report staff who have been in tears at the discrepancy between what they want to do and what they can. A worse fate awaits patients who experience excessive restrictive practices that directly repeat the way society or early caregivers have treated them; a particular problem for Black men and abuse survivors. Beyond the obvious things required \u2013 clawing back the millions spent on private provider beds; specialist units for those with autism; the end of the diagnosis that is most weaponised against patients, borderline personality disorder; and training on self-injury \u2013 we need the types of non-carceral approach, those not based on a logic of imprisonment, that grassroots organisations have long lobbied for. Ask any consultant where they would most like to have a breakdown, and the answer is probably Trieste. This Italian city is recognised by the World Health Organization as a centre of excellence, having little involuntary treatment and few hospitalisations. Trieste focuses on principles that are dear to patients: dignity and respect; inclusion in the city\u2019s daily activities; an emphasis on the social relations that define us; access to nature, and that great enemy of anguish, play. Deinstitutionalisation works in Trieste; once, there were 1,200 beds for a population of 240,000 citizens, now there are only six general hospital beds and 30 overnight community centre beds. But it works only because there is a community scaffolding there to uphold it. We can make this jump in England, investing in emerging projects such as Bristol\u2019s Link House and London\u2019s Open Dialogue that emphasise the importance of human relationships in responding to mental health crises. The well-intentioned efforts today to create parity between mental and physical health must not lose sight of this. We are not applying a physical procedure, like a bandage to a wound, but hoping to create relationships within which the ailing person can heal. This is what we cannot afford to ignore any longer.

            "content": "Our children and young people are facing mental health challenges on an unprecedented scale (Editorial, 6 November). Tragically, there seems to be little meaningful action being taken in response. My 17-year-old son died by suicide last year. We had spent over a year trying to secure adequate help for him \u2013 it never came. Even after his mental health disintegrated badly enough to lead to two suicide attempts, he languished on a waiting list. The \u201ctalking therapy\u201d that he eventually received was inadequate, the oversight of his case shambolic, and my repeated attempts to sound the alarm were recorded as the reactions of an anxious mother. Communication failures, dismissive attitudes, and \u201ccare\u201d that was provided almost entirely by phone or online meant that no one took overall responsibility and no one got to know this struggling boy well enough to uncover his desperation. I now have to spend the rest of my life bearing his loss. Why is the proper, timely treatment of youngsters not an absolute priority to this government? Every preventable death is a tragic loss, not only to the family, but also to society. Name and address supplied \u2022 I can only confirm from our own experience how broken the system is. Our child waited for over two years to be seen by the child and adolescent mental health service (Camhs), with our GP unable to prescribe antidepressants due to Nice guidelines. During this period, their mental health steadily deteriorated, with an escalating cycle of self-harm. By the time they could finally access Camhs, they were experiencing suicidal ideation in addition to anxiety and depression. Our child is 14. To say that all of us became desperate seems like an understatement. There are no adequate words to describe the worry experienced on behalf of a vulnerable child. This experience is being lived by thousands of children and their families, so it is not surprising that in some cases, we see the ultimate tragedy being played out. Our children are silent victims of governmental failure on an epic scale. My heart goes out to everyone across the country who is waiting for help. You are not alone. Name and address supplied \u2022 Our eldest daughter started self-harming in early 2020, and did so constantly through the next two years. She has large keloid scars that she will carry for the rest of her life. The scars that my husband and I, and her sister bear are emotional, and I am not sure when they will heal. This crisis began just as the ability of her school or Camhs to offer meaningful support was shattered by lockdown and then crippled for over 18 months. Visit after visit to A&amp;E, several admissions to hospital, assessment after assessment by Camhs, with no meaningful follow-up. She asked me: \u201cWhy do people ask me all these questions if nobody helps me?\u201d We\u2019re in a better place now, largely due to a Camhs programme begun 10 months ago. I value this, but I remain angry that we were left in the wind for a year and a half. Name and address supplied \u2022 My 15-year-old daughter was referred to Camhs in September 2019 as her secondary school refused to accept her ADHD diagnosis from Canada and make appropriate accommodations, and our GP couldn\u2019t continue to prescribe her medication without a Camhs appointment in the pipeline. Thirteen months later, we were finally seen for the first time. Next week is our last appointment, as with a sigh of relief they kick us forward in the system as my daughter turns 18 and we will be someone else\u2019s problem. Each time, she was forced to open up afresh about depression and anxiety to a new doctor (eight appointments, seven doctors). Are they counting that as talk therapy? Not one piece of meaningful advice about coping with or overcoming ADHD, let alone depression and anxiety. Not so much as a DIY book recommendation. \u201cWhat can we do for you?\u201d they ask my mortified child every time. They need her to say she\u2019s not suicidal (today) so they can tick the box and escort us out. Name address supplied \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Before the first world war, the trade unions had benefited from cooperation between the newly created Labour party and the Liberal party, but Lloyd George\u2019s decision to stay as prime minister at the end of the war using the \u201ccoupon election\u201d left him in the power of a Tory majority in the Commons. When the miners, faced with drastic wage cuts, appealed to him for help, he set up a royal commission. The Sankey report supported the miners and the nationalisation of the mines for the benefit of the national economy. However, the Tory majority refused to implement the report and slashed wages. The Liberal party never recovered from the coupon election and the Labour party\u2019s then leader, Ramsay MacDonald, lost faith that strikes would help the party gain power. So even though the unions had brought about the existence of the Labour party, he dissociated the party from supporting strikes and opposed the calling of the General Strike in support of miners\u2019 wages. Its failure led to a general lowering of working-class wages. Margaret Morris Author, The General Strike \u2022 I could not agree more with Aditya Chakrabortty regarding the Tory party and its iterations since 2010. We are expected to believe that the austerity party of 2010 was \u201csocially liberal\u201d and fiscally conservative. Do people think universal credit, the bedroom tax, the two-child policy and the benefit cap were socially liberal? Austerity was sold as paying off the national debt so that future crises could be avoided. This has clearly not happened. Furthermore, in order to keep the right wing on board, the Tories spent the years leading up to the Brexit vote denigrating the EU and slagging off migrants, then acted surprised when people voted leave. Even in economic good times the measures introduced since 2010 would hamper any country\u2019s prosperity, but in bad times there is literally no capacity in the system to cope.

            "date": "2022-11-04T06:00:38Z",
            "content": "Bernie Sanders has criticized Democrats for not doing enough to motivate voters around the economic issues that have an impact on everyday life, as he warned next week\u2019s midterm elections are the most \u201cconsequential\u201d in modern American history. In an interview with the Guardian in Texas, the leftwing Vermont senator said: \u201cObviously, everybody should be turning out for what is the most consequential midterm election in the modern history of this country. Democracy is on the ballot. Women\u2019s right to control their own bodies is on the ballot. Climate change is on the ballot, so everybody should come out.\u201d But Sanders said he worried \u201cvery much that Democrats have not done a good enough job of reaching out to young people and working-class people and motivating them to come out and vote in this election\u201d. Sanders, a Democratic socialist who ran for president in 2016 and 2020, maintains a strong core of support in the Democratic party. He has been a fierce critic of Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, but has also been unafraid to point out what he sees as flaws in Democratic strategy. Sanders was in Texas last weekend as part of a barnstorming trip across the US ahead of next week\u2019s midterm elections that he wants to use to highlight economic issues, which are emerging as the primary concern for many voters. \u201cPeople are hurting. You got 60% of our people living paycheck to paycheck, and for many workers, they are falling further behind as a result of inflation. Oil company profits are soaring, food company profits are soaring, drug company profits are soaring. Corporate profits are at an all time high. The rich are getting much richer, and Democrats have got to make that message,\u201d he said. In assessing his party\u2019s success at communicating the threat of corporate profiteering to the cost of living, Sanders said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of [Democrats being] successful. They haven\u2019t tried.\u201d On Wednesday, Biden urged oil companies to pass their massive profits on to consumers, seeking to address what he sees as the real reason behind the high gas prices Americans have seen in the past year: corporate profiteering. It\u2019s the kind of message Sanders hoped to see earlier in an election in which many Democratic candidates have focused more on the loss of abortion rights and the growing threat to US democracy. \u201cThe truth is that about half of inflationary cost increases are a result of corporate greed. So if people can\u2019t afford to fill up their gas tanks, if they can\u2019t afford food, if they can\u2019t afford their prescription drugs \u2013 what Democrats should be explaining to them is why that is so,\u201d Sanders said. Sanders said he is showing up for progressive candidates he feels were abandoned by many other Democrats. In San Marcos, Sanders appeared with the congressional candidate Greg Casar who is, according to Sanders, successfully underscoring the idea that Democrats are the party of economic leadership. In the Rio Grande Valley, the southern region of the state where Latino voters play a critical role, Democrats still maintain their hold but are slowly losing control. Across south Texas counties in 2020, Biden either won against Trump by lower margins compared with Hilary Clinton in 2016, or he lost outright. In a June special election for district 36 \u2013 which covers parts of the Gulf coast, including Brownsville \u2013 the rightwing conspiracy theorist Mayra Flores won and flipped a historically Democratic district. On Sunday night, Sanders showed up in person to throw his weight behind Michelle Vallejo, a progressive in a tight congressional race with Monica De La Cruz, a fellow Latina endorsed by Trump in newly drawn congressional district 15. It\u2019s reminiscent of another race in the region back in 2020, when the progressive congressional candidate Jessica Cisneros lost by just a few hundred votes to the conservative Democrat Henry Cuellar, the incumbent representative and the only House Democrat to vote against legislation to codify Roe v Wade. In that primary election, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the organization responsible for helping Democrats get elected to Congress, endorsed Cuellar over Cisneros, to the disappointment of Sanders, progressives and many other Democrats within the party. Now, Sanders is hoping for a change of tune within the party. \u201cWe worked hard for Jessica and she lost by a few hundred votes. And unbelievably, the Democratic leadership ended up supporting the most conservative Democrat in the caucus there [Henry Cuellar]. Look \u2013 what I would simply tell you \u2026 is that along with Greg, you\u2019re gonna have some great new members of Congress from Illinois, from Pennsylvania, from around the country. And you\u2019re going to have more strong progressives in Congress than in history this month in this country.\u201d While Sanders is still in disagreement with aspects of the strategy of the Democratic political apparatus, it remains unclear if this dissatisfaction extends to Joe Biden. Referring to the supreme court\u2019s undoing of Roe v Wade, the case that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion into law, Sanders said it was an issue that is \u201cenormously important\u201d. But it\u2019s not the only issue. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fight every step of the way with the supreme court. You\u2019ve seen a pretty much united Democratic party on [the abortion] issue, have you not? Zillions of dollars on ads and so forth. But we have not had the same unity and the same energy around the economic crisis facing working families and what Republicans would do. So it\u2019s not a question of what the president alone is doing. It\u2019s a question of what the party is doing, where it\u2019s putting its money, its resources, its energy.\u201d When asked if he supported a 2024 Biden presidential run, Sanders said: \u201cRight now, we\u2019re worried about 2022.\u201d"

            "content": "A coalition of influential trade unions, business and environmental groups have urged Rishi Sunak\u2019s government to scrap plans for a bonfire of EU regulations by the end of 2023, saying it could put the UK\u2019s economic growth at risk. In a letter signed by organisations including the Trades Union Congress (TUC), Institute of Directors (IoD) and Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, leaders said sweeping away thousands of pieces of EU legislation and legal principles would \u201ccause significant confusion and disruption for businesses, working people and those seeking to protect the environment\u201d. The letter, which was addressed to the business secretary, Grant Shapps, said the groups were concerned about the loss of \u201cvital\u201d worker, consumer and environmental rights, including those regarding holiday pay, safe working hours and protection from discrimination. \u201cMaking these changes will prove costly and bureaucratic and would undermine the certainty and stability workers and businesses need if the economy is to prosper,\u201d the letter said. That could spell further trouble for the government, which is already preparing for the UK economy to shrink by 1.4% next year, according to forecasts released alongside the government\u2019s autumn statement last week. Sunak\u2019s government has already received a scathing review of the so-called retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill from experts on the regulatory and policy committee, which advises on the impact of regulations, earlier this week. The bill was one of the major policy reforms introduced under Liz Truss\u2019s short-lived government, and was then promoted by her business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg. But the committee\u2019s subsequent review of the bill \u2013 under which thousands of EU laws will automatically expire at the end of 2023 \u2013 found that that it was not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. It said the department had \u201cnot sufficiently considered, or sought to quantify, the full impacts of the bill. In addition, the impact assessment does not include a consideration of the impact on small and micro businesses consistent with better regulation\u201d. Commenting on the bill alongside the campaign letter sent on Thursday, the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThis bill has been being rushed through with no consultation and no real thought for the impacts on workers, businesses, consumers and the environment. It is a recipe for chaos. \u201cToday unions have joined with employers, lawyers, environmental groups and civic society to call on ministers to press stop. This bill must be withdrawn before lasting damage is done,\u201d she added."

            "content": "For three decades, world leaders at international conferences have pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions and greener energy sources have been developed, yet emissions have continued to rise (World still \u2018on brink of climate catastrophe\u2019 after Cop27 deal, 20 November). Even as previously extreme weather events become normal and millions of people are displaced by weather-related events, there is still no sign of electorates in richer countries being willing to vote for rationing or much higher prices for car use, air travel, meat consumption and other particularly damaging activities. Clearly, we urgently need a new strategy. The world\u2019s biggest economies or the UN need to spend hundreds of billions of dollars, perhaps funded by a financial transactions tax, on carbon scrubbing and ocean seeding to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; solar radiation management to reduce warming; and the purchase and protection of land such as rainforest to prevent its destruction. Richard Mountford Hildenborough, Kent \u2022 The primary cause of the climate crisis and damage that the world is facing, and the growth in the problem if we fail to curb emissions, comes from the global fossil fuel industry treating the atmosphere as a free sewer for emissions from their products. It is obvious where the money for a \u201closs and damage\u201d fund should come from \u2013 the fossil fuel industry (A deal on loss and damage, but a blow to 1.5C \u2013 what will be Cop27\u2019s legacy?, 20 November). A surcharge of, say, 5% of the market value on all movements of fossil fuels from mines, to be paid by the producer, would not only ensure a copious flow of cash but would also provide a strong incentive for the market to adopt climate-friendly technologies. The fund should also be accessible to alleviate the suffering of poorer people wherever they may live. The climate issue is first an economic one. There can be no human prosperity on a climate-wrecked planet where people drop dead in the streets from the heat, everything we build gets blown away, flooded or burned to the ground, and we can no longer produce food to nourish ourselves. Faced with such events, there will be a demand for a return to a safe climate, not just some money to try to fix the damage. The historic agreement we need is one on how to adjust the way the market works so it rewards activities that nourish the future rather than emissions-based ones that destroy it. Harold Forbes Wareham, Dorset \u2022 Damian Carrington is right (The 1.5C climate goal died at Cop27 \u2013 but hope must not, 20 November), but his analysis overlooks the tragedy of the commons. There is a limit to the pain that governments are willing to ask their citizens to accept for the long-term good of the world, unless enough other countries can be trusted to do the same. Do we seriously believe that the most polluting countries will take urgent actions that damage their national interests for the good of the world? On what evidence could we justify such beliefs? Irrational hope is not an acceptable basis for national security; it\u2019s time for realism. Alongside taking our strongest actions to slow down climate heating, we should accept that it will continue to increase for decades and that this will cause serious famines, droughts, floods and loss of habitable land. We need to prepare for the consequences, which seem likely to include mass migration and wars to defend or to gain access to vital resources. As a nation, we cannot prevent the catastrophe alone, but we can start to discuss what will happen and how soon, and how this should affect where we build, what defences we shall need, and how we will sustain access to food and other vital resources. To fail to plan would be the utmost irresponsibility. Martyn Thomas Tunbridge Wells, Kent \u2022 The dismal failure of Cop27 and the government\u2019s \u201cdeliberate amnesia\u201d over Covid (They said we would \u2018build back better\u2019 after Covid. What breathtaking deceit, 20 November) are not separate issues. They are parts of the trinity of existential risk \u2013 the third is the ever-lurking nuclear weapons danger. We need to recognise how these are interrelated. The same vested interests, the same short-term vision, the same political mystifications prevent us from tackling these global threats and the poverty and inequality underpinning them that have been documented for decades. If we are to have a chance, and it is a slim one, our analysis has to go deeper and understand why the warning signals were consistently missed. And the various campaigns and protests need to agree that they are facing a single challenge that must be faced jointly, with a long-term vision of an entirely different world.

            "content": "Time to wrap up, after a day in which Joules joined the companies at risk of collapse, Brexit was blamed for the UK\u2019s second bout of austerity, and Paris claimed the title of Europe\u2019s largest stock market. Here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories, first on the autumn statement and the impact of Brexit: Problems in the UK economy: The cost of living crisis: The crisis in the cryptocurrency world: And in other news\u2026 Another Brexit development \u2013 firms are being given an extra two years to shift from European product safety marking to a new British scheme. Business Secretary Grant Shapps has announced that companies have until the end of 2024 to move to UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) marking for products sold in the UK. UKCA has been introduced following Brexit, to show that products comply with UK product safety regulations. It is meant to supplant the CE marking, which shows products comply with Europeon Union standards. The UK had planned to end recognition of the CE mark at the end of this year. But following warnings that some companies would stop selling to the UK, the deadline has been pushed back to the end of 2024. Businesses can thus use either marking until then. The Business Department explains that\u2026 \u2026given the difficult economic conditions created by post-pandemic shifts in demand and supply, alongside Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine and the associated high energy prices, the government does not want to burden business with the requirement to meet the original (31 December 2022) deadline. The government will continue to recognise the CE marking for 2 years, therefore allowing businesses until 31 December 2024 to prepare for the UKCA marking. Businesses can also use the UKCA marking, giving them flexibility to choose which marking to apply. Brexit is the ultimate reason why the UK now faces a fresh round of austerity, a former interest rate-setter at the Bank of England has said. \u201cThe UK economy as a whole has been permanently damaged by Brexit,\u201d Michael Saunders, a former external member of the central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \u201cIt\u2019s reduced the economy\u2019s potential output significantly, eroded business investment,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t had Brexit, we probably wouldn\u2019t be talking about an austerity budget this week.\u201d \u201cThe need for tax rises, spending cuts wouldn\u2019t be there, if Brexit hadn\u2019t reduced the economy\u2019s potential output so much.\u201d Saunders joined the rate-setting committee shortly after the result of the Brexit referendum in 2016 and left the role in August this year. He said the \u201cmain legacy of that period\u201d was weak economic output. More here: Austerity is not inevitable, despite the need to reassure the markets following the disastrous mini-bdget of September. Some investors believe taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor would be \u2018fine\u2019 with the bond market. My colleague Anna Isaac, who has examined the choices facing the chancellor, reports: Bond market \u201cvigilantes\u201d as they are sometimes termed, thanks to their history of forcing fiscal U-turns around the world, are more concerned that inflation is not fanned by a huge stimulus, and that the budget is funded, rather than advocating austerity for its own sake. \u201cIt is important that it is funded. As long as it is funded the bond market vigilantes are completely fine with it,\u201d says Kaspar Hense, a senior portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management, an investment company which focuses on bonds. \u201cIf you take the money from the rich and give it to the poor that is completely fine for the bond market. The bond market is not too antagonistic in that sense.\u201d But investors are still warier of UK assets, following this autumn\u2019s turmoil: After recent wild yields on UK government bonds this debt comes with a riskier profile. The government will have to tread carefully for months, if not years, to avoid the prospect of a sell-off. \u201cYou can\u2019t unburn toast,\u201d says Toby Nangle, an independent economic and markets analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s more technical than people may realise, but in basic terms, data informs the quantitative strategy that investors take. That data is now in the machine. It\u2019s baked into the maths. It frames future decisions.\u201d Brexit has also left UK companies struggling to hire staff \u2013 last week, the Brexiteer boss of Next warned that current immigration policy was holding back economic growth. And today, Britain\u2019s foremost business lobby group urged Jeremy Hunt to use this week\u2019s autumn statement to shake up immigration rules to support companies struggling with chronic staff shortages and a looming recession. The head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said urgent action was required from the chancellor on Thursday to bolster the economy, including \u201ctough political choices\u201d to allow more overseas workers in Britain as employers struggle with a desperate lack of staff. CB director Tony Danker said: Not matching action on spending and tax with measures to tackle labour shortages and productivity is likely to be damaging in the short and long term. A desperate lack of workers is inflating wages and stopping firms growing.\u201d As well as permanent damage from Brexit, the UK also faces stubbornly high inflation. Deutsche Bank predict that inflation rose again in October to 10.9% (we get the data on Wednesday), from September\u2019s 40-year high of 10.1%. And worryingly for households, Deutsche reckons inflation will average 8.2% through 2023 \u2013 or four times the Bank of England\u2019s target \u2013 before dropping to 3.4% in 2024. The weakness of the pound, which is down 13% against the US dollar this year, has pushed up the cost of imported goods. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the UK\u2019s stock market has now been overtaken by Paris (see earlier post for details), due to the pound\u2019s weakness, and concerns over Britain\u2019s economic health. Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union is one of the reasons why the UK is now entering a period of austerity, a former Bank of England policymaker has said. Michael Saunders, who left the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee this summer, told Bloomberg TV that leaving the European Union had created permanent damage. Saunders said the last six years of government had been a \u2018chaotic period\u2019, with five prime ministers and seven chancellors. This upheaval has included the Brexit vote, the depreciation of sterling, a period of political uncertainty, the pandemic, and then renewed political uncertainty, says Saunders, now senior adviser at Oxford Economics. And the legacy of this period is that the economy\u2019s potential output \u201chas been weak\u201d. Q: So has the City of London has been damaged, as it loses its crown as the biggest European stock market to Paris? Saunders says the impact has been wider: \u201cThe UK economy as a whole has been permanently damaged by Brexit. It\u2019s reduced the economy\u2019s potential output significantly, eroded business investment. If we hadn\u2019t had Brexit, we probably wouldn\u2019t be talking about an austerity budget this week. The need for tax rises [and] spending cuts wouldn\u2019t be there, if Brexit hadn\u2019t reduced the economy\u2019s potential output so much. The key is to raise potential output, Saunders concludes, saying that Liz Truss was right to diognose this as the problem. But, cutting taxes and deregulating was the wrong solution. Instead, Saunders says the government should focus on improving trade links with the EU, strengthening education and trading, and tackling the worrying rise in long-term sickness that has reduced the UK\u2019s workforce. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt warned on Sunday that everyone will be paying \u201ca bit more tax\u201d after the autumn budget, while public services are expected to face severe cuts. Last Friday we learned that the UK was the only major advanced economy to shrink in the last quarter\u2026.. \u2026with business investment now 8.4% below its pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s been a tough few weeks for Twitter\u2019s ad sales department, since Elon Musk\u2019s takeover prompted a clutch of major companies to pause activity on the site. But they can celebrate a win \u2013 from Musk\u2019s aerospace business SpaceX. According to CNBC, SpaceX has ordered one of the larger advertising packages available from Twitter. The campaign will promote the SpaceX-owned and -operated satellite internet service called Starlink on Twitter in Spain and Australia, according to internal records from the social media business viewed by CNBC. Musk has said that the package is \u2018tiny\u2019, though \u2013 to test the effectiveness of Twitter advertising. Last week, advertising and marketing conglomerate Omnicom advised clients to pause their spending on Twitter in the short term. Musk, who sacked half of Twitter\u2019s staff this month, also says he\u2019s overworked. He told a business conference in Bali that: \u201cI have too much work on my plate, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m working the absolute most that I can work -- morning to night, seven days a week.\u201d Oil cartel Opec has revised down its predictions for oil demand this year, partly due to the slowing global economy. Forecast oil demand this year has been revised down by 100,000 barrels per day, to 2.5m barrels per day. The revision is due to China\u2019s zero-Covid policy, ongoing geopolitical uncertainties and weaker economic activities. Opec says: The significant uncertainty regarding the global economy, accompanied by fears of a global recession contributes to the downside risk for lowering global oil demand growth. In addition, China\u2019s strict adherence to the \u201czero COVID-19 policy\u201d adds to this uncertainty, making the country\u2019s recovery path even more unpredictable. It has also cut its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2023, again by 0.1 mb/d. Back in Europe, eurozone factories performed better than expected in September. Eurozone industrial production rose by 0.9% in September, thanks to an easing of supply chain problems that cushioned the damage from higher energy prices. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to give away the majority of his $124bn net worth during his lifetime. Bezos has told CNN he will devote the bulk of his wealth to fighting climate change, and to supporting people who can unify humanity in the face of deep social and political divisions. Bezos\u2019 pledge is light on specifics, though. He has been criticised in the past for not signing the Giving Pledge, under which some of the world\u2019s richest people promise to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes \u2013 including his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott. CNN reports: In a sit-down interview with CNN\u2019s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren S\u00e1nchez, said the couple is \u201cbuilding the capacity to be able to give away this money.\u201d Asked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d Bezos adds that the hard part is working out how do in a levered way. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I\u2019m finding \u2014 and I think Lauren is finding the same thing \u2014 that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.\u201d Here\u2019s a video clip of the interview: Bezos has also awarded a $100m (\u00a384.8m) prize to country music star and philanthropist Dolly Parton, to spend on any charitable donations of her choice More here: Exclusive: Jeff Bezos says he will give most of his money to charity Over in the US, there are hopes that inflation may be heading lower. Goldman Sachs have predicted that the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, called core PCE, will fall below 3% by the end of next year as supply constraints ease, the cost of housing falls and the labor market cools. Last week, the US consumer prices index dropped by more than expected, to 7.7% in October from 8.2% in September, which triggered a market rally. But, Fed governor Christopher Waller did urge caution over the weekend, warning that the endpoint for rising rates was still \u201ca ways off\u201d. Britain lost its title of Europe\u2019s largest equity market to France, Bloomberg reports. The City was overtaken by Paris as economic growth concerns hit UK assets, while China\u2019s relaxation of Covid rules has boosted French luxury shares. Bloomberg has the details: The combined market capitalization of primary listings in Paris overtook that of the London in US dollar terms, according to an index compiled by Bloomberg. Domestically-focused UK shares have slumped this year, while French luxury goods-makers like LVMH and Gucci owner Kering have recently been boosted by optimism over a potential easing of China\u2019s Covid Zero policy. Currency movements have also worked in Paris\u2019s favor. Former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget of unfunded tax cuts in September and subsequent storm in UK financial markets sank sterling to the lowest level since 1985 against the greenback. UK midcaps have been crushed this year on predictions that Britons would be squeezed harder by rising energy costs than elsewhere, while British homeowners are facing a surge in interest payments given the widespread issuance of flexible-rate mortgage loans in the country. Within about three weeks of Truss becoming prime minister, UK\u2019s stock and bond markets had lost roughly $500bn in combined value, with investor confidence shattered by the tax-cutting budget. The drop in the pound has also eroded the value of UK shares in dollar terms. Bloomberg adds that the market cap gap between the UK and French stock markets has been narrowing from about $1.5trn since the Brexit vote in 2016. British equities are now worth about $2.821trn compared with about $2.823trn for French equities, by Bloomberg\u2019s calculations. Here\u2019s the full story: London Loses Crown of Biggest European Stock Market to Paris Joules\u2019s failure to move with the times helped to push it to appoint administrators, says Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown. Streeter explains: The apparel retailer, once the darling of the outdoor set, had become stuck in a rut \u2013 as athleisure wear took over as the casual clothes for the younger generation and even Joules\u2019 core customers, started falling out of love with the staples of its floral and fashion ranges. It can be hard for a brand based on British heritage to move with the times, but Joules\u2019 demise shows, fast moving fashion trends can cause serious damage to slow coaches. The effect of consumers tightening their belts will have caused deeper damage to the company\u2019s furniture and accessories business Garden Trading, as spending on revamped rooms and outdoor spaces has been cut back. But despite its problems, there is likely to be \u201csignificant interest\u201d in acquiring the Joules brand, and its intellectual property, Streeter adds. The Joules brand is still strong, and although it will need a modern twist to help it survive longer term, there is likely to be significant interest in the name and the intellectual property. \u2018\u2019 Hundreds of workers at a factory which makes products including Jacob\u2019s Cream Crackers, Jaffa Cakes and Twiglets are to strike in a dispute over pay. Staff at the plant in Aintree have been taking limited industrial action since September, but walked out on Monday on indefinite strike. Eamon O\u2019Hearn, national officer of the GMB union, said: \u201cThese workers are rightly angry - they put themselves on the line to keep the company going during the pandemic. \u201cNow they need some help to get them through the cost-of-living crisis, but it\u2019s falling on deaf ears. \u201cJacob\u2019s workers will now be on strike 24 hours a day, seven days a week until the company comes back to the negotiating table.\u201d Shares in North Sea oil and gas producers have dropped this morning, amid reports that chancellor Jeremy Hunt is considering increasing the emergency levy from 25% to as much as 35% in his Autumn Statement on Thursday. Harbour Energy are the top faller on the FTSE 100, down 7%, while Enquest have dropped 9%. Soaring energy bills are forcing some UK pubs, restaurants and cafes to cut their trading hours or even stay shut some days. A survey by the Office for National Statistics found that food and drink service firms are most likely to cut trading to tackle energy costs One in five hospitality firms have reduced their daily trading hours, while 7% have closed one day a week. Another 6% have stayed shut at least two days each week, judging that soaring costs made it uneconomical to operate. The government has brought in an emergency cap on business energy bills this winter, to help protect non-domestic customers. But even so, one hospitality business told the ONS they could cut staff if the energy squeeze continues: We employ three local people to work in our business, paying above living wage as we see this as fair. We will have to let our staff go if energy costs increase. Around two in five food and drink service businesses expect to raise their prices in November, compared with an overall average of 28%, which would add to the cost of living squeeze. The fashion retailer Joules has announced it attends to appoint administrators, putting as many as 1,600 jobs at risk after talks fell through to find new investors. The board of Joules on Monday said they had \u201cregrettably\u201d decided to appoint administrators from Interpath Advisory to Joules Group and three subsidiaries including the Garden Trading Company. Trading in Joules shares has been suspended. Joules, which is best known for its jackets and patterned wellington boots, had been struggling for months with falling sales. It has in part blamed those woes on the cost of living crisis and on the UK summer heatwave which reduced demand for its posh winter wellies. Conditions appear to be improving in the events sector, after some torrid years. UK events organiser Informa has lifted its annual earnings forecast this morning, reporting that demand for physical events and its subscription services has improved. Informa, which had been hit by pandemic cancellations and lockdowns, now expects adjusted operating profit for the year of \u00a3490m-\u00a3505mm, up from \u00a3470m-\u00a3490m. Informa told shareholders: \u201cThe operating momentum across both our businesses, combined with the strength of our positions in North America, put us in a strong position for continued growth and acceleration in 2023, with incremental growth in China as the market reopens.\u201d Shares in Informa have gained almost 5%, the top riser in London this morning. Here\u2019s a Twitter thread on the fall in UK business confidence: Another economic warning light is flashing \u2013 in the housing market. Asking prices for British residential properties are dropping, and first-time buyers are pulling back as the turmoil following the \u201cmini-budget\u201d slows the property market. Figures from the property platform Rightmove show buyer demand fell 20% in October compared with a year ago, as house-hunters put their property searches on hold in response to soaring borrowing costs and rising economic uncertainty. Older people face a bigger income hit from surging energy costs this winter but younger households are more at risk of being unable to pay their bill or getting into debt amid the cost of living crisis. As households across Britain turn their heating on, the research by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found that older generations, in particular the over-75s, will spend a bigger share of their income, up from 5% to 8%, on their energy bills. For those under 50 the proportion is 5%. But while older households face a bigger increase, it is younger generations, who have endured years of stalled pay growth and high rents, who will struggle most to cope, according to the report. Here\u2019s a chart showing how business confidence has sunk to a 13-year low, as firms brace for a lengthy recession. As flagged in the intro, bosses haven\u2019t been this gloomy since the aftermath of the financial crisis. The proportion of manufacturing and service sector firms expecting activity to increase over the next 12 months was the lowest since 2009. Firms expect inflation to remain elevated, while pessimism about profits will lead to cuts in both capital expenditure (capex) and research &amp; development (R&amp;D) spending. European bosses are even gloomier, according to the latest Accenture / S&amp;P Global UK Business Outlook. Here\u2019s the key findings from the report: UK headline index has fallen to its lowest of +18% since 2009, but remains stronger than European peers. Employment still expected to rise, though firms lack confidence in finding skilled staff Companies still expect a considerable rise in costs, with 80% of UK businesses forecasting higher wages UK firms project falls in both capex and R&amp;D over the coming 12 months Lisa Webb, consumer rights expert at Which?, has advice for customers of Joules, and its subsidiary The Garden Trading Company: \u201cThe news that Joules is entering administration will be devastating for its employees, as well as a real concern for customers with orders placed - as exercising your rights is not always straightforward in these circumstances. \u201cWhen a company is in administration, it may not accept the return of items. \u201cMany customers may find themselves in a situation where items have not been delivered. It is always worth trying to claim for a refund in these situations, but customers should know it is not guaranteed. The cost of repairs for faulty items could still be claimed if they came with a warranty. \u201cIf you\u2019ve bought something on your credit card costing more than \u00a3100, the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract. \u201cYou can claim under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act if the item is faulty or not delivered. \u201cIf you paid for goods that cost less than \u00a3100 on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.\u201d Elsewhere in UK retail, Frasers Group is reportedly in late-stage talks to seal a deal for Savile Row tailor Gieves &amp; Hawkes. Sky News has reported that Mike Ashley\u2019s empire is close to sealing the purchase of the 251-year-old Savile Row business after its Hong Kong-based owner fell into administration The value of the deal is uncertain but will not be material for Frasers, which rejoined the FTSE 100 index this year. Gieves &amp; Hawkes have been royal tailors since 1809. The Gieves and Hawkes tailoring labels can trace their histories back to 1785 and 1771 respectively, with Giever supplying the British Royal Navy and Hawkes the British Army. Gieves acquired Hawkes in 1974. Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman explains: Based at 1 Savile Row, the brand has been part of Trinity Group - which is in turn owned by the collapsed Shandong Ruyi Technology Group - since 2012. Sarah Riding, retail partner at the law firm Gowling WLG, predicts another retailer will move to rescue Joules \u2013 but there could still be job losses. \u201cWhile the potential job losses are regrettable, it seems that Joules has taken the precautionary steps needed to limit further fallout in terms of further job losses and an erosion in their brand equity. \u201cGiven the surprising acquisitions and strategic partnerships that have been made in the retail space recently, there should be at least some optimism that another industry player will come to the rescue of a brand that still holds resonance with consumers. While the brand may need to identify supply chain contingencies that deliver more value for money for consumers with lighter pockets, the potential is there for a partner to emerge and help facilitate this.\u201d Here\u2019s Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, on Joules\u2019s plan to appoint administrators and suspend its shares. It comes after various discussions with investors about an equity raise including Cornerstone Investment and the retailer Next appear to have fallen through. Last week Joules reported revenue figures for the 11 weeks to 30th October which fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations driven by softer online sales. The fashion brand\u2019s cash crunch is putting around 1,700 jobs at risk with shares now suspended on AIM this morning, pending clarification of the company\u2019s financial position. Joules appears to be the latest victim of the UK\u2019s retail crisis with the demise of the high street and the cost-of-living crisis. Just last week Made.com entered into administration after the interior design and DIY pandemic boom faded along with its furniture sales. Joules has been struggling with the squeeze on household budgets after the post-pandemic and war-driven inflation supercharged the cost-of-living, leaving far less money left over for retail spending. Outdoor goods vendor, the Garden Trading Company which is owned by the same parent company is also on the brink of collapse. The latest UK retail sales figures underscore the difficulty facing shops across Britain, with a 6.9% slump year-on-year in October as retail sales still languish below their pre-covid February 2020 levels. Joules operates about 130 shops, so its collapse would be a blow to UK high streets as well as extremely worrying news for its staff. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says: Well, at Friday\u2019s close of c9p, Joules was capitalised at just \u00a310m, so its fall from grace has been alarming (the IPO price in May 2016 was 160p and it peaked at over 300p), but no doubt Next will be poised to pick up the pieces\u2026 Joules had hoped that Next, one of Britain\u2019s biggest clothes retailers, would invest in the company to help with its turnaround. However, a deal could not be reached. Once Joules has appointed administrators, as it intends to, some of its assets could be bought up by a larger rival. Trading in Joules shares have been suspended at the company\u2019s request, \u2018pending further clarification of the Company\u2019s financial position\u2019, says the London Stock Exchange. Joules shares have fallen 93% this year, from around 140p in January to 9p at the end of last week. Over 1,000 jobs are at risk at Joules and the Garden Trading Company, as it prepares to appoint administrators. The company is also asking for its shares to be suspended. Sky News reports: Joules Group, which has around 1,700 staff, revealed it was to file a notice of intention to appoint administrators and had requested the suspension of trading in the company\u2019s shares. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Struggling high street retailer Joules has decided to call in the administrators, becoming the latest UK company to be hit by the cost of living crisis. The coats and wellies retailer is on the brink of collapse after failing to raise new funding. Joules told the City this morning that it will file a notice of intention to appoint Interpath Advisory Limited as administrators to the Company, \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable.\u201d It explains: \u201cThe board is taking this action to protect the interests of its creditors\u201d Garden Trading, Joules\u2019 furniture and accessories business, will also file for administration. Joules has suffered from the milder weather this year, as well as the cost of living crisis, whic both hit sales in recent month. In August it issued a profits warning, blaming the summer heatwave for plunging sales of clothing such as jackets, knitwear and wellington boots. Last week, Joules revealed it was in talks with its founder, Tom Joule, over a possible cash injection following those poor sales. It had also hoped to agree a bridging loan, to help it keep operating while refinancing talks took place. But today, it says: \u2026.discussions with various parties have not been successful and have now terminated. The crisis at Joules follows the collapse of online furniture retailer Made.com last week, which led to 320 redundancies and left customers worried about their orders. Online mattress retailer Eve Sleep also filed for administration, before being rescued by rival Bensons for Beds. And there are more warning signs across the economy today, with UK business confidence falling to its lowest level in 13 years, according to data from Accenture and S&amp;P Global. Firms are cutting back on capital investment plans, while rising inflation is creating tough economic conditions. Simon Eaves, Market Unit Lead for Accenture in the UK &amp; Ireland, said: \u201cAs we head towards what is likely to be a tough winter for the UK economy, business confidence has understandably been shaken. However, many British companies continue to demonstrate resilience in the face of economic difficulties. Hiring plans remain positive and overall optimism, whilst muted, is higher than many of our European counterparts.

            "date": "2022-11-22T13:00:30Z",
            "content": "Golden generation. The eyes must roll every time that loaded description is mentioned in Belgium circles but there it is, from Eden Hazard no less, in a Fifa promotional video for the World Cup in which the Real Madrid man insists this incarnation has delivered on account of a third-place finish in Russia four years ago. Roberto Mart\u00ednez concurs, although that is no great surprise from a master of positive spin who once described an Everton player\u2019s broken leg as \u201ca great opportunity\u201d and every set of results going against Wigan in their fight for Premier League survival as good for his players\u2019 mindset. They were relegated the next day courtesy of a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal. Revisit Belgium\u2019s performance in 2018, however, and it does seem churlish to dismiss Hazard\u2019s and Mart\u00ednez\u2019s point entirely. Beating England for a second time in the tournament to win the third-place playoff meant something, as the jubilant reaction in the dugout and on the pitch demonstrated. It meant Belgium\u2019s best placing at a World Cup, eclipsing the achievement of the Enzo Scifo, Jan Ceulemans, Eric Gerets and Jean-Marie Pfaff generation who finished fourth in Mexico in 1986. And it meant a great deal to the thousands of fans who packed the Grand-Place in Brussels, turning the air black, yellow and red with their flares as they gave the squad a triumphant homecoming. There was no sign of disappointment that day with a golden generation being unmasked as bronze. Four years on Belgium bring expectation into a World Cup again, albeit accompanied by reservations rather than the conviction this gifted group can go one step further. Several of the original cast members have gone \u2013 including Vincent Kompany, Marouane Fellaini and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, plus Nacer Chadli, who underlined the value of a selfless squad player when scoring the 94th-minute winner that sealed a thrilling 3-2 comeback win over Japan in the last 16. Several ageing originals remain \u2013 mainly concentrated in defence where Mart\u00ednez remains reliant on the 33-year-old Toby Alderweireld and 35-year-old Jan Vertonghen. Last summer\u2019s European Championship brought defeat in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners Italy, when Belgium ran out of options and ideas. This year has brought two defeats by the Netherlands in the Nations League, the first a comprehensive 4-1 reverse on home soil after Romelu Lukaku had departed injured with the game goalless. \u201cThis is what we needed to prepare for the World Cup,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, true to form, of Belgium\u2019s first loss to the Netherlands for 25 years. Doubts continue to surround the fitness of Lukaku, who has made only two brief substitute appearances for Internazionale since injuring a hamstring in the summer and has been receiving daily treatment in the buildup to day\u2019s opener against Canada. Belgium\u2019s prospects are closely aligned to the availability of their leading goalscorer but there is validity to their belief as well as the concerns. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s squad remains packed with title-winning experience, possesses some world-class talent and an emerging crop who hope to replenish the golden stock. They include Amadou Onana, whom Everton signed in a deal worth up to \u20ac40m from Lille this summer and who exudes confidence that his first World Cup can result in the ultimate triumph in Qatar. \u201cWhy not? That is the ambition we have,\u201d says the 21-year-old. \u201cWe have a very good mix. We have very experienced players; I\u2019m talking about Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois, Romelu and others. I think we have a great mix. Talking about pressure \u2013 I don\u2019t feel no pressure. We have a great team. Of course we have to take it in a very serious way and not just think: \u2018We are Belgium and we\u2019re going to make it anyway,\u2019 but I am quite confident.\u201d De Bruyne is a major reason for Onana\u2019s optimism. The younger midfielder venerates his senior teammate, and to whoever is in his company. \u201cHe is one of the best players in the world. That is my opinion,\u201d Onana says. \u201cFor me, and I have been saying this is the locker room at Everton, he does things that no one else can do. I would give him the Ballon d\u2019Or. If it depended on me I would give it to him. He is a crazy player and I enjoy having the chance to share the pitch with him.\u201d The Manchester City playmaker is 31 and has indicated this could be his last chance to win a World Cup. That is certainly true of Vertonghen and Alderweireld, while Courtois and Lukaku, who will be 34 and 33 respectively by the time the 2026 tournament kicks off, may also view Qatar as a final farewell in their prime. Onana believes the golden age could last until the United States, Canada and Mexico in four years\u2019 time, however. \u201cYou will have to ask them if it is their last World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I would be pleased to keep playing with them because they are great, great players. And they are great professionals.\u201d Onana admits it will be the realisation of \u201ca dream to play in a World Cup\u201d and the completion of a plan that involved moving to the Premier League, establishing himself in the Everton team and winning selection for Mart\u00ednez\u2019s squad. There is a possibility he could come up against his Everton colleague Jordan Pickford, and England\u2019s No 1, in the final. \u201cI\u2019ll score against him\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m joking, but why not?\u201d"

Rhubarb is good to go, too. Grow green manures in open space. It\u2019s a month of maintenance before the winter rains. There may be gales in some places; the first frosts. It\u2019s time to remove perennial weeds and add any ready organic matter. Maybe think about hiring a shredder for the year\u2019s heavier compost: stubborn artichoke and sunflower stems, any lighter sticks and woody material. Though air temperatures have dropped, garden soil should still be warm enough for new bare-root fruit trees, bushes and raspberry canes. But best get them in before it is too wet. Prune any apple and/or pear trees. Protect against winter moth with glue bands. Remove nets from soft fruit bushes. Maybe retain them over brassicas. Pigeons are hungrier now. Feed the soil with the last of the older compost and manure. Also make plans for ordering more. Sort through the shed if you have one. Sweep it, clear it, check for leaks. Think about ordering next year\u2019s seed. I buy mostly online but I\u2019ll still support my local garden centre when I can. I have no immunity to a nice-looking packet. Check any old stock for use-by dates. That said, we have been known to keep ours for longer than stated. Sort through any saved seed, too: it is a relaxing way to while away hours. I have trays and bowls and dishes piled with peas, a few beans and many flowers, all gently drying. Calendula, sunflowers, tagetes and nasturtiums are all easy to save. This year we have added a comforting amount of orange cosmos. Time, then, to make quiet plans. Collect leaf mould. Hang bird boxes. Put food and water out for wildlife.

            "date": "2022-11-13T18:29:46Z",
            "content": "As the balance of power in the US House of Representatives remained unresolved on Sunday, Democrats are celebrating the projection that they won control of the Senate, marking a significant victory for Joe Biden as Republicans backed by his presidential predecessor Donald Trump underperformed in key battleground states. While senior Democrats remained guarded on Sunday about the chances of keeping control of both chambers of Congress, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, hailed the party\u2019s performance in the midterms following months of projections indicating heavy losses. \u201cWho would have thought two months ago that this red wave would turn into a little tiny trickle, if that at all,\u201d Pelosi told CNN. She added: \u201cWe\u2019re still alive [for control of the House] but again the races are close. We don\u2019t pray for victory \u2026 but you pray that God\u2019s will will be done.\u201d As of Sunday morning Republicans remained seven seats shy of the 218 needed to win control of the House, with Democrats requiring 14, an indication that a majority on either side will be slim. As internal discussions between House Republicans intensify over potential leadership roles, with the minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, facing opposition from the far-right Freedom Caucus, Pelosi remained circumspect about her own future, saying she would not make any announcements on her plans until after the House\u2019s control is decided. \u201cMy decision will then be rooted in what the wishes of my family [are], and the wishes of my caucus,\u201d Pelosi said, with reference to her husband Paul Pelosi\u2019s ongoing recovery following an allegedly politically motivated violent burglary and attack at their family home in San Francisco last month. She added: \u201cThere are all kinds of ways to exert influence. The speaker has awesome power, but I will always have influence.\u201d The Democrats were projected to maintain their control of the Senate on Saturday evening when a tight race in Nevada was called for the incumbent Catherine Cortez Mastro who defeated Adam Laxalt, a Trump-backed, former state attorney general. The result marks a substantial victory for the Biden administration\u2019s agenda over the next two years, not only with regards to potential legislative negotiation but other powers which include appointments to the federal judiciary. Speaking to reporters in Cambodia during the Asean summit, Biden congratulated the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, but appeared to acknowledge how a Republican-controlled House might affect his agenda. \u201cWe feel good about where we are,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I know I\u2019m a cockeyed optimist \u2013 I understand that \u2013 from the beginning, but I\u2019m not surprised by the turnout.\u201d Biden added that the party\u2019s focus would move to the Senate runoff in Georgia next month, where incumbent Raphael Warnock will face Trump-endorsed Herschel Walker after neither candidate received over 50% of the vote. A victory for the Democrats in Georgia would hand them an outright majority of 51, without needing Biden\u2019s vice-president, Kamala Harris, to break Senate ties in their favor. As fallout from the midterm elections continues, attention is likely to pivot to Florida next week, where Trump is expected to announce a 2024 run for the presidency at his private members\u2019 club in Palm Beach. Although polling still indicates Trump is the preferred candidate among the Republican base, his support has shown signs of fracture after many of his endorsed candidates performed poorly last week. One poll released on Saturday showed Trump\u2019s support declining by six points to 50%, while the far-right governor Ron DeSantis, who cruised to re-election in Florida last week, saw support increase. On Sunday, Maryland\u2019s outgoing Republican governor \u2013 Larry Hogan, a longtime Trump critic \u2013 urged the party to move away from the former president\u2019s influence. \u201cYou know, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,\u201d Hogan told CNN. \u201cAnd Donald Trump kept saying: \u2018We\u2019re going to be winning so much, we\u2019ll get tired of winning.\u2019 I\u2019m tired of losing. That\u2019s all he\u2019s done.\u201d Nonetheless, Hogan \u2013 who himself is believed to be considering a run in 2024 \u2013 acknowledged that ousting Trump from the potential presidential nomination would be an uphill battle. \u201cHe\u2019s still the 800lb gorilla,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a battle and it\u2019s going to continue for the next few years. We\u2019re still two years out from the next election, and \u2026 the dust is still settling from this one. I think it would be a mistake, as I mentioned Trump\u2019s cost us the last three elections and I don\u2019t want to see it happen a fourth time.\u201d The midterms also proved to be an electoral rebuke to unfounded accusations of electoral fraud in the 2020 election, a baseless claim Trump has continued to press since losing the White House to Biden. Many Trump-endorsed candidates in major races, including the governor\u2019s election in Pennsylvania and the Senate race in Arizona, had denied the 2020 election results. In both of these contests, as well as several other high-profile races, the Trump-backed candidate lost to Democrats by significant margins. Although the gubernatorial election in Arizona, which pits the high-profile election denier Kari Lake against Democrat Katie Hobbs, remained too close to call on Sunday, a number of Democratic gubernatorial victors argued their wins marked a rejection of election conspiracy theories and rightwing extremism. Michigan\u2019s Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who won in a landslide against a Trump-endorsed election denier, said on Sunday that she believed her victory marked a rejection of political violence in the state. \u201cGood people need to call this out and say we will not tolerate this in this country,\u201d Whitmer, who was targeted by a failed kidnapping plot in 2020, told CNN. \u201cAnd perhaps part of that message was sent this election.\u201d"

            "content": "British retailers are hoping that one of the traditionally busiest shopping periods of the year will help reduce the amount of clothing filling warehouses after being caught out by improving supplier-delivery times. Marks &amp; Spencer is among the big retailers that have found they are receiving orders more quickly than expected, giving them an additional headache just as the UK economy braces for an expected recession. Discounted offers from Black Friday through to Cyber Monday have in recent years boosted sales for some retailers over the period, with data collected so far indicating figures are up compared with last year but down on 2019, before Covid disrupted the sector. Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics, said the industry was seeing \u201cmore discounts from a greater number of discounters. That\u2019s symptomatic of retailers sitting on too much stock. It\u2019s almost a perfect storm for retailers.\u201d He contrasted annual consumer prices index inflation of 11.1% in October and a forecast of a long recession with the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts in February, which showed a peak of only 7% and suggested the economy would continue to grow. \u201cFor many retailers, they\u2019re caught out with too much stock,\u201d he said. \u201cDemand has taken a significant hit and inflation has risen much more quickly than expected. \u201cBlack Friday is a chance to turn that stock into cash,\u201d he added. M&amp;S has been forced to ask suppliers to postpone deliveries to its warehouses and has delayed finalising orders for next year, the Sunday Times first reported. M&amp;S has also discounted some coats, jackets and boots. A spokesperson for M&amp;S said: \u201cSector-wide, lead times are normalising post-Covid and this means, like other retailers, we are having to readjust stock flow.\u201d The industry had been expecting \u201cmore of a muted Black Friday in the context of a cost of living crisis\u201d, Lim said, suggesting \u201cpolarised\u201d spending patterns are likely. Those households with means will bring forward purchases, while others will be forced to concentrate on essentials, he said. Data from Springboard, which tracks shopper numbers, showed a noticeable bump in traffic in the UK on Black Friday. Shopper numbers rose by 12% compared with the week before, and were 9% higher than on Black Friday 2021. However, they remained 19% lower than in 2019. Footfall only increased \u201cvery marginally\u201d on Saturday, up 0.9% compared with the week before. Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s insights director, said she did not expect significantly higher traffic in shops on Monday. Separate data from Sensormatic showed UK footfall across all retailers rose 3.7% on Black Friday compared with last year, but still down by 21% on pre-pandemic levels. The picture was complicated by the football World Cup, with Wales and England both playing on Friday. While neither game offered a huge deal of excitement for fans, they \u201cprovided a welcome boost to retail footfall\u201d, said Andy Sumpter, a consultant at Sensormatic."

            "content": "UK food price inflation hit a new high of 12.4% in November as the price of basics such as eggs, dairy products and coffee shot up. Fresh foods led the increase in prices \u2013 with inflation rising to 14.3% from 13.3% in October \u2013 with rises expected to continue into next year according to the latest data from the British Retail Consortium trade body, which represents most big retailers, and the market research firm NielsenIQ. Overall shop price inflation rose to 7.4% in November from 6.6% in the previous month, a level not seen since at least 2005, as items such as sports equipment also jumped in price. The rise in the cost of essentials is likely to hit poorer households hardest, many of which are already struggling with higher energy bills, as they have fewer options to make cut backs and savings. Those on higher incomes are able to offset inflation, to some extent, by reining in spending on non-essentials such as meals out and holidays and switching to cheaper products, by shopping at the discounters such as Aldi and Lidl or buying the big supermarkets\u2019 own-label goods. Retail bosses said the cost of Christmas would be higher this year despite a wave of discounts aimed at encouraging an uptick in spending during the final month of the year when most businesses make the majority of profits. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cWinter looks increasingly bleak as pressures on prices continue unabated. Food prices have continued to soar, especially for meat, eggs and dairy, which have been hit by rocketing energy costs, and rising costs of animal feed and transport. \u201cCoffee prices also shot up on last month as high input costs filtered through to price tags. Christmas gifting is also set to become more expensive than in previous years, with sports and recreation equipment seeing particularly high increases.\u201d Dickinson said cost pressures for retailers may ease next year, reducing pressure on prices for shoppers, but she said: \u201cChristmas cheer will be dampened this year as households cut back on seasonal spending in order to prioritise the essentials.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-30T14:00:18Z",
            "content": "This week the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, apologised to people who listened to the RBA\u2019s statements on future rate rises. The worry now is that he will have to come back next year and apologise for raising rates longer than he should have. You know the feeling \u2013 you\u2019ve had a wonderful meal, you feel good and then you think, \u201cOh just one more piece\u201d. You quickly realise that was a bad choice. Just one extra bite took you from replete to sickly-stuffed. Right now, the Reserve Bank is trying to work out if it needs to take another few bites or has it (and more importantly, Australian households) had enough. In the past inflation was only measured every quarter but fortunately the Bureau of Statistics has begun measuring it monthly. This gives us (and the RBA, which meets next week to decide if it should raise rates) a quicker idea of what is going on. The ABS estimates that in October annual inflation slowed, from 7.3% to 6.9%. This was well below estimates and marked four months where inflation has hovered around 7%. It suggests that inflation might have peaked: If the graph does not display click here Next Wednesday, the day after the RBA makes its decision, the September quarter GDP figures are released, which will provide more information \u2013 not just about prices, but whether the economy is slowing. Most importantly for the Reserve Bank it will provide information about how households are travelling. We already have some signs that people are starting to feel the pinch. On Monday the ABS revealed that, rather unexpectedly, we spent less money in shops in October than we did in September. The fall wasn\u2019t that massive \u2013 down 0.2%, and we still spent about 12.5% more than we did in October 2021. If the graph does not display click here But it was significant because as prices are rising, it means the number of things we bought (or the \u201cvolume\u201d) fell quite significantly. We got some indication this was happening from the most recent quarterly figures which, unlike the monthly ones, count the volume of spending as well as the actual cash amount. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup For example, the dollar amount we spent on household goods (furniture, hardware and white goods) continued to grow. But the volume of those items has fallen for three quarters and is now below the level it was in the June 2020 quarter. If the graph does not display click here This is important because household consumption makes up around 55% of the size of economy and in the past year has been responsible for around 85% of the entire growth of the economy. If household consumption slows, so does the economy. And while retail spending is only a part of total household consumption (for example, it doesn\u2019t include rent, electricity or health), the two measures do move in sync: If the graph does not display click here The problem is the September GDP figures won\u2019t include the impact of the October or November rates rises, and not even the full impact from the September increase. That combined represents 100 of the 275 basis points rate increase since April. But another problem with interest rates is that they actually take a while to affect all mortgage holders. Banks notoriously raise rates very quickly when the RBA increases the cash rate, but that applies to new home loans. The rates for existing mortgages generally take a little longer to go up (but go up they do!). Generally, the average interest rate for all mortgage holders is lower than the advertised rates for new loans. And because people can change loans to seek a better deal, the average rate for mortgage holders generally goes up more slowly: If the graph does not display click here In September the average interest rate being paid by all mortgage holders was 4.04%, compared with the average discounted rate of 5.70%. More crucially, the average rate for existing loans had only risen 141 points from April to September compared with a 225 point rise in the discounted rate. Now don\u2019t celebrate too soon \u2013 those rates will keep rising, as the impact of the September, October and November rates rises flow through. Even if the RBA stops raising the cash rate now, mortgage rates for most people will still be likely to rise in the future. And that means any more rate rises might be working to stop spending that has already stopped Because the rate rises have already been significant. Monthly repayments for a $500,000 loan at the average rate have gone from $2,010 in April to $2,399 in September and are likely to rise at least another $90 or so to take into account the latest rate rises. If the graph does not display click here That is a 19% increase in interest rate payments to September, and if we conservatively add another 30 basis points on to the average mortgage rate, it means at least a 26% increase in the amount households pay each month compared with April. That is a massive impost and not surprisingly is seeing a decline in the growth of new mortgages but also a drop in the number of things we are buying. The signs are around that the rate rises have already had a big impact and inflation may have peaked. The RBA needs to watch that it does not overdo the rate rises and go from delivering a good economy that leaves us satisfied to one that has us feeling very sick. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

The inquiry heard on Tuesday that Jones had met with several colleagues from within the Department of Social Services to discuss the DHS plan. In an October 2014 email summary of a meeting, Jones and his colleagues agreed the proposal did not \u201caccord\u201d with the legislation and they could \u201cnot see how such [debt] decisions could be defended in a tribunal or court\u201d. Jones told the royal commission he provided the damning legal and policy advice to Andrew Whitecross, who the inquiry heard was then acting group manager of social security policy at DSS. It is unclear who else outside the team in which Jones was part of had seen the legal or policy advice. DSS lawyer Anne Pulford, who was involved in drafting the legal advice, will give evidence on Wednesday. Despite the misgivings with the Department of Social Services in late 2014, costings spruiking the financial benefits of the plan were worked up earlier the following year. Jones said he did not know why these were created given the damning and legal policy advice held by DSS. Asked by the royal commissioner Catherine Holmes why he did not say anything to his superiors at DSS when it was clear the flawed proposal was going ahead, Jones said he was \u201cquite way down the chain\u201d. He said: It\u2019s not my role to raise [with superiors] a policy issue that\u2019s being pursued by another department. It was a proposal being put \u2026 together by the Department of Human Services. And I don\u2019t know their full justifications for pursuing it. I can indicate that I think it delivered savings \u2026 at a time we were trying to develop savings with the new government. The inquiry continues. 2/2 Royal commission hears some staff believed robodebt plan could not be \u2018defended in tribunal or court\u2019 Some staff at the Department of Social Services believed the proposal for what became the robodebt scheme could not be \u201cdefended in tribunal or court\u201d and could deny welfare recipients \u201cnatural justice\u201d, according to an email aired at the royal commission. The inquiry, which has been mired in legal argument over the release of documents, late on Tuesday heard evidence from Mark Jones, who was an official at the Department of Social Services. Jones worked in the payment review and debt strategy team at the Department of Social Services until May 2015, shortly before the robodebt scheme was implemented. The royal commission heard the proposal for the robodebt scheme came from the Department of Human Services (DHS), which was then responsible for Centrelink, and was the junior department under the Department of Social Services. It heard the proposal was met with opposition from junior and mid-level officials within Department of Social Services, including Jones. He had been asked by his superiors to obtain legal and policy advice from within the Department of Social Services following the DHS proposal. That advice, the royal commission heard on Monday, cast serious doubt on the legality of the robodebt proposal. 1/2 Consumer confidence in decline as interest rates rise From AAP: An unexpected surge in inflation is weighing heavily on consumers and pushing confidence towards pandemic lows. The Reserve Bank\u2019s delivery of a 25 basis point rate hike for November, taking the cash rate to a nine-year high of 2.85%, will likely weaken consumer confidence further. Consumer confidence has fallen for a fifth week in a row to levels last seen during the early Covid-19 lockdowns. The 1.5% decline in the weekly ANZ/Roy Morgan index followed the September quarter consumer price index print that surpassed expectations to hit 7.3% annually. The surprisingly high inflation figure pushed the \u201cweekly inflation expectations\u201d subindex up 6.6%. Other subindices of the confidence gauge were mixed, with \u201ctime to buy a major household item\u201d climbing 2.7% after three weeks of declines. \u2018Current financial conditions\u2019 fell 2.9% and \u2018future financial conditions\u2019 slid 4.2%. ANZ economist David Plank said expectations of future rate rises were reflected in the 15.6% decline in confidence among people paying off a mortgage. \u201cCost of living concerns, along with expectations of more rate hikes by the RBA, have caused confidence to decline to levels last seen during the early weeks of the Covid lockdowns,\u201d he said. We have a bit more from AAP on the latest flood warnings for NSW Evacuations have been ordered and a series of road and bridge closures are also likely. In Adelong, the main street is under water and residents in adjoining streets have been ordered to leave. An evacuation order has also been issued for Tumut caravan park on the Tumut River amid rapidly rising waters and the threat of flash flooding. Cowra caravan park on the Lachlan River is also under evacuation orders. Major flooding is again likely along the Castlereagh, Gwydir, Namoi and Macquarie rivers after recent rain. The BoM also expects major flooding on the Bogan River. There are 90 SES hazard warnings current for NSW. They include evacuation orders for residents along the Murray River at Willow Bend, Moama and Mathoura. After some sunshine to round off October, the state faces another rainy month as temperatures drop, the BoM says. Showers and thunderstorms were forecast across most areas on Tuesday, with creeks and rivers likely to rise rapidly as rain falls on already saturated or flooded catchments. The cold front sweeping Australia\u2019s southeast will bring chilly temperatures, showers and alpine snow until midweek - all of which are unseasonal for November. Above-median rainfall is forecast for most of eastern Australia over the next two weeks, increasing to very likely (more than 80% chance) for the northeast and far southeastern mainland.

The area is home to a colony of koalas and University of NSW scientists recently raised concerns that the vibrations caused during the exploration process could negatively affect research underway on the efficacy of vaccines used to treat chlamydia in the endangered animals. Mullaley Gas and Pipeline Accord spokesperson Margaret Fleck said the government\u2019s decision showed it was paving the way for Santos to drill across the world renowned foodbowl of the Liverpool Plains: Santos was never going to stop with 850 gaswells in the Pilliga - the very nature of the coal seam gas beast is that these companies need to drill thousands of wells in order to make a it worthwhile - just look at the pockmarked farmland of inland Queensland. Meanwhile, farms sink due to CSG induced subsidence, groundwater is drained and placed at risk of contamination, and both people and animals like the koala suffer due to the industry\u2019s greed. We will face problems even at this early stage of exploration. Seismic testing is a disruptive process that involves ongoing vibration that will be felt in the homes of people who live along the route. This approval is of course disappointing, but the Perrottet Government has clearly underestimated farmers in this part of the world. We fought off Shenhua, we have fought off gas companies before, and we have no plans to roll over and let Santos trash the food and fibre powerhouse of the Liverpool Plains. We stopped Santos in their tracks just over a decade ago and we are determined to do it again. NSW emergency services searching for two men missing in floodwaters, more rain forecast From AAP: The search continues for two men missing in NSW floodwaters, evacuations are again at play in a series of communities in the state\u2019s south and yet more rain is on the way. The pair are thought to have been riding in the back of a utility swept off the road while being driven across a flooded causeway near the South West Slopes town of Boorowa on Monday night. Police say two others in the cab were able to free themselves and get to safety. The search was briefly paused in the early hours of Tuesday morning but was ongoing in the afternoon. Further west where Muttama Creek divides the Riverina centre of Cootamundra, residents have been directed to emergency accommodation at the local showgrounds, with dangerous flash flooding a concern. Local member and NSW emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, told the ABC the order was for 10 streets and about 100 homes. \u201cThe weather event we saw come through from late yesterday afternoon and overnight has really caused some substantial damage and wreaked havoc right across the region,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time since we\u2019ve seen flooding hit the town in the way that it did last night and so people were having to work closely with the SES.\u201d The Murrumbidgee River at nearby Gundagai exceeded major flood levels (8.5m) on Tuesday afternoon, rising more than 2.5m in 24 hours. The Bureau of Meteorology warns it could be the area\u2019s worst flood since 1989. Australian survivor of Seoul crowd blames loss of 151 lives on officials\u2019 failure to control crowd From the Associated Press: An Australian survivor of a crowd crush that killed more than 150 partygoers in the South Korean capital of Seoul blamed the huge loss of life on officials\u2019 failure to employ effective crowd controls despite anticipating a massive turnout for the Halloween celebrations. Nathan Taverniti, 24, said he\u2019s still grappling with shock after one of his friends, Grace Rached, died during the tragedy on Saturday in the nightlife district of Itaewon. Stuck in a huge crowd, Taverniti said he didn\u2019t sense that something terrible would happen until some women near him apparently slipped and fell down, and people nearby tried to help them back up. By that time, he could no longer see where his three friends were. \u201cAll of a sudden more people started falling there were just too many people,\u201d he said. He said he thought he saw some of his friends\u2019 hands among the people who were piling up. He tried to grab them, but had to let go after being crushed by the enormous weight of other people who were losing balance. He said he heard \u201clots of people screaming\u201d. Taverniti said he shouted to the bars and clubs to open their doors to let some people in to ease the crowd, but that nobody listened. He said several police officers arrived about half an hour later and people in the crowd helped pull out those who were injured before more officers arrived later. He later found one of his friends among the rows of unconscious bodies laid out in the pavement. \u201cI believe 100% that this incident is a result of the government\u2019s mismanagement and the lack of ability because I have known that Halloween event has always been this big in Itaewon,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year there was clearly not enough police presence.\u201d Queensland dugong survey starts James Cook University scientists are in the air this week kicking off a critical Queensland-wide dugong population survey \u2013 counting dugongs along 2000 kilometres of coastline in under two months. Like a census, the surveys are conducted over an intense period every five years to get a snapshot of dugongs and calves\u2019 populations, from Cape York to Moreton Bay. JCU TropWATER\u2019s Chris Cleguer said Australia is home to the largest dugong population in the world, and the surveys are critical for monitoring trends in abundance and distribution: These aerial surveys have been conducted for more than 30 years and are essential in not only estimating the current dugong population size but also mapping where dugongs are more or less abundant. There are concerns about the decline in dugongs across the urban coast of the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 this year\u2019s surveys will give us the opportunity to understand the extent of this. Hervey Bay to the south of the Great Barrier Reef, a known hot spot for dugongs, is an area of concern following a major loss of seagrass habitat earlier this year. The seagrass loss resulted from two flood events, which smothered the seagrass and destroyed the dugongs\u2019 main food source, Cleguer said. The surveys will help us to determine how many dugongs currently are in Hervey Bay and the Great Sandy Strait as well as understanding their large-scale movements. It is possible the dugongs have moved in search of seagrass to other nearby key habitats such as Gladstone to the north or Moreton Bay to the south. Employer group calls on Tony Burke to exempt some firms from multi-employer pay deals The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, Andrew McKellar, has met the workplace relations minister Tony Burke today, putting employers\u2019 case that small and medium-sized businesses should be exempted from some of the changes expanding multi-employer pay deals. The bill contains two streams of multi-employer bargaining: The \u201csupported\u201d stream for workers in sectors such as community services, cleaning, and early childhood education, from which small businesses are not exempted; and The \u201csingle-interest\u201d stream, which does include a safeguard that small businesses cannot be compelled to bargain together without their consent, even if their employees vote for it. McKellar told Guardian Australia that ACCI \u201cput forward an argument that the threshold for small business should be much higher than 15 employees\u201d. If ACCI had its way small and medium-sized businesses could opt out of the single-interest stream, meaning businesses with up to 200 employees. McKellar said employers \u201cdon\u2019t have a problem with the supported stream\u201d, formerly known as the low paid bargaining stream. But they are \u201cnot comfortable\u201d and believe the single-interest stream \u201cgoes too far\u201d and opens a \u201ccan of worms\u201d with \u201cno clear boundary\u201d. McKellar nominated sectors like retail, manufacturing and transport as those that could be affected. ACCI also wants the test for whether a majority of employees support bargaining together in the single-interest stream to require \u201cmajority support in all businesses that would be involved in any agreement not just an overall majority\u201d. When employers\u2019 enterprise agreements expire, they should have a \u201cperiod of grace\u201d to negotiate a new deal before being included in multi-employer bargaining, McKellar said. McKellar said that David Pocock\u2019s proposal to split the bill \u201cis a sensible one\u201d because it \u201cwould allow the government to secure the key measures that it wants\u201d this year, and save debate on more controversial measures for next year. But Burke isn\u2019t a fan. He told ABC TV: The problem there is a contentious [area], multi-employer bargaining, is a measure that precisely will get wages moving, and if you look at the areas of the economy that had been crying out for this the most it is areas like childcare, cleaning, areas like aged care, we are talking about those feminised sections of the economy, not especially militant, not areas of the economy that have done well out of bargaining over the last decade, they are the ones that have been crying out for multi-employer bargaining. The Victorian election campaign even stops, sort of. Support for for national First Nations arts and culture body Fake art, cultural appropriation, and the need to protect the intellectual property of art are among the reasons Australia needs a national First Nations arts and culture body, a report has found. The Australia Council released the report, Bringing it forward, at the Purrumpa conference in Adelaide this morning. A national body could help with intellectual property issues for First Nations artists, including ways to fight back against imitators, such as a trademark. Those consulted had some concerns about how a national body would work, such as potential duplication of services, and how power and authority would be used, but the report found overall there was \u201csubstantial agreement\u201d that such a body was needed. It found: Many participants spoke of the national body as an agile \u2018facilitator\u2019, \u2018coordinator\u2019, \u2018connector\u2019 or \u2018go to\u2019 referral agency which could work both ways: acting as portal to First Nations arts and culture for industry and government; and helping First Nations artists to navigate existing networks and services and have their voices heard nationally. The proposed First Nations owned, led and run national body has the working title of the National Indigenous Arts and Cultural Authority (Niaca). Jones says energy policy will reflect country\u2019s needs Stephen Jones would not say whether we could expect an announcement on energy policy next week when parliament resumes. The assistant treasurer said: This is going to be determined \u2026 by the needs of Australian households and businesses, not the politics of parliament next week. You can be guarantee that the sooner we get these things knocked into shape, we\u2019ll be wanting to go out to the Australian people, because they deserve certainty. So do the businesses, by the way, and the energy generators that are trying to lock in gas contracts at the moment. It is in the interests of everybody that we get this right \u2026 that we get this done as soon as possible. Assistant treasurer swipes at Angus Taylor The assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, is up next on ABC Afternoon Briefing and takes aim at the claim from the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, that the Labor government doesn\u2019t have a plan to address the cost of living crisis. When asked whether households are currently having to bear the burden through the interest rate increase and other cost increases, Jones said: Can I put it to you like this: in budgets we have two choices. We can bring a meltdown on Australian households by cutting all the services and the expenditure \u2013 should we [start] with healthcare or medicine? Start with aged care, childcare? Where would the opposition or others like us to start? Or we could have a gentle part to ensure that over time we are bringing inflation down, not adding to the pressure; keeping a lid on spending, which is exactly what we have done. If Angus thinks we should be going further, he should say exactly how, because two days ago his boss stood up and gave the big tick to all the initiatives we have had in our budget. Mixed reaction to RBA rate rise Post 2 of 2 The ANZ, too, has retained its \u201cterminal\u201d RBA rate forecast at 3.85% after today\u2019s hike. David Plank, ANZ\u2019s head of Australian economics, said: The RBA\u2019s updated forecasts have inflation above the top of its target band [of 2%-3%] for more than three full years, i.e. beyond the end of 2024. This must pose some risk to medium-term inflation expectations, and the possibility that they become unanchored. We\u2019ll get to see more of the RBA\u2019s thinking, including its precise forecast for how high inflation will go when it releases its quarterly statement on monetary policy on Friday. Analysts will be on alert to see how the updated forecasts compare with those supplied in the federal budget released by treasurer Jim Chalmers just a week ago. The latter had CPI peaking at 7.75% and today Lowe has it reaching \u201caround 8%\u201d. Given the government has dispensed with the traditional December release of a \u201cmid-year economic and fiscal outlook\u201d because of its budget \u201cre-do\u201d, we probably won\u2019t see government adjustments until its next budget in May. (Unless, of course, the news is really good, such as higher revenue from elevated commodity prices.) More of the story is told here: Tony Burke says he doesn\u2019t want jobs bill delayed The employment minister, Tony Burke, is speaking on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing about the Guardian Australia report from late last week suggesting the Senate crossbench wanted more time to examine the secure jobs, better pay bill. Crossbench members wanted a Senate committee deadline extended into early next year from mid-November this year, but was rebuffed by the government. Burke said he was keen to provide whatever assistance possible to senators on the detail, but says he didn\u2019t want to delay: So for the senators that are quite reasonably saying they want to make sure they can get across the detail, I want to provide whatever assistance we can, and helping them get across the detail. But certainly, I don\u2019t want for the families and households who are saying, wages aren\u2019t keeping up, I don\u2019t want to be in a world where we are awaiting a day longer than we have to in getting wages moving in Australia. He said it was not his starting point in negotiating with the crossbench to split the bill into different parts. He also said he wasn\u2019t going to be intimidated by a reported $20m ad campaign from employer groups against the bil. If they think they can simply buy advertising space and we will suddenly turn a blind eye to households, with wages not keeping up with standards of living, then they just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening around every kitchen table in Australia. As a sign some punters were betting on a larger rate rise, the Aussie dollar gave up some of its early gains for the day, easing to about US64.25c from 64.4c prior to the RBA news. Stocks went the other way \u2013 also modestly \u2013 with the ASX200 benchmark share index cantering to a 1.1% gain for the day. Just before the rate decision landed, it was up just a tad under 1%. The Greens finance spokesman, Senator Nick McKim, said, however, that the inflation was triggered \u201cby a pandemic, war and climate breakdown, and fuelled by corporate profiteering\u201d. The Albanese government should not be putting up with the series of rate hikes. McKim said: The RBA should have stopped rate rises months ago and should not have put them up today. And the government needs to get into the game instead of watching from the sidelines. McKim, hailing from Tasmania, might be able to address his concerns directly if he attends a dinner speech planned by RBA governor Philip Lowe tonight in Hobart. Others, such as Brendan Rynne, KPMG\u2019s chief economist, think the RBA is fully aware that there is a time lag between the rise in official interest rates and the hike being passed onto borrowers. (The full effect can be out to two years, Lowe has said.) Rynne said: Continuing to rapidly push the cash rate above the neutral rate [of about 2.5%] reduces the likelihood of ensuring the economy is kept on an even keel during a period of contractionary monetary policy. KPMG has left its forecast for a peak RBA rate of 3.35% unchanged. Post 1 of 2 New ABC studio in Parramatta will not cost taxpayers extra, David Anderson says The ABC will set up a state-of-the-art studio in Parramatta at no extra cost to the taxpayer, ABC managing director David Anderson has told a parliamentary committee. Anderson told the public works committee: The decision to establish a new bureau in Parramatta and relocate up to 300 ABC staff from Ultimo to Parramatta was therefore an obvious step for us. Today we are here to talk about boosting the ABC\u2019s presence and effectiveness in greater western Sydney. With 2.6 million people, greater western Sydney is Australia\u2019s fastest growing region. The ABC has of course always had a western Sydney presence, but the growth of the region and its increasing significance means there is a compelling case to make this even bigger. The move will be paid for by the recent sale for $88m of an ABC studio in Artarmon. Anderson said the ABC had hired 60 new journalists in rural and regional towns on the back of commercial agreements with Google and Facebook following the media bargaining code legislation. The Guardian has reported the ABC received $12m for its news content from the digital platforms. Taylor is asked if households should be offered some means-tested relief \u2013 he doesn\u2019t answer but says the Coalition had a great policy geared towards pensioners. This government could have gone with a full-blown policy that allowed pensioners to do extra work without losing 50 cents in the dollar of their pension. I mean, that helps pensioners and it takes pressure off inflation \u2013 it is dealing with the symptom and the source of. Taylor pans Labor\u2019s approach to gas Taylor said Labor needed to fix electricity prices by getting more gas out of the ground. You get there if your policy has failed. You look at Labor on energy and they still can\u2019t bring themselves to say we need to get more gas out from under the ground into the domestic network, because you\u2019ve got an energy minister who doesn\u2019t like the gas industry, has demonised it, has called it BS and fraud. Reporter: Isn\u2019t that a state issue? Taylor: Getting gas out from under the ground is something we always took responsibility for. We worked with the states to do energy deals, New South Wales to get Narrabri opened up. We argued and debated and fought the Victorian government on their moratorium. We worked closely with state governments who did want to get gas out from under the ground. We worked on the Beetaloo Basin. There\u2019s a number of initiatives there that Labor slashed in their budget, so you are not going to solve this problem without going to the underlying source, which is not enough supply going into the domestic network. Rod Sims put it very well just the other day when he said you have got to get more supply into the domestic network that will drive down the price. Labor is failing to do that. Now we are on to questions. He is asked what actual changes to the policy he would like to see. Taylor: We have always had budget balance, that is a part of a fiscal strategy, and it must be part of a fiscal strategy, but there were basic things that we suggested over recent months, like getting more pensioners into the workforce, and they went with a half-baked version of that. We don\u2019t need a toxic industrial relations culture when we are trying to ensure that we have a strong economy that will take pressure off interest rates and inflation, and yet they are rushing that \u2026 through parliament. Taylor says Labor\u2019s budget \u2018a missed opportunity\u2019 Taylor, the shadow treasurer, says the decision will exacerbate pocket pain for many Australians. He says there is no clear plan in the budget to help: Interest rate decisions by the Reserve Bank are of course made by the Reserve Bank, as it should be, but they are made within the context of government policy. And a great disappointment for so many Australians is that what we didn\u2019t see from the government last week in the budget is a clear and consistent plan that can take pressure off interest rates. It was a missed opportunity. The Labor government has put up the white flag when it comes to interest rates and inflation, and Australians will pay the price for that. I stood here now six times in a row since I became shadow treasurer, each time saying what we need from the government is a clear and comprehensive plan to take pressure off interest rates and the nation. And my hope, and I think many Australians\u2019 hope, is that we would see that in the budget. We clearly didn\u2019t \u2013 it was a missed opportunity. \u2018This is a challenging time for so many Australians\u2019 \u2013 Angus Taylor Taylor: This is the seventh increase in a row, and in fact since May. That means for a typical Australian household with a $750,000 mortgage, they will be paying $1,200 a month more than they were paying before. That is a very significant increase they are paying for their groceries, for other household goods, and for fuel and electricity bills, of course. So this is a challenging time for so many Australians. The Reserve Bank statement was sobering. It said that they expect inflation to continue to go up, to peak at 8%. That is an increase in what they had previously said, and they expect more interest rate increases to follow beyond today. We are now going to Angus Taylor, who is responding to the RBA decision. Treasurer says Plibersek did not raise stage-three tax cut concerns with him The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has indirectly responded to a Guardian Australia report that the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, expressed personal opposition to the stage-three tax cuts to a constituent at a public event on Saturday. Asked if Plibersek had raised any concerns with him about the income tax cuts, Chalmers replied: \u201cOn your second question \u2013 no.\u201d Plibersek\u2019s office declined to comment when contacted on Monday, and Plibersek doesn\u2019t appear to have had any public events or commented about it elsewhere today. Winning jockey says he feels \u2018like crying\u2019 as Gold Trip takes Cup Gold Trip made light of inclement weather and an early-morning attempt to sabotage the track to win the 162nd running of the Melbourne Cup, as unrestricted crowds returned to Flemington Racecoursr for the first time in three years. Emissary came in second, with High Emocean coming from last place to claim third. After just 10,000 spectators were allowed in a year ago due to Covid-19 restrictions \u2013 and none at all during the Victorian lockdown in 2020 \u2013 a sizeable but soggy crowd watched as Gold Trip, trained by Ciaron Maher and David Eustace, galloped to victory over the 3,200m course. Asked to try and put his feelings into words, winning jockey Mark Zahra said: I can\u2019t. I feel like crying. It\u2019s unbelievable. What a day. Torrential rain that fell on Melbourne earlier in the day cleared in time for the marquee event, but come the 3pm jump the track was hardly dry. A section of it near the 1,500m mark has also sustained damage in the early hours of Tuesday morning when protesters poured an unknown fluid onto the surface. The track was cleaned and repaired before being deemed fit to race on. Police say they are investigating the incident. The field for the $7.75m race had been reduced to 22 starters after Lunar Flare \u2013 the offspring of 2013 Cup winner Fiorente \u2013 failed a veterinary examination and joined Point Nepean as a late scratching. And the Cup top three: 1. Gold Trip 2. Emissary 3. High Emocean Gold Trip is victorious at this year\u2019s Melbourne Cup. Wages, companies\u2019 pricing behaviour key to how far RBA moves Australia was the first major nation to reduce the pace of interest rate rises in October when the Reserve Bank went with a 25bp hike after four 50bp rises in a row. And, of course, they\u2019ve stuck to this moderate course this month. (The US Fed is expected to go again with a 75bp rise this week.) What might tilt the bank to go harder again? Well, despite more than a year of wages increasing at a slower pace than inflation, this aspect of the economy is clearly in the RBA\u2019s sights, as is the behaviour of companies in jacking up prices. Governor Philip Lowe said: Wages growth is continuing to pick up from the low rates of recent years, although it remains lower than in many other advanced economies. A further pick-up is expected due to the tight labour market and higher inflation. (The jobless rate remains at near half-century lows of 3.5%.) Lowe said: Given the importance of avoiding a prices-wages spiral, the board will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms in the period ahead. With today\u2019s back-to-back quarter point increases in the cash rate, the Reserve Bank signalled that it wasn\u2019t overly spooked by the September quarter CPI said. The lift to 2.85% comes just over six months after the RBA started hiking during the federal election campaign, when the cash rate was at a record low of 0.1%. (Seems like a long time ago.) That 275 basis point increase now matches the previous record spate of rate rises during five meetings in the second half of 1994. What\u2019s clear, though, is the RBA isn\u2019t done, particularly as inflation still hasn\u2019t stopped its ascent. Philip Lowe, the RBA governor, said: A further increase in inflation is expected over the months ahead, with inflation now forecast to peak at around 8% later this year. Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case. Here\u2019s what it means for borrowers: More to follow Inflation is \u2018No 1 focus of the government\u2019 \u2013 Chalmers The message Chalmers is delivering is clear: everything will get more expensive before it gets less. Higher inflation and higher interest rates coming with it means that the pressure is coming on Australians from around the world, that it\u2019s felt around the kitchen table. That\u2019s precisely why we took difficult decisions in the budget, showed spending restraint, put a premium on what\u2019s responsible and affordable and sustainable. As today\u2019s decision has shown, inflation is the No 1 challenge in our economy. It\u2019s the No 1 focus of the government. It\u2019s the No 1 focus when it comes to the budget that we handed down last week. Inflationary pressures \u2018will get a little bit worse before they get better\u2019 Chalmers says this is why the budget focuses on bringing inflation down: It\u2019s more important than ever that the budget is responsible, restrained and right for the times. And that\u2019s what our budget is. We knew when we put the budget together that inflation was high and rising, and that was bringing with it higher interest rates. And that was putting additional pressure on Australians with a mortgage. This is precisely why the budget was designed \u2013 for dealing with these inflationary pressures, which will get a little bit worse before they get better, but they will get better in time. Inflation is economy\u2019s \u2018biggest challenge\u2019 \u2013 Treasurer Chalmers says the RBA expects inflation to peak at 8% towards the end of the year. The Treasury\u2019s expectation is more like 7.75%, but they have always said that the risks when it comes to inflation are on the upside, given what\u2019s happening in energy markets as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and given the upward pressure on grocery prices brought about by flooding of some of the prime farmland in eastern Australia, in particular. This is exactly why inflation is the biggest challenge in our economy. Treasurer on interest rate rise Treasurer Jim Chalmers is talking now: This is another difficult day for Australians, who are already under the pump. This means Australians with a mortgage will have to find that little bit extra in their monthly budget to accommodate these interest rate rises. This is about another $50 a month on an average outstanding balance of $330,000. It\u2019s about an extra $75 a month for a $500,000 mortgage. Australia\u2019s interest rates have risen for a record seventh time in as many months, with the Reserve Bank hiking its key rate by 25 basis points to 2.85% Economists had mostly expected a quarter-point increase after the September quarter consumer price index rose more than expected to 7.3%, a 32-year high. More to follow Dutton targets Labor on cost of living In contrast, opposition leader Peter Dutton has also been running paid ads on cost of living, spending up to $400 to boost posts about rising household expenses and pouring scorn on Labor\u2019s economic record. On 29 October the Liberal leader paid to boost a post claiming \u201cyou are never better off when Labor has its hands on the budget\u201d, and a second one talking about \u201cincreasing financial pressures \u2013 in your mortgage repayments, insurance premiums, visits to the supermarket, filling-up at the petrol station and especially in your power bills\u201d. (Don\u2019t forget that the Reserve Bank started lifting official interest rates in May, under the former Coalition government, and that the Labor government has been excoriating the Coalition for delaying a report that power prices were set to rise until after the May election.) The second ad features a graphic of Dutton giving his budget reply speech, featuring the caption: \u201cYou have every right to be anxious and disappointed, the Prime Minister has broken faith with you.\u201d Dutton is overwhelmingly targeting those Facebook ads at men and older women aged above 55; female voters under that age made up just 14% of the audience for the \u201cnever better off\u201d ad, and just 22% of the \u201cincreasing financial pressures\u201d ad. Of course it\u2019s not just the party leaders tipping cash into Facebook coffers. Coalition MP Jason Wood paid under $100 to boost an ad calling the budget a \u201cdumpster fire\u201d to around 5,000 people last week, while Labor MP Libby Coker also dropped less than $100 to promote a post saying the government \u201care going to do fantastic things\u201d to around 2,000 people. New Liberal MP Zoe McKenzie spent under $200 to boost an ad calling it \u201ca pretty terrible budget\u201d for regional Australia, while Labor senator Karen Grogan reached less than 1,000 people with a $100 ad saying \u201cwomen are front and centre of Labor\u2019s first budget\u201d. Post 2 of 2 What politicians boost on social media You can often tell a lot about politicians from which posts they pay to boost on social media. While it\u2019s usually not hard to figure out which messages they\u2019re wanting to drive home or which voting demographics they\u2019re trying to activate, the posts they pay to show up more in your news feeds give us even more indication of which messages they think are winners and which voters they\u2019re trying to reach. For instance, Anthony Albanese has just boosted his very first Facebook ad since winning the top job in May, paying for an ad asking Australians to \u201cfollow my page for more updates on how we\u2019re tackling the cost of living.\u201d The boost, which was supported by less than $100 in paid advertising and ran for only one day on Monday, came just a week after the federal budget \u2013 which the federal opposition and some media commentators have criticised for not doing more to help cost of living pressures. The ad was accompanied by a photo of the prime minister wearing a hard hat on a construction site, with the caption: \u201cIn Labor\u2019s first budget we\u2019re building more affordable housing.\u201d It reached less than 4000 people, and Facebook ad library data shows it was targeted slightly more toward middle-aged and older women. It\u2019s only small money, and the ad ran only for a day, but it\u2019s interesting in that it\u2019s the very first ad Albanese has paid to boost since becoming PM. Post 1 of 2 Hello everyone \u2013 this is Cait Kelly. First up a big thank you to Natasha for the morning. She leaves big shoes to fill as always. We are set for a busy afternoon with the RBA announcement on interest rates due at 2.30 pm followed by the Cup, with the race at 3 pm. Let\u2019s get into it! That\u2019s it from me, as I hand the blog over to the delightful Cait Kelly. See you tomorrow! Deployment of bombers part of \u2018longstanding\u2019 cooperation with Australia, US embassy says The US embassy in Canberra has shared a bit more information with Guardian Australia about how the US deployment of the nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to Australia came about. At the Australia\u2013US Ministerial Consultations (Ausmin) last year, the two nations committed to: Enhanced air cooperation through the rotational deployment of US aircraft of all types in Australia and appropriate aircraft training and exercises. Establishing a combined logistics, sustainment and maintenance enterprise to support high-end war-fighting and combined military operations in the region. The spokesperson for the US embassy said: The US-funded airfield infrastructure projects at RAAF Base Tindal demonstrate US investment in and commitment to Australia and supports the rotational presence of a range of US aircraft in the Northern Territory, which is a longstanding feature of United States force posture cooperation with Australia. A wide range of US military aircraft, including B-52s and other bombers, have visited Australia to participate in joint exercises for years. As has been the case for several years, a wide range of aircraft, including strategic bombers like B-52s and B-2s, will continue to visit Australia for joint exercises with Australia and other partners and allies in the region under the United States force posture initiatives. Information about joint exercises, including media days and those open to the public, will be released closer to the start of each exercise. The spokesperson also said: The US-Australia alliance is an anchor for peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. The United States and Australia have a shared commitment to a region that is open, resilient and inclusive, and are committed to evolving the alliance to effectively respond to the strategic environment. Victoria Racing Club \u2018disappointed\u2019 by sludge dump on Flemington track The Victoria Racing Club has released a statement following the dumping of sludge at Flemington racecourse early this morning. A spokesperson said the club was \u201cdisappointed by the actions of protesters, who caused some minor damage to the racetrack early this morning\u201d. Protesters poured an unknown fluid onto the surface of the track near the 1500m area. The track was immediately cleaned and repaired. Stewards deemed the track to be safe and there was no impact to racing. Police are investigating the incident. An individual who claimed responsibility for the incident issued a media release to Extinction Rebellion, claiming the action was to highlight problem gambling. Monique Ryan says stronger federal protection of native forests needed The independent member for Kooyong, Monique Ryan, has taken to social media to speak out against the logging of native wildlife habitat. Ryan began a tweet thread showing off some of her youngest constituents\u2019 entries into the Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s kids\u2019 wildlife art competition Wild At Art and took the occasion to reflect on her recent visit to Toolangi state forest. I visited Toolangi State forest to hear about the destruction of our precious Central Highlands rainforests by logging. This kind of logging destroys habitat for wildlife including increasing the threat to the already endangered Leadbeater\u2019s possum. The federal protection of native forests must be reconsidered before it\u2019s too late. What is the cash rate? And how is it different to interest rates? As Peter just told you, we\u2019re expecting a decision from the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s meeting, which will reveal how much the bank hikes its cash rate. Now the blog was very busy this morning so I was as guilty as anyone of throwing the term \u201ccash rate\u201d around, but you weren\u2019t alone if you were left scratching your head wondering \u2026 what exactly does that mean again? And how is it different to the interest rate? Luckily our wonderful multimedia team have you covered with a dedicated video explainer in Matilda Boseley\u2019s excellent news glossary series. About half an hour before a certain horse race in Melbourne, we\u2019ll get the Reserve Bank\u2019s latest decision on interest rates at 2.30pm AEDT. As noted in an earlier post, the surprisingly large CPI reading for the September quarter made a rise in the RBA\u2019s cash rate a better wager than anything on four legs today. The main tension is how high will it go. At the October meeting, the bank surprised most economists with a 25 basis-point increase that snapped a run of four \u201csuper-sized\u201d hikes of twice that in a row. In cutting the pace of rises, the RBA became the first central bank to ease back. But after the inflation jump (particularly for the underlying inflation rate \u2013 the trimmed mean \u2013 that the RBA watches closest), there\u2019s a chance of something larger than a quarter point today. A 40bp increase would split the difference, with the advantage of creating a neater number. A figure like 3% is a lot rounder than 2.85% or 3.1%, although aesthetics probably don\u2019t loom large in the minds of the RBA board. Either way, we\u2019ll be matching or exceeding the 275bp increase in the cash rate during the second half of 1994 in terms of the fastest tightening by the central bank. Analysts such as Catherine Birch, a senior economist with ANZ, will be alert to changes in the accompanying explanation by RBA governor Philip Lowe. Will it retain an emphasis about \u201ckeeping the economy on an even keel\u201d or revert to stronger language, such as the need to \u201cbring down inflation at all costs\u201d, which has been the tone of some overseas counterparts, Birch says. The ANZ and Westpac both pick the RBA rate peaking at 3.85% in the first half of 2023. For a typical owner-occupier paying principal and interest with 25 years on the $500,000 mortgage to go, the rate rises (assuming they are passed on) since May to the peak would add $1,059 more a month to repayments, RateCity says. Today\u2019s pain, in other words, is unlikely to be the last. Reporters battle wild weather at Flemington racecourse The Melbourne Cup is going ahead despite some pretty wild weather, including hail and strong winds, which has left one ABC reporter, Stephanie Ferrier, doing battle with her umbrella. Ferrier had earlier called the brolly the \u201cessential fashion accessory\u201d at this year\u2019s races while reporting on the unseasonable conditions: Today we are predicted to see the coldest Melbourne Cup Day since 1995, only getting up to a top of 14 degrees. There is now starting to feel that windchill factor as well that is so commonly known across Melbourne, unfortunately. Here comes the wind as well. And we are expecting a lot of those showers and potentially, as you said, even hail this afternoon. So, whether or not that actually happens at the running of the Melbourne Cup, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Many people are down here and the brolly this year is the essential fashion accessory. The former health minister Greg Hunt has confirmed that he has given evidence to Virginia Bell\u2019s inquiry into Scott Morrison\u2019s multiple ministries. Hunt told Sky News: We said at the time when we were asked \u2013 about a month ago \u2013 that we\u2019d respond, which we did, and dealt with that exactly in the terms. In fact, I was thanked by Virginia Bell for both the timeliness and the comprehensiveness of the response. Hunt said Morrison \u201cnever exercised\u201d and \u201cnever sought to exercise\u201d any of his powers in the health portfolio and \u201cnever even raised that option with me during the course of [the pandemic]\u201d. Asked why other ministers were not informed they shared their portfolios with Morrison, Hunt replied: Look, in terms of the other elements, that\u2019s not something which I have any knowledge. In terms of, you know, the public position, we\u2019ve shared the same advice with everybody, and that is it was done as a contingency. And the prime minister, when he announced the Biosecurity Act, announced that he was the co-holder of those powers under federal health. I\u2019m not sure what Hunt is referring to here. In the first instances the Biosecurity Act was used in March 2020, it was Hunt named as the decision-maker. Car washed down flooded creek near Adelong The NSW Rural Fire Service has shared images from the moment a car was washed down a creek near the township of Adelong. Adelong is one of five towns in NSW which are under emergency warnings to \u201cevacuate now\u201d due to flooding. Adelong\u2019s main street is under water and residents have been ordered to leave. An investigation is under way after an \u201cunknown substance\u201d was poured over the Flemington racecourse during a break-in this morning. Victoria police confirmed detectives from the investigations unit were looking into the incident after being informed a substance had been poured over a portion of the track about 6am. Extinction Rebellion has not claimed responsibility for the incident but said it had been \u201ccontacted by friends\u201d who alleged they dumped 1,000 litres of \u201coily sludge\u201d on to the racecourse. A lengthy media release was attached, issued by a \u201cproblem gambler\u201d who claimed responsibility for the incident. They said they were opposed to the \u201ctoxic industry\u201d of racing. The existence of this industry means that a select few get richer whilst normal punters go broke ... the Melbourne Cup is the super-spreader event for the virus of gambling addiction. Racing Victoria said it had assessed the track following notification of some damage to the surface at the 1,500 mark and deemed it safe for racing: Remedial work has been undertaken by Victoria Racing Club track staff. The track has been deemed safe for racing by RV stewards with no impact of the conduct on today\u2019s meeting. The Victoria Racing Club has been approached for comment. Rescue helicopter resupplies medicine to cut-off property near Gundagai Fears flooding has affected dugong numbers off Queensland Researchers from James Cook University are conducting a survey of dugong numbers off Queensland\u2019s coastline amid concerns the population has declined after recent flooding. The researchers are using cameras strapped to a lightweight aircraft to survey numbers between Cape York and Moreton Bay. One of the senior research officers, Dr Christophe Cleguer, spoke to ABC News about the problem: We are doing this survey now to find out how many there are and looking at potential impacts of recent floods. We\u2019ve had a lot of rain in Hervey Bay early this year and we\u2019ve got some reasons to think that dugongs might have moved from Hervey Bay as a result of a reduction in their seagrass habitat because they rely heavily on seagrass food, and so when seagrass starts to disappear, then dugong try to move in other places to find some food to eat. Cleguer said while the focus was \u201ccounting every single dugong\u201d, they would also count other marine megafauna sighted such as sea turtles, sharks, dolphins, whales and sea snakes. Victorian opposition promises $1m for energy battery storage for community groups Victoria\u2019s Coalition has pledged to give community groups access to grants of up to $1m for energy battery storage if it wins this month\u2019s state election. The pledge was made on Tuesday morning, as the state election campaign begins in earnest. The grants \u2013 accessible by sporting clubs, scouts halls and charities \u2013 would fall under a $100m net-zero renewable energy fund to install solar panels and big batteries. The Andrews government in September unveiled the country\u2019s largest energy storage targets in a bid to drive down household power bills. The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said the grants would give energy security to community groups. Batteries are a key part of that. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to have a plan that is sensible, realistic and reliable that keeps prices down. Across NSW, this is the current state of play when it comes to the weather. From AAP: The Bureau of Meteorology said the Murrumbidgee River at nearby Gundagai was likely to exceed the moderate flood level (7.6 metres) again this morning. It was expected to surpass 8.5m about midday and could reach 9.4m by tonight, bringing the town\u2019s worst floods since 1989. Evacuations have been ordered and a series of road and bridge closures are also likely. Downstream at Adelong, the main street is under water and residents in adjoining Selwyn and Tumut streets have been ordered to leave. An evacuation order has also been issued for Tumut Caravan Park on the swollen Tumut River amid rapidly rising waters and the threat of flash flooding. There are still more than 80 State Emergency Service hazard warnings current for NSW. They include evacuation orders for residents along the Murray River at Willow Bend, Moama and Mathoura. After some sunshine to round off October, the state faces another rainy month as temperatures drop, the BoM says. Showers and thunderstorms are forecast across most areas today, with creeks and rivers likely to rise rapidly as rain falls on already saturated or flooded catchments. Following the wet, cold air is likely to sweep Australia\u2019s south-east, bringing chilly temperatures, showers and alpine snow until midweek \u2013 all of which are unseasonal for November. More rain and possibly hail will hit western and southern NSW, with a severe thunderstorm warning for damaging winds and heavy falls for Nyngan, Cobar, Bourke, Wilcannia, White Cliffs and Ivanhoe. For the next fortnight, above median rainfall (more than 60% chance) is forecast for most of eastern Australia, increasing to very likely (more than 80% chance) for the north-east and far south-eastern mainland. Snow is possible around the central tablelands and a light dusting might fall around the northern tablelands. A search has been launched for two men missing in New South Wales flood waters, evacuations are again at play in a series of communities in the state\u2019s south and yet more rain is on the way. The two men are thought to have been riding in the back of a utility swept off the road while being driven across a flooded causeway near the South West Slopes town of Boorowa. Police say two others in the cab were able to free themselves and get to safety. Further west, where Muttama Creek divides the Riverina centre of Cootamundra, residents have been directed to emergency accommodation at the local showground with dangerous flash flooding a concern. Steph Cooke, the local member and NSW emergency services minister, told the ABC this morning the order was for 10 streets and about 100 homes. She said: The weather event we saw come through from late yesterday afternoon and overnight has really caused some substantial damage and wreaked havoc right across the region. It\u2019s a long time since we\u2019ve seen flooding hit the town in the way that it did last night and so people were having to work closely with the SES. \u2013 From AAP Officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PMC) revealed on Friday it had referred the possible leak of national security committee information to the authors of Plagued to the attorney general\u2019s department to consider whether \u201crelevant criminal provisions\u201d had been breached. Plagued, which was written by Simon Benson and Geoff Chambers and revealed how Scott Morrison appointed himself to multiple ministries in his government, also contains details of deliberations of Australia\u2019s national security committee of cabinet. A spokesperson for the Australian federal police told Guardian Australia: As of Monday 31 October 2022, the AFP has not received any complaint or report relating to this. On Friday the attorney general\u2019s department said it was \u201caware of allegations\u201d the book revealed details of cabinet deliberations and had provided advice to PMC \u201con the scope of offences that apply to the unauthorised disclosure of security classified information\u201d. A spokesperson said: The department is not an investigative agency and has not referred the matter to any other agency. So that seems like the end of the matter. Melbourne Cup draws animal rights criticism It\u2019s Melbourne Cup day in Victoria, but beyond fascinators and fashions on the field the \u201crace that stops the nation\u201d is drawing increased critique among animal rights groups and activists. A petition launched by the Animal Justice Party in NSW demanding an end to horse racing in the state ahead of the Cup has drawn 30,000 signatures online, trending with the hashtag #NupToTheCup. Yesterday, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (and the Coalition for the Protection of Racehourses converged on Flemington to hold a \u201cT-rex\u201d race in opposition to the Cup, stumbling towards a banner reading \u201cFinish the Cruel, Prehistoric Melbourne Cup Now\u201d. It comes as the latest Guardian Essential poll suggested almost half of those surveyed (45%) believe the race promotes \u201cunhealthy\u201d gambling behaviour, with a third (34%) saying it normalises animal cruelty. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said the social license of the racing industry was \u201cclearly fading\u201d. The majority of people actually agree that racing is cruel. You wouldn\u2019t know that, though, from the massive marketing campaigns from the racing and gambling industries that are designed to make events like the Melbourne Cup appear universally loved. The Melbourne Cup is the most lavish symbol of the gambling-fuelled animal cruelty of horse racing. It has to be challenged. Animal cruelty goes way beyond the Melbourne Cup \u2013 there are systemic and unfixable problems with racing. Not safe to return to Bogong Village Wiebusch\u2019s final update is that it\u2019s still not safe for residents of Bogong Village to return after a major landslip yesterday. Finally, we have an emergency warning: not safe to return for the Bogong Village. It was evacuated in the last 24 to 48 hours as a result of a major landslip \u2026 and it is impacting on the High Plains Road. The Bogong High Plains Road remains closed between Mount Beauty and Falls Creek at this time. Flood rescues ongoing in Victoria, with five in past day: SES Wiebusch says there have been \u201cfive flood rescues in the last 24 hours, predominantly with people attempting to drive through floodwaters\u201d. Major transport route reopened for Kerang Wiebusch: In good news, at Kerang we have seen the Murray Valley Highway reopened to the south, which means one of the major transport routes is now accessible back in and out of Kerang. However to the north and west and east, roads remain closed as a result of flooding. Swan Hill, Boundary Bend and Mildura brace for flooding Other Murray River communities are still bracing for flooding this coming week. Wiebusch says: The Murray River at Swan Hill is likely to reach a major flood level later this coming week at 4.6m, and the bureau is continuing to do modelling and monitor the gauges downstream of Echuca, for that flood peak, so at that stage 4.6 is the initial indication of it reaching major at Swan Hill. We have had SES volunteers, the rapid relief team, all working with local government and other community groups in and around Swan Hill with a major sandbagging effort and also door knocking. The key messages that the main town centre of Swan Hill is not at risk, it is those areas immediately in and around the Murray River that are at the risk of major flooding later this week. Murray River at Boundary Bend is likely to reach a 8.8m by this weekend into the early part of next week. Mildura at the Murray Weir is likely to reach a level of moderate flooding between the 10th and 12 November before it peaks at the end of November. By the flows on the Murray River, we still have a period of time ahead of us were those communities will be at risk of moderate to major flooding in the coming days. Echuca won\u2019t drop below major flood levels until early next week: SES Tim Wiebusch from Victorian SES has spoken about the northern Victorian town of Echuca which has been at major flood level since last week. We are still likely to see major flooding at Echuca well through to this coming weekend. It is currently at 94.81m, and indications are we won\u2019t see a drop below major until late on Sunday or into the early parts of next week does Echuca. Recent rainfall causing major to moderate flooding in Victoria Tim Wiebusch from Victorian SES has provided an update on how specific Victorian communities are faring: In the last 24 hours we have seen the Tallangatta Creek reach major flood level and has now receded to the moderate flood level, just as an example of very little rainfall \u2013 some 40-50 millimetres of rain \u2013 taking the creek up to flood level. Communities along the Murray River need to continue to remain alert to their conditions \u2026 On the Upper Murray we are likely to see moderate flooding at Jingellic overnight tonight, and that will flow through to Albury, Wodonga and down to Yarrawonga and Tocumwal where we could see the upper end of moderate flooding as a result of further releases coming out of the Hume and Khancoban Dams, and that is all a result of rainfall in the last 24-48 hours. On Monday the workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, said he would be \u201cdeeply reluctant\u201d to delay elements of Labor\u2019s secure jobs, better pay bill in response to a suggestion from David Pocock that the bill could be split to deal with non-controversial elements this year. The chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, has endorsed the idea. He told ABC News Breakfast: Well, look, I think that\u2019s a possibility. I mean, obviously, we want to have those discussions with the government. I\u2019m meeting with the minister later today, so there\u2019ll be a chance to put those ideas to him directly. Let\u2019s see what the government says. But what we\u2019ve got to do is I think is take the time on those other elements of the bill. We don\u2019t want to end up with unintended consequences that really could be very harmful to many smaller and medium-sized businesses. McKellar was also asked about the Australian Resources and Energy Employer Association\u2019s threat of a mining tax-style campaign against the IR bill. He said: Well, certainly, there are very deep concerns across many sectors in our economy. And the resources sector, mining, and energy, those are very important sectors in our economy with very big projects. So of course, yes, they are deeply concerned about what they\u2019re seeing. My concern is more for small and medium-sized businesses, family businesses and the like, where they can\u2019t afford to get wrapped up in this sort of regulation and additional red tape that\u2019s going to add to complexity and make it much harder for them to manage their businesses. That\u2019s where my main concern is. Dipping out of that Victorian presser for the latest in national politics \u2026 The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has warned the Senate crossbench the government is trying to rush its industrial relations legislation because it wants to \u201cpay back\u201d unions for their support. On Tuesday the Australian Resources and Energy Employer Association chief executive, Steve Knott, told the Australian there was \u201cwhite-hot anger\u201d among mining, oil, and gas companies about the bill and these employers had \u201csignificant capacity to fund a substantial campaign\u201d. Knott reportedly said: From my discussions, I have no doubt that unless the government slows down their plans to rush their initial bill through parliament before year\u2019s end and makes substantive changes, the broader employer community will be energised to run an anti-IR bill campaign that will dwarf the ACTU\u2019s Your Rights at Work campaign ... They would absolutely dwarf the WorkChoices campaign and they have the financial capacity to do it. It would be like the mining tax campaign but on steroids. That campaign cost about $20m. The industry has got a history of, when they\u2019ve been poked, they will respond and there are enough corporate guerrillas in the mining, oil and gas sector who have come to me and said this is not on. Knott called for the resources and energy sector to be carved out from proposed changes expanding multi-employer bargaining. Asked about the possible campaign on Sky News, Littleproud defended adverse reactions to a bill he argued amounted to \u201cpayback to unions for helping Labor get into government\u201d. He noted comments from CFMMEU secretary Christy Cain at the jobs and skills summit who \u201cbasically said \u2018this is our time\u2019\u201d, and argued the union had been repaid with the proposed abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Littleproud warned Jacqui Lambie and David Pocock - who will likely have the casting votes on the bill but have asked for more time to examine it - that the government is trying to sell them \u201ca pup\u201d. He said structural change \u201ctakes time, takes care\u201d to avoid \u201cperverse outcomes\u201d. \u2018This flood emergency is far from over\u2019: Victorian SES Wiebusch emphasises the flood emergency \u2018is far from over\u2019: The flood risk still remains in many parts of our state, with flood watches for most parts of Victoria at this time. We still have water storages that are at capacity, catchments that are now saturated, and we still have the climate drivers of La Ni\u00f1a and the negative Indian Ocean dipole which means we are likely to see above average rainfall for at least another 6-8 weeks. In the last few days we have seen as a result of the rainfall renewed minor to moderate flooding in various parts of our state. It will only take another large rainfall event for us to see our rivers in Victoria go back to major flood levels, and again, that\u2019s why we are asking all Victorians to be flood ready now. Tim Wiebusch of the Victorian SES follows Symes, saying: October was the biggest month on record for volunteers, and this is off the back of what is now regarded as Victoria\u2019s wettest month on record. SES volunteers have now responded to 13,689 requests for assistance during October, making it the single busiest month on record for the SES. That has exceeded what we saw back in June of 2021 which was the previous record of 10,740 requests for assistance and also what we saw in the February storm and floods of 2011 of 9,674 requests for assistance. The Victorian emergency services minister, Jaclyn Symes, is giving a media conference in Melbourne about the joint Victorian and federal government\u2019s $877m package for the state\u2019s flood recovery. Symes is giving a bit more detail about community hubs: We anticipate there will be a need for around 16 community hubs across the state making sure that individual responses for individual needs of their own community. This is a model that will be familiar for those who have covered or indeed experienced the recovery efforts of the fires of previous years when we had these hubs in communities for some time, a centrepiece for people to ensure they can get the help. We also know that many people, when they recover from a disaster event, may take time to think about what services they need \u2013 or, indeed, are distracted by other things before they might decide that they need to go and get additional help, whether it is financial or emotional support, for example. These hubs will help people with limited Internet access and also support for cultural and linguistically diverse communities in relation to ensuring that they have access in the right information in the right way to ensure they know what support is available for them. More about the full package here: Ahead of the RBA\u2019s expected seventh consecutive monthly rate rise later today, there\u2019s more news of weaker consumer confidence. The weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan survey found sentiment sinking another 1.5%. Confidence among those paying off a mortgage was down 15.6% over the past six weeks, said David Plank, ANZ\u2019s head of Australian economics. Denting demand is what the RBA, of course, is trying to do. Still, the survey has found those who think they are financially worse compared with a year ago has now risen to 47%, or the highest in three decades of the survey. One reason for the sagging confidence, though, is the jump in the CPI for the September quarter, where the annual rate hit the highest in 32 years at 7.3%. That rate (and an even higher tally for non-discretionary goods of 8.4%) has also fed into higher inflation expectations, the survey found. That spike to 6.6% was the highest since February 2011, Plank said. The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, won\u2019t be happy with that reading, you\u2019d have to assume. As it is, investors have lately been pulling back on their forecasts of how high the cash rate will go. Today\u2019s move is only moderately favoured as another 50 basis point rise to 3.1% \u2013 as a 52% chance. But further out, they no longer expect the cash rate to peak above 4%. Most economists are also less hawkish, with a spread among the big four banks of 3.1% (CBA) to 3.85% (ANZ). Speaking of the RBA decision, it\u2019ll be the first meeting since the Albanese government\u2019s federal budget was announced, so any decision by the central bank could be an indicator as to whether it thinks the government has got the monetary and fiscal policy correct. This is what the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had to say at a Business Sydney breakfast event this morning. It was really one of those things hanging over every conversation \u2013 this sense that if you do get it wrong you can spook the market, you can provoke a blunt reaction from central banks \u2013 and that is what we are desperate to avoid here. Investors tip 52% chance of 50 basis-point rate rise Guardian Australia\u2019s economic oracle, Peter Hannam, has tweeted ahead of the RBA meeting today where a seventh consecutive interest rate rise is predicted in as many months. Investors are tipping just over a 50% chance the rise will be a 50 basis point rise. Aussie firm turns classic cars electric An Australian startup adding modern technology to classic Land Rovers will become part of one of the biggest electric vehicle conversion companies in the world this week after merging with an English firm. Melbourne-based Jaunt Motors will partner with Zero EV to create Fellten, in a plan that will see the companies operate across Australia, the UK and North America. Jaunt Motors co-founder Dave Budge said the merger was not just about converting more classic cars with electric motors themselves but helping car owners and mechanics to make the switch too. We\u2019re scaling up to deliver hundreds of units next year and beyond. And the biggest thing is awareness. Most people don\u2019t know that this is even possible. Electric vehicles represented just 3.39% of new car sales in Australia until September, but the new firm will convert existing petrol vehicles, including Porsche 911s, Mini Coopers, Land Rover and Land Rover Defender vehicles, into EVs to boost their numbers. Budge said: If you want a true full-drive electric vehicle on the market in Australia there isn\u2019t one. Even though the conversation is expensive ... it\u2019s comparable with the price of a new Land Rover. - from AAP Here are the latest flood warnings which have been issued for NSW within the last hour: The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting major flooding at Scone and moderate flooding at Bathurst this morning, while Gundagai could see major flooding from midday today. Top pay for top-performing NSW teachers Top-performing NSW teachers could earn as much as $150,000 a year under reforms the government is proposing to combat the profession\u2019s shrinking supply and keep the best and brightest in the classroom. The proposal to reward excellent teachers with higher pay and enhanced status was unveiled today, in a government options paper developed by Melbourne University education expert Prof John Hattie. Hattie recently told a NSW parliamentary committee probing the crisis that a lack of a financial incentive tied to career progression was a major contributor to teachers leaving. Under options released for consultation, classroom teachers assessed as \u201cexpert\u201d under the \u201cRewarding Excellence in Teaching\u201d program could attract salaries up to $147,000 a year or beyond in recognition of their skills and impact. The education minister, Sarah Mitchell, said the program was a key component of the government\u2019s focus on building an education system that recognises and rewards excellence. Initial feedback showed around three out of four teachers in NSW would be interested in putting themselves forward for the senior role. Hattie\u2019s paper proposes the creation of new teaching roles across schools with salaries ranging from $117,000 to $147,000, depending on the proportion of mentoring and collaboration time undertaken. Over the next month, more than 100 roundtables will be held with teachers and other school staff to get feedback on the paper, while others will be able to share their thoughts online through a survey. The \u201cRewarding Excellence in Teaching\u201d program is expected to start next year and scale up over time. - from AAP Penny Wong meets with leaders in Brunei The minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, has shared images of her meetings with the Sultan of Brunei as well as her Bruneian counterpart, Dato Erywan. Wong says she had \u201cwarm discussions\u201d with Erywan about maritime security, mental health, food security and climate change. Victorian and federal governments to announce $877m package for flood recovery Victorian businesses in flood-affected areas will be able to receive up to $200,000 in grants as part of a $877m support package to be announced by the state and federal governments. Under the scheme, grants of up to $50,000 will be made available to eligible businesses and not-for-profit organisations to aid recovery efforts, including rebuilding infrastructure and replacing damaged assets. Primary producers and rural landholders will be eligible for grants of up $75,000, while medium and large-sized businesses directly affected by the floods will be able to receive up to $200,000. This is in addition to concessional loans of up to $250,000, already announced by the federal government. We\u2019ve been bringing you some of the news about rain causing more flooding in NSW. Here are some visuals from Wagga Wagga in southern NSW and the Newell highway in the state\u2019s central west. Jacinta Allan avoids question of whether families returned from Syria would be welcome in Victoria The Victorian deputy premier, Jacinta Allan, was on ABC radio this morning as the state government officially enters its caretaker period tonight ahead of the upcoming state election. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas pressed Allan on the Victorian government\u2019s stance on the four women and 13 children returned from Syria this weekend. The Australian reports all the families will live in suburban Sydney, so it\u2019s potentially hypothetical. Karvelas: The first group of families the wives and children of Islamic State fighters arrived in Sydney over the weekend from Syria and are now living in the community in Sydney. Will Victoria accept returnees? Allan: I was with the premier [Daniel Andrews] on Sunday at a at a media event\u2026 where the premier was asked this direct question and I\u2019ll give to you the answer he gave on Sunday which is these are very sensitive security matters. They are primarily the province of the federal government, it would not be appropriate - Karvelas: As a matter of principle, will you accept them [in] Victoria? Or have you asked for them not to come during the election campaign? Allan: We\u2019ve not, Patricia. There is a \u2026 As I think we\u2019ve seen from the media reporting around this issue, this is a very careful matter. There is a very - Karvelas: Sure, but as a matter of principle, do you think returning citizens \u2013 they\u2019re Australian citizens \u2013 should be allowed to live in Victoria? Allan: I would really direct you to the federal government and the federal \u2026 I think you would appreciate that this is not a simple yes or no proposition because there needs to be robust and careful assessments that are not undertaken by the Victorian government. They\u2019re undertaken by the federal government and the federal Department of Home Affairs. Karvelas: And if they do all the checks and balances, should they be welcome in Victoria? Allan: Firstly it\u2019d be entirely inappropriate to cut across that and secondly, I am in no position to run a commentary. And that\u2019s when the interview ended for news time. China has accused the US and Australia of escalating regional tensions with the plan to deploy up to six American nuclear-capable B-52 aircraft to the Northern Territory. Officials in Canberra yesterday confirmed that the US-funded aircraft parking apron at RAAF Base Tindal, 320km south-east of Darwin, would be capable of accommodating up to six B-52 aircraft at a time but said it could also house other aircraft types. The project is now in the design phase. A spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, said at a daily press conference in Beijing last night: All countries\u2019 defence and security cooperation needs to contribute to regional peace and stability and must not target any third party or undermine their interests. Such a move by the US and Australia escalates regional tensions, gravely undermines regional peace and stability, and may trigger an arms race in the region. China urges parties concerned to abandon the outdated cold war zero-sum mentality and narrow geopolitical mindset, and do more things that are good for regional peace and stability and mutual trust among all parties. The detailed plans were aired on the ABC\u2019s Four Corners program last night amid increasing concerns in Canberra and Washington about Beijing\u2019s own military buildup and its threat to take Taiwan by force. For more on this story, see our news wrap: Overnight the SES have issued \u201cevacuate now\u201d warnings for Cowra, Willow Bend, Adelong, Boorowa Dam and Tumut Caravan Park, in addition to 400 properties evacuated in Cootamundra. Dr Ben Gauntlett, the disability discrimination commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission, on Sunday tweeted about the unit price paid to NDIS providers compared with what workers actually see in response to debate about the scheme on ABC\u2019s Insiders program. He\u2019s asked more about that issue: We need to make sure in this debate that we understand providers and participants do not necessarily have the same interests. We need to be really conscious when we have the debate that we emphasise the outcomes for participants and the participants get value for money for the dollars spent. Asked if some providers are price gouging, Gauntlett says: I think there is evidence that there is some concerning behaviour in the market relating to pricing and providers. We need to create a far better data framework that underpins the national disability insurance scheme. We need to measure outcomes better. And we also need to provide a lot of impetus to get a little known policy to become widespread, which is the national disability data asset. We need to be able to make invisible need visible and to track expenditure on outcomes to ensure that what we\u2019re getting is the best outcomes for people with disability possible. Building disability policy system with layers will avoid cost blowouts, commissioner says The solution? Dr Ben Gauntlett: If we build a disability policy system that has layers to it, that understands the interrelationship between local, state and commonwealth governments \u2013 most importantly understands the need for a whole of community attitude to improve in relation to areas such as employment, then that [$100bn per year] figure will not be reached, instead we\u2019ll have a disability policy system that\u2019s the envy of the world. NDIS costs have blown out because it has become an \u2018island in the oasis\u2019, commissioner says Spending in the NDIS was identified as one of the top five fastest rising areas of government spending, with the budget put the scheme on track to cost more than $100bn a year by the end of the decade. Dr Ben Gauntlett, the disability discrimination commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission, is speaking with ABC Radio this morning. He explains why the blow out is occurring: What has happened is everyone has relied on the NDIS to provide services, that being commonwealth, state, territory and local government. It\u2019s become, for want of a better expression, an island in the oasis and what we need to do is to be really clear to build a framework where there is a disability policy system that has different layers to it, to support people in different ways. In that way the cost will not necessarily reduced, but the expenditure will be as effective as possible. Asked about whether $100bn is sustainable, Gauntlett says: When we talk about sustainable, I also think we need to remember that we\u2019re talking about people. We can never lose sight of the humanity that underpins the NDIS. More than 80 hazard warnings are current for NSW, as widespread rain is expected on already saturated or flooded catchments. In the the Riverina, residents of Cootamundra have been evacuated with Muttama Creek is in flood, while Gundagai could see major flooding. Residents along the Murray River have been advised to seek higher ground at Willow Bend, Moama and Mathoura, as well as residents on the Adelong Creek, south-east of Wagga Wagga, which is a tributary of the Murrumbidgee River. Senior public servants involved in the design and implementation of the Centrelink Robodebt scheme will appear before a royal commission into its failures. The Albanese government initiated the inquiry into the scheme, which was designed under the Liberal-National Coalition to recover debt from welfare recipients. Lawyer Anne Pulford and former assistant director Mark Jones, public servants within the Department of Social Services that oversaw the scheme, are due to provide evidence today. Senior counsel assisting the commission Justin Greggery yesterday revealed the department knew about the potential illegality of the scheme well before a pilot program was initiated. Greggery told the commission legal advice had not been sought from the solicitor general before the scheme was implemented. Instead, the departments responsible for overseeing the scheme had sought internal legal advice: That advice raised significant questions about the legality of the scheme. He said the advice raised concerns about the proposed approach by the department to determine a social security debt. In December 2014 the social services department received advice that \u201cthe proposal to smooth a debt amount over an annual or other defined period may not be consistent with the legislative framework\u201d. Submissions to the inquiry are open until February 2023, with a final report due by mid-April. \u2013 from AAP The Reserve Bank is expected to increase interest rates for a seventh month in a row when it meets today. The cash rate is now 2.6% after it was raised a quarter of a percentage point last month. RBA governor Philip Lowe indicated that as rates go up, big hikes were less likely. The decision comes on the day of the Melbourne Cup, an event for which the latest Guardian Essential Poll indicates enthusiasm is slipping with more than half of Australians uninterested. Amid growing support for the Nup to the Cup movement, the poll suggests almost half of those surveyed (45%) believe it promotes \u201cunhealthy\u201d gambling behaviour, with a third (34%) saying it normalises animal cruelty. In more economic news, Australians home prices have fallen for six month in a row, with Core Logic\u2019s latest data showing prices fell 1.2% in October. The second day of hearings of the royal commission investigating the botched Centrelink Robodebt scheme are taking place today with senior public servants involved in the design and implementation of the scheme to front the commission. As more rain has hit NSW, the Riverina is being hit by flooding. Residents of Cootamundra have been issued with evacuation orders after the Muttama Creek is in flood while major flooding is possible at Gundagai. The Victorian government goes into caretaker mode at 6pm tonight ahead of the state election. That means it can no longer make major policy decisions, sign contracts or make significant appointments during this period. Let\u2019s kick off!"

            "date": "2022-11-24T11:00:27Z",
            "content": "From concert tickets to gasoline, inflation has made almost every aspect of daily life more expensive in the US this year. Unfortunately, that also includes producing the much-savored Thanksgiving Day meal and gathering to eat it. Rising food costs in the US have made the celebratory spread more expensive to procure \u2013 and cook. A report from market research firm IRI predicted that Thanksgiving dinners will cost 13.5% more to produce this year than the year before, based on October data, reported CNN. Other surveys drew similar conclusions. The American Farm Bureau Federation\u2019s annual Thanksgiving cost survey estimated that it would cost almost $11 more to produce the annual meal, from $53.31 for a family of 10 in 2021 to $64.05, reported Axios. Ingredients across the board are costing consumers more. Turkeys, traditionally the centerpiece on most Thanksgiving Day tables, have gotten more expensive due to inflation and an avian flu outbreak affecting poultry across the country. The average cost of a 16-pound bird has gone up by almost 21% since 2021, the bureau found. Shoppers for the survey said turkey prices have come down since mid-October, as more whole frozen turkeys came into grocery store chains in bulk. Even the price of the humble potato, perhaps the most popular side dish for Thanksgiving, is up by 19.9%. Pie shells and eggs, two key ingredients in this season\u2019s desserts, have both increased in price by double percentage points: 26% and 74.7% respectively. This year\u2019s cost was the highest for a Thanksgiving dinner in the 37 years that the American Farm Bureau Federation has conducted the survey, reported the Hill. The only food that has been spared the painful increase has been fresh cranberries, which experienced a slight drop in price this year despite lower-than-expected crop outputs. Joe Biden even made a cranberry sauce joke at the pre-Thanksgiving pardoning of the turkeys this year. Unfortunately, for those who prefer canned sauce, prices have increased due to costs that have to do with processing the fruit and its journey to store shelves, Tom Lochner, executive director of the Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association, said. Some will feel the sharp increases in Thanksgiving meal costs more than others based on geography, not just income levels. According to MoneyGeek, the cities where it is most expensive to produce a Thanksgiving dinner include Honolulu, Boston, New York City and Seattle. It\u2019s not just the food Meanwhile, filling up at the gas station to go shopping or visit relatives and friends means a car-loving country on the move will be paying more at the pump than in many previous years. Gas prices in the US peaked in June 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration, at an average of about $5 a gallon, compared with $2.42 in January 2021. Costs surged first as people returned to the roads post-Covid, and then again after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. By this September, prices had dropped to an average of $3.77, but in October rose again to almost $4 a gallon. Once the ingredients for dinner have been bought and the relatives have arrived, there\u2019s the task of cooking, and the hope that diners gathering around the table will be in a cozy place \u2013 another set of challenges with higher energy costs. Electricity, fuel oil and natural gas bills are all sharply up this year, with early winter weather hitting some parts of the US with record snow or just brutal chill. There is no doubt that Thanksgiving is an all-around challenge for the pocketbook this year \u2013 and some will be gathering for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the US in 2020. To that end, the US president, family doctors and public health officials have been urging more people to receive the latest coronavirus vaccine booster and flu shots, and to make efforts to stay as safe as possible this holiday season."

            "content": "Anthony Albanese has revealed he discussed opportunities for Australia to commercialise new clean technology with the US during conversations with Joe Biden on the sidelines of international summits over the past week. Winding up his nine-day travel program on Saturday in Bangkok \u2013 and as the Cop27 in Egypt moved into end game \u2013 Australia\u2019s prime minister told journalists he spoke to Biden \u201cabout how Australia can benefit from his groundbreaking Inflation Reduction Act\u201d passed in the US earlier this year. \u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act envisages an enormous investment in clean technology,\u201d Albanese said on Saturday. \u201cAustralia has an opportunity through green hydrogen, through other innovations working to gain jobs and economic opportunity.\u201d Albanese said the Biden administration was not looking at the clean energy transition \u201cas a closed nation-state\u201d. He said Biden was looking for partnerships with other countries. He said Australia \u201cpunched above our weight\u201d when it came to breakthrough ideas but \u201cwhat we haven\u2019t been good at in the past is commercialising \u2026 opportunities and giving Australia the advantages\u201d. \u201cI see the Inflation Reduction Act as being part of that.\u201d Albanese said he also used the opportunity of participating in the Asean, East Asia, G20 and Apec summits to lobby other world leaders to support Australia\u2019s bid to host a future UN-led climate conference in partnership with the Pacific. He said the idea was getting a positive reception. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia\u2019s prime minister said his participation in the summits of the past week had reinforced his understanding that most of the world\u2019s contemporary problems required international cooperation to solve. He said \u201cyou can\u2019t have one-nation solutions to issues that are global\u201d. \u201cThey require goodwill and they require countries to work together for the common interest,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThat is what I have sought to do over the last eight days \u2013 to send a message that Australia want to engage constructively and work with our partners in the region and throughout the world. \u201cI believe Australia has taken significant steps forward over the past eight days.\u201d The Apec summit winds up on Saturday evening. On the final day, Albanese met the Thai prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, and the president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, on the sidelines of the summit. On Friday, Australia\u2019s prime minister joined the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, the prime minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, South Korea\u2019s prime minister, Han Duck-soo, and the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, in a huddle to condemn North Korea\u2019s provocative launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile that landed in Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone. North Korea responded to the joint call for an emergency session of the UN security council by declaring it would respond to any nuclear threats with nuclear weapons. As well as provocations from North Korea, all of the summits of the past week have been overshadowed by the ongoing war in Ukraine, and by regional anxiety about the implications of great power competition between the US and China. From the Australian perspective, the key diplomatic breakthrough of the trip was a cautious thaw in the frosty relationship between Australia and China. According to a report in the New Zealand Herald, Ardern walked away from a 50-minute meeting with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of Apec with an invitation to start working on dates for a visit to Beijing. New Zealand has pursued a more conciliatory diplomatic line than Australia on China. Asked on Saturday whether he would also like an invitation to visit the country now he had re-established leader-level dialogue with Xi, Albanese said the relationship reboot was in its infancy \u201cand I\u2019m not getting ahead of myself\u201d. He said it was \u201cconstructive\u201d for Australia to keep engaging with China and with other countries. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue, arising out of this week\u2019s progress, to take steps forward together.\u201d Asked whether he had had more interaction informally with the Chinese delegation than his two conversations with Li Keqiang and Xi, Albanese said \u201cwe have informal interactions because we are all in the same building\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m a polite bloke, I say hello to people,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cIt costs you nothing to be courteous. That\u2019s my style, I hope you notice that. I do it even with people in the media, although of course you know I love each and every one of you.\u201d Apec generally concludes with a \u201cfamily photo\u201d, with leaders wearing matching shirts. Unusually, the Bangkok summit did not conclude on that note. Officials say the absence of shirts reflected the wish of the Thai government. Summits this week have seen pitched battles behind the scenes over statements and communiques given splits in the membership. China and Russia have objected to collective condemnations of the war in Ukraine. Albanese will return to Canberra on Sunday morning for the final sitting fortnight of the parliament for 2022."

            "date": "2022-11-01T12:55:40Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s manufacturing sector stood on the brink of a deep recession in October after firms suffered their worst slump in output and new orders since the beginning of the pandemic. Factory output was hit especially hard by a drop in new orders amid a global fall in the demand for industrial goods. The S&amp;P Global/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI, a measure of activity across the sector, scored 46.2 in October, down from 48.4 in September to hit a 29-month low. A figure below 50 signals that the sector is shrinking. An element of the index that tracks domestic and export orders plunged to 39.9 from 44.8 to mark its lowest level since the financial crisis in 2009, excluding the lows hit during the pandemic. Fhaheen Khan, senior economist at the manufacturing industry lobby group Make UK, said the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will draw up a budget in a fortnight knowing that factory output is shrinking and a deep recession across the manufacturing sector is almost certain. \u201cAs the economy tries to find its bearings after months of political crisis, manufacturing may already be in a recession with demand falling rapidly,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil recently, the consumer\u2019s willingness to spend on goods and services was the final saving grace ensuring industry\u2019s persistence in trying times, despite record levels of inflation. \u201cIt is clear there is a limit to how long this can go on for with a slowdown pointing to further decline and a deep recession next year looking more likely by the day,\u201d he added. Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cLooking ahead, demand for industrial goods looks set to fall further as real incomes continue to be hit by above-target inflation, the watering down of government support for energy bills in April, austerity measures and higher unemployment.\u201d Turkey, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturing hubs, reported a drop in output on Tuesday, as did China, South Korea and Germany. Japan\u2019s factory owners reported that activity grew at its slowest pace in 21 months in October following marked declines in output and overall new orders."

            "date": "2022-11-17T17:21:41Z",
            "content": "By their very nature, recessions are cyclical. I am now old enough to have lived through three large economic downturns during my working life and experienced two more as a child. So, what lessons can we learn when it comes to marketing during a recession? From the Dot-Com US recession in 2001 through to the 2008/09 Credit Crunch to the more recent Covid-19 recession, the data and learnings from these difficult times can help us minimise the effect on business during the next couple of years. While every recession is slightly different, human behaviour can be predictable, and digital marketing has some clever and agile tactics to assist. A reduction in spending is usually the first step; your target audience will be tightening their belts. However, digital marketing is great for finding new clients in new geographic regions and lets you listen to the market and assess where customers spend their money. If we take a moment to reflect on the pandemic, the companies who profited in this uncertain time were the ones that pivoted quickly to offer online services and fast delivery. The ability to be agile was crucial, with many traditional restaurants starting takeaway services while small independent shops invested in their e-commerce platforms. These businesses aimed to maintain their income during the uncertainty and, in many cases, found new audiences that continue to be steady revenue streams today. We may not know exactly how customers will behave next year, but we know their habits will change. If we don\u2019t listen, we risk missing out on crucial business opportunities. Adopting a more strategic approach to your digital marketing by using data insights can lead to new markets and tell you where best to spend your marketing budget. Understanding recession psychology and how to judge customers\u2019 reactions to the changing situation is also fundamental. Think about the impact on your sales and whether your customers will see your products and services as: Essential: necessary expenditure Treats: justifiable indulgence Postponables: needed or desired item, but purchase can be delayed Expendable: may have been purchased in good times, but unjustifiable now History has shown us no matter how difficult 2023 will be for businesses - we can\u2019t think short term. While it may be tempting to cut marketing budgets, a decrease in brand awareness will make recovery harder when the economy is on the up again. Making every \u2018marketing\u2019 penny count during a downturn is essential. Can digital marketing build business resilience? With digital marketing and eCommerce, you can answer the question of whether to discount or not by implementing short-term sales on your website to test the waters. Alongside driving awareness through social media channels, it can be a winning combination, but it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all. Your customers are likely to feel less indulgent, so it may be worth thinking about how you can package up your products in more manageable and budget-friendly ways. Can you offer subscription services with less initial outlay? Or perhaps take advantage of seasonal sales, loyalty cards or referral discounts. Digital marketing is not just selling or reducing the price of your products and services. Other strategic objectives and activities, such as newsletter signups and multiple regular touch points, also increase brand loyalty. With digital marketing, you can pivot and respond to market changes quickly. The fact that everything in digital marketing is measurable ensures you know the return on your investment. In an economic downturn, it\u2019s even more vital to plan and allocate digital marketing budgets to the right place. Recession is hard but temporary; use the time now to analyse your business and create a digital marketing strategy to make it more resilient for the next few years. We\u2019ve survived many recessions and our businesses can survive this one, as long as we keep calm, keep an eye on the data and make calculated and measurable decisions.

            "date": "2022-11-03T14:02:12Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England has increased the cost of borrowing by 0.75 percentage points to 3%, despite predicting that higher interest rates would push the economy into the longest recession since the 1930s. In a split vote, the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a 7-2 majority for the biggest increase in rates since 1989 to combat an inflation rate that hit 10.1% in September. The Bank blamed higher energy prices and a tight labour market for the decision to increase interest rates, matching rises in the last week by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The last time rates increased by more than 0.5% was in 1989. John Major\u2019s government was forced into a 2% rise during the exchange rate mechanism crisis in 1992, though for less than 24 hours before it was scrapped. Without taking into account the chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s likely squeeze on government spending in his budget on 17 November, which could worsen the outlook for economic growth, the MPC said the economy was already contracting and would continue to shrink for eight consecutive quarters to the summer of 2024 if interest rates continued to rise as financial markets expected. The Bank expects inflation, which hit 10.1% in September, to peak at 11% by the end of 2022, and then to fall \u201cprobably quite sharply\u201d from the middle of 2023. Consumer spending and business confidence are expected to be hit, leading to a two-year recession that will be longer, if not deeper, than the slump in the 1930s. Conservative MPs are likely to be concerned at the forecast, which shows the economy only just reviving before a general election expected in the second half of 2024 and the economy growing only modestly in 2025. Inflation has taken off in most developed countries as the war in Ukraine reduced the supply of gas and sent world prices of essential resources soaring. Britain has been hard hit by a combination of high energy prices and a lack of workers in several key industries, leading to concerns of soaring wages. The Bank of England has ramped up its rate rises in recent months as the impact on gas and other commodity prices from the war intensified. After turmoil in financial markets that followed Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget, investors forecast interest rates peaking at 5.25%, but before the November MPC meeting they had already reduced the expected peak to 4.75%. The gloomy forecasts are expected to be interpreted by financial markets that interest rate rises will be limited in the next year, possibly to no more than 4%. Critics of the central bank are expected to argue that further interest rate rises are unnecessary when the MPC\u2019s central forecasts show inflation falling below its 2% target in 2024 should interest rates remain at 3%. The Bank\u2019s report said: \u201cThe economy has been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continues, consumer prices index inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term.\u201d However, it added that there were many moving parts to the economic outlook, domestically and from the global economy, to make forecasting economic growth next year difficult. \u201cThere are considerable uncertainties around the outlook. The committee continues to judge that, if the outlook suggests more persistent inflationary pressures, it will respond forcefully, as necessary.\u201d Homebuyers with tracker or variable rate mortgages will feel the pain of the rate rise immediately, while the estimated 300,000 people who must remortgage this month will find that two-year and five-year fixed rates remain at levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. Before the MPC meeting, the average two-year fixed rate had fallen to 6.47% from 6.65% in mid-October \u2013 as the effects of the disastrous Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget eased \u2013 but it remains three times the rate offered by lenders earlier this year. A five-year fixed rate mortgage that could be obtained for 6.51% on 20 October has slipped only marginally to 6.31%. Mortgage payers that need to refinance will be hit by a \u00a33,000-a-year increase in interest payments, the Bank estimated, while private rents were also expect to increase sharply after the MPC decision. The nine-strong MPC voted by seven to two for an increase of 0.75 percentage points, with two former LSE economics professors on the committee voting for a smaller rise. Silvana Tenreyro voted for a 0.25 percentage point rise while Swati Dhingra supported a 0.5 percentage point increase."

            "date": "2022-11-20T06:00:18Z",
            "content": "They\u2019re young, rich and mortgage-free, and the scions of the 1% are having a roaring twenties. Despite the economic gloom currently shrouding the UK and many other western countries, sales of luxury brands have been booming and growing numbers of buyers are young adults. Swiss watches, Louis Vuitton trainers, rare Birkin bags and 81-year-old whiskies are among the products that are fuelling impressive growth in the bottom lines of luxury brands such as LVMH, Burberry and Kering. Imports of Swiss watches to the UK were up by 31% in the first half of 2022, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry \u2013 the average spend at the Watches of Switzerland group being about \u00a36,000. Meanwhile, sales of watches below \u00a32,500, sometimes referred to as \u201cmid-range\u201d, are falling. Burberry\u2019s sales were up 11% over the last six months, it was reported last week. LVMH, which owns brands including Dior, Tiffany, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy and Louis Vuitton, was up by 28%, while Kering, the firm behind Gucci and Balenciaga and others, saw a 14% rise. \u201cI don\u2019t want to describe luxury as recession proof \u2013 it feels like tempting fate \u2013 but it is an extremely resilient sector, both at the top end of the market and at the affordable luxury segment,\u201d said Helen Brocklebank, chief executive of Walpole, which represents the British luxury market. Tourists from the US and the Middle East are making use of the strong dollar to come to the UK and European countries, according to James Ison, the self-styled Deal Maker For The 0.1%, who founded his business as a wrangler for the rich after his Rich Kids of Instagram account became popular. \u201cPeople are having a Yolo [you only live once] moment,\u201d Ison said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to Bicester Village and spending five figures in an afternoon. They include a lot of people who did well in the pandemic, online entrepreneurs. \u201cThese are people who aren\u2019t necessarily paying a mortgage or high fuel costs,\u201d Ison said. \u201cKids of very successful business people, or international students. They\u2019re the younger generation who are more likely to bid on Louis Vuitton and Nike Air Force 1 trainers at \u00a37,000 a pair.\u201d This is the other side of the boom \u2013 the rise of the luxury reseller. Buying a watch, a handbag or a pair of trainers has become a new type of investment, although nobody refers to these resold investments as \u201csecond hand\u201d. \u201cDuring the pandemic, people were selling their Rolexes for 150%, 180% more than the retail cost,\u201d Ison said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have the supply \u2013 the big luxury brands are facing the same kind of issues as every other business with supply chains, so you\u2019re getting people who are able to find something at retail, and then sell it online 24 hours later for double.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s and other traditional auction houses have set the tone with sales of items such as a Herm\u00e8s Himalaya Birkin 30 handbag for $226,180 (\u00a3190,250) in 2021. More modest offerings are available online at sites such as Vestiaire Collective, Trendy Tickers and the RealReal, which said that millennials and Gen-Z shoppers made up 41% of their customers. \u201cPeople are more incentivised to buy a watch than save up and buy a house,\u201d Ison said. \u201cIt gives them opportunities \u2013 they\u2019re buying status, that way to level up into whatever crowd they\u2019re chasing. And a watch is easier to sell than a house.\u201d Whiskies are the British equivalent of Swiss watches, according to Brocklebank. Last month an anonymous collector at Sotheby\u2019s in London paid \u00a3300,000 for a bottle of Macallan\u2019s The Reach, an 81-year-old single malt, the oldest whisky to be sold at auction. However, luxury goods makers in Britain are concerned that dollar-rich tourists are not returning to London, but are preferring European destinations such as Paris and Milan because the UK has stopped allowing tourists to reclaim VAT when they leave the country. \u201cI go day-to-day to boutiques and department stores, and it\u2019s quiet,\u201d said Melody Mashilompane, the founder of Style Concierge by Melody, who is a personal shopper for many high-net worth individuals. \u201cPeople definitely aren\u2019t spending as much as they were six months ago,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2022-11-17T13:43:37Z",
            "content": "Polly Toynbee: \u2018These Tories forget nothing and learn nothing\u2019 No contrition. Not for Liz Truss, not for their self-harming Brexit deal, nor for 12 years of going backwards. Recession, eight years of growth wiped out, rising unemployment, falling wages: all this is confirmed by the Office for Budget Responsibility today. But these Tory Bourbons forget nothing and learn nothing. There\u2019s no remorse for George Osborne\u2019s austerity that stripped the country bare and wiped 1% off GDP. Instead, here comes the austerity reprise, but far worse now that the Tories are cutting spending on skeleton services in a state of collapse. The usual flurry of spending announcements can\u2019t blot out the warning of Rob Whiteman, the head of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. He says: \u201cPublic services are going to need increases of about 20% just to stand still, and we are not going to see anything like that.\u201d More for the NHS and social care doesn\u2019t begin to compensate for years of their worst funding ever. The NHS spends 20% less per person than 14 similar EU countries, the Health Foundation reveals today. There\u2019s no chance of reducing the waiting lists, the National Audit Office warns. Even Tory home counties council leaders are finally breaking their silence to warn they will go bankrupt. \u201cEye-wateringly difficult,\u201d said Jeremy Hunt, but whose eyes are watering most? \u201cTo be British is to be compassionate,\u201d the chancellor claimed at his most unctuous. True, he hasn\u2019t cut benefits yet again, but his government slashed them in seven of the last 10 years to the lowest among similar countries, as millions of children go hungry to school. Look where Tory \u201cchoices\u201d have left us, with the worst wage growth in 200 years and one in five key workers earning so little they bring up their children in poverty. Meanwhile shareholders had a bonanza and bankers\u2019 bonuses doubled. Covid and the war in Ukraine don\u2019t explain why Britain faces the lowest growth in the G20 \u2013 bar Russia. An extraordinary poll today suggests the public will neither forgive nor forget. With things so hard for so many, Ipsos found a third of those interviewed expected the autumn statement to make things worse, a third expected they would be no better, and only 22% expected improvement. The sheer effrontery of Hunt\u2019s claim that \u201cConservatives do not leave our debts to the next generation\u201d is breathtaking. No, he leaves it to Labour after the next election, a callow political trick. We wait for Labour\u2019s policy responses: tax rises in this under-taxed country can only help Labour\u2019s future, while spending cuts are unthinkable. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Katy Balls: \u2018Copying Blairism will only aggravate MPs on the right\u2019 When Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled his not-so-mini-budget, Tory MPs quickly saw red over his and Liz Truss\u2019s headline move: to cut the top rate of tax. As Michael Gove put it in an interview in the weeks afterwards: \u201cThat is a display of the wrong values.\u201d This autumn statement is intended to say the opposite. The Truss era of \u201clibertarian jihadists\u201d \u2013 as one Tory MP, now a minister, labelled them \u2013 is over and, under Rishi Sunak, the party is trying to move to the centre ground. Not only has tax been raised for high earners, with people to start paying the 45p rate at \u00a3125,000 rather than \u00a3150,000, Hunt was quick to emphasise spending increases for the NHS and schools as well as a rise in the \u201cnational living wage\u201d and benefits going up in line with inflation. The attempt by the Tories to park their tanks on Labour lawns isn\u2019t exactly subtle \u2013 with announcements that the former Labour health secretary Patricia Hewitt will advise on integrating health and social care and Tony Blair\u2019s delivery chief Michael Barber will help with the skills agenda. However, no Labour hires can dress up the dismal economic outlook. For all the talk of helping the most vulnerable, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that living standards will fall 7% over the next two years \u2013 wiping out all growth from the previous eight years. Already the Liberal Democrats are preparing to go on the attack over the squeezed middle. Even if Sunak can convince the public that these are the best steps given the circumstances, the harder audience could be the one right in front of him: Tory MPs. The tax rises and enhanced windfall tax go against the instincts of many. The idea of copying a form of Blairism, too, will only aggravate MPs on the right of the party further. When Sunak became prime minister, the party made an uneasy truce to rally behind him in a bid to end the psychodrama of the past few months. As he put it to MPs in his first private address to them: unite or die. We\u2019re about to find out which option the Tory parliamentary party is going to choose. Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor Miatta Fahnbulleh: \u2018The chancellor prioritised fixing a fiscal crisis that does not exist\u2019 We are facing one of the deepest and longest recessions in 100 years at the same time as millions are being squeezed by soaring prices. Real household incomes are set to fall by 7% over the next two years, the biggest fall on record. Cushioning people from this double hammer blow should have been the chancellor\u2019s No 1 priority. Instead, he prioritised fixing a fiscal crisis that does not exist. The extension of the energy price guarantee, increase in the living wage and uprating of benefits and pensions in line with inflation are welcome. They will take the sting away, but won\u2019t be enough to insulate millions who are already struggling to afford everyday essentials. And for public services facing \u00a343bn of cuts a year due to inflation, the failure to plug this gap will push our schools, hospitals and local services further into crisis. He could have reversed the outstanding tax cuts in the mini-budget, closed the non-dom tax loophole, and equalised wealth taxes with income taxes to do this, but he chose not to. The wrong political choice. With a painful recession looming, Hunt missed the opportunity to give the economy a \u00a330bn-a-year green investment boost that would have allowed us to retrofit millions of homes, deliver a clean energy system that we own, upgrade public transport and build the infrastructure we need for the future. Reviving our economy in the short term and building our resilience for the long term. We have had 12 years of Conservative party making the wrong choices for the economy. We are weaker and poorer as a result. It seems the chancellor has learned nothing from this \u2013 and we will all pay the price. Miatta Fahnbulleh is an economist. She is standing to be Labour\u2019s parliamentary candidate in Camberwell &amp; Peckham Rachel Clarke: \u2018This doesn\u2019t even cover half the NHS budget shortfall\u2019 It\u2019s the weasel words that are hardest to swallow: Hunt\u2019s pretence that failing to address the NHS\u2019s real-terms, multibillion-pound funding cuts is in any way compatible with slowing the collapse of the NHS, let alone reversing it. Thanks to inflation, the NHS is already facing a \u00a37bn shortfall in its budget this year. Today\u2019s announcement of an extra \u00a33.3bn of NHS funding doesn\u2019t even cover half of that. We are, in other words, still facing de facto budget cuts \u2013 at a time when the scale of avoidable deaths and patient suffering has never been more indefensible. Worse was that the chancellor couldn\u2019t resist in indulging in some not-so-subtle NHS bashing, presumably as a sop to his party\u2019s libertarian wing. \u201cI\u2019m asking the NHS to join all public services to tackle waste and inefficiency. We want Scandinavian quality alongside Singaporean efficiency,\u201d he said, suggesting the NHS is somehow uniquely at fault. Yet as the country\u2019s longest-serving former health secretary, he knows full well how brutally the NHS has been pared to the bone \u2013 and how forcing us to run on empty makes it only harder to streamline services. Let\u2019s be blunt. If the government was truly committed to \u201cputting the NHS first\u201d, as Hunt has claimed today, it would provide the financial support necessary to genuinely drive down waiting lists and stop patients dying in corridors, in stranded ambulances and in abject misery, over and over again. Hunt likes to insist he is a patient safety champion, but this budget is an exercise in managing optics, not reality. Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor and the author of Breathtaking: Inside the NHS in a Time of Pandemic Tessa Khan: \u2018The chancellor has sided with the oil and gas industry\u2019 The chancellor rightly diagnosed climate breakdown and energy affordability as two of the biggest challenges we face, but has sided today with the industry driving both: oil and gas. Until this year, the UK offered among the most lucrative tax conditions for oil and gas producers in the world. The rise in the rate of the windfall tax to 35% is therefore welcome, but it is a temporary fix when what is needed is permanent reform. More alarmingly, Hunt has failed to close the gaping tax loophole that allows companies such as Shell to avoid tax if they invest in new oil and gas fields. It also gives them an even bigger handout if they choose to power their oil and gas rigs using wind \u2013 despite the fact that the vast majority of emissions come from burning, not extracting, oil. Not only will this see billions in lost tax, it sends us in precisely the opposite direction to the one that will get us out of this hole for good. This is the \u201chighway to climate hell\u201d, that the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned world leaders about at Cop27. It is also the route to permanently high energy bills. Electricity generators have also been hit with a 45% windfall tax but without the generous allowance for new investment that oil and gas companies benefit from. This is an absurd outcome given the dual crises we face of climate breakdown and energy affordability. Tessa Khan is executive director of climate action organisation Uplift Frances Ryan: \u2018The public will pay for the Tories\u2019 failures\u2019 Hunt pulled out some rabbits \u2013 extra social care, schools and NHS funding, and capping social rent rises \u2013 but it couldn\u2019t distract from the grim news: public spending on already crumbling services will be gutted in the long term. This statement was a lesson in kicking the can down the road. Delaying the social care cap. Delaying major cuts until after the next election. Those who rely on the state pension or benefits must get through a cold winter before the 10% rise in payments arrives next year. It was all everyone else\u2019s fault, though. Euphemisms of \u201cefficiencies\u201d and \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d suggest such public funding cuts are reasonable and necessary, even noble. \u201cGlobal forces\u201d give the impression every major economy is in this position. But it cannot be forgotten: we are largely in this position because of the fallout of Truss\u2019s calamitous mini-budget. The Resolution Foundation calculates that the Truss government cost the country \u00a330bn \u2013 doubling the sum that the Treasury has had to raise. Not to mention the impact of Brexit. The public is still reeling from the last decade of cuts: struggling to get a GP appointment, languishing on social care waiting lists or taking children to a rundown local park. Twelve years of Tory failure have ratcheted up a staggering bill. But it is the British public who will pay \u2013 in more ways than one.

            "date": "2022-11-24T18:50:33Z",
            "content": "The US justice department has asked Mike Pence to testify in the criminal investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, according to a person familiar with the matter. The request came before the attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed a special counsel last week to oversee inquiries examining Trump, which are focused on two areas: potential mishandling of national security documents, and the January 6 Capitol attack. Pence is considering testifying because unlike the congressional investigation, which he has panned, the New York Times earlier reported, the department wants him to appear before a federal grand jury, and could compel his cooperation with a subpoena. Even if Pence is willing to testify, however, the matter could be further complicated should Trump attempt to block Pence\u2019s testimony by asserting executive privilege \u2013 potentially prompting months of legal wrangling over what Pence is allowed to divulge. So far, Trump\u2019s lawyers appear to have had only limited success blocking testimony from Pence\u2019s aides: his former chief of staff Marc Short and former legal counsel Greg Jacob appeared before a federal grand jury in Washington in July. Moments that federal prosecutors would be likely to ask Pence about include a phone call between Trump and Pence at 11.20am ET on the morning of the Capitol attack, when Trump attempted to bully Pence into commandeering and delaying the ceremonial certification of Biden\u2019s election win in Congress. Trump\u2019s words and the gist of the call were revealed when Oval Office aides described it to the House January 6 select committee. What Pence said in response remains unclear. Both Short and Jacob, who also testified to the select committee, told investigators they did not know what Pence had said because he had walked out of the room to take the call; it was his standard practice not to brief others on his conversations with Trump. After the call, Pence went to the Capitol and said in a statement distributed through his office that he would not carry out Trump\u2019s wishes. He proceeded to certify Biden\u2019s win as Trump supporters and far-right extremist groups such as the Proud Boys stormed the Capitol. The former vice-president could also shed light on Trump\u2019s intent and overt participation in the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, as well as whether Trump was warned those efforts were illegal, which would be critical for prosecutors as they weigh whether to issue charges. At issue is the concept of willful blindness \u2013 and whether Trump continued to pursue strategies that he was warned could violate the law. Emmet Flood, Pence\u2019s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment. A person close to Trump suggested it was too soon to know whether Trump would assert executive privilege given Pence had not yet agreed to cooperate. Pence did say in an interview with CBS News last week that he would not cooperate in the select committee\u2019s investigation into the Capitol attack. \u201cCongress has no right to my testimony on separation of powers under the constitution,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd I believe it will establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a vice-president of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House.\u201d On Sunday, Pence was asked on NBC if he thought Trump had committed a crime in connection with the events of January 6, when some Trump supporters who attacked the Capitol chanted \u201chang Mike Pence\u201d, to which he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is criminal to listen to bad advice from lawyers.\u201d Pence is eyeing a presidential run for which he appears to be pursuing a balancing act, seeking to distance himself from Trump while appealing to Republican voters. His new memoir, So Help Me God, which deals in detail with his version of events during his time at Trump\u2019s side, includes an extensive account of Pence\u2019s role in, and views of, Trump\u2019s attempts to stay in office. Trump, he writes, said he was \u201ctoo honest\u201d to take part in a plot based on claims of widespread electoral fraud. He also says Republicans were right to lodge objections to results in key states, as it \u201cmeant we would have a substantive debate\u201d. But the former vice-president also made clear that he views Trump as responsible for the Capitol attack. In a recent interview with ABC News concerning January 6, he said Trump\u2019s words and actions \u201cangered me\u201d. \u201cBut I turned to my daughter who was standing nearby. And I said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t take courage to break the law. It takes courage to uphold the law.\u2019 The president\u2019s words were reckless. It\u2019s clear he decided to be part of the problem,\u201d Pence said."

            "date": "2022-11-02T10:00:03Z",
            "content": "The state of social care in England has \u201cnever been so bad\u201d, the country\u2019s leading social services chief has said, with half a million people now waiting for help. Sarah McClinton, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), told a conference of council care bosses in Manchester: \u201cThe shocking situation is that we have more people requesting help from councils, more older and disabled with complex needs, yet social care capacity has reduced and we have 50,000 fewer paid carers.\u201d Over 400,000 people rely on care homes in England and more than 800,000 receive care at home. But care services are struggling with 160,000 staff vacancies, rising demand and already tight funding for social care that is being squeezed by soaring food and energy inflation. About a third of care providers report that inability to recruit staff has negatively affected their service and many have stopped admitting new residents as a result. Last month the Care Quality Commission warned of a \u201ctsunami of unmet care\u201d and said England\u2019s health and social care system was \u201cgridlocked\u201d. Problems in social care make it harder to free up beds in hospitals, slowing down the delivery of elective care. \u201cThe scale of how many people are either not getting the care and support they need, or are getting the wrong kind of help, at the wrong time and in the wrong place is staggering,\u201d said McClinton, who is also director for health and adult services in Greenwich. \u201cIt is also adding to the endless pressures we see with ambulances and hospitals, and adding to the pressures we see in our communities, more people requesting help with mental health and domestic abuse.\u201d More than 2 million hours of homecare couldn\u2019t be delivered in the first quarter of this year leaving unpaid carers \u201cat breaking point\u201d, ADASS said. Councils are receiving 5,400 new requests for help every day. The warning comes amid reports the government is preparing to delay the introduction of an \u00a386,000 cap on social care costs, a reform that was due to come alongside a new funding deal for councils that commission social care. Calls from MPs and campaigners for an additional \u00a37bn a year from the Treasury to bring social care back into equilibrium are also likely to be rejected as the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, weigh public spending cuts and tax rises to fill an estimated \u00a340bn budget hole. Care workers earn \u00a39.50 an hour on average. Half of health and social care workers say the government\u2019s approach to pay makes them more likely to quit in the next one to three years, according to research by the Trades Union Congress. Care England, which represents for-profit companies that provide most of England\u2019s care homes, last week warned the PM of \u201ca mass exodus of care providers across the country\u201d without immediate support. Martin Green, its chief executive, said: \u201cThis will be devastating not only for those receiving care and their loved ones but also through the catastrophic knock-on effects it will have on the NHS\u201d. A government spokesperson said: \u201cSocial care is a top priority and we are committed to bolstering the workforce and protecting people from unpredictable care costs. We have today launched our annual domestic recruitment campaign, Made With Care, to encourage people to take up a career in adult social care and we are also investing \u00a315m to increase international recruitment into the sector. \u201cFunding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as intended when the health and social care levy was in place, including \u00a35.4bn for adult social care, [over three years] while we have committed \u00a3500m to support discharge from hospitals into care homes.\u201d"

            "content": "The US justice department has taken drastic action regarding the crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, that has affected drinking water for its 150,000 residents for several months. On Tuesday, the city of Jackson and the Mississippi health department signed an order agreeing to federal oversight of the failing water system, in an attempt to restore clean and safe drinking water. The justice department filed a complaint on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) against the city, for failing to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act. In a statement, the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, said he was \u201ctaking action in federal court to address longstanding failures in the city of Jackson\u2019s public drinking water system. \u201cThe Department of Justice takes seriously its responsibility to keep the American people safe and to protect their civil rights. Together with our partners at EPA, we will continue to seek justice for the residents of Jackson, Mississippi. And we will continue to prioritize cases in the communities most burdened by environmental harm.\u201d Several boil water notices have been issued to neighborhoods across Jackson, thanks to aging infrastructure and severe weather. In August, the situation worsened after heavy flooding and power outages at well water facilities resulted in a water shortage. In September, Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rang the alarm about racial inequity exacerbated by the water crisis, which predominantly affected Black residents. Johnson said: \u201cSomehow, in the year 2022, equality and justice remain out of reach for Black communities across America. \u201cThe disparities facing our community are stark \u2013 just look at the catastrophe unfolding in my home town of Jackson, Mississippi. More than 100,000 people, the majority of whom are Black, are without safe access to drinking water for the foreseeable future.\u201d Johnson called the crisis a \u201cdirect result of the failures of politicians\u201d. City officials implemented months-long emergency distribution of bottled water. In a statement to the Guardian on Wednesday, the mayor of Jackson, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, said the city was \u201cpleased we have finally reached an agreement that represents a critical next step in our efforts to provide immediate and long-term solutions for Jackson\u2019s water issues\u201d. Lumumba also said his city government would work with an appointed administrator to \u201cmake smart choices for the city\u2019s drinking water system and ensure that we can provide safe, clean and sustainable drinking water for all\u201d."

            "content": "Doreen Lawrence, who has campaigned tirelessly for justice and equality since her son was killed in an unprovoked racist attack in 1993, has spoken candidly for the first time about finding her inner strength after the brutal murder that seized Britain. In a BBC Maestro course released on Thursday, Lady Lawrence reflects on being thrust into the spotlight and having to publicly mourn her son Stephen, then 18, who was stabbed while waiting for a bus in Eltham, south London, nearly 30 years ago. \u201cIt took me a while to feel comfortable in talking about what had happened to Stephen, in talking about my feelings,\u201d Lawrence says in one episode. \u201cIt was too raw at the beginning, too early to process my thoughts to anyone.\u201d Speaking in the three-hour BBC course, Lawrence refuses to tread lightly over her delayed decision to have therapy, her feelings of impostor syndrome and the guilt of not having been there for her son on the night of his murder. \u201cThere are times that you think you can\u2019t go on, but then you just think of the person who you\u2019re fighting for and the fact that Stephen didn\u2019t have a voice,\u201d Lawrence told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Thursday. \u201cI needed to be his voice and to speak out about the injustice.\u201d The 1999 Macpherson inquiry concluded that institutional racism contributed to the Metropolitan police\u2019s failure to bring Stephen\u2019s attackers to justice. In 2012, two men \u2013 Gary Dobson and David Norris \u2013 were jailed for murder. Lawrence later became a life peer and received an OBE. With her then husband, Neville, she founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, now called Blueprint For All, and she is a member of the board and of the council of the human rights organisation Liberty, as well as being a patron of the hate crime charity Stop Hate UK. While the loss of her son is not something Lawrence is able to stop thinking of, with time the pain has lessened, she says. When asked by Today how she managed to carry on, Lawrence said she drew strength from two sources: the fight for justice for Stephen, and modelling her behaviour on that of her Jamaican grandmother. Lawrence referred to an old Jamaican saying \u2013 \u201cWe likkle but we tallawah\u201d \u2013 which she equated to standing tall in the face of adversity despite one\u2019s small stature. She said it was a position she had had to assume after Stephen\u2019s murder to speak out and demand justice. Otherwise, she said, his name would have been forgotten. \u201cI wanted to make sure that his name and what he stands for and how we can help other young people because they have a right to life and that was denied Stephen,\u201d she said. Lawrence, who has been selected to sit on panels within the Home Office and the police service, said the racism that existed in today\u2019s police force brought her back to her son\u2019s death. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t seen as a human being, and we weren\u2019t also,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happened to Stephen was terrible and I would not wish that on anybody, but when I look at what came out of what happened to Stephen, that is what I think I take some comfort in,\u201d she says in an episode of the course. \u201cThat is what has helped: to look at the positiveness.\u201d"

But on the way he displays a crucial misunderstanding. There is no presumption in favour of development in the planning system; it\u2019s a presumption in favour of sustainable development \u2013 something with which surely no one could disagree? This is an egregious example of the Tory use of sophistry that has made a massive contribution to the issue that Harris so ably describes. Far from being an objective, science-based definition, it is in reality a circular argument that the government inserted in the national planning guidance. In effect, \u201csustainable\u201d is what the government, Humpty Dumpty-like, says it is. The assessment of major housing proposals, which so often go to appeal, is comically perfunctory, the overriding criterion being the supply of new housing, however and wherever built. Many people participate in this charade. We have been building in unsustainability \u2013 carbon emissions, destruction of habitat, poor health and unaffordability \u2013 throughout the last 12 years. The cost of retrofitting will be astronomical. We need the houses we need. Campaigners cannot morally deny that, but development must be based on sound sustainability principles and by applying rigorous tests that are available but are never used effectively. The planning guidance or, more accurately, diktat is what needs to be radically overhauled to place sustainability at its heart. That will result in major shifts in the burden of costs and benefits, but equally, that must be faced. Neil Blackshaw Whittingham, Northumberland \u2022 John Harris rightly points to the complexity of the issue that goes beyond finger-pointing at nimbys. However, having worked for a local authority recently, I get the sense that many well-off and organised residents weaponise issues such as environmental concerns, lack of infrastructure and pressure on services to serve their own ends, and usually offer solutions such as building on brownfield sites. These involve other associated costs and complexities for local authorities and developers, and hold back economic growth and much-needed housing for people who commute to work in places where they can\u2019t afford to live. Local authorities are not allowed to build schools either, which compounds the issue. Newly built houses do bring in council tax revenue for local authorities, so surely they have to start somewhere to generate revenue to rebuild infrastructure and services? Steve Flatley York \u2022 It is worth recalling that the only time that we were able to complete 300,000 new homes a year was when half of them were local authority-built for subsidised social rent (under a Conservative housing minister \u2013 Harold Macmillan). We know we can\u2019t rely on private housebuilders to provide the affordable housing that we so desperately need, and a thorough reform of the way that housing is delivered is required. What is also needed is a commitment to genuine levelling up, with new, well-paid jobs and the housing that goes with them available throughout the country, not just in the already overheated south.

            "date": "2022-11-18T09:10:06Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt claimed the burden of his autumn statement tax rises would fall on those with the broadest shoulders, saying on Thursday he would \u201cask those with more to contribute more\u201d. Unfortunately, the chancellor\u2019s statement was surprising in its timidity. The UK tax system is sadly riddled with problems. Fixing any one of those could have raised substantial revenue, improved growth and gone some way towards improving fairness, not only between rich and poor but also between people with the same incomes, taken home in different ways. Instead, in terms of personal taxes, the budget did three small things. First, it did a whole lot of nothing. By which I mean that the chancellor chose to sit on his hands, and hold a lot of tax thresholds fixed: something often described as a stealth tax. What it means in practice is that even if you can somehow negotiate a pay increase of 11.1%, to match this month\u2019s inflation figure, you will still be less able to afford the things you could before. More of your income will be taxable, and depending what you earn, more of it may be in higher tax brackets. Most of the \u201cstealth tax\u201d comes from freezing the threshold at which employer\u2019s national insurance kicks in. This freeze means employers will have to pay more for each employee. Proportionally it affects the lowest paid the most, ultimately feeding through to lower wages and employment for that group. This alone raises \u00a35.5bn. Second, it fiddled with the tax-free allowances for dividends and for capital gains. On top of the personal allowance we all get, recipients of dividends get an additional \u00a32,000 tax-free and recipients of capital gains receive a further \u00a312,000 tax-free each year. These amounts will be halved from April, and halved again a year later, to \u00a3500 and \u00a33,000 respectively. Particularly in the case of capital gains, this threshold was unjustifiably high. While there are administrative costs to filing, having an annual allowance for capital gains that is as high as the income tax personal allowance is pretty difficult to defend. The final, symbolic, reform is the lowering of the threshold at which the 45p rate of income tax kicks in. This represents a remarkable repudiation of the mini-budget from only eight weeks ago, when Kwasi Kwarteng sought to remove the 45p rate altogether, and it will make the \u201cdistributional analysis\u201d charts look good. This reform does raise money from people with incomes in the top 1-2%. But it is essentially a poll tax for individuals in that group: they will pay a flat \u00a31,250 more whether taking home \u00a3150k or \u00a31.5m. The latter two reforms are ones that will largely affect the better off. But even taken together, they don\u2019t actually raise very much, bringing in only \u00a32bn. Most of the tax rises on individuals come from the threshold freezes, and are therefore coming from workers who are much less well-off. And these reforms raise only 12% of what could have been raised by fixing the deeper problems capital gains tax. Despite repeated mentions of the former chancellor Nigel Lawson during his budget speech, Hunt did not follow his example and equalise the tax rates on income and on capital gains. Currently, someone earning an income of \u00a31m as an employee will pay 47% tax on every additional pound they earn, and their employer has to put in another 13.8% on top. If they can instead take their pay through a company they own and manage, they can take the money out as a capital gain. This allows the first \u00a31m to be taxed at a rate of only 10%, after which the rate is still only 20%. Capital gains are particularly unequally distributed, with more than half of taxable gains going to only 5,000 people. A budget seriously aimed at focusing tax rises on those with the broadest shoulders would have corrected this anomaly. And now would have been the perfect opportunity. The chancellor could have paired an increase rates with a reintroduction of the inflation allowance for capital gains, reverting to the system we had before 1998, benefiting many people who receive income in this way. Hunt also avoided addressing one of the most divisive wealth tax breaks. There was no mention of closing the non-dom tax loophole, which allows families with links to other countries, including the prime minister\u2019s wife, to use the UK to shelter their worldwide fortunes. All in all, this is a budget that ducked the opportunity to make serious reforms to the way wealth is taxed. \u2022 Arun Advani is an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick and a research fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies"

            "content": "Graham Arnold has expressed \u201cmassive concerns\u201d over the state of football development in Australia, putting the onus on the national governing body on the eve of the Socceroos\u2019 decisive World Cup group match with Denmark. In what could be the final pre-match press conference of his four-and-a-half-year tenure, Arnold put forward his views on the state of the nation and called on Football Australia to conduct a thorough review. When the 59-year-old replaced the interim coach Bert van Marwijk after the 2018 World Cup, he and his assistant, Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, also took charge of the national under-23s team with a view to breaking the Olyroos\u2019 12-year-old Olympics drought and transitioning those younger players into the national team. \u201cIt was a quick fix and it\u2019s not right,\u201d Arnold said on Wednesday. \u201cWhatever happens with this World Cup, I think the organisation needs a review of what\u2019s going on in junior development. Because when I went to Russia in 2018, when I first got appointed to the job, and I watched the them play, I could see straight away that Cahill, Jedinak, Milligan, Kruse \u2013 an ageing squad was there. \u201cI\u2019d already taken the job and I needed to find players, and then when I started looking there was nothing coming through. And when you\u2019re ringing A-League coaches \u2013 and you are talking about two players per club \u2013 I could barely put a squad together to go to [Olympic qualifiers in] Thailand and even to Cambodia.\u201d Nine of the under-23 players who competed in the Tokyo 2020 Games last year are in the 26-man senior squad in Qatar \u2013 the faces of a new generation exceeding expectations. But Arnold said the stopgap salve \u2013 which also includes selecting players born and bred overseas, particularly in Scotland \u2013 would not stand the test of time if resourcing is not increased and existing infrastructure not reformed. Having spent years coaching in the A-League with Sydney FC and Central Coast, he has spoken repeatedly about the lack of sufficient game time for young players in Australia\u2019s 26-round top-tier competition and the yawning gap in resources between that and the semi-professional second-tier National Premier Leagues. Further down still, children\u2019s development at the grassroots is often blocked because of exorbitant registration costs and academies not always harnessing the best young talent. \u201cYou need more kids to give an opportunity in Australia,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cFor me there\u2019s massive concerns for the future, moving forward, unless it\u2019s fixed. It was a quick fix, and that\u2019s why I did the Olympic thing for nothing. I asked the organisation: \u2018What\u2019s the Olympic program?\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s 10 days\u2019 preparation and they didn\u2019t even have a coach two months before. \u201cAt least now Tony Vidmar\u2019s in charge of that. The Socceroos are just the icing on the cake and whatever that icing, whether it tastes good or bad, the most important thing is the ingredients. The ingredients are junior development and junior national teams, and if that\u2019s not right and the icing will not taste very good.\u201d Arnold said he would \u201chire about 150 people\u201d if hypothetically given the reins to make meaningful change but clarified his future remains undecided \u2013 whether Football Australia offers him a new contract or not. \u201cAt this moment I\u2019m focused on this, then I\u2019m focused on having a break,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game is growing and growing right across the world, and Asia is growing so quickly. \u201cPeople can sit back at home and their opinion is maybe Saudi and Japan are not that good, but look what they\u2019ve done \u2013 they\u2019ve beaten Argentina and they\u2019ve beaten Germany. Asia is throwing a lot of money into football and we need to catch up and do the same thing.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-29T03:10:12Z",
            "content": "There has been a lot of discussion about the need for gambling reform, quite rightly, but there is one important element that has been left out of the conversation \u2013 suicide. Gambling is not only causing harm to people\u2019s financial situation and relationships, it is risking people\u2019s lives. The risk of suicide needs to be part of the dialogue if we\u2019re to have a true understanding of the harm gambling is causing. Reform is not just necessary, it\u2019s urgent and it\u2019s a non-negotiable, particularly when lives are at stake. Australia is home to less than half a per cent of the world\u2019s population but 20% of its poker machines. In New South Wales we have almost half of Australia\u2019s 200,000 poker machines. There has also been a 300% increase in online gambling in the last two years and Australia now holds the unwanted position of being the country with the highest rate of gambling losses per person in the world. Gambling apps are easy to access are and increasingly pushing the boundaries. A new sports betting app controversially entered the market by offering 100-to-1 odds on all runners in the Melbourne Cup. This marketing tactic attracted more than 300,000 new customers. During a consultation we heard from a lawyer from a gambling legal service who shared that, in one day, four out of six clients admitted they were considering suicide. A financial counsellor also shared that a bank had extended a line of credit of $120,000 to an aged pensioner, which should not have been granted. That person attempted suicide. These are only a handful of the stories that we\u2019ve uncovered and, sadly, there are many more like it. We know that gambling-related suicides are happening. But they are under-reported and not getting the policy attention they deserve. Gambling regulation is failing to provide adequate consumer protection and myriad state and federal regulators are operating in silos. Not to mention the advertising, which is pervasive and targeted towards those most at risk of experiencing the harms of gambling, and often those most at risk of suicide. Data from NSW suggests that of those who seek help for gambling problems, as many as 11% attempt suicide. Other studies found that almost one in five people presenting with suicidality also experienced problems with gambling. So how can we better protect people at risk? First, it is important to understand that suicide is complex human behaviour with many varied risk factors, including social and economic factors. We know that problematic gambling can heighten two key risk factors for suicide \u2013 financial hardship and relationship breakdown. Protective factors, such as social and financial supports, are compromised by the financial harms of gambling and this leaves people vulnerable. As we emerge from the pandemic and compounding environmental disasters, research shows suicide rates can peak two to three years after a crisis. We\u2019re already seeing this play out. Indications from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Suicide and Self-harm Monitoring System point to a steady increase in suicides this year in NSW and Victoria. This rise is being observed alongside increases in gambling across the country. The state election in Victoria and the forthcoming NSW elections are therefore are critical. Bipartisan commitment to suicide prevention and addressing gambling harm can help save lives. We need stronger gambling regulations, especially to curb emerging online gambling and the introduction of a cashless gaming card. We need greater education and awareness of the signs of gambling harm for individuals, families and frontline workers. We need a total ban on gambling advertising. And, finally, we need a coherent, adequately funded, national regulatory structure for gambling. Every life lost to suicide is a tragedy and more needs to be done now to prevent suicides related to gambling and associated financial stress. Governments, service providers, the industry and the community all have a role to play in suicide prevention. Don\u2019t gamble with people\u2019s lives. Reform is a no-brainer.

Better known as cannabis, modern varieties of hemp are too weak to use as narcotics, but they are extremely efficient at absorbing and locking up carbon. Hemp is one of the fastest-growing plants in the world and can grow 4 metres high in 100 days. Research suggests hemp is twice as effective as trees at absorbing and locking up carbon, with 1 hectare (2.5 acres) of hemp reckoned to absorb 8 to 22 tonnes of CO2 a year, more than any woodland. The CO2 is also permanently fixed in the hemp fibres, which can go on to be used for many commodities including textiles, medicines, insulation for buildings and concrete; BMW is even using it to replace plastics in various car parts. But unlike many other countries, the UK still classifies industrial hemp as a controlled drug, and growing the plant needs a Home Office licence. Cultivation in Britain is only about 800 hectares but work at the University of York and Biorenewables Development Centre aims to increase this to 80,000 hectares and make hemp a leading UK crop."

            "date": "2022-11-14T12:30:38Z",
            "content": "The past year has seen an unending drumbeat of climate-driven disasters. And yet, the climate story of this past decade has been one of slow but steady progress. Global CO2 emissions have flattened, and countries representing 88% of global emissions have adopted or announced plans to get to net zero in the latter half of the 21st century. Another reason to be hopeful is that clean energy became cheaper much faster than expected. The cost of both solar energy and batteries fell tenfold in the last 10 years and the cost of wind energy by two-thirds. Solar is the cheapest form of new electricity to build in much of the world today, and electric vehicles now represent 13% of new vehicle sales globally. But this doesn\u2019t mean we can rest on our laurels. Far from it. We are still nowhere near where we need to be to meet our climate goals. In the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which I contributed to, we found that if we want to limit warming to 1.5C we can only emit 420bn more tons of CO2 \u2013 equal to around 10 years of current emissions. This means that even with the progress we\u2019ve made, the increase in global temperatures is very likely to exceed 1.5C by the early 2030s. So where does that leave us? The short answer is: \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d To start with, it\u2019s important to emphasise that climate change happens incrementally rather than in big jumps. There is no evidence that 1.5C represents a boundary between manageable and catastrophic impacts. But the further we push the climate beyond where it has been for the past few million years, the greater and more unpredictable the risks become. Large climate shifts in the Earth\u2019s past, and potential future tipping points such as CO2 release from thawing permafrost, should give us pause: we can\u2019t easily predict what might happen. Every tenth of a degree matters if we want to minimise the harm we inflict on ourselves and leave to future generations. But equally, just because we pass 1.5C does not mean that there is no way back. We know that if we can get emissions down to zero the world will effectively stop warming. And climate models show that if we remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than we are emitting it will actually cool the world back down. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere and oceans was highlighted in the recent IPCC report as an \u201cessential element\u201d of meeting our climate goals. Virtually all climate models suggest that we need to remove 6bn tons of CO2 per year by 2050 alongside rapid emissions reductions to bring temperatures back down to 1.5C by the end of the century. One form of carbon dioxide removal people are already familiar with comes in the form of trees and soil. The Earth\u2019s living systems already sequester about a quarter of the CO2 we emit today (with another quarter absorbed by the oceans). There is real potential to enhance this \u201cnatural carbon sink\u201d by protecting forests, planting more of them, and changing how we manage agricultural land and pasture to get more carbon into the soil. This is relatively low cost today, but it is also likely to prove temporary. Trees may be cut down, burn down, or die from beetle infestations, while soil may dry up due to drought or heat \u2013 and these risks will increase as a result of climate change. There are also limits to the land available to use. All in all, models suggest that trees and soil could provide only half of the carbon dioxide removal that we need. There are other more reliable ways to take carbon out of the atmosphere over the long term. Such approaches are still at an early stage, but are being rapidly developed by hundreds of companies around the world. They include direct air capture, which sucks CO2 directly from the atmosphere; taking agricultural waste or wood and storing carbon from it deep underground; spreading minerals like basalt that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere on to agricultural fields; removing CO2 directly from ocean water; making ocean water less acidic so it absorbs more CO2; and sinking kelp or other plants into the deep ocean where the carbon they have absorbed will stay for millennia to come. These approaches are less likely to be reversed and are less limited by available land. But they tend to be much more expensive, at least at the moment. It follows that we should be focusing on making them cheaper, the way we did with renewable energy. This is the goal of Frontier, a $925m advance market commitment that Stripe, where I am climate research lead, has launched alongside Alphabet, Shopify, Meta and McKinsey. The idea is simple: by guaranteeing money up front, we\u2019re sending a signal to entrepreneurs and researchers that if they build and scale those early-stage technologies, we will buy them. This approach was piloted a decade ago to accelerate the development of the pneumococcal vaccines in low-income countries, and saved an estimated 700,000 lives. We have a saying in the climate science world \u2013 that CO2 is forever. It will take close to half a million years before a ton of CO2 emitted today from burning fossil fuels is completely removed from the atmosphere naturally. This means that when we try to neutralise or undo fossil fuel emissions \u2013 for example, with carbon offsets \u2013 those interventions should operate over a similar timeframe: a ton of emissions from cutting down trees can be neutralised by putting more carbon in trees or soils, but CO2 from fossil fuels needs to be balanced by more permanent carbon removal. This is the reason why the respected Science Based Targets initiative only allows measures that permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere to neutralise a company\u2019s remaining fossil fuel emissions in their net-zero standard \u2013 and only alongside deep emissions reductions. We should not oversell the role of carbon removal. The vast majority of the time it is cheaper to reduce emissions than to remove CO2 from the atmosphere after the fact. Models that limit warming to 1.5C show that we need to reduce global CO2 emissions by around 90%, while only using carbon removal for around 10%. But 10% of the solution to a problem as big as climate change is still something we cannot afford to ignore. In 2021 the world spent a total of $755bn on reducing emissions. We should probably aim to spend about 1% of that money on carbon removal technologies. But we cannot simply sit back and assume that ways of removing billions of tons of CO2 per year will magically appear in the decades to come. By investing today, we can ensure that we are in a good position to make net-zero a reality, stop the world from continuing to heat up, and give ourselves the tools to ultimately reverse global warming in the future.

            "date": "2022-11-12T19:00:52Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has flagged working more closely with China on issues such as climate change as part of ongoing efforts to reboot the fractured relationship after years of public confrontation. As Anthony Albanese signalled publicly his willingness to meet with China\u2019s leaders during the week-long international summit season in Cambodia, Bali and Bangkok, Wong used a major foreign policy speech in Australia to articulate her objective to stabilise relations with China. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister said any rapprochement would not be easy because the two nations had different values and different interests. Wong said as China increasingly sought to assert itself in the world, the differences between Canberra and Beijing had \u201cbecome harder to manage\u201d. \u2022 Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But she said her objective as foreign affairs minister was to \u201cnavigate our differences wisely \u2013 something, in fact, we believe both our countries should do\u201d. Albanese\u2019s clear public overture to China on Saturday night followed confirmation the president of the United States, Joe Biden, will meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the G20 summit in Bali on Monday. Speaking to reporters in Phnom Penh, Australia\u2019s prime minister welcomed the looming conversation between the US and China. \u201cOut of dialogue comes understanding and we need more, not less, in today\u2019s uncertain world,\u201d he said. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister noted in her speech that she had met twice with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, as part of a cautious diplomatic thaw after the Labor election victory in May. Wong said their dialogue had been frank, encompassing human rights, the current trade dispute and sensitive consular matters. \u201cI have said to him that Australia\u2019s approach will be calm and consistent,\u201d Wong said. \u201cWe seek to cooperate where we can and will disagree where we must. \u201cI have made it plain that we will speak out as necessary on the issues that matter to Australians, including human rights and upholding the international rules to which we have all agreed, and I have been clear that we believe the removal of impediments to Australian exports and the full resumption of our bilateral trade would greatly benefit both Australia and China.\u201d Wong said her objective was to work out areas of \u201cmutual benefit in our relationship, and we are open to working with China in other ways, including to address major transnational challenges like climate change\u201d. With Albanese opening his international summit program in Phnom Penh by meeting Ukraine\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, on the sidelines of the Australia-Asean summit, Wong reiterated Australia\u2019s expectation that China use its influence with Vladimir Putin to end the illegal Russian invasion. She declared the \u201cworld looks to China\u201d as a great power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. While Labor is clearly pursuing a stabilisation of the China relationship, it is also engaged in significant outreach with Asean nations, which have different views about the challenges associated with China\u2019s rise. As well as courting Asean countries, Australia has also pursued a rapid-fire courtship of Pacific nations to try and repel Beijing\u2019s soft power offensive with island states. Albanese on Saturday used his opening remarks at the Asean-Australia summit to emphasise the centrality of the Asean region to Australia\u2019s foreign policy and to underscore Australia\u2019s commitment to partners and regional values, which he characterised as \u201cthe cherished ideals of peace, freedom, social justice and economic well-being\u201d. Back in Australia, Wong said Asean was \u201ccentral to managing today\u2019s challenge in our region\u201d. She said the Indo-Pacific region and south-east Asia was on the frontline of great power competition. \u201cNow, and for the foreseeable future, we face the theme of great power competition in different variations,\u201d Wong said. She said we cannot be passive \u201cwhen big powers flout the rules\u201d. But she said Australia also had considerable agency. \u201cWe are more than just supporting players in a grand drama of global geopolitics, on a stage dominated by great powers.\u201d Wong said that agency extended to Australia\u2019s relationship with our most important security partner, the United States. \u201cWe do ourselves and our American partners no favours if we are not exercising our own agency, and standing as a reliable partner of choice in the region. \u201cIndeed, that is the principal value we add to the alliance\u201d. Wong said Australia needed to tread its own path. \u201cIf Australia can be effective in our diplomacy, especially in multilateral and mini-lateral groupings, we have will more chance of upholding the international order, maintaining our independence, exercising our agency, and achieving the equilibrium that is the basis of sustainable peace and prosperity.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-04T07:03:21Z",
            "content": "Federal environment officials have agreed to look again at 18 proposed new coal and gas projects after a Queensland environment group submitted requests to have the effects of climate change considered. None of the 18 projects has been approved under the country\u2019s environment law, but have been through a process where the environment minister determines the nature and scale of their likely impacts. In July, lawyers for the Environment Council of Central Queensland sent documents to the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, asking her to reconsider decisions made under previous ministers going back to 2011. Projects from major coal and gas companies \u2013 including Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Whitehaven and Glencore \u2013 were included in the request. In a statement, the federal environment department said on Friday that \u201cafter careful consideration\u201d it had decided each request was valid and all new information had been placed on its website and was open for public comment until 24 November. \u201cAs this is a legal process, and the minister is the decision maker, she is unable to make public comment at this time,\u201d the statement said. Under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, projects are considered by the minister at two stages. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup At the first stage, the minister lists the habitats, species and ecological communities that could be affected by a project. At the second and final stage, the minister either denies environmental approval, or grants it with conditions. The Environment Council of Central Queensland used a little known process related to the first stage known as a \u201creconsideration request\u201d where new information is submitted that had come to light since original decisions were made. Expert reports from two Australian climate science experts, Prof David Karoly, of the University of Melbourne, and Prof Lesley Hughes, of Macquarie University, are part of the new evidence. The council\u2019s president, Christine Carlisle, said: \u201cUntil now, former environment ministers failed to take climate change into account when considering which animals, plants and places could be harmed by a coal or gas proposal. \u201cAssessing the risks and harm of new coal or gas should account for all the evidence, including how it would contribute to climate breakdown.\u201d Hollie Kerwin is the principal solicitor at Environmental Justice Australia, which is representing the council. \u201cWhat these requests really do is ask the minister to take into account the global scientific consensus and the granular information on the impacts of new coal and gas on all of these living wonders,\u201d Kerwin said. The requests are looking to test how the act defines an impact and whether the government can exclude climate change. \u201cA climate change impact is no different than any other impact and it fits within the meaning of an impact under the law,\u201d Kerwin said. Among the evidence submitted to the government are the findings of recent UN climate assessments, the government\u2019s own State of the Environment report, peer-reviewed scientific articles and maps of the impacts of the black summer bushfires on different species. The council said climate change was threatening more than 2,120 species and places considered by the EPBC Act as matters of national environmental significance. Kerwin said the intervention was a deliberate challenge to the fossil fuel proposals. \u201cThere are proposals to dig up more coal, bids to stay open for decades longer and to drill major new gas wells,\u201d she said. \u201cThe science is clear. More coal and gas would just be adding fuel to the fire we need to put out.\u201d The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, welcomed the reassessments, saying: \u201cAn enormous amount of scientific evidence showing the detrimental effect of climate change on Australia\u2019s matters of environment significance \u2013 from the Great Barrier Reef to koalas \u2013 was given to the minister. She must not ignore it in her decision making. \u201cAny project, not just these 18, that comes across the minister\u2019s desk must be assessed according to the climate and nature crisis we are in right now.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-30T08:27:41Z",
            "content": "Banks expect to reduce lending to households and businesses in northern Australia and to fossil fuel industries across the country as the risk of losses due to the climate crisis escalates, the industry regulator says. A new report by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) found climate change could make banks more vulnerable to economic downturns as they face up to a threefold increase in lending losses by 2050, but that the system should be able to absorb the impact. The climate vulnerability assessment (CVA) said banks\u2019 lending losses on mortgages were expected to be higher in parts of northern Australia, which is at greater risk of extreme weather events including cyclones and heavy rain. Modelling from the banks suggested lending losses in Queensland could increase by 35% between 2030 and 2045. Lending losses from businesses were expected to be higher in fields most affected by the transition to a net zero emissions economy, including mining, manufacturing and transport. The assessment found the country\u2019s five biggest banks \u2013 ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Macquarie, NAB and Westpac \u2013 were likely to respond to the potential for higher lending losses by tightening loan-to-value ratio limits on new mortgages and reducing lending to regions and economic sectors most at risk unless there was additional government policy support. Observers said the assessment was a good start in considering climate risk on banks, but did not go far enough in assessing the impact on all parts of the economy, or the cumulative effect of extreme events and rising temperatures. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Erwin Jackson, policy director with the Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents $2tn in assets under management, said there was a lot of variability in the results from different banks, in part because the models were new and the data incomplete. \u201cThe government needs to increase funding for the underlying climate science, and the banks need to significantly improve their analysis that translates the science into comprehensive climate risk models,\u201d he said. Jackson said the assessment showed banks were changing their lending practices. \u201cThat means pulling back from banking vulnerable industries and regions,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors are also undertaking similar approaches in response to climate risks.\u201d He said investors had the capital ready to fund climate solutions, but to allocate capital with confidence they needed a reliable picture of the risks and opportunities. Which he said requires companies produce and release information on climate risk, and strong government policy to adapt to the impacts of climate change and drive an orderly transition to net zero. Apra\u2019s deputy chair, Helen Rowell, said the assessment was an important step as it required the banks to develop techniques in climate analysis, but there were limitations, such as banks using different modelling approaches and assumptions. \u201cDespite the high profile of climate change, climate risk management and modelling remain emerging areas of expertise, in part due to uncertainty about how the risks will play out decades into the future, and how these risks are incorporated into financial models,\u201d she said. \u201cThis, however, is a good start and we urge all Apra-regulated entities to examine the CVA findings to see how they can leverage the insights to enhance their own climate risk analysis and management.\u201d The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the report was \u201ca really significant contribution to understanding the risks of climate change in our banking system\u201d. The government is developing a framework for climate disclosure by businesses and financial institutions. A consultation paper is expected next month."

            "date": "2022-11-07T00:01:34Z",
            "content": "The super-rich emit greenhouse gases at a level equivalent to the whole of France from their investments in carbon intensive businesses, according to analysis published on the opening of the Cop27 UN climate talks in Egypt. Examining the carbon impact of the investments of 125 billionaires, the research found they had a collective $2.4tn stake in 183 companies. On average each billionaire\u2019s investment emissions produced 3m tonnes of CO2 a year; a million times more than the average emissions of 2.76 tonnes of CO2 for those living in the bottom 90% of earners. In total the 125 members of the super-rich emitted 393m tonnes of CO2 a year \u2013 equivalent to the emissions of France, which has a population of 67 million. The report by Oxfam called for the investments of the very rich to be regulated and for a wealth tax with a steep rate of top up on investments in polluting industries. Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam GB\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe need Cop27 to expose and change the role that big corporates and their rich investors are playing in profiting from the pollution that is driving the global climate crisis. It is people in low income countries who\u2019ve done the least to cause it who are suffering the most \u2013 as we are seeing with the devastating drought in east Africa and catastrophic floods in Pakistan.\u201d The investments were held in the consumer industry, energy and materials, with an average of 14% of their investments in polluting industries, such as fossil fuels and cement. There was only one renewable energy company in the sample. Studies show that 50-70% of emissions from the super rich come from their investments. Researchers made the calculations by starting with a list of the 220 richest people in the world, according to the Bloomberg billionaire list from August 2022. They worked with a data provider to identify what percentage of each company was held by the billionaires and the scope 1 and 2 emissions of these corporations. The researchers used analysis by Bloomberg for detailed breakdowns of the sources of billionaire wealth to calculate what percentage of each company was owned by the billionaires. They excluded billionaires with less than a 10% share in a business. The research was limited because it was reliant on data that companies publish themselves, which is often not externally verified. \u201cEach of these billionaires would each have to circumnavigate the world almost 16m times in a private jet to create the same emissions,\u201d the report said \u2013 adding that almost four million people would have to go vegan to offset the emissions of each of the billionaires. Some of the super-rich analysed did attempt to make positive impacts to tackle the climate crisis. They highlighted Yvon Chouinard, the billionaire owner of the sportswear brand Patagonia, who put the company\u2019s ownership into a trust for the benefit of environmental efforts and declared that \u201cEarth is our only shareholder\u201d. The tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes took up a significant holding in the Australian energy company AGL to prevent it from continuing to operate coal power plants for another two decades, the report said. But Oxfam researchers said these efforts of activism were very limited in the sample of the super-rich. The charity has estimated that imposing a wealth tax on the world\u2019s super-rich could raise $1.4tn a year, which could help developing countries who are worst-hit by the climate crisis to adapt, address loss and damage and carry out a just transition to renewable energy. It is also recommending steeply higher tax rates for investments in polluting industries; and is calling for governments to act to ensure that investments in new fossil fuel extraction and use and in highly polluting industries are strictly regulated and banned in many instances. \u201cWe need governments to tackle this urgently by publishing emission figures for the richest people, regulating investors and corporates to slash carbon emissions and taxing wealth and polluting investments. They can\u2019t be allowed to hide or greenwash,\u201d said Sriskandarajah. \u201cThe role of the super-rich in super-charging climate change is rarely discussed. This has to change. These billionaire investors at the top of the corporate pyramid have huge responsibility for driving climate breakdown. They have escaped accountability for too long.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-11T08:07:12Z",
            "content": "Carbon emissions from fossil fuels will hit record levels this year, according to a comprehensive analysis. The finding represents a brutal contrast with the need to cut emissions by half by 2030 to restrict global heating to 1.5C and avoid the most devastating impacts of the climate crisis. There is no sign of the decline needed, the researchers said, heaping further pressure on the countries whose representatives are meeting at the UN Cop27 climate summit in Egypt to deliver real and rapid action. Other scientists described the news as \u201cbleak\u201d and \u201cdeeply depressing\u201d. A glimmer of hope comes from assessment of emissions from the destruction of forests. These have been declining slowly over the last two decades, though largely because of more new trees being planted rather than fewer being felled. When this decline is taken into account, global carbon emissions have been essentially flat since 2015. However, until emissions actually start falling, huge amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide are still being pumped into the atmosphere every year. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has made clear to world leaders at Cop27 this week what this means: \u201cWe are in the fight of our lives and we are losing. Our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,\u201d he said. The analysis by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) uses multiple streams of data from the year to date to estimate emissions for 2022. It found fossil fuel related CO2 is on course to rise by 1% to 36.6bn tonnes, the highest ever. More burning of oil products is the biggest contributor, mostly because of the continuing rebound of international aviation after the pandemic. Continued emissions at this level would make 1.5C of global heating become more probable than not in the next decade, the researchers said. Reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as pledged by many countries, now requires an annual decrease comparable to the sharp fall in 2020 due to Covid-19 lockdowns. Emissions from coal will return to the all-time peak seen in 2014, the analysis found. But unlike in the past, this is not driven by China but by India and the European Union. Gas burning remained level, but at the same record level seen in 2021. Emissions from China, the world\u2019s biggest polluter, will decrease by 1% in 2022, the GCP found, because of the country\u2019s stringent Covid restrictions and a collapse in the construction industry. The EU will also see a similar decrease because the 7% rise in coal emissions has been offset by a 10% fall in CO2 from gas consumption after Russia invaded Ukraine. In contrast, US emissions will rise by 1.5%, with a surge in flights largely to blame. India will have the largest rise, 6%. This is due to higher coal and oil emissions, and India now emits more than the EU overall \u2013 although emissions per capita remain much lower. \u201cThis year we see yet another rise in global fossil fuel CO2 emissions, when we need a rapid decline,\u201d said Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter who led the study. \u201cLeaders at Cop27 will have to take meaningful action if we are to have any chance of limiting global warming close to 1.5C.\u201d \u201cWe are a very long way from where we need to go,\u201d said Dr Glen Peters, a GCP member at the Centre for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Norway. \u201cMany countries, cities, companies, and individuals have made pledges to reduce emissions. It is a stark reminder that despite all this rhetoric, global fossil CO2 emissions are more than 5% higher than in 2015, the year of the Paris agreement. \u201cThere is clearly no sign of the decrease needed to limit climate change close to 1.5C.\u201d Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, at the University of East Anglia, who was also part of the study, noted that the average annual increase in emissions was 3% during the 2000s but has fallen to 0.5% rise in the past decade. \u201cWe have shown climate policy does work,\u201d she said. \u201cIf governments respond by turbo-charging clean energy investments and planting, not cutting down, trees, global emissions could rapidly start to fall.\u201d A series of reports released before Cop27 laid bare how close the planet is to climate catastrophe, with \u201cno credible pathway\u201d of carbon cuts to 1.5C in place. With targets already in agreed at previous summits, Cop27 is hoping to drive action but the disagreements over the provision of climate finance by rich countries is proving a major obstacle. The GCP\u2019s 2022 analysis is published in the journal Earth System Science Data and was produced by more than 100 scientists from 80 organisations around the world. The oceans and land absorb about half of humanity\u2019s carbon emissions. However, the GCP found this vital service was increasingly damaged by global heating, with the uptake of CO2 by the land and ocean reduced by 17% and 5% respectively over the last decade. The GCP scientists are concerned about future emissions as well. \u201cGiven that a further recovery in oil use is expected in 2023, if coal or gas use remains flat or increases, then it is likely that global fossil CO2 emissions will continue to rise in 2023 without a concerted policy effort,\u201d said Robbie Andrew, a senior scientist at Cicero. Prof Vanesa Cast\u00e1n Broto, at the University of Sheffield, said: \u201cThe results of the [analysis] are bleak. Carbon emissions are continuing to rise, and if this continues, climate change will reach a very destructive stage in a single decade.\u201d \u201cThe report is deeply depressing,\u201d said Prof Mark Maslin, at University College London. \u201cIt sends a clear message to the leaders at Cop27 \u2013 the world needs to have significant cuts in global emissions in 2023 if we are to have any chance to keeping climate change to 1.5C.\u201d"

            "content": "Wet cat and dog food is far more environmentally damaging than dry pet food, according to a new study. It found that wet food results in eight times more climate-heating emissions than dry food. The analysis found that a wet food diet for a typical dog resulted in an \u201cecological pawprint\u201d for the animal that was the same as for its human owner. There are estimated to be 840 million cats and dogs in the world and, with numbers rising, the impact on the environment of feeding them is under increasing scrutiny. Pet food is usually based on meat, which has by far the heaviest environmental footprint of all foods. The researchers, based in Brazil, analysed 618 different diets for dogs and 320 for cats, ranging from wet food in cans and pouches to dry biscuits and kibble. The diets were those provided by three major Brazilian pet food retailers, although a few homemade diets were assessed, too. The environmental impacts of the ingredients of each diet was evaluated, including greenhouse gas emissions, land and water usage, and chemical pollution such as from manure. Wet diets had the greatest environmental impact for all factors, the dry diets the least, and homemade diets lay in between. A key reason was that 90% of the calories in the wet diets came from animal ingredients, compared with 45% in the dry diets. The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, found that a 10kg dog eating about 500 calories a day of dry food would result in 828kg of CO2 emissions a year, but 6,541kg of CO2 a year when fed a wet diet. That is almost as much as the average Brazilian citizen, whose carbon footprint is 6,690kg a year. The study also noted that there were estimated to be more dogs in Brazil than children. Previous research in Japan also found that the ecological pawprint of a dog can be similar to that of a Japanese citizen, while in the US a study suggested dog food was responsible for about a quarter of the entire impact of meat production. Some pet food uses offal, bone meal and blood that would not be eaten by humans, potentially making it a relatively efficient use of by-products. But in Brazil, only about 13% of animal by-products were used to make pet food, the study said. The scientists suggested pet food could be made greener by using alternative proteins such as insects. The CO2 emissions from insect production can be 10 times lower than for regular meat. The researchers also said cutting the provision of protein and fat would help, as all the diets analysed provided more of both than is recommended for dogs and cats. Plant proteins have very low environmental impact compared to those from meat and a study published in April found that vegan diets were healthier and safer for dogs, as long as they were nutritionally complete."

            "content": "The world still stands \u201con the brink of climate catastrophe\u201d after the deal reached at the Cop27 UN climate summit on Sunday, and the biggest economies must make fresh commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, climate experts and campaigners have warned. The agreement reached in Sharm el-Sheikh early on Sunday morning, after a marathon final negotiating session that ran 40 hours beyond its deadline, was hailed for providing poor countries for the first time with financial assistance known as loss and damage. A fund will be set up by rich governments for the rescue and rebuilding of vulnerable areas stricken by climate disaster, a key demand of developing nations for the last 30 years of climate talks. But the outcome was widely judged a failure on efforts to cut carbon dioxide, after oil-producing countries and high emitters weakened and removed key commitments on greenhouse gases and phasing out fossil fuels. Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders Group of former world leaders, ex-president of Ireland and twice a UN climate envoy, said: \u201cThe world remains on the brink of climate catastrophe. Progress made on [cutting emissions] has been too slow. We are on the cusp of a clean energy world, but only if G20 leaders live up to their responsibilities, keep their word and strengthen their will. The onus is on them.\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary general of the UN, warned: \u201cOur planet is still in the emergency room. We need to drastically reduce emissions now \u2013 and this is an issue this Cop did not address. The world still needs a giant leap on climate ambition.\u201d Oil-producing countries had thwarted attempts to strengthen the deal, said Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, now chief executive of the European Climate Foundation. \u201cThe influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cThis Cop has weakened requirements around countries making new and more ambitious commitments [on cutting emissions]. The text [of the deal] makes no mention of phasing out fossil fuels, and scant reference to the 1.5C target.\u201d She blamed the host country, Egypt, for allowing its regional alliances to sway the final decision, a claim hotly denied by the hosts. Next year\u2019s conference of the parties under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (Cop) will take place in Dubai, hosted by the United Arab Emirates, one of the world\u2019s biggest oil exporters. Tubiana warned: \u201cThe Egyptian presidency produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the UAE next year.\u201d At the talks, nearly 200 countries agreed that a fund for loss and damage, which would pay out to rescue and rebuild the physical and social infrastructure of countries ravaged by extreme weather events, should be set up within the next year. However, there is no agreement yet on how much money should be paid in, by whom, and on what basis. A key aim for the EU at the talks was to ensure that countries classed as developing in 1992 when the UNFCCC was signed \u2013 and thus given no obligations to act on emissions or provide funds to help others \u2013 are considered potential donors. These could include China, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, and Russia. Under the final agreement, such countries can contribute on a voluntary basis. John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, who tested positive for Covid on Friday night and spent the rest of the summit self-isolating in his hotel, fixed China in his sights in a statement after the conference concluded. \u201cReducing emissions in time is about maths, not ideology. That\u2019s why all nations have a stake in the choices China makes in this critical decade,\u201d he said. China is the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, as well as the world\u2019s second biggest economy, and comes second only to the US in cumulative historical emissions since the industrial revolution. \u201cThe US and China should be able to accelerate progress together, not only for our sake, but for future generations. And we are all hopeful that China will live up to its global responsibility.\u201d Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for the US to work with developing nations to put pressure on China, or climate protection will become impossible. China should be a climate outcast, along with Russia.\u201d Several key commitments championed by the UK, which hosted last year\u2019s Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, were dropped from the final deal, at the behest mainly of Saudi Arabia and other petro-states, though the Guardian understands that China, Russia and Brazil also played a role in weakening some aspects. These included a target for global emissions to peak by 2025, in line with the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the threshold of safety that was the focus of the Glasgow Climate Pact signed last year at Cop26. Although the final text did include the commitment to limiting temperature rises to 1.5C, the language was regarded as weak and marking no progress on the outcome of Cop26 a year ago. Alok Sharma, the UK\u2019s Cop26 president, sacked as a minister by Rishi Sunak, was visibly angry at the close of the conference. \u201cThose of us who came to Egypt to keep 1.5C alive, and to respect what every single one of us agreed to in Glasgow, have had to fight relentlessly to hold the line. We have had to battle to build on one of the key achievements of Glasgow, the call on parties to revisit and strengthen their [national plans on emissions].\u201d In Glasgow, in the final moments a commitment to phase out coal was watered down by China and India to a phase down of coal, a last-minute trial that reduced Sharma to the brink of tears. At Cop27, he joined with efforts to include a phase down of all fossil fuels in the text, but it was reduced in the final stages to a simple repetition of the Glasgow commitment to phase down coal. Sharma listed commitments weakened or lost, hitting the table for emphasis: \u201cWe joined with many parties to propose a number of measures that would have contributed to this. Emissions peaking before 2025, as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text. Clear follow-through on the phase down of coal. Not in this text. A commitment to phase out all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text, weakened in the final minutes [to endorse \u201clow-emissions energy\u201d, which can be interpreted as a reference to gas].\u201d In the end the responsibility will lie with everyone, as Meena Raman of Third World Network, an adviser to developing countries, points out. \u201cSince the EU and Alok Sharma are disappointed that fossil fuel phase-out is not in the text, we would like them to take leadership and revise their NDCs [nationally determined contributions] and put into plans their fossil fuel phase-out urgently and stop expansion of fossil fuels including oil and gas. [It\u2019s] not enough to play to the gallery but act if they really want to save the planet and not hide behind 2050 net zero targets, which will bust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5C.\u201d Sharma concluded: \u201cI said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5C was weak. Unfortunately, it remains on life support.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-22T07:00:44Z",
            "content": "The US, fresh from reversing its 30 years of opposition to a \u201closs and damage\u201d fund for poorer countries suffering the worst impacts of the climate crisis, has signaled that its longstanding image as global climate villain should now be pinned on a new culprit: China. Following years of tumult in which the US refused to provide anything resembling compensation for climate damages, followed by Donald Trump\u2019s removal of the US from the Paris climate agreement, there was a profound shift at the Cop27 UN talks in Egypt, with Joe Biden\u2019s administration agreeing to the new loss and damage fund. The US also backed language in the new agreement, which finally concluded in the early hours of Sunday morning after an often fraught period of negotiations between governments, that would demand the phase-out of all unabated fossil fuels, only to be thwarted by major oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. Despite these stances, the US continued to be the leading target of ire from climate activists who blame it for obstruction and for failing to reckon with its role as history\u2019s largest ever emitter of planet-heating gases. On Friday, the US was given the unwanted title of \u201ccolossal fossil\u201d by climate groups for supposedly failing to push through the loss and damage assistance at Cop27. The US delegation in Sharm el-Sheikh chafed at this image, with John Kerry, Biden\u2019s climate envoy, using his closing remarks to shift the focus on to China, now the world\u2019s largest emitter. Kerry said that \u201call nations have a stake in the choices China makes in this critical decade. The United States and China should be able to accelerate progress together, not only for our sake, but for future generations \u2013 and we are all hopeful that China will live up to its global responsibility.\u201d Kerry and his team were by the end of the talks \u201csick\u201d of shouldering the blame, according to Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC. \u201cSomehow the US became the villain despite aggressive action on emissions, meanwhile Russia and China\u2019s emissions are growing like crazy and yet they are not in the crosshairs of activists, it\u2019s confusing,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean it\u2019s absurd. If we don\u2019t get hold of China\u2019s emissions the climate will spin out of control.\u201d Nate Hultman, who was part of Kerry\u2019s negotiating team for Cop26 last year, said the US entered the climate talks \u201cwith its head held high\u201d after Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act over the summer, which included more than $370bn (\u00a3313bn) in spending to advance renewable energy and electric cars. \u201cThe US is acting as one of the key leaders in getting the climate outcome the world wants, I just reject this caricature of the US being obstructionist,\u201d he said. The US and China, the world\u2019s two largest emitters, had been in a sort of diplomatic deep freeze on climate issues following the visit of Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, to Taiwan in August. Cop27 saw the beginnings of a thaw in this relationship, with the overlapping G20 summit resulting in Biden resuming dialogue with Xi Jinping. China\u2019s emissions are now nearly three times as large as America\u2019s and while it has become the pre-eminent renewable energy superpower, it is ramping up its use of coal at a rate that scientists say will push the world disastrously beyond 1.5C in global heating. \u201cOur planet is still in the emergency room,\u201d said Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary general of the UN, on the lack of progress in cutting emissions in the Cop27 deal. \u201cWe need to drastically reduce emissions now and this is an issue this Cop did not address. The world still needs a giant leap on climate ambition.\u201d China, and many climate activists, point to America\u2019s long history of being the lead carbon polluter and its failure to honor past commitments on climate finance to developing countries strafed by heatwaves, droughts, floods and other impacts. Biden has promised $11bn (\u00a39bn) for this effort, although this spending will probably be blocked by the House of Representatives when it falls under Republican control in January, barring a last-gasp funding deal before Christmas. \u201cA quarter of the CO2 in our atmosphere is red, white and blue,\u201d said Ed Markey, a Democratic senator who visited the Cop27 summit. \u201cThe United States has a moral and planetary responsibility to partner, not prohibit, on equitable climate finance. We cannot leave the countries least responsible for the climate crisis to be sacrifice zones and bear this horrific burden alone.\u201d The summit also saw criticism of a glut of new oil and gas projects in the US, Biden\u2019s call for a short-term leap in oil production to help bring down gasoline prices that have spiked following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and a new carbon-trading scheme announced by Kerry. The carbon offsets \u201cwill only further condemn the African continent and global south nations to a future of pollution and environmental chaos, all for the benefit of the fossil fuel industry and big business,\u201d according to Ozawa Bineshi Albert, co-executive director of the Climate Justice Alliance. Back at home, Biden will face pressure from activists to declare a climate emergency to bypass Republican intransigence and to curb the leases still being liberally handed out for oil and gas drilling. The focus of the president on climate, however, will be \u201cChina, China, China\u201d, according to Bledsoe. \u201cThat is the only game in town, we\u2019ve got to get Beijing to bend its emissions downwards, whatever it takes, even if it\u2019s carbon border tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what, that\u2019s the priority of Biden. If you want to blame two groups for the climate impasse, blame communist China and America\u2019s Republican party. That\u2019s the truth of it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-16T05:00:10Z",
            "content": "The British spy agency GCHQ and weapons manufacturer BAE Systems have issued an appeal to attract more neurodivergent women to work for them in cybersecurity jobs. The employers are actively seeking women on the autism spectrum and women with dyslexia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for cybersecurity roles to address gaps in their workforces. Neurodivergent people often report challenges in work environments. The Office for National Statistics last year reported that 22% of autistic people were in work, the lowest among the disabilities they analysed. However, employers in some industries have in recent years said they are actively seeking neurodivergent applicants. Code First Girls, a social enterprise that works with GCHQ and BAE Systems to increase recruitment of female coders, said employers were looking for neurodivergent women in particular for cybersecurity roles that require \u201cfast pattern recognition, sharper accuracy and greater attention to detail\u201d. BAE Systems said neurodivergent female workers represented \u201can industry gap we are keen to contribute to filling\u201d. GCHQ, or Government Communications Headquarters, first said it was looking to recruit more neurodivergent men and women in 2019, but has now backed a call for women in particular from this group to apply. The Cheltenham-based agency focuses on counter-terrorism, cybersecurity and organised crime. Jo Cavan \u2013 GCHQ\u2019s director of strategy, policy and engagement \u2013 said: \u201cNeurodiversity is key to keeping Britain safe. At GCHQ, some of our most talented and creative people have a neurodiverse profile \u2013 including dyslexia, autism, dyscalculia and dyspraxia [conditions that affect the ability to process different forms of information]. \u201cHaving a diverse team and a mix of minds better equips us to carry out our mission and tackle new and emerging threats posed by terrorists, criminals and hostile states.\u201d Theresa Palmer \u2013 head of diversity and inclusion at BAE Systems\u2019 digital intelligence division \u2013 said cyber industries could benefit particularly from neurodivergent workers. \u201cFemale talent is among the varying types of neurodivergent people we are looking to attract,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cVarying ends of the spectrum offer opportunities across our products and services ensuring that we take the broadest, most common and unique views of the world into account. \u201cSome benefits of our employees\u2019 differences are better pattern recognition, trending, creativity and innovation.\u201d The FTSE 100 company\u2019s growing digital intelligence division sells cybersecurity and data analysis services and software to other companies as well as governments. Other parts of the business build the UK\u2019s nuclear submarines and naval ships, but the company has also attracted controversy for selling weapons and surveillance technologies to foreign governments with poor human rights records. A survey by Code First Girls of 1,250 female coders either studying or in work found that about a fifth identified as neurodivergent. Of those, two-fifths said they have not made their employer or university aware, in some cases because they felt uncomfortable or fearful of being judged. A third said they believed it could affect their career prospects. Code First Girls said that it encouraged employers to offer tools to help neurodivergent workers, including software to map out thought processes or projects, noise-cancelling headphones and voice-to-text or text-to-voice software. \u2022 The headline and text of this article were amended on 22 November 2022 to refer to individuals as neurodivergent, rather than neurodiverse, in line with editorial guidelines."

            "date": "2022-11-06T11:00:18Z",
            "content": "There are mounting fears over the surveillance of delegates at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt, with cybersecurity experts warning that the official app for the talks requires access to a user\u2019s location, photos and even emails upon downloading it. The revelation, as more than 25,000 heads of state, diplomats, negotiators, journalists and activists from around the world gather at the climate summit that starts in Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday, has raised concerns that Egypt\u2019s authoritarian regime will be able to use an official platform for a United Nations event to track and harass attendees and critical domestic voices. The official Cop27 app, which has already been downloaded more than 5,000 times, requires sweeping permissions from users before it installs, including the ability for Egypt\u2019s ministry of communications and information technology to view emails, scour photos and determine users\u2019 locations, according to an expert who analysed it for the Guardian. This data could be used by Abdel Fatah al-Sisi\u2019s regime to further crack down on dissent in a country that already holds about 65,000 political prisoners. Egypt has conducted a series of mass arrests of people accused of being protesters in the lead-up to Cop27 and sought to vet and isolate any activists near the talks, which will see governments attempting to hammer out an agreement over dealing with the climate crisis. \u201cThis is a cartoon super-villain of an app,\u201d said Gennie Gebhart, the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s advocacy director. \u201cThe biggest red flag is the number of permissions required, which is unnecessary for the operation of the app and suggests they are trying to surveil attendees. \u201cNo reasonable person will want to consent to being surveilled by a nation state, or having their emails read by them, but often people click these permissions without thinking much.\u201d She added: \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single good reason why they need these permissions. It\u2019s an open question how this information will be used \u2013 it raises a lot of scary possibilities. It may well have a silencing effect in that people self-censor when they realize they are being watched in this way. It can have a chilling effect.\u201d Hussein Baoumi of Amnesty International told the Guardian that tech operatives working for the rights organisation had examined the app and flagged a number of concerns prior to Cop27. The app was able to access users\u2019 camera, microphone, Bluetooth and location data as well as pair two different apps. \u201cIt can be used for surveillance,\u201d he said. Baoumi added: \u201cThe issues they found were primarily the permissions it asks for. If granted, it allows the app to be used for surveillance against you. It collects data and sends them to two servers, including one in Egypt. The authorities don\u2019t say what they\u2019re doing with this data, and they\u2019re able to use this app for mass data collection from everyone using it.\u201d Amr Magdi of Human Rights Watch said that his organisation had also assessed the app and found that it \u201copens doors for misuse\u201d. Magdi added that conferences like Cop27 are \u201can excellent chance from a security perspective for information gathering,\u201d including for certain activists \u201cthey want to know more about\u201d. Rights activists in Egypt flagged concerns about the Cop27 app almost immediately after it became available. \u201cYou can now download the official #Cop27 mobile app but you must give your full name, email address, mobile number, nationality and passport number. Also you must enable location tracking. And then the first thing you see is this,\u201d tweeted Hossam Baghat, the head of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, linking to an app screen showing the face of the Egyptian president. He then tweeted a screenshot of the app\u2019s terms and conditions, which read: \u201cOur application reserves the right to access customer accounts for technical and administrative purposes and for security reasons.\u201d Digital surveillance of Cop27 attendees comes atop a highly developed infrastructure for dragnet surveillance of Egypt\u2019s citizens\u2019 communications, prompted in large part by Egyptian officials\u2019 fears of the power of digital communications and their relationship with the popular uprising of 2011. This includes deep packet inspection technology provided by an American company in 2013, allowing authorities to monitor all web traffic moving through a network. The Egyptian government also blocks online access to over 500 websites, including the country\u2019s lone independent news outlet Mada Masr, using technology provided by Canadian company Sandvine. Surveillance by major telephone providers such as Vodafone allows the Egyptian authorities direct access to all users\u2019 phone calls, text messages and information. One Cop27 attendee said that Vodafone was distributing free sim cards to conference attendees on arrival in Sharm el-Sheikh airport. \u201cThe Cop27 app is really part of the wider surveillance structure in Egypt,\u201d Baomi said. \u201cThis app is coming from a country doing mass surveillance unapologetically on its own population. It makes sense that, of course, the Egyptian government\u2019s app can be used for surveillance, to collect data and use it for purposes unconnected to Cop27. It\u2019s sad but expected from Egypt.\u201d Rights activists and members of Egyptian civil society critical of the government have been subject to targeted surveillance by the Egyptian authorities for years, raising concerns about the risks for high-profile activists attending Cop27. The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and Citizen Lab identified one \u201congoing and extensive phishing campaign against Egyptian civil society\u201d, in 2017 targeting organizations working on human rights issues, political freedoms and gender as well as individual targets such as lawyers, journalists and activists. Four years later, Citizen Lab identified a fresh targeted hacking attempt against the phone of a prominent former Egyptian opposition leader based overseas. South Sinai governor Khaled Fouda also recently boasted to a domestic cable channel about the level of surveillance at Cop27, including cameras in the back of taxis feeding footage to a local \u201csecurity observatory\u201d. \u201cSisi\u2019s idea of \u2018security\u2019 is mass spying on everyone,\u201d Magdi tweeted in response. The Cop presidency and the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs were approached for comment."

            "date": "2022-11-08T22:21:18Z",
            "content": "A ransomware group has started posting Medibank customer data on the dark web, days after the Australian health insurer announced it would not pay a ransom. The initial dump, limited to a few hundred megabytes, was posted on a blog linked to the Russian ransomware group REvil overnight, after threats were made to release data on Tuesday. The data includes hundreds of names, addresses, birthdates, Medicare numbers and hospital addresses posted as \u201cgood list\u201d and \u201cnaughty list\u201d. The alleged hacker said the data is currently stored in a \u201cnot very understandable format\u201d of table dumps, and they will continue to post data partially. \u201cNeed some time to do it pretty.\u201d Medibank has said 9.7 million current and former customers are affected by the breach. That includes 5.1 million Medibank customers, 2.8 million ahm customers, and 1.8 million international customers. The insurer says health claims for about 160,000 Medibank customers, 300,000 ahm customers and 20,000 international customers were accessed. The information exposed includes service provider names and codes associated with diagnosis and procedures. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup There were also 5,200 My Home Hospital patients who had their personal and health data accessed, and 2,900 next of kin of these patients who had some contact details accessed. The hacker also posted screenshots of what they claimed were communications between themselves and Medibank over the release of the data. The last contact was on 7 November \u2013 the day Medibank publicly announced it would not pay the ransom. Medibank confirmed that the files released appear to be the sample of data originally provided to the insurer by the hacker. The data includes Medicare numbers for ahm customers, some passport numbers for international students, and some health claims data, Medibank said. \u201cWe expect the criminal to continue to release files on the dark web,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The Medibank CEO, David Koczkar, apologised to customers. \u201cThis is a criminal act designed to harm our customers and cause distress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take seriously our responsibility to safeguard our customers and we stand ready to support them.\u201d Medibank said customers should be vigilant that they might be targeted by scammers via phone, email or texts from unknown or suspicious numbers. Koczkar told Guardian Australia on Monday paying a ransom could result in customers or other businesses being targeted. \u201cYou just can\u2019t trust the criminals. Our advice is that not paying the ransom will provide the best security for our customers and also other Australians,\u201d he said. Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert and founder of Haveibeenpwned.com, posted on Twitter that the release of the data was \u201cas about as bad as we feared it would get\u201d. Medibank has said that not paying the ransom is in line with the advice of cybersecurity experts and the Australian government. The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, told the parliament in question time that she \u201ccannot articulate the disgust I have for the scumbags who are at the heart of this criminal act.\u201d O\u2019Neil said the government had been preparing for the eventuality of the data being published, and a \u201cnational coordination mechanism\u201d had been put in place between Home Affairs and the Health Department, that includes protecting government data, coordinating with state police, working with those people who are affected, and providing mental health support and counselling. She said both herself and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, are Medibank customers. The eSafety commissioner will also be included in the mechanism, and O\u2019Neil urged the social media and traditional media companies not to publish personal information from the data. \u201cI have said before we are about five years behind where we should be with regard to cybersecurity and there is a power of work under way at the moment to change that. We are working hard to protect you and to protect our country.\u201d Cybersecurity company Sophos\u2019 State of Ransomware 2022 report found that 46% of organisations who were hit with ransomware attacks chose to pay the ransom, but only 4% received all their data back unencrypted. The Australian federal police announced on Wednesday that it would expand Operation Guardian \u2013 which was set up to protect the 10,000 Optus customers who had their personal information posted online earlier this year \u2013 to those Medibank customers exposed. \u201cOperation Guardian will be actively monitoring the clear, dark and deep web for the sale and distribution of Medibank Private and Optus data,\u201d AFP assistant commissioner cyber command Justine Gough said in a statement. \u201cLaw enforcement will take swift action against anyone attempting to benefit, exploit or commit criminal offences using stolen Medibank Private data.\u201d Gough also said people should not try to download or access the data themselves, saying it may constitute a criminal offence. \u201cWe use the powers and authorities of all of our agencies to disrupt the sale and distribution of the unlawfully obtained data,\u2019\u2019 Gough said. On Tuesday, the Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, told Senate estimates that Operation Palladius had been launched to investigate the Medibank data breach. The agency also has separate investigations under way for the Optus and MyDeal data breaches. \u201cThe AFP has invested significant resources into these investigations, which will be long and complex,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-11-29T01:17:45Z",
            "content": "One month after a cyber-attack brought down government servers and websites in Vanuatu, frustrated officials were still using private Gmail accounts, personal laptops, pen and paper, and typewriters to run the government of the prime minister, Ishmael Kalsakau, who came into office just a few days after the crash. The malware attack on state networks has caused delays in communication and coordination in the Pacific island nation of 314,000 people and 80 islands. People resorted to the online Yellow Pages or the hard copy phone directory to locate government phone numbers. Some offices were running from their Facebook pages and Twitter. The problems began about a month ago, when suspicious phishing activity was first noticed in emails to the Ministry of Finance, according to a financial analyst who works closely with the ministry\u2019s cybersecurity teams. The malware crashed nearly all government email and website archives. Many departments were still using local computer drives to store data, as opposed to web servers or the cloud. No official information has been released on whether ransom demands were made by the hackers. \u201cIt is taking longer for payments [from the Ministry of Finance] to get out, but \u2026 we are always on Vanuatu time anyway,\u201d said the financial analyst. Government departments have struggled to stay connected, frustrating officials, with impromptu solutions being implemented for communication between agencies and departments. Many outer islands government offices are experiencing sharp delays in services. \u201cIt was chaos during the first few days but the entire government made alternative Gmail accounts or used their private emails. We are all using telephones and mobile phones for communication. But we are resilient in Vanuatu as a small country and can manage this,\u201d said Olivia Finau, a communications officer in the Ministry of Climate Change. \u201cOur department is communicating with the public more now with Facebook and Twitter, and we are actually getting more followers.\u201d The attack did not crash civilian infrastructure, such as airline or hotel websites. Most tourism and business has continued as usual into the busy Christmas and New Year period. The current system can be remedied by upgrading software and putting files on to the cloud for managing, said the analyst. But local officials do not have the expertise to do this and \u201cneed outside assistance\u201d. The government previously reported that the attack occurred on 5 November, but a computer technician at the Office of the Government\u2019s Chief Information Officer and a foreign diplomat confirmed to the Guardian that the crash actually came on Sunday 30 October. In the first few days of the crisis, some Vanuatu authorities attributed the issue to poor weather damaging internet infrastructure. However, the diplomat said: \u201cWe noticed there was a problem right away \u2026 our team recognised this as having the hallmarks of a cyber-attack, and not being caused by weather.\u201d Gaps in internal communications in the days that followed the attack compounded matters. Prime minister Kalsakau formally came into power on 4 November, and on 5 November the government officially recognised the problem. Australia\u2019s government has made offers of assistance. \u201cWe sent in a team to assist with that disgraceful cyber-attack and the response and we are working through the process of bringing the government IT systems back up to speed,\u201d Pat Conroy, Australia\u2019s minister for international development and the Pacific, told local newspaper Vanuatu Daily. Cyber-attacks have wreaked havoc globally in recent years and Vanuatu\u2019s attack will serve as a warning to small nations across the Pacific who have even weaker cybersecurity than Port Vila. The Vanuatu Office of the Government Chief Information Office (OGCIO) did not respond to requests for comment."

            "content": "Nearly 10 million Australians have had their private health data hacked \u2013 with sensitive medical records detailing treatments for alcoholism, drug addictions, and pregnancy terminations already posted online \u2013 in a cyber-attack believed to have been coordinated from Russia. The Australian Federal Police have said they know the identity of the Russian ransomware criminal organisation that hacked into the databases of Medibank, Australia\u2019s largest private health insurer, stealing customer data over weeks inside the company\u2019s computer systems. After Medibank refused to pay a demanded ransom of US$9.7m \u2013 US$1 for every one of the 9.7 million people whose information has been compromised \u2013 the hackers have begun releasing sensitive data on the dark web. Two initial tranches were posted on Wednesday to a dark web blog linked to the REvil Russian ransomware group: a so-called \u201cnaughty list\u201d that detailed people\u2019s treatment for drug addictions or mental health issues, and a \u201cgood list\u201d that contained more generic hospital procedure claims. Each list contained data from about 100 Medibank customers. On Thursday, the hackers posted another file labelled \u201cabortions.csv\u201d containing more than 300 claims made by policyholders in relation to the termination of pregnancies, including non-viable pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and miscarriages. On Friday, a further list was posted on the dark web \u2013 \u201cboozy.csv\u201d \u2013 containing files associated with 240 customers related to alcoholism-related treatment. Medibank has said the data of 9.7 million current and former customers has been hacked: they have had their names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses and addresses stolen. Some customers\u2019 unique numbers for Medicare \u2013 Australia\u2019s universal public healthcare scheme \u2013 have also been stolen, along with the passport information of international customers. The hackers have also accessed the health claims of about 160,000 Medibank customers, about 300,000 customers of its subsidiary company, ahm, and data from 20,000 international customers. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, himself a Medibank customer, said he was \u201cdisgusted by the perpetrators of this criminal act\u201d. \u201cWe know where they\u2019re coming from, we know who is responsible and we say that they should be held to account.\u201d The Australian Federal Police (AFP) commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said on Friday to the hackers: \u201cWe know who you are.\u201d \u201cWe believe those responsible for the breach are in Russia,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra, but declined to name the alleged perpetrators saying it would jeopardise an ongoing investigation. \u201cWe believe we know which individuals are responsible \u2026 our intelligence points to a group of loosely affiliated cybercriminals who are likely responsible for past significant breaches in countries across the world.\u201d Kershaw said the attack was likely not limited to Russian soil, and that some affiliates of the organisation may be operating in other countries. He said the AFP was working in cooperation with the national central bureau of Interpol in Moscow. Kershaw said the AFP had \u201cruns on the scoreboard\u201d in extraterritorial investigations. The AFP has successfully extradited people from Poland, Serbia, and the UAE in recent years to face criminal \u2013 mainly drug-related \u2013 charges in Australia. But the chances of extraditing Russian hackers appear remote. In 2018, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said \u201cRussia does not extradite its citizens to anyone.\u201d Kershaw said Australian government policy did not condone paying ransoms to cybercriminals. \u201cAny ransom payment, small or large, fuels a cybercrime business model, putting other Australians at risk.\u201d The AFP has expanded Operation Guardian \u2013 set up in September to protect 10,000 customers of telecommunications company Optus who had their personal information posted online earlier this year \u2013 to assist Medibank customers. Australia\u2019s cybersecurity minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, vowed those behind the \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d cyber hack would be caught. \u201cI want the scumbags behind this attack to know that the smartest and toughest people in this country are coming after you,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to say, particularly to the women whose private health information has been compromised \u2026 as the minister for cybersecurity but more importantly, as a woman, this should not have happened, and I know this is a really difficult time.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-29T01:24:38Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden called on Congress to intervene and block a railroad strike before next month\u2019s deadline in the stalled contract talks, saying a strike would \u201cdevastate our economy\u201d. Biden\u2019s move comes as business groups have warned that the looming strike would hit just before the holiday season and worsen the US\u2019s inflation problems. \u201cLet me be clear: a rail shutdown would devastate our economy,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cWithout freight rail, many US industries would shut down.\u201d The strike comes after long-running negotiations reached an impasse and both sides agreed to a cooling-off period that ends next week. Congress has the power to impose contract terms on the workers, but it\u2019s not clear what lawmakers might include if they do. They could also force the negotiations to continue into the new year. Both the unions and railroads have been lobbying Congress while contract talks continue. Four rail unions that represent more than half of the 115,000 workers in the industry have rejected the deals that Biden helped broker before the original strike deadline in September and are back at the table trying to work out new agreements. Eight other unions have approved their five-year deals with the railroads and are in the process of getting back pay for their workers for the 24% raises that are retroactive to 2020. Last month the Biden administration said it was up to unions and the rail companies to reach an agreement. In his statement Biden said that as \u201ca proud pro-labor president\u201d he was reluctant to override the views of people who voted against the agreement. \u201cBut in this case \u2013 where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families \u2013 I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal.\u201d Biden\u2019s remarks came after a coalition of more than 400 business groups sent a letter to congressional leaders on Monday urging them to step into the stalled talks because of fears about the devastating potential impact of a strike that could force many businesses to shut down if they cannot get the rail deliveries they need. Commuter railroads and Amtrak would also be affected in a strike because many of them use tracks owned by the freight railroads. The business groups, led by the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation, said even a short-term strike would have a tremendous impact and the economic pain would start to be felt even before the 9 December strike deadline. They said the railroads would stop hauling hazardous chemicals, fertilizers and perishable goods up to a week beforehand to keep those products from being stranded somewhere along the tracks. \u201cA potential rail strike only adds to the headwinds facing the US economy,\u201d the businesses wrote. \u201cA rail stoppage would immediately lead to supply shortages and higher prices. The cessation of Amtrak and commuter rail services would disrupt up to 7 million travelers a day. Many businesses would see their sales disrupted right in the middle of the critical holiday shopping season.\u201d On Monday, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) trade group praised Biden\u2019s action. \u201cNo one benefits from a rail work stoppage \u2013 not our customers, not rail employees and not the American economy,\u201d said the AAR\u2019s president and chief executive, Ian Jefferies. \u201cNow is the appropriate time for Congress to pass legislation to implement the agreements already ratified by eight of the 12 unions.\u201d The unions have asked the railroads to consider adding paid sick time to what they already offered to address some of the workers\u2019 quality-of-life concerns. But so far, the railroads, which include Union Pacific, BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX and Kansas City Southern, have refused to consider that. The railroads want any deal to closely follow the recommendations a Biden-appointed special board of arbitrators made this summer that called for the 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses but did not resolve workers\u2019 concerns about demanding schedules they say make it hard to take a day off and other working conditions.

            "date": "2022-11-05T07:00:05Z",
            "content": "With the Federal Reserve leading the world\u2019s central banks in a tightening cycle of interest rate rises, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen since 2006, commentators across the political spectrum are noting the fondness of the Fed chair, Jerome \u201cJay\u201d Powell, for his legendary predecessor, Paul Volcker. On the left, the comparison is fearful; on the center and on the right, it\u2019s one of admiration. But circumstances don\u2019t really support the comparison. On taking office in October 1979, Volcker declared \u201cthe standard of living of the average American has to decline\u201d as a consequence of the war against the chronic inflation of the 1970s. He quickly set to work making that happen by driving interest rates up towards 20% and creating the deepest US recession since the 1930s. That squeeze did put an end to high inflation but at a tremendous social cost. Six million people lost their jobs over the next three years, taking the unemployment rate from 6% to almost 11% in late 1982. The cost wasn\u2019t merely short-term. About half of those job losses were categorized as permanent, as opposed to being temporary layoffs, many of them in the manufacturing heartland. The term \u201crust belt\u201d entered common usage. Volcker was appointed by Jimmy Carter, who seemed to have no idea of what he was getting himself into. His friend and adviser, the Georgia banker Bert Lance, prophetically warned him that he was dooming his prospects in the 1980s election. But Carter listened to the consensus of Wall Street and the political class \u2013 Volcker was the man to tame inflation, which was running around 13% at the end of 1979. The US had seen inflation rates that high before, but never outside of major wars or their immediate aftermath. Inflation, which was under 2% in 1965, had been rising relentlessly for 15 years, barely pausing even in the nasty recession of the mid-1970s. Contrary to a belief popular on the left, that inflation was not kind to workers. Wages badly lagged prices, and real average hourly earnings fell 14% between 1973 and 1980. There are some similarities between the present and 40 years ago. Then, as now, food and energy prices were important factors in sparking inflation, but in both cases, even if you strip out those two volatile components, a severe inflation remains. And in both cases, polls have shown inflation to be deeply unpopular. But there are also major differences, notably in the strength of labor. At the end of the 1970s, almost a quarter of all workers were unionized; now only about a tenth are. Then, an average of 22,000 workdays were lost to strikes every year; last year it was just 1,500 \u2013 a decline of 93%. The early 1980s recession hammered the bargaining power of the working class. Unions were busted, and we went from a time when Take This Job and Shove It could be a hit song (as it was in 1977) to one where workers were grateful to have any job at all, no matter how tenuous and low-paying. As the recession ended in late 1982, the stock market took off and the employer class began a 40-year celebration of its triumph. That\u2019s not the world Powell finds himself in. Inflation has been a problem for close to 15 months rather than 15 years, and although there are some tentative signs of life in the labor movement \u2013 notably at one Amazon site and a few hundred Starbucks outlets (out of 9,000) \u2013 the share of the labor force represented by unions fell last year, and strike activity so far in 2022 is about a third lower than in 2021. Unlike the inflation of the 1970s, this is not the wage-push kind (to use the jargon). It\u2019s been driven first by supply chain blockages, thanks to Covid, and extended by embargoes against Russian energy exports, and most workers are just looking on helplessly as their paychecks fail to keep up with price increases. There\u2019s another difference as well: we\u2019re coming off a decade of extremely indulgent monetary policy. Coming out of the Great Recession, the Fed kept short-term interest rates near zero between 2011 and 2021, with the brief exception when they pushed them up to just over 2% in 2017 and 2018 (still quite low by historical standards). On top of that, the central bank pumped over $3tn (\u00a32.7tn) into the financial markets between 2008 and 2015, and almost $5tn between early 2020 and early 2022. The earlier pumping was meant to prevent a financial implosion after the sub-prime crisis, and the latter to counter the threats of the early pandemic months. But the result of both has been to stimulate crazy inflation in asset prices \u2013 stocks, crypto, unicorns, housing \u2013 a remarkable waste of capital and one that can be very risky to deflate. Decades of bailouts have convinced financial market players that the Fed will always come in to rescue them and reversing that mentality could require a Volckerish austerity for Wall Street \u2013 one that\u2019s politically hard to imagine. What Powell is up to now bears almost no resemblance to Volcker\u2019s clampdown. The federal funds rate, the interest rate at which banks lend each other money overnight \u2013 that is the Fed\u2019s most direct policy target \u2013 changed from just above 0% to just under 4% after raising the target rate another 0.75 points this week. That\u2019s almost 15 points below the Volcker peak. In real terms \u2013 deducting the rate of inflation \u2013 Volcker\u2019s peak was almost 10%, a lot higher. Right now, the real fed funds rate is around -4% (yes, that\u2019s a negative sign). Powell may admire Volcker, but next to him, he\u2019s a piker. The debate over monetary policy overlooks a more important issue. That decade of cheap money papered over a lot of fundamental problems with the US economy: low levels of public and private investment, massive polarization between rich and poor and unstable employment for much of the labor force. These should be addressed with serious public policy, not by printing money. It would be nice if we talked about that, but given the degraded state of American political discourse, I\u2019m not hopeful. Doug Henwood is an economic journalist based in Brooklyn.

            "date": "2022-11-15T15:08:00Z",
            "content": "Time to wrap up\u2026 here are today\u2019s main stories: Prices at the wholesale level rose 8% in October from a year ago, the fourth straight decline and the latest sign that inflation pressures in the United States are easing from painfully high levels, Associated Press report. The annual figure is down from 8.4% in September. On a monthly basis, the government said Tuesday that its producer price index, which measures costs before they reach consumers, rose 0.2% in October from September. That was same as in the previous month, which was revised down from an initial reading of 0.4%. The figures came in lower than economists expected and make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will increase its benchmark interest rate in smaller increments. It has hiked its short-term rate by three-quarters of a point for four meetings in a row, but economists now increasingly foresee an increase of a half-point at its December meeting. Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting firm, says: \u201cThe improvement in the October inflation data, if it persists, supports the Fed\u2019s expectation of a step down in the pace of increases going forward.\u201d Most of the monthly increase reflected higher gas prices at the wholesale level, which rose 5.7% just in October. The cost of new cars fell 1.5%, last month, which could lead to lower prices at the retail level as well. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core producer prices were unchanged in October from September, the lowest reading in nearly two years. Core prices increased 6.7% last month from a year ago, down from a 7.1% annual rate in September. The cost of services, such as hotels, air travel, and health care, slipped 0.1% in October from September, the first drop since November 2020. Stocks have opened higher in New York, as traders hail the drop in PPI inflation. The S&amp;P 500 index of US stocks has jumped 1.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial averaeg of 30 major companies is 1% higher. Tech stocks, which are vulnerable to higher interest rates, are among the risers, lifting the Nasdaq by 2.5%. Greg Daco of EY Parthenon confirms that US producer price inflation cooled more than expected last month: Wall Street futures have jumped too, with the Nasdaq 100 index of tech shares expected to surge 3% at the open. The dollar has extended its losses following the drop in US PPI inflation, sending the pound up to $1.20 for the first time since mid August. Traders are banking that inflation is slowing, which will allow the Fed to ease off on interest rate rises soon. Just in: American producers eased off on their price rises last month, in another sign that inflation could have peaked. US producer price inflation slowed to 8% in October, down from 8.4% in September. On a monthly basis, PPI rose by 0.2%. Goods inflation rose, driven by more expensive gasoline, but services prices actually fell by 0.1% in the month, the first fall in almost two years. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics epxlains: In October, 60 percent of the increase in prices for final demand goods is attributable to the index for gasoline, which rose 5.7 percent. Prices for diesel fuel, fresh and dry vegetables, residential electric power, chicken eggs, and oil field and gas field machinery also advanced. In contrast, the index for passenger cars declined 1.5 percent. The US Federal Reserve will also be encouraged to see that core producer price inflation fell. PPI, stripping out food and energy, dropped to 6.7% year-on-year, down from 7.2%. The record disparity between UK public and private sector pay rises (2.2% vs 6.6%) will continue to widen, fears Paula Bejarano Carbo, associate economist at NIESR. We expect this disparity to continue growing through the fourth quarter of this year, undoubtedly causing further strain to many public sector workers struggling to cope with the cost-of-living crisis. Given the expected departmental spending cuts in the Chancellor\u2019s upcoming Autumn Statement, this trend bodes poorly for public sector workers \u2013 who are increasingly resorting to industrial action to bargain for higher wages.\u201d Sterling has climbed to its highest level against the US dollar since mid-August, as the US currency continues to slide. The pound has gained one and a half cents to $1.1904, and is also up half a euro cent at \u20ac1.1436. The pound has rallied after UK regular pay rose at the fastest pace in a year (although still behind inflation). That could encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates again in December. The dollar, though, has fallen back from recent 20-year highs in recent sessions after US inflation fell faster than expected in October. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard indicated on Monday that the central bank could soon slow the pace of its interest rate increases, which put the dollar on the back foot. The dollar\u2019s weakness was also due to \u201cUkraine taking it to the Russians\u201d, says Brad Bechtel of Jefferies. The liberation of Kherson has lifted hopes that Russia could suffer a catastrophic political defeat. The UK is spending in debt interest \u00a322bn more in the year to date than at the same time last year, Jeremy Hunt has said. Speaking at Treasury questions in the House of Commons, Hunt said Thursday\u2019s autumn statement would show a pathway to debt reduction. The chancellor explains: Margaret Thatcher said that there is nothing moral about spending money you do not have and that is precisely because of what she says that it passes on the burden to future generations to pay it back. \u201cCurrently, our debt to GDP ratio is about 98% and we are currently spending \u00a322bn more on debt interest in the year to date than at the same time last year. That\u2019s more than the entire budget of the Home Office, Hunt added. Soaring inflation has pushed up the debt repayment bill, as the interest rate on some government debt is linked to the RPI inflation measure, which hit 12.6% in September. Rishi Sunak has urged UK executives to rein in excessive pay awards, as the government tried to cool inflation. He\u2019s in Bali for the G20 leaders\u2019 meeting. When it was put to him that there has been a big rise in the value of City bonuses, he told ITV that executives should show pay restraint. Of course I would say to all executives to embrace pay restraint at a time like this and make sure they are also looking after all their workers. In a situation like this, I\u2019m sure executives of most companies will be thinking about pay settlements for senior management, for their workers and making sure they are fair. However, the government is still scrapping the UK\u2019s bankers\u2019 bonus cap \u2013 one of the few changes in the mini-budget that weren\u2019t reversed. Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details: Astonishingly, champagne maker Mo\u00ebt Hennessy says it\u2019s running out of some vintages as wealthy drinkers celebrate the winding back of pandemic restrictions. It\u2019s another clear sign of the unequal economy, with the rich splashing out more on luxury goods and services even as millions face falling real wages. Bloomberg has the story: \u201cWe are running out of stock,\u201d for some top champagnes, Mo\u00ebt Hennessy chief executive Philippe Schaus said in an interview with Bloomberg Television at the New Economy Forum in Singapore, adding that the current period has been dubbed the \u201croaring 20s\u201d internally. There\u2019s good news on the horizon too, with the new year set to see supply replenished, he said. After an initial slump in the early days of the pandemic, the biggest names in luxury are reporting a spending frenzy as consumers unleash pent-up demand. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE managed to beat analyst estimates at four of its five main divisions in its most recent earnings, while Herm\u00e8s International saw revenue surge 24%, excluding currency swings, despite increasing a raft of product prices. Back in February, City bars reported a boom in champagne sales as bankers celebrates bumper bonuses, even as food banks warned of surging demand from struggling households. And even luxury yacht-makers have reported a jump in demand in the pandemic. Today\u2019s economic data shows the folly of imposing more austerity on the UK, says economics professor David Blanchflower, a former policymaker at the Bank of England. Company insolvencies are increasing as the UK heads into an economic downturn, withouh the pandemic-era business protection measures, says Claire Burden, partner in the advisory consulting team at Evelyn Partners. Burden points out that some business owners have been using their personal wealth to keep their businesses running, such as selling or remortaging their home: 242 companies entered compulsory liquidation in the last month, four times as many as in October last year, as winding-up petitions presented by HMRC increase. The liquidation statistics are particularly concerning after Evelyn Partners research suggests an increase in owner funding across the market, as businesses face challenges accessing capital. For instance, a survey of more than 500 UK business owners with revenues of \u00a35m upwards shows that UK business owners are taking measures to invest their personal wealth into their businesses before letting staff go or cutting wages: Some \u201czombie firms\u201d who were kept running through the pandemic by government support are now failing, says Chris Tate, restructuring and insolvency partner at Azets. Commenting on October\u2019s jump in insolvencies, Tate says: \u201cThis continued increase in corporate insolvencies versus pre-pandemic levels is primarily fuelled by a rise in Creditor Voluntary Liquidations (CVLs), a terminal process whereby there is often very little recovered by creditors. \u201cA proportion of these liquidations relate to businesses that would have failed sooner were it not for the government support measures, which, while they were instrumental in providing businesses much needed support, inadvertently propped up ailing businesses which were likely destined to fail in any event. \u201cThis is also reflected in the recent increase in compulsory liquidations, partly driven by banks and HMRC taking more proactive recovery action. \u201cThe smaller number of Administrations and Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs), seen as rescue tools to salvage viable businesses, suggests the pandemic will likely have significantly increased numbers of heavily debt burdened zombie businesses, now limping on with marginal prospects of a return to good health.\u201d The cost of living squeeze is now driving some companies out of business, explains Nicky Fisher, vice president of R3, the insolvency and restructuring trade body. \u201cA series of economic issues, the end of temporary insolvency legislation, and a lack of a post-COVID bounce have hit all parts of the economy and the supply chain hard, and have resulted in more directors choosing to close their businesses and more creditors calling in debts as a means of balancing their own books. \u201cThe current outlook is tough for many businesses as costs rise and consumer confidence remains low. Worries about the price of food and fuel as winter approaches means many people are saving their money ahead of their bills coming in and simply aren\u2019t spending \u2013 and a range of businesses, including household names, are struggling as a result. \u201cOn top of this, business owners are worried about the economy, the prospect of an imminent and prolonged recession, and where they\u2019ll find the money to meet employees\u2019 requests for increased pay as their own costs of living increase. Nearly 2,000 companies in England and Wales collapsed last month in the face of a weakening economy, and soaring inflation. There were 1,948 company insolvencies across England and Wales last month, the Insolvency Service has reported today, up from September\u2019s total of 1,684. That\u2019s 38% more than in October 2021, when there were restrictions on winding up companies during the pandemic, and also 32% higher than in 2019. It shows that companies in England and Wales face a \u201cworsening situation\u201d, says Jeremy Whiteson, restructuring and insolvency partner at city law firm Fladgate: It would be unsurprising if the situation was worsening for businesses and this was not merely a blip. High fuel prices, inflation, labour shortages, post-Brexit difficulties with international shipping, uncertainty in capital markets, raising interest rates and geo-political uncertainty all pose difficulties for businesses. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are a growing number of businesses in financial distress - although many are not yet reaching for formal insolvency procedures. Voluntary liquidations made up the bulk of the insolvencies, with companies deciding to be wound up because they could not meet their obligations to creditors. But there were 242 compulsory liquidations \u2013 more than four times as many as in October 2021. David Hudson, restructuring Partner at FRP Advisory says inflation is hurting businesses badly: \u201cOn the ground inflation is devastating margins and throwing into doubt historically sound business models, which is eating away at confidence, undermining recovery plans and, crucially, testing the resolve of lenders. The latest insolvency figures show what many business leaders have been witnessing on the ground for some time now, conditions on the economic frontline are stormy. The Chancellor faces an unenviable task on Thursday to steady the ship.\u201d Two in five established businesses are concerned that they could face insolvency or mass redundancies as the UK enters into a recession, according to a recent survey from Allica Bank. People looking to secure a Tesco Christmas slot this morning have complained of a queue of over 100,000 by 6am and a crashing site, PA Media report. Delivery Saver customers were told they could book a slot from 6am on November 15, but some complained that the queue was opened before the advertised time. Posting on Twitter, one customer said: \u201cI logged on at 5.59 (am) to get ready only to find over 135,000 in the queue already.\u201d By 6.13am, users were posting screenshots that showed the queue was up to 180,000 people. Shortly after 9am a customer posted: \u201cI got on after a 2.5 hour wait. Managed to get a slot on the 21st (22 and 23 already fully booked).\u201d Others complained they spent time waiting in the queue only to be kicked out: A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re currently seeing a high number of visits to our website and Groceries app and some customers are temporarily having difficulty logging on or placing orders. \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry about this. There are still slots available for both home delivery and click &amp; collect over the Christmas period and we\u2019re working to get things back up and running as quickly as we can. In the meantime, we recommend that customers use our website to place their order.\u201d The number of working days lost to strikes in the UK has risen to the highest in more than a decade as pay growth in the public sector falls behind the private sector at the sharpest rate on record. The Office for National Statistics said more than half a million days were lost to industrial disputes in August and September as annual wage growth fails to keep pace with the soaring cost of living. In the final snapshot of the jobs market before the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, delivers his autumn statement on Thursday, the figures suggested public sector workers were bearing the brunt of the cost of living emergency thanks to much weaker pay growth than the economy at large. The annual rate of pay growth, excluding bonuses, in the private sector rose to 6.6% in the three months to September, compared with 2.2% for the public sector. Excluding the Covid pandemic, when economic data was distorted by furlough and changes in the workforce, the ONS said this was the biggest difference it had experienced. Here\u2019s the full story: Here\u2019s a neat round-up of today\u2019s UK unemployment report, from Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies: (or you can scroll back to 7.32am for full coverage) The oil market is facing unprecedented uncertainty as Europe prepares to ban imports of Russian oil by sea, and the G7 move towards a price cap. That\u2019s the warning from the International Energy Agency today, as the energy markets already wrestle with high prices and a weaker global economy In its monthly report, the IEA says: \u201cThe approaching EU embargoes on Russian crude and oil product imports and a ban on maritime services will add further pressure on global oil balances, and, in particular, on already exceptionally tight diesel markets. \u201cA proposed oil price cap may help alleviate tensions, yet a myriad of uncertainties and logistical challenges remain ... the range of uncertainty has never been so large.\u201d With economic headwinds mounting, the IEA predicts that demand growth will slow to 1.6 million barrels per day in 2023, down from 2.1 million b/d this year. It says: China\u2019s persistently weak economy, Europe\u2019s energy crisis, burgeoning product cracks and the strong US dollar are all weighing heavily on consumption. Tomato ketchup fans will agree with Jeremy Hunt that inflation has an \u2018insidious\u2019 impact. The cost of Heinz tomato ketchup in UK supermarkets has shot up 53% since 2020, making it the biggest riser in of a list of leading branded groceries. Two other Heinz products also made the top 10 in the index of average price rises compiled by the consumer group Which? \u2013 the brand\u2019s cream of chicken and tomato soups. The research comes four months after the company\u2019s products temporarily disappeared from the shelves of Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, in a row over price increases. Heinz was thought to have been seeking cost price rises of as much as 30% in the summer. Which? found that its list of 79 popular branded products exceeded the overall rate of grocery price inflation, with none rising less than 22%. More here: The slowdown in the jobs market could also further depress the housing market. Prices have already started falling, while the drop in real wages makes it harder for save for deposits. Just over 2m mortgages, around a quarter of the total, come to the end of their fixed term by the end of 2023, and are \u201clikely to be refinancing at much higher rates\u201d, the Bank of England has warned. Neal Hudson, a UK housing market analyst, said: \u201cIn isolation, these higher mortgage rates would cause hardship for some households, but the impact on the wider housing market and economy could be managed. \u201cHowever, alongside higher mortgage rates, there is the cost of living crisis, with high inflation and increasing energy costs alongside rapidly rising rents. And it now looks like we can add public spending cuts and pay caps to the list. The prospects for the housing market and economy are looking scary \u2013 and any deterioration in one will feed through to the other.\u201d My colleages Julia Kollewe and Mabel Banfield-Nwachi have looked at the situation, here: More GDP data: The Dutch economy shrank 0.2% on a quarterly basis in the third quarter. Rising interest rates slowed the Netherland\u2019s housing market and surging inflation hit consumption. Soaring inflation has also hammered Japan\u2019s economy. Japanese GDP shrank unexpectedly, by 0.3%, in the third quarter of the year, new figures show. The global slowdown hit businesses, while the weak yen drove up the cost of imports. It means that Japan and Britain were the only two G7 countries not to grow in July-September, with UK GDP falling 0.2%. Mobile phone operator Vodafone has cut its forecasts as economic woes rise, and announced a \u20ac1bn cost-cutting drive. Vodafone warns that the global macroeconomic climate has worsened in the face of rising energy costs and broader inflation. It has lowered its core earnings guidance, and its predictions for free cash flow. Nick Read, Vodafone\u2019s chief executive, says the macroeconomic environment is challenging \u2013 with Vodafone lifting its prices across Europe in response to higher inflation: We are taking a number of steps to mitigate the economic backdrop of high energy costs and rising inflation. These include taking pricing action across Europe, whilst at the same time supporting our most vulnerable customers and driving energy efficiency measures across the business. We are also announcing today a new cost savings target of \u20ac1+ billion focused on streamlining and further simplifying the Group. Shares in Vodafone are down 5%. Minister for Employment, Guy Opperman MP, says: \u201cThe UK labour market has remained resilient in the face of global challenges, with a low unemployment rate and a record number of people on payrolls. \u201cWhilst these figures are encouraging, we recognise that families are facing rising prices and employers need support to fill vacancies with a reliable workforce. Our focus is on making sure people looking for work, and those already in work, have the opportunity to boost their skills and keep more of what they earn \u2013 helped by our extensive network of Jobcentres. \u201cOur priority will always be to support the most vulnerable and we recognise that people are struggling with rising prices, which is why we are protecting millions of those most in need with at least \u00a31,200 of direct payments.\u201d The UK jobs market will come under more pressure as winter draws in, and increased energy bills starting to really bite businesses\u2019 bottom line, warns Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot: In real terms, total pay fell by 2.6% and regular pay fell by 2.7%. This remains one of the largest falls in pay since 2001. Although there was growth in average pay this growth is totally eclipsed by the inflation we are experiencing, meaning that people\u2019s pay packets simply will not stretch so far. Although the UK is not officially in recession it looks almost certain that we are heading for one. The budget on Thursday will further illustrate the precarious financial position the UK is in and while this fiscal event will hopefully be better welcomed by the markets compared to the mini-budget delivered by Truss and Kwarteng, it is certainly going to spell pain for public services and bring higher taxes for all further muddying the picture as we head into winter. Today\u2019s UK jobs report shows \u2018tentative signs\u2019 of an economic slowdown, explains Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor. Despite fears of a looming recession, the labour market has remained very tight post pandemic driven by the Great Resignation after Covid as well as Brexit which have reduced the available pool of potential employees in the UK, creating a worker shortage and thereby pushing up job vacancies and flattering the unemployment rate. This has also given workers much more bargaining power when it comes to wage negotiations, allowing employees to demand higher wages to cover the increasing cost of living, especially in the private sector. However, we are beginning to see tentative signs of an economic slowdown come through in the labour market figures now with job vacancies retreating from the highs as businesses make cutbacks and reduce hiring and with the unemployment rate surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations. And although wages are rising sharply, they are still falling short of inflation, representing a real pay cut both in the private and public sector. No doubt Jeremy Hunt will claim both the low unemployment rate and high wage growth as victories for the government when he delivers his Autumn Statement on Thursday. But underneath the surface, the picture is less rosy with inflation still eroding real pay and with a major worker shortage that is adding to the inflationary backdrop and making the labour market appear stronger than it really is. More than 2.5 million people are now unable to work due to long-term illness, the most on record. As this chart shows, long term sickness has driven the rise in economic inactivity (those neither working nor looking for work). Tony Wilson, director at the Institute for Employment Studies, says far too many people are falling out of the jobs market altogether, and need more government support. \u201cThere are now 630 thousand more people out of work than before the pandemic began and today\u2019s figures show clearly that people aren\u2019t becoming unemployed, they\u2019re leaving the labour force altogether. The number of people leaving work to unemployment over the last three months was below a quarter of a million for the first time on record, while more than twice as many people left work to economic inactivity. And our analysis shows that once people become economically inactive they are less and less likely to come back to work, with the number off work for five years or more growing by more than two hundred thousand in the last few years. Our Commission on the Future of Employment Support launched last week showed that a large part of the problem is that people just aren\u2019t getting the right help to get back into work. The number of jobseekers using Jobcentre Plus has halved over the last decade while the government\u2019s Restart scheme is set to underspend by over a billion pounds. With more than a million unfilled vacancies, a shrinking economy and falling living standards, cutting access to employment support is a complete false economy. The Budget on Thursday needs to put this right, in particular by opening up Restart to more of those who are out of work and want help to get back in.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has blamed the Ukraine war for driving up inflation, meaning wages aren\u2019t keeping up with prices. He also points out that unemployment is still near its record low, despite rising in the last quarter. \u201cUnemployment remains near record lows \u2013 providing security to families and testament to the resilience of the British economy even in the face of severe global challenges. \u201cBut I appreciate that people\u2019s hard-earned money isn\u2019t going as far as it should. Putin\u2019s illegal war has driven up inflation - a hidden and insidious tax that is eating into paychecks and savings. \u201cTackling inflation is my absolute priority and that guides the difficult decisions on tax and spending we will make on Thursday. Restoring stability and getting debt falling is our only option to reduce inflation and limit interest rate rises.\u201d Rachel Reeves MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures press home the knock-on impact of 12 years of Tory economic mistakes and low growth. \u201cReal wages have fallen again, thousands of over-50s have left the labour market and a record number of people are out of work because they\u2019re stuck on NHS waiting lists or they\u2019re not getting proper employment support. \u201cWhat Britain needs in the Autumn Statement on Thursday are fairer choices for working people, and a proper plan for growth. \u201cLabour has a plan to secure our economy and get it growing again, powered by the talent and effort of millions of working people and thousands of businesses.\u201d More than half a million working days were lost to strike action in August and September \u2013 the most in over a decade. Much of the disruption was centred on the transport sector, where there were widespread railway strikes, and in communications, where BT staff held their first national walkouts in 35 years. Darren Morgan, director of labour and economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) explains: \u201cAugust and September saw well over half a million working days lost to strikes, the highest two-month total in more than a decade, with the vast majority coming from the transport and communications sectors. \u201cWith real earnings continuing to fall, it\u2019s not surprising that employers we survey are telling us most disputes are about pay.\u201d Public sector workers are being worst hit by the real pay squeeze. Regular pay in the public sector rose by 2.2% in the last year, lagging far behind the private sector where pay has risen by 6.6%. That is the largest difference between the private sector and public sector on record (apart from in the pandemic, when private sector earnings sank). UK companies cut back on hiring, again, in the last quarter. The number of job vacancies dropped to 1.225m in August to October 2022, down 46,000 in May to July 2022. It\u2019s the fourth quarterly fall in a row. Vacancies fell fastest at information and communication companies (-11.9%), and at pubs, restaurants, cafes and hotels (-11.3). More companies have reported holding back on recruitment due to economic pressures, the ONS says. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain\u2019s jobless rate has risen, as the economy heads into what could be a long recession. The unemployment rate nudged up to 3.6% in the July-September quarter, up from 3.5% a month ago, according to the latest labour market report from the Office for National Statistics. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, warns that cracks now starting to show in the wider economy, meaning unemployment will keep rising. \u201cIt is only a matter of time before the recessionary environment spills into the labour market as employers increasingly consider the weakening demand and rising labour costs. While the vacancy rate will likely be one of the first indicators to turn, we expect the unemployment rate to eventually peak at around 6% by 2024. Wages have risen faster than expected \u2013 but still not fast enough to keep up with inflation. Total pay, including bonuses, rose by 6% per year in July-September, while regular pay rose by 5.7%, up from 5.4%. That\u2019s the strongest growth in regular pay seen outside the pandemic period. But with consumer price inflation hitting 10.1% in September, real wages are still falling. But\u2026 the number of people on company payrolls has continued to rise in October \u2013 to 834,000 above the pre-pandemic levels. Almost 9 million people were not working or looking for work, higher than before the pandemic. Around 21.6% were classed as economically inactive \u2013 up from 20.2% in February 2020. The ONS says: During the latest three-month period, the increase in economic inactivity was driven by those who are long-term sick, who increased to a record high. The rise in people with long Covid is one factor, as is home working in the pandemic. There has been a sharp rise in the number of people being unfit for work because of neck and back injuries \u2013 after many months of home-working at crowded kitchen tables and cramped home offices. Also coming up today We get a second estimate of eurozone growth in the last quarter, plus a healthcheck on German economic sentiment. Investors will pay close attention to the latest producer price inflation data from America. It will show how fast goods and services prices rose in October. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: In recent months PPI has tended to act as a leading indicator, although there was a spike in June, the general trend has been a gradual decline in prices since the end of Q1. Final demand PPI is expected to slip back to 8.3% from 8.5%, while core PPI excluding food and energy is expected to remain steady at 7.2%.

            "date": "2022-11-21T16:32:52Z",
            "content": "The boss of Britain\u2019s biggest airport group has said there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that Brexit has damaged the UK economy, adding that it has \u201cmassively exacerbated\u201d worker shortages. Charlie Cornish, the chief executive of MAG, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, said problems with recruitment were making the UK less competitive. Manchester airport was one of the facilities worst affected by disruption this year as a shortage of frontline staff left it unable to handle the post-Covid demand for travel, with huge queues and chaotic scenes in security and baggage halls. Speaking at the Airlines 2022 conference in London, Cornish said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Brexit has damaged the UK economy, 99% of leading economists would tell you that. You just have to look at the rate of growth now, and that\u2019s significant.\u201d He added: \u201cIf that carries on, the UK\u2019s ability to be competitive will get eroded every single year. We do need the UK government to look at how to actually get a sensible economic growth plan back, with aviation at the centre of that.\u201d Cornish said that while other factors such as Covid had structurally altered the labour force, the problems were exacerbated by fewer Europeans coming back into the UK. \u201cThat does damage the UK aviation sector\u2019s ability to recruit workforce at scale and at pace,\u201d he said. \u201cPre-Brexit, that problem was never there.\u201d He added: \u201cAviation is wholly linked to GDP. We have to have an open conversation: how are we going to solve the Brexit-related disruption? If you look at the economic recovery in the EU, they\u2019re much further ahead of the UK. Nobody\u2019s going to be able to say that\u2019s not due to Brexit.\u201d Charlotte Vere, the aviation minister, when asked later at the conference to name a Brexit benefit for the industry, suggested that the UK would be able to modernise its airspace. \u201cOur ability to proceed with airspace modernisation is different from in the EU \u2026 I see that as a constraint [on the EU]. From our perspective, I believe we will be able to develop our aviation sector,\u201d she said. Willie Walsh, the head of global airlines body Iata and former boss of the British Airways owner IAG, said there were clear indicators that UK aviation was recovering more slowly than Europe\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s damaged the UK, from everything I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said. \u201c I haven\u2019t heard any politician articulate any benefit, and don\u2019t see any Brexit benefit for aviation. If you can\u2019t acknowledge that there\u2019s a negative, they\u2019re not going to be able to fix it.\u201d In response to Lady Vere\u2019s comments, Walsh said: \u201cJesus, we\u2019re an island, we\u2019re going to reform our airspace? What, you\u2019ll be able to fly from Heathrow to Manchester quicker than you can today?\u201d Walsh said Iata was confident that the wider aviation industry would recover further in 2023, despite the war in Ukraine and other economic headwinds. \u201cGlobally, we\u2019re looking at positive growth. The UK is an outlier.\u201d"

            "title": "Q&A: what does a split Congress mean for US politics?",
            "date": "2022-11-16T23:56:29Z",
            "content": "Republicans officially captured control of the House on Wednesday, as the Associated Press called the 218th seat for the party. The House victory ends four years of Democratic control of the lower chamber, handing Republicans the speakership and the chairmanships of key committees, while Democrats will maintain control of the Senate. But the incoming Republican speaker has the unenviable task of attempting to pass legislation with a very narrow majority, where only a few defections within the party will be enough to kill a bill. Republicans had hoped that a \u201cred wave\u201d in the midterm elections would allow them to flip dozens of House seats, giving them a much more comfortable majority. Instead, Republicans were barely about to flip the House, and Democrats may even be able to increase their Senate majority depending on the results of the Georgia runoff next month. With the House and the Senate now both called, Washington is bracing for at least two years of split control of Congress. Here\u2019s what we can expect. Will Congress be able to pass any bills? It will be extremely difficult for Democrats to advance their legislative agenda. Republicans can use their majority power to block any bills passed by the Democratic Senate from even getting a vote on the House floor. Since Joe Biden took office, some notable bills have passed the House with bipartisan support, including the infrastructure law that the president signed late last year. But the new Republican speaker will probably be hesitant to hand Biden and his party any more policy wins before the 2024 presidential race, which could result in a legislative logjam. How will Republicans use their House majority? Given their very narrow majority, House Republicans may have trouble advancing major legislation through the chamber. Even if they are able to pass something, the bill would almost certainly fail in the Democratic Senate, so it seems likely House Republicans will focus most of their attention on investigations and executive oversight. Even before polls closed last Tuesday, House Republicans had outlined plans to launch a series of investigations into the Biden administration and members of the president\u2019s family. Republican members have expressed keen interest in investigating the administration\u2019s handling of the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden\u2019s oversight of the US-Mexican border and his son Hunter\u2019s overseas business dealings. Some of the far-right members of the House Republican caucus have also threatened to use their new majority to hold up must-pass bills, including a debt ceiling hike. If the debt ceiling \u2013 essentially, the maximum amount the US government can borrow \u2013 is not raised, it could jeopardize the entire US economy. Some House Republicans have signaled they want to withhold support for a debt ceiling increase until they secure concessions on government spending and entitlement programs. The new House Republican majority could also threaten proposals to send more military aid to Ukraine amid its war against Russia. The far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that \u201cnot another penny will go to Ukraine\u201d once Republicans take control, alarming Ukraine\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill and abroad. With such a narrow majority, it only takes a few votes to block bills. Who will replace Nancy Pelosi as House speaker? That is a question that many House Republicans are asking themselves right now as well. The obvious frontrunner for the role \u2013 which oversees, manages and directs the majority party in the House \u2013 is Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who has served as House minority leader since 2019. But McCarthy has faced some dissent from within his own caucus, and it remains unclear whether he can get the 218 votes needed to become speaker. On Tuesday, the House Republican caucus easily nominated McCarthy as their speaker candidate, but 31 members cast ballots for the far-right Arizona lawmaker Andy Biggs. That tally could spell disaster for McCarthy when the full floor vote is held in January. \u201cMy position remains the same until further notice \u2013 no one has 218 (or close, as needed),\u201d Chip Roy, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus who nominated Biggs, told the Texas Tribune on Tuesday. \u201cWe have to sit down and establish the fundamental changes needed.\u201d How will Biden work with the new Republican speaker? Before becoming president, Biden built a reputation in the Senate for his ability to reach across the aisle and strike compromise with his Republican colleagues. During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden boasted about how he was even able to work with hardline segregationists such as James Eastland and Strom Thurmond. Those comments, meant to demonstrate Biden\u2019s collaborative nature, outraged many Democratic primary voters. But in recent months, Biden has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the modern Republican party, which he says is beholden to Donald Trump and hostile to democratic principles. \u201cDonald Trump and the Maga Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,\u201d Biden said in September. McCarthy has responded to Biden\u2019s criticism by accusing the president of having \u201cchosen to divide, demean, and disparage his fellow Americans \u2026 simply because they disagree with his policies\u201d. So if McCarthy does manage to capture the speakership, he and Biden will not be starting off their new relationship on the best footing. When a reporter asked Biden last week about his relationship with McCarthy, the president deflected. \u201cI think he\u2019s the Republican leader, and I haven\u2019t had much of [an] occasion to talk to him,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cBut I will be talking to him.\u201d What can Democrats get done without control of the House? Democrats\u2019 continued control of the Senate ensures that they will still be able to approve Biden\u2019s cabinet and judicial nominations. Their Senate majority will allow Democrats to install more liberal judges in key posts, and it could give them the ability to fill another supreme court seat if one opens up in the next two years. But overall, Democrats\u2019 best opportunity to enact change between now and 2024 may come down to the power of the executive. Biden has already signed more than 100 executive orders since becoming president, according to the Presidency Project at University of California Santa Barbara. Biden has used executive orders to overturn some of Trump\u2019s most controversial policies, such as halting funding for construction of a wall at the US-Mexican border, and to advance progressive proposals that would otherwise stall in Congress. Biden\u2019s order to provide student debt relief of up to $20,000 for millions of borrowers was celebrated by the president\u2019s progressive allies, although the policy is now facing legal challenges. With Republicans now in control of the House, Biden could soon be reaching for his executive pen more frequently."

            "content": "As the new House Republican majority stumbles into power, with all the chaotic, embittered bumbling of a rich man\u2019s son who can only seem to fail upwards, another, peculiar kind of political transition is taking place: Nancy Pelosi, 82, is leaving the House speakership, almost certainly for the last time. Perhaps no individual has come to symbolize the Democrats more to the people who do not like the party. To Republicans, Pelosi has long taken on a kind of mythic malice. To the Fox-watching white male, Pelosi symbolizes liberal elitism, a vague but totalizing specter of corruption, and that particular kind of liberal decadence that can be evoked by the name of the city that makes up nearly all of her longtime congressional district: San Francisco. She\u2019s a woman in power, and she\u2019s long been supportive of gay rights, and she opposed the Iraq war. She\u2019s been a reliable opponent of conservatives\u2019 favorite culture war crusades: she supports gun control and opposes Confederate statues. In an association facilitated by misogyny, her very face is a shorthand for liberal extremism, a visual code that denotes secularism, taxation and frightening new pronouns. Which was always a bit of a stretch, because the fact of the matter is that the American left tends to hate Pelosi, too. To them, her two terms as speaker \u2013 first from 2007 to 2011, and then again from 2019 until this coming January \u2013 were eras of strictly enforced centrism. Under Pelosi\u2019s tenure, the congressional agenda was kept well to the right of the base\u2019s preferences, and leftist stars like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were needlessly sidelined. Pelosi has taken positions that frustrate and disappoint the Democratic rank and file. She allegedly knew about waterboarding during the war on terror, and she didn\u2019t object to it; she has backed Israel even in its most flagrant violations of Palestinian rights. And for all the fear and hatred she provokes in Republicans, some Democrats found her insufficiently willing to attack them. Under her leadership, the House impeached Donald Trump twice. But the Rubicon of impeachment was crossed only belatedly, in the face of Pelosi\u2019s long, obstinate resistance. Many Democrats felt that the impeachments \u2013 along with other congressional oversight efforts against the Trump administration \u2013 were too tepid, and came too late. Neither of these understandings of Pelosi really capture the most striking aspect of her career \u2013 which has been characterized, above all, by an almost preternatural ability to discipline her caucus. Perhaps no speaker has been so successful at securing votes and cultivating the loyalties of her members; in interviews, Democratic House members speak of her with awe, like she\u2019s something between a charismatic high school teacher and an emotionally withholding mom. This charisma is carefully cultivated: she famously tells no one her secrets, but has a long memory \u2013 both for past favors and past grievances. Some members seem to be eagerly seeking her approval. None seem willing to cross her. She has a natural\u2019s instinct for politics, able to anticipate what will persuade someone to do what she wants them to do before they often know themselves. Pelosi cultivated this talent from a young age. At the beginning of her political career, Pelosi painted herself as a mom and housewife, the devoted spouse to Paul, an obscenely wealthy financier, and the doting mother of five. But this pretended humility was always a rather flimsy facade. In reality, Pelosi is the scion of an influential Democratic political family from Maryland: her father was a congressman, and both her dad and brother served as mayors of Baltimore. Her job as speaker was one she had been training for since infancy, or at least since she attended her first presidential inauguration, at 12. After she and her husband moved to San Francisco, Pelosi swiftly rose in the ranks of the California Democratic party, in part because Nancy, with her comfort among elites and the almost coercive power of her charm, was very good at raising money. She was elected to Congress in 1986, and never looked back; she quickly stood out as a charismatic voice in public and an aggressive negotiator in private. Pelosi became the leader of the House Democrats in 2003, and ascended to become the first \u2013 and so far, the only \u2013 woman to serve as speaker, in 2007. Under Pelosi\u2019s tenure, the House Democrats have achieved some herculean tasks of political maneuvering. Everything that the Democrats have accomplished legislatively since 2007, they have accomplished thanks to Pelosi\u2019s control of her caucus. She forced through the Dodd-Frank campaign finance reform bill in the face of the kind of fearsome opposition that a politician of weaker will would have balked at. She managed to pass the massive Affordable Care Act, expanding healthcare coverage to millions, in a show of persuasion and strength that could terrify grown men, and did. These are the kinds of bruising political battles that would end a different congressperson\u2019s career, but Pelosi\u2019s district is among the safest blue seats in the country. She has never faced a real challenger for her spot; during her election years, she doesn\u2019t even engage in debates. Her re-election campaigns are little more than formalities: everyone, in San Francisco and elsewhere, knows that seat belongs to Nancy Pelosi for as long as she wants it. This safety is what allowed Pelosi to turn to her bigger, more national ambitions. Her real constituency has long been the whole country \u2013 or at least, the whole of the Democratic party. But recent years have taken the shine off of Pelosi. She stood in the way when Democrats wanted to pass ethics reforms that would have forbidden members of Congress from trading individual stocks; this past summer, she made the dangerous choice to travel alone to Taiwan, in a show of defiance against Xi Jinping. And the constant attacks on her personally from the right have begun to take a grim toll. This fall, a crazed man, deluded by rightwing media, broke into her California home with a hammer, and attacked Pelosi\u2019s elderly husband, fracturing his skull; the intruder was there looking for Pelosi. Perhaps the quintessential moment of this part of Pelosi\u2019s career came during the January 6 hearings, when footage of the speaker taken during the Capitol attack emerged. In the hidden location where the House members had been taken, she makes brisk phone calls, searching for a way to clear the Capitol. Her calm competence, contrasted with her extreme physical frailty, made for a portrait of integrity, endurance, courage. But even then, Pelosi seemed out of place. In the video, her institutionalism, and her faith in the legal process, shines through. You get the sense that she feels strongly that everything will be all right, if only she can make the right phone call. As the mob stormed the Capitol, and Trump orchestrated them on Twitter like a symphony conductor, Pelosi\u2019s technocratic proceduralism could not have stood in starker contrast. She looked, perhaps for the first time, like a figure from a lost era. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist"

            "title": "Voters hold political fate of US in their hands as they cast midterm ballots",
            "date": "2022-11-08T19:19:11Z",
            "content": "Millions of Americans took to the polls on Tuesday for the 2022 midterm elections, a series of bitter contests that will determine whether Democrats or Republicans control Congress for the next two years, as well as key state and local offices. The outcome could also help determine whether 2020 election deniers gain more political power, and potentially set the stage for still more discord among an increasingly fractious electorate. Voters across the US described a range of urgent concerns, whether over the ongoing assault on reproductive rights or anxieties about the economy and crime. Many also described a heightened level of worry about possible challenges to accurate election results and the disenfranchisement of voters, including protracted litigation that could sow dangerous distrust in the US\u2019s electoral system. In Columbus, Ohio, Ashley Sica said her vote for Democrat Tim Ryan in the US Senate race was decided after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. \u201cI voted based off of my values, and maybe not necessarily what I would do, but just thinking globally of choices that other people should be able to have. I don\u2019t think that government officials should be in charge of what people do with their own bodies,\u201d said Sica, whose polling place was Ohio\u2019s largest Greek Orthodox church. Sica, a nurse, said the Roe decision prompted many women to vote in the midterms who otherwise probably would not. She also described fear over Republicans\u2019 opposition to tighter gun control laws despite a series of deadly school shootings. \u201cMy children\u2019s daycare is just a mile from here. There was an issue with someone shooting a gun around their daycare. So that\u2019s another thing that kind of brought me out to vote for stricter laws in regards to guns,\u201d Sica said. \u201cHaving kids that are of school age now really brings that kind of thing into focus, thinking about their safety and the safety of others.\u201d Jeffrey Weisman, another Columbus resident, voted for the bestselling author and Republican candidate for the US Senate JD Vance, albeit without much enthusiasm. \u201cI vote Republican pretty much all the way and that is my main reason why,\u201d Weisman said. Vance has a slight polling lead over Ryan in a state that has increasingly given sizable majorities to Republicans. The neck-and-neck Ohio contest somewhat reflects the strength of Ryan\u2019s campaign for a seat that could determine whether his party holds control of the Senate. The close race also reflects voters\u2019 doubts about Vance\u2019s sincerity; he dramatically moved away from calling Trump a \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cmoral disaster\u201d to becoming a dogged supporter to land Trump\u2019s endorsement in the GOP primaries. Weisman, the owner of a retail jewelry store, said it didn\u2019t matter that Vance was backed by Trump. \u201cI like the Republicans\u2019 stuff when it comes more to the economy. I\u2019m a business owner and I feel that things are not going in the right direction with the Democrats in charge,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that maybe the Republicans in charge will get things going a little better economy-wise.\u201d Weisman, who twice voted for Trump in presidential races, said he\u2019d rather the former commander-in-chief stay out of the 2024 contest. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one. I like his politics. His mouth scares a lot of people. So, I personally do not think he can win because of the mouth, the \u2018controversialness\u2019 of him, and so I think that would be a tough road for him,\u201d he said. Voters in Pennsylvania \u2013 a state which is poised to have one of the closest US Senate elections \u2013 were choosing between John Fetterman, the state\u2019s Democratic lieutenant governor, and Mehmet Oz, a Republican celebrity doctor. While Fetterman held a commanding lead in the polls for months, Oz has since closed the gap. Fetterman suffered a stroke in May, and still has difficulties with speaking and comprehending other speakers, as revealed in a debate with Oz two weeks ago. Fetterman and his team have insisted he is able to work and serve as senator; Oz\u2019s campaign has mocked his health. \u201cI liked Fetterman, except for the man had a stroke,\u201d said Steve Schwartz, who just voted for Oz in Beaver county, approximately 30 miles north-west of Pittsburgh. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if he can drive to work yet. You don\u2019t wanna hire him and then he\u2019s going to be on disability for a little bit.\u201d Schwartz, who also voted for the Republican candidates for governor and the US House, said he would have \u201cseriously considered\u201d Fetterman if not for his stroke. Beaver county, named after the Beaver River, which is either named after the Lenape chief King Beaver or the flat-tailed animal, voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. The former president\u2019s margin of victory was smaller here than in other Pennsylvania counties. Mike Moore, a 41-year-old loan closer, said he had cast his vote for Fetterman. \u201cI like the way he is. I\u2019ve met him a couple of times, he seems like a real genuine guy. I kind of don\u2019t like Dr Oz, because he doesn\u2019t live in Pennsylvania \u2013 and that\u2019s kind of like: \u2018How can he represent me?\u2019\u201d Moore said, referring to Oz\u2019s decades-long residency in a mansion in New Jersey; Oz claims he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020. For Moore, the most important issue was \u201cbipartisanship\u201d, which appears unlikely given the tone of this election cycle. \u201cThis country is so polarized now, it\u2019s a shame,\u201d Moore said. \u201cYou know, we got to work together. We got to be Americans.\u201d In Lansing, Michigan, the congresswoman Elissa Slotkin\u2013 \u2013 who is running in the most expensive House race in the country \u2013 said she was bracing herself for attempts to undermine the state\u2019s election results. \u201cThis is what happens when a leadership climate is set in our country, trying to undercut democracy when one side loses,\u201d she said on a small patch of tidily cropped grass outside the Eastern high school athletic club after casting her vote. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear what my opponent will do if he loses. The good news is, we\u2019ve seen this movie before, in 2020. We were prepared,\u201d Slotkin said. A judge on Monday dismissed an effort by Republicans to throw out votes in Detroit, determining that their claim lacked a \u201cshred of evidence\u201d. Slotkin remarked that inflation was undeniably on everybody\u2019s mind in Michigan, but added that the ballot initiative to protect abortion in Michigan is a \u201ccountervailing wind\u201d following the US supreme court\u2019s decision in July to overturn Roe v Wade. \u201cI was at the Michigan State rally last night with campus organizers, and Roe v Wade is really motivating students,\u201d Slotkin said. In nearby Detroit, at a polling site at the Greater Grace temple in the north-west of the city, 35-year-old Xhosoli Nmumhad said she decided to cast a ballot to support a constitutional amendment that would dramatically expand voting rights in Michigan. Nmumhad, 35, has only voted twice before \u2013 once in 2008 and then again in 2012, for Barack Obama \u2013 but said of her decision: \u201cI believe everyone should be able to vote.\u201d Ruth Draines, 72, another voter here, said she always participated in elections. This cycle, she was especially motivated by a ballot proposal that would amend Michigan\u2019s constitution to protect access to abortion. \u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that they want to take away a woman\u2019s right, because some women get raped and they don\u2019t want to be reminded of that,\u201d Draines said. In Kentucky, Ona Marshall, who co-owns one the two remaining abortion clinics in this state, said her polling station in Louisville was overflowing with voters around 11 am. \u201cNot even in a presidential year have we seen that number of people, and this is mid-morning,\u201d Marshall said. On the ballot in Kentucky is Amendment 2, a proposal that would restrict abortion in Kentucky. It\u2019s unclear whether the surge of voters will cast their ballots in favor or opposition of the amendment, but Marshall remains optimistic. \u201cWhatever happens, for our country and democracy, it\u2019s extremely important that we have a higher turnout at the polls for every election, so to see it in a midterm election is definitely hopeful,\u201d Marshall said. This morning in Georgia, Avondale Estates voter Coleman Williams said he felt the weight of the midterm elections. Georgia voters must chose between Democrat Stacey Abrams and incumbent Republican governor, Brian Kemp, in the gubernatorial race \u2013 and pick between Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican candidate Herschel Walker for US Senate. \u201cI\u2019ve watched the debates, and there\u2019s just so much at stake for everyone,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling nervous but hopeful because Georgia knows that we have to get out there, and we clearly have.\u201d There were also the voters who found themselves so worried about the future of this country that they cast their votes early in case something happened. Beverly Harvey, a retiree and bingo organizer in the Villages, a sprawling age-55-and-up community in central Florida, was among them. \u201cMost of my friends and I voted early. We wanted to make sure we got our vote in to try to save this country if we should not live long enough to vote on election day,\u201d said Harvey, 75. \u201cWhen you live in the Villages, you have to plan ahead.\u201d Harvey\u2019s top concerns were the border, crime and the economy. \u201cWe need to be doing for people here. I understand their need to escape their living conditions, but we have a lot of people in this country that are living in poor conditions as well,\u201d Harvey said. As for crime, \u201cI have four grandchildren, two in college, and I pray every day for their safety wherever they might be.\u201d Meanwhile, Harvey and her friends are reeling from the soaring cost of living. They saved and saved for years, not to live \u201cexpensively\u201d in their retirement, but just comfortably, Harvey said \u2013 which seems like an increasingly ephemeral goal. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost so much of our savings toward our retirement that we\u2019re really having to cut back on everything,\u201d said Harvey. She said she \u201cpretty much\u201d voted \u201cstraight Republican\u201d. As for the few Democrats Harvey voted for, she explained: \u201cThey agreed on the same things I do: the economy, the border, safety.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-01T19:41:59Z",
            "content": "The National Union of Students has ousted its president after a long-running independent inquiry into allegations of antisemitism found \u201csignificant breaches\u201d of the organisation\u2019s policies. The allegations of misconduct are thought to centre around past comments by Shaima Dallali, in some cases dating back 10 years before her election as NUS president in March this year. In a statement announcing the decision, the NUS said: \u201cFollowing the independent [King\u2019s Counsel]-led investigation into allegations of antisemitism, specifically into the then president-elect under the NUS code of conduct, an independent panel has found that significant breaches of NUS policies have taken place. \u201cAs per this finding, we have terminated the president\u2019s contract.\u201d The NUS said the panel\u2019s decision may be subject to appeal. Chloe Field, an NUS vice-president, will be acting chair of the NUS UK board until a new president can be appointed. \u201cIn strict accordance with rules around employees and confidentiality, we will not be sharing any further details on the investigation into the president,\u201d the NUS said. \u201cWe can assure any interested parties that this process has been incredibly robust and that we can and must trust in the outcome. \u201cWe know that there will be strong feelings around this issue, so we urge people to respect this process and to refrain from taking part in or perpetuating any abuse, particularly online, towards anyone involved in this matter.\u201d Dallali, a former student union president at City, University of London, was elected leader of the NUS for a two-year term starting in July. But in August she was suspended from the role as a result of the investigation. After Dallali\u2019s election the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) objected to comments she is alleged to have made, including a tweet posted in 2012 that read: \u201cKhaybar Khaybar O Jews \u2026 Muhammad\u2019s army will return Gaza,\u201d referencing a historical battle. Dallali later apologised for the tweet. The UJS said it \u201crespects the decision of the National Union of Students to dismiss their president. Antisemitism in the student movement goes beyond the actions of any one individual and this case is a symptom of a wider problem. \u201cJewish students across the country will be asking how an individual deemed unfit for office by NUS was elected in the first place. We await the findings of the substantive inquiry into NUS treatment of Jewish students.\u201d The Federation of Student Islamic Societies called Dallali\u2019s removal \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d and called for student unions to disaffiliate from the NUS. \u201cThe investigation into Shaima has been deeply politicised from the outset, and due process has not been followed, opening Shaima up to the court of public opinion and denying her the opportunity to fairly represent herself,\u201d it said in a statement. The president\u2019s dismissal \u2013 said to be the first time in the organisation\u2019s 100-year history \u2013 came after pressure for the NUS to address longstanding concerns over antisemitism. The Guardian revealed in April that more than 20 former NUS presidents, including three former cabinet ministers, had warned the organisation\u2019s trustees to address concerns from Jewish students. After consultation with the UJS, the NUS asked Rebecca Tuck KC to undertake an inquiry into Dallali\u2019s conduct and wider issues of antisemitism. In an interview with the Guardian in April, Dallali said of the controversy: \u201cIt genuinely is really difficult to have to see these horrible things being said about me. They are not true. This idea that I don\u2019t like Jewish people, or I\u2019m hateful towards the Jewish community, is absolutely not true.\u201d Dallali said she had received Islamaphobic and racist online abuse, including death threats, after the allegations came to light. Robert Halfon, the education minister, said: \u201cWe welcome the verdict to this initial investigation and look forward to seeing the outcome of the next stage, which will provide more detail on NUS\u2019s plans to address antisemitism within the organisation.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-11-30T15:49:34Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s former leader Jiang Zemin, who was elevated to the head of the Communist party as a loyalist during the Tiananmen protests and then presided over years of economic expansion, has died aged 96. The cause of death was leukaemia and multiple organ failure, state media said. His life ended in a hospital in Shanghai, the city that was his power base, and has been the scene of recent protests against the government and its Covid controls. Jiang\u2019s death could hardly have come at a worse time for China\u2019s current leader, Xi Jinping. There is a tradition in China of using public mourning gatherings for past leaders to express discontent with the current regime. The 1989 Tiananmen protests that triggered Jiang\u2019s own elevation to the top of China\u2019s Communist party, and later head of government, had their roots in mourning for reformist premier Hu Yaobang. Jiang did not inspire the same public affection in China as Hu did three decades ago, but nonetheless, many in China may look back fondly on the time when he ran the country. It was an era that saw harsh repression \u2013 including of the Falun Gong religious group \u2013 but in some ways was the diametric opposite of Xi\u2019s China. Jiang shepherded China out of the international isolation that followed the massacre around Tiananmen Square. The economy grew rapidly, he oversaw entry into the World Trade Organization which spurred growth, and the government loosened controls on citizens\u2019 private lives. Xi in contrast has isolated China with Covid regulations and aggressive foreign policy. The economy is slowing in part because of these restrictions and authorities have extended their reach into citizens\u2019 homes, personal lives and leisure time. \u201cThe Jiang era wasn\u2019t exactly that great when it was unfolding, but in contrast to where China is today you will have a lot of people are who are genuinely nostalgic,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the SoasS China Institute. \u201cIt is not hard for people to reimagine it in a more beautiful and sanitised way, saying how great it was \u2013 which is really criticising what is happening today. That is why Xi will be very cautious.\u201d Emotional tributes poured in immediately after the news was announced. \u201cThe end of an era, and it was a good time! An era of unity and struggle for development!\u201d read one message on Weibo, China\u2019s biggest social media platform. His death was top of the site, with one news article read by 700 million users, and garnering hundreds of thousands of comments. \u201cA leader who carries on the past and ushers in the future, leading us to a new era,\u201d said another commentator. Tsang predicted tight controls on any public mourning, in an attempt to control dissent particularly in Shanghai, a key site for protests in recent days and Jiang\u2019s power base. He was so closely identified with the financial hub that his faction inside the party was known as the Shanghai gang. Some originally counted Xi as a member, before he created his own power bloc. Long before his death, Jiang had already become a channel for discontent with China under Xi, mostly expressed through an unlikely internet meme \u2013 \u201ctoad worship\u201d \u2013 that was eventually stamped out by censors. The meme grew out of Jiang\u2019s apparent resemblance, with his trademark large-frame glasses and high-waist trousers, to a cartoon amphibian. He was also admired for his colourful personality, and penchant for flamboyant public appearances, in contrast to Xi\u2019s meticulously stage-managed persona. Jiang famously sang an Elvis song with the president of the Philipines, cracked out a comb to tidy his hair while meeting the King of Spain, and stepped away from a meeting in Hong Kong to harangue journalists with an impromptu lecture on media ethics in three languages. \u201cToo simple, sometimes naive,\u201d he told them. A ruthless believer in one-party rule and party loyalty, he was part of the leadership responsible for the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen protesters and later had no compunction about coming down hard on any group he saw as a threat to Communist control. But he helped shape a system of collective leadership, and norms around term and age limits for the country\u2019s rulers, that aimed to prevent a return to the chaos of the Maoist era. Xi has dismantled that system, engineered a historic third term in control of the party, and accumulated more power than any leader since Mao. Jiang\u2019s death, coming as the leadership tries to suppress the most widespread protests in decades, is a reminder that despite Xi\u2019s networks of surveillance and intimidation, his control is not absolute. \u201cFor all the demonstrations of strength and control Xi has made, this shows how very brittle the system is, that the death of a very, very old man could cause so much concern,\u201d Tsang said."

            "content": "Money! Money! Money! has dominated the second full day of Cop27, with a deep chasm emerging between long-time polluting rich states and developing countries that need finance to deal with devastating extreme weather events while also cutting emissions. Meanwhile, Egypt will be realising that it cannot hold such a significant international conference without its dire human rights record being thrust into the limelight. Here are some of the highlights from the second day: President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen urged the global north to follow the EU\u2019s example of committing climate finance to the global south. A report by renowned climate economist Lord Stern showed that $2tn a year would be needed by developing countries (excluding China) by 2030 to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the effects of climate breakdown. However, civil society climate experts called out \u201cAmerica\u2019s decades-long game plan of denial, delay and deception\u201d when it comes to loss and damage funds. In one such stark example, Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan, said his country needed more than $30bn in flood relief \u201cdespite our very low carbon footprints\u201d. However, Barbados prime minister Mia Mottley celebrated that loss and damage had been added to the agenda of Cop27. The family of jailed British-Egyptian hunger-striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah voiced fears that Egyptian officials may be torturing him behind closed doors through force-feeding. A pro-government Egyptian MP confronted Abd el-Fattah\u2019s sister, Sanaa Seif, outside the conference. The plight of Abd el-Fattah has become the defining issue for British-Egyptian relations, the former British ambassador to Egypt John Casson warned. For the first time in years, Egypt has unblocked access to the Human Rights Watch website, a day after the Guardian described how delegates at Cop27 were unable to access it. A UN group set up to crack down on the greenwashing of net zero pledges by industry and government has called for \u201cred lines\u201d to stop support for new fossil fuel exploration and overuse of carbon offsets. Tuvalu has become the first country to use United Nations climate talks to demand an international fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty, which would phase out the use of coal, oil and gas. Temperatures in Ireland were so mild this autumn that trees were producing new growth before they shed their leaves, according to the Irish taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin. The Barbados prime minister, Mia Mottley, has celebrated that \u201closs and damage\u201d \u2013 the idea that developed countries that grew rich off fossil fuels should pay poorer countries \u2013 has been added to the agenda of Cop27. Here\u2019s an explainer on the term loss and damage, which is quite simple but confusing without context: Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has spoken to the summit from Kyiv. \u201cThere can be no effective climate policy without peace,\u201d he said. Russia\u2019s invasion has caused chaos in global energy supplies, food prices and Ukraine\u2019s forests, he said. The family of jailed British-Egyptian hunger-striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah have voiced fears that Egyptian officials may be torturing him behind closed doors through force-feeding. On the sidelines of the Cop27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi reportedly told the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to ensuring the democracy activist\u2019s health \u201cis preserved\u201d and that \u201cthe next few weeks and months will bring results\u201d. Abd el-Fattah was due to be on his third day without water as Cop27 continued, after more than six months on a hunger strike during which he consumed fewer than 100 calories a day. \u201cI\u2019m really worried from these comments that they\u2019re implying they will be force-feeding Alaa. Force-feeding is torture, and nothing should happen that\u2019s against Alaa\u2019s will,\u201d Sanaa Seif, Abd el-Fattah\u2019s sister, said. \u201cWe need proof of life. The scenario I imagine is that Alaa is handcuffed somewhere and put on an intravenous drip against his will. That would be torture, and he shouldn\u2019t be living that. The solution is simply just to let the British embassy see him.\u201d Mexico, one of the world\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitters, is expected to announce a hotchpotch of old, inadequate and undeliverable climate promises that will leave its Paris pledges in tatters, experts have warned. Climate action has nosedived under the leadership of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who had to be blocked from rolling back Mexico\u2019s modest Paris greenhouse gas targets by the country\u2019s supreme court, and emissions are rising. John Kerry, the US climate envoy, said last week that the Mexican president, also known as Amlo, would make a major announcement on the country\u2019s climate commitments during Cop27. No official announcement has yet been made, and Amlo is not expected to attend the UN summit in Egypt, but reports suggest that the announcements will include: A reduction in methane emissions from the state-owned oil company, Pemex \u2013 an important but existing target for which Pemex has been fined for non-compliance. A 1,000MW state-opened solar plant \u2013 construction is already under way for a 180MW project, and the government had previously already ruled out further investment to expand the energy potential. A lithium commitment. Mexico has the ninth-largest identified deposits of lithium \u2013 a crucial mineral for electric vehicles and other green technologies \u2013 but there has been no government investment so far in advancing extraction, and none is currently being mined. Experts say the country is years away from producing its first gram of lithium. \u201cIt\u2019s highly likely that the Mexican government will try to deceive the entire world at Cop27 with false actions and projects that will never be built,\u201d said Carlos Flores, a renewable energy expert in Mexico. \u201cWe are not going to meet our current pledges, never mind anything more ambitious.\u201d There have been many extreme weather disasters this year made more severe or more likely by the climate crisis, but none on the devastating scale of the floods in Pakistan. At Cop27, Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan, laid bare the impact and just how high the stakes are at this UN climate meeting, warning other countries they could face a similar fate. Shehbaz Sharif said: The catastrophic floods impacted 33 million people, more than half our women and children, [covering] the size of three European countries. Despite seven times the average of extreme rain in the south, we struggled on as raging torrents ripped out over 8,000km of metal roads, damaged more than 3,000km of railway track and washed away standing crops on 4m acres and ravaged all of the four corners of Pakistan. An estimate of damage of loss has exceeded $30bn and this all happened despite our very low carbon footprints. We became a victim of something with which we had nothing to do, and of course it was a manmade disaster. While we were grappling and fighting against these torrential floods, we had to import wheat, palm oil and of course very expensive oil and gas \u2013 spending about $30bn to $32bn. We redirected our meagre resources to meet the basic needs of millions of [people] and had to dish out about $316m. Now winter is settling in and we need to provide shelter homes and medical treatment and food package to millions of people. Imagine on one hand we have to cater for food security for the common man by spending billions of dollars and on the other we have to spend billions of dollars to protect flood-affected people from further miseries and difficulties. How on earth can one expect from us that we will undertake this gigantic task on our own? The delivery of money from the rich, polluting nations to the poorer, vulnerable nations has become the critical issue at Cop27 \u2013 read more here. The Guardian\u2019s senior climate justice reporter, Nina Lakhani, is moderating a panel at Cop27 on climate justice and human rights. Panellists include the heads of the two major global human rights groups, Amnesty International (Agn\u00e8s Callamard) and Human Rights Watch (Tirana Hassan). Sanaa Seif, the sister of the jailed British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, and Hossam Bahgat, the executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, are also speaking. You can watch it live here: New Zealand has announced a $20m climate fund for land and resources lost by developing countries to the effects of the climate crisis. \u201cComparatively wealthy countries like Aotearoa New Zealand have a duty to support countries most at-risk from climate change. The best way to do that is to cut climate pollution, but so too must we support communities to cope with the unavoidable impacts of the climate crisis,\u201d said foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta. The government said it was one of only three countries to dedicate such funding so far. The bulk of the fund will likely be distributed in the Pacific, where New Zealand has close partnerships and \u201cthe loss of land and resources from sea-level rise is a well-known threat,\u201d said Mahuta. \u201cLoss and damage is happening to homes and crops and fisheries, but it also happens to cultures, languages, people\u2019s mental health and their physical wellbeing.\u201d Cop27 is likely to discuss a centralised fund for international commitments for loss and damage in poorer countries. Mahuta said New Zealand was \u201cnot opposed to this\u201d but would \u201calso support a wide range of funding arrangements to make best use of our contribution\u201d. Readers \u2013 or rather, non-readers \u2013 if you have recently joined and are looking for a concise and focused way to catch up, then listen to this podcast. Made by our colleagues at Guardian Australia, it is a fantastic explainer of what is happening at Cop27, and what is at stake. (Spoiler: Everything) A reader has emailed me to ask if we know what temperature rise the world is \u201con track\u201d for. \u201cWhere does the current state of play lead us to?\u201d the reader asks. Unfortunately, the UN said just last week that current pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions will lead to global heating of 2.5C, a level that would condemn the world to catastrophic climate breakdown. That is based on governments fulfilling their pledges, and even then, it is far above the 1.5C goal, which would avoid the worst ravages of extreme weather. A UN group set up to crack down on the greenwashing of net zero pledges by industry and government has called for \u201cred lines\u201d to stop support for new fossil fuel exploration and overuse of carbon offsets. The \u201chigh-level expert group\u201d, created in March by the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to advise on rules to improve integrity and transparency in net zero commitments by industry, regions and cities, said climate plans must include deep cuts in greenhouse gases before 2030, and not delay action until closer to 2050. It stressed serious commitments must prioritise immediate cuts in absolute emissions, with the use of carbon offsets \u2013 an often controversial practice that allows companies and governments to pay for cuts elsewhere instead of reducing their own pollution \u2013 to be used sparingly in later years, if at all. Rules were needed to ensure offsets were high-quality and came from a reliable and verifiable source, the group said. The group of experts was created after widespread concern about greenwashing, including claims by major fossil fuel companies that they were aiming for net zero emissions by 2050 while backing new coal, oil and gas developments and relying heavily on offsets. A Guardian investigation this year revealed that oil and gas companies, including several with net zero pledges, were still planning vast new developments that would push the world well beyond the goals of the landmark 2015 Paris agreement. My colleague and Environment editor, Damian Carrington, has been speaking to the creator of this remarkable sculpture at Cop27: \u201cWe are the environment and the environment is us - we can\u2019t be separated,\u201d says artist Victoria Pratt, part of the Invisible Flock collective, who made a striking sculpture for the World Health Organization\u2019s health pavilion at Cop27. \u201cThe sculpture is both a lung and a tree,\u201d she says. It was made by casting fallen branches in metal, and then inverting them to resemble a giant lung. The parallel between the bronchioles of the lung and the branches of the tree is fractal growth patterns, which are shared by humans, plants and animals. \u201cWe wanted something that was both scientific and metaphorical,\u201d Pratt said. The sculpture, titled Bodies Joined by a Molecule of Air and cast in Lebanon, also pulsates to the touch, like a human body. Other artworks at the WHO pavilion include tiny bottles of tears in which algae from the North Sea grows, along with notes from the artist Kasia Molga on why she cried at the time each tiny glass bottle was filled. \u201cCan environmental health be an indicator of our own health?\u201d she asks. In another piece, a podcast weaves bees buzzing in the high-swinging hives of Mau Forest, Kenya, with the singing and speech of the Ogiek indigenous community for whom honey is an intrinsic part of their culture. Dr Maria Neira, WHO director of public health and environment, says the climate crisis and health are intimately connected: \u201cThe price of not taking decisions to fight climate change is paid by our lungs, when you breathe polluted air, and many other organs. I think health will be the final motivation that has been missing from the 26 previous Cops. I don\u2019t see what else can be.\u201d Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, a WHO clean air advocate, also spoke at the event. Her daughter Ella was the first person to have air pollution cited as a cause of death, when she died in London aged nine in 2013. \u201cElla would want you to think about all those we could save in the future,\u201d Kiss-Debrah says. \u201cEvery minute, a child dies from air pollution, but they don\u2019t have a voice. I hope Ella is a voice for them.\u201d The pavilion features a film about Ella, currently being shown at the Wellcome Collection in London, UK. Omnia El Omrani is the youth envoy for the Cop27 president and a doctor in Cairo and says she sees her patients suffering from air pollution and increasing heat: \u201cWe see first-hand that climate change is not just an environmental problem, but a health problem.\u201d Neira\u2019s message to those at COP27 is simple: If they take the right decisions, our health will gain. If they take the wrong decisions, our health will lose. An international report published in October said the health of the world\u2019s people is at the mercy of a global addiction to fossil fuels and found an increase in heat deaths, hunger and infectious disease as the climate crisis intensifies. For the first time in years, Egypt has unblocked access to the Human Rights Watch website, a day after the Guardian described how delegates at Cop27 were unable to access it during the conference. Yet the website of Mada Masr, Egypt\u2019s lone independent news outlet, which has endured raids on its offices and repeated attacks by the Egyptian state, remains blocked on the conference internet. Mada Masr and HRW\u2019s websites, along with more than 600 others \u2013 some estimates put the figure as high as 700 \u2013 have been blocked in the country since 2017, after Egypt began using Canadian technology to stop access to a broad swath of news, political and human rights websites several years ago. The block also came in tandem with a prolonged crackdown on civil society in Egypt, forcing many activists and rights defenders to flee the country, while others faced travel bans and arrest for their work. The lack of access to information represents Egypt\u2019s attempt to prevent Cop27 attendees from accessing information about the country\u2019s dismal human rights record. Conference attendees said the website block at Cop27 had curtailed their ability to work. While the unblocking of HRW\u2019s website during the conference is good news for the next couple of weeks, the test will come after the summit when Egyptcould decide to block the website again, outside of the focus that Cop27 brings on the crackdown on free expression. Egyptian officials have never provided any public explanation about why they block websites, and local activists have said they fear reprisals for attending the UN climate talks in Sharm el-Sheikh. Here is yesterday\u2019s story on the Cop27 internet restrictions: Here is the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, calling on the global north to follow the EU\u2019s example and commit to climate financing in the global south. \u201cTeam Europe is providing its fair share of the $100bn promise,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is doable and we call on others to step up too.\u201d Temperatures in Ireland have been so mild this autumn that trees are producing new growth before they have even shed their leaves, Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Irish taoiseach, has said. Climate breakdown is causing \u201cabject human misery\u201d, he said, particularly in the global south, for countries that have not contributed as much carbon. He added: If this generation does not step up urgently, future generations will not forgive us. Ireland would exceed the climate justice finance commitments asked of it, he claimed, and called for others to do the same. Here are some photos from the conference: I\u2019m Oliver Holmes and will be with you until the end of a busy day at Cop27. You can send me stories, tips, and opinions by emailing oliver.holmes@theguardian.com or via Twitter (@olireports). As the US climate envoy John Kerry walked the halls of the conference centre today, civil society climate experts called out \u201cAmerica\u2019s decades-long game plan of denial, delay and deception\u201d when it comes to \u2018loss and damage\u2019. In what\u2019s clearly become the red line for climate-vulnerable countries and climate justice advocates, Harjeet Singh, a senior adviser at the Climate Action Network (CAN), said: The US has for decades acted in bad faith with regards to loss and damage, but the delays and deception have real life consequences. We need to agree on a funding facility at this Cop so we can work on making it operational by 2024, and the US needs to change from being obstructive to constructive. Loss and damage refers to the money needed to cover the vast economic, cultural and social consequences of the climate crisis that have already happened or are too late to avert with either adaptation or mitigation - impacts mostly being experienced by the countries that have least contributed to the greenhouse gases causing global heating. For years, the US and other large polluters including the EU, UK, Canada, and Australia have used their political and economic muscle to block and delay progress on setting up such a fund that is desperately needed by island nations and other vulnerable countries. Amid growing criticism, Kerry softened his language in the run-up to the summit, claiming that the US is open to discussions on loss and damage. After a hard-fought battle over the weekend, it is on the Cop agenda for the first time. But the US is pushing for another two years of dialogue - a delayRachel Rose Jackson from the Union of Concerned Scientists said would be a \u201csevere, unjust blow for those suffering the worst effects of the climate crisis\u201d. Jackson added: The litmus test for Cop27 is meaningful progress on loss and damage, which means the US needs to stop obstructing so we can establish a funding facility this year. Separately, Austria announced $50m for climate loss and damage, shortly after Scotland\u2019s first minister pledged an additional \u00a35m to support developing countries with direct finance to cope with the unavoidable, devastating impacts of the climate crisis. This means that five European countries - Austria, Scotland, Belgium, Denmark and Germany - have committed to fund the loss and damage finance mechanism that the US wants to avoid. \u2022 The Cop27 high-level segment for heads of state and government continued, with more world leaders calling for urgent action on the climate crisis. There were many references to the issue of loss and damage, the funding demanded by poorer nations to rebuild after accelerating climate disasters, which made it onto the official agenda for the talks. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, urged the global north to follow the EU\u2019s example of committing climate finance to the global south. \u2022 Lazarus Chakwera, the president of Malawi, told the summit: \u201cAs nature lashes out, our citizens are losing patience,\u201d while the president of Venezuela, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, said \u201cthe total collapse of our ecosystem ... appears to be our fatal destiny\u201d. Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, said: \u201cThe most valuable contribution that developed countries can make is to reduce their emissions faster while investing in Africa to build sustainable, green power.\u201d \u2022 Tuvalu has become the first country to use United Nations climate talks to demand an international fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty, which would phase out the use of coal, oil and gas. \u2022 The release of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, the detained British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist who is on hunger strike, has become the defining issue for British-Egyptian relations, the former British ambassador to Egypt John Casson has warned. \u2022 John Kerry, the US climate envoy, has vowed that Joe Biden\u2019s administration will press ahead on climate action regardless of the outcome of today\u2019s midterm elections. I am now handing over the blog to Oliver Holmes. Thank you for reading the Guardian. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has urged the global north to follow the EU\u2019s example of committing climate financing to the global south. She said: \u201cThose most in need in the developing world must be supported in adapting to a harsher climate. We urge our partners in the global north to stand by their climate finance commitments to the global south.\u201d Though the developed world has not yet met its commitment to give $100bn in climate finance, she said: \u201cTeam Europe is stepping up \u2026 despite Covid, despite the Russian war.\u201d She highlighted the need to reach the Paris goals and said: \u201cEurope is staying the course. We call on all major emitters to increase their ambitions too.\u201d Von der Leyen also highlighted the hydrogen deals Europe had struck with Egypt and other countries, commenting: \u201cThe global south has the resources in abundance, so let\u2019s team up.\u201d She trumpeted the EU\u2019s renewable energy record, and said over the next year 100GW of additional renewable energy capacity could be achieved. \u201cEvery kilowatt per hour we generate from green energy is not only good for the climate, it is good for our resilience,\u201d the leader explained. My colleague, the Guardian US climate reporter Oliver Milman, has written about Tuvalu becoming the first country to use United Nations climate talks to demand an international fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty, which would phase out the use of coal, oil and gas. He writes: \u201cThe small Pacific Islands nation, which is acutely vulnerable to sea level rises caused by global heating, becomes the second country to call for an agreement to end the era of burning fossil fuels, which is the primary cause of the rapidly escalating climate crisis, fellow Pacific nation Vanuatu being the first.\u201d As the remaining world leaders hold another day of closed door meetings \u2013 and in a few of them, they might even discuss climate, rather than the other political issues that dominated their bilateral talks yesterday \u2013 money is still top of the agenda. Heads of state control the purse strings, and as the scale of the financing issue becomes clearer, it\u2019s a key bone of contention at this Cop. Developing countries are not getting access to the finance they need, both to cut their own greenhouse gas emissions, and to cope with the impacts of extreme weather. On Tuesday, a report by Lord Stern, the climate economist, showed that $2 trillion a year would be needed by developing countries (excluding China) by 2030 to achieve this. That sounds enormous. However, the climate crisis encompasses vast swathes of a country\u2019s economy \u2013 energy, transport, industry, housing, food. There is scarcely an area of spending, or revenue, that is untouched. So when talking about investment in the climate crisis, we are also talking about investment in every aspect of a country\u2019s economic, and socio-economic, situation. That\u2019s why the sums appear so huge, but in fact are not that different from the aggregate of investment that would be needed anyway, to lift developing economies to a decent standard of living. The benefits of this investment are also huge. When people in the developing world gain access to clean electricity from wind or solar farms, children can do their homework, people can conduct business, and have more leisure options, modern medicine can function. These social benefits are a huge lever to increase prosperity and improve people\u2019s lives. One immediate reaction to Stern\u2019s report \u2013 which was commissioned jointly by the UK and the Egyptian governments, presidents of Cop26 and 27 respectively \u2013 in some quarters has been to claim developing countries want the rich world to cough up these trillions. That is not quite the case. Private sector investment is likely to be much greater than anything the public sector can muster, but for private sector investment to flow, countries need some initial help. That\u2019s because private sector companies charge a huge risk premium for any investment in the developing world. Set up a solar farm in Nigeria instead of the UK, and your profits are likely to be much greater \u2013 people still pay good sums for the electricity but the sun in Nigeria shines more reliably and labour and associated costs are low. That\u2019s not reflected in the financing, however: a bank will charge you seven times more interest for the same project in Nigeria as in a developed country. That makes capital much harder to access and projects much more difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to get off the ground. Yet few countries have any trouble tapping up banks to lend for fossil fuel projects \u2013 because banks are used to such lending and are willing to splash out on oil and gas. So most of the $2 trillion of investment needed will still come from the private sector, but for it to flow takes some reforms in the finance sector, including restraints on fossil fuels, and some of what financiers call pump-priming (an initial investment of public money) and for the public sector to underwrite some of the risks. Diverting fossil fuel finance into clean energy alone would make a big dent in the trillions needed. Countries are also still subsidising fossil fuels to the extent of hundreds of billions a year around the world. Trillions of investment will pour over the next few decades into developing countries in any case. It is time to see that this investment is directed towards clean ends, rather than scaremongering over demands from the poor. Minds were focused again on loss and damage when listening to the impassioned speech by Jos\u00e9 Maria Neves, who represents the volcanic island state of Cabo Verde. He said it \u201cis one of the most vulnerable countries in Africa and in the world\u201d, because it is a \u201csmall developing island state with one of the lowest emissions of greenhouse gases per capita in the world\u201d, contributing \u201calmost nothing\u201d to climate change, but \u201chas suffered greatly from the consequences of climate change, jeopardising the years of progress we have made towards sustainable development.\u201d This includes long droughts, salt water intrusion and worsening of ground water, degradation of soils and the loss of biodiversity. \u201cFor small island developing states such as Cabo Verde, it is essential that they should be able to access global financing,\u201d he said. Chandrikapersad Santokhi, the president of Suriname, a tropical country on the north-east coast of South America, made a similar point. \u201cWe are in fact carbon negative but we are facing the impacts,\u201d he said, with the coastline threatened by sea-level rise. He said that despite limited resources, the country is investing to protect its natural assets such as its mangrove forests, which store carbon and are valuable for the whole world. In a relatively upbeat speech, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, the prime minister of Portugal, pointed out that his country has managed to mitigate many of the effects of the energy crisis caused by the Ukraine crisis because of its strong investments in renewables. \u201cPortugal, which started to invest in renewable energies 15 years ago, is an example of how investing in transition ensures we are safer from a fuel emergency,\u201d he said. The country is set to be carbon neutral by 2045, he said, which is earlier than the 2050 goal set by many other countries, and it has joined up with France and Spain to create a \u201cgreen energy corridor\u201d. The country abandoned coal eight years earlier than planned, and Costa has said he does not think the Ukraine war will cause the country to reverse the decision. Surangel Whipps, the president of Palau, had a less cheering message. He said rather than leave his people to the ravages of the climate emergency, \u201cYou might as well bomb us. That might well have been an easier fate.\u201d He said: \u201cThe climate crisis is tearing us apart limb by limb. Just last Monday we were hit by another storm, ripping off roofs and destroying our infrastructure. Droughts have caused water shortages. The extreme heat this summer killed over 30m of our prized and beautiful jellyfish that are world renowned because they are stingless.\u201d Sanaa Seif has been holding a press conference in Egypt to demand the release from jail of her brother, the British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah. He is currently being held in a desert prison, where he continues to refuse all food and water, while his family wait for proof of his condition, according to latest reports. Guardian video producer Nikhita Chulani was at the press conference and writes: \u201cSanaa Seif was confronted by a pro-regime Egyptian lawmaker during a press conference in which she was pleading for the UK government to help secure proof of life for her brother Alaa Abd el-Fattah. The jailed British-Egyptian activist has been on hunger strike for more than half a year, and told his family shortly before the beginning of the UN climate summit that he would begin a water strike. While taking questions from the media, the MP Amr Darwish interrupted Seif, questioning why her family was seeking British support to free her brother. He said this was a legal case that should be dealt with by the Egyptian government, adding that the country would not bow to Western pressure. Abd el-Fattah is a figurehead of Egypt\u2019s 2011 uprising, whose writings on protests, technology and democracy have affected a generation across the Middle East, even though he has spent most of the past decade behind bars. Last year, he was sentenced to a further five years in prison for sharing a social media post about torture. Speaking to the Guardian today, Seif said she fears the Egyptian authorities will begin force feeding her brother in order to guarantee nothing happens \u2018while the world is watching\u2019 during the climate conference.\u201d The Guardian has been committed to covering Abd el-Fattah\u2019s case in depth, and the wider issues of climate justice and human rights. In case you missed it, this long read by Naomi Klein was published last month, in which she argues: \u201cThe message activists should bring to the [Cop27] climate summit, whether they travel to Egypt or engage from afar, is simple: unless political freedoms are defended, there will be no meaningful climate action. Not in Egypt, nor anywhere else. These issues are intertwined, as are our fates.\u201d The president of Venezuela, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, delivered strong words at the climate summit today. \u201cMany elites have denied [climate change] and yet the scientific community warned about it very early on,\u201d he said. He said more should have been done over the last 30 years to declare it an emergency and act accordingly. \u201cWe still remember [the Cop15 climate summit in 2009 in] Copenhagen, we still remember police brutality repression in the streets against the social movements and what happened since then. We have wasted a lot of time since then. Every hour, every month, every year we have hesitated.\u201d Maduro touched on issues of climate justice, pointing out that Venezuela is responsible for just 0.4% of greenhouse gases worldwide. And he made a stark prediction: \u201cThe planet had given us all we needed for life generously yet today we are having to pay this great toil because of our actions. Today the threat is the total collapse of our ecosystem...it appears to be our fatal destiny.\u201d Before this, in his speech to conference, Paul Kagame, the President of Rwanda, was scathing about the global north\u2019s attitude towards Africa. He pointed out that during the Covid-19 pandemic, external financing did not work for vulnerable nations, who were left to bear the worst impacts. Kagame said this cannot happen with the climate emergency. \u201cThe most valuable contribution that developed countries can make is to reduce their emissions faster while investing in Africa to build sustainable, green power. Questioning whether Africa is ready to make use of climate finance should not be used as an excuse to justify inaction.\u201d I\u2019ve been looking at what some climate scientists on Twitter have been saying about Cop27. Here is a small selection: Dr Chandni Singh has been checking out the displays at different country pavilions, including one from Pakistan. Professor Mark Maslin lists actions that governments at Cop should take. While Hannah Cloake puts it more bluntly. Ed Hawkins, known for his graphic of the Warming Stripes, reminds us how long we have known about global heating. And finally some scientists have given reasons for why they are not attending Cop27. There have been warnings of the dangers of global heating for decades and Assoumani Azali, the president of Comoros, recalls one. He quotes then French president Jacques Chirac: \u201cOur house is burning and we are looking elsewhere.\u201d Chirac said that in 2002. Twenty years later this warning is still relevant, says Azali. Cyclone Kenneth devastated his country in 2019, he says, and the damage is still being repaired. Mohamed Menfi, the president of Libya, points out the danger of sea level rise. \u201cWe have the longest coastline in the Mediterranean sea, where 95% of our people live,\u201d he says. He also says water is becoming scarcer, soil more saline and erosion is worsening. Despite the ongoing political crisis, Menfi says: \u201cWe can only be part of this world.\u201d Lazarus Chakwera, the president of Malawi, choose rhetorical power over the detail-driven speeches of many of the world leaders. \u201cAs nature lashes out, our citizens are losing patience,\u201d he says. \u201cTo pass this test of leadership we must act with courage, urgency and humanity Alexander van der Bellen, the president of Austria, recalls a high-profile piece of rhetoric by Greta Thunberg in in 2021: \u201cThere is far too much blah blah blah and far too little concrete action,\u201d he says. The most controversial issue at Cop27 is loss and damage, the funding demanded by poorer nations to rebuild after accelerating climate disasters, and which some campaigners call reparations. Ranil Wickremesinghe, president of Sri Lanka, raises this in the context of colonialism. \u201cThe practice of colonialism extracted resources from Asia and Africa to fuel industrialisation in rich nations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe became poor from this plunder.\u201d Wickremesinghe says this industrialisation caused the climate crisis hitting poorer countries now. He also calls out rich nations: \u201cThe G7 and G20 are backtracking to use more fossil fuels - such double standards are unacceptable.\u201d We will find out what has happened to global carbon emissions in 2022 later this week but the news is unlikely to be good. Food, and the huge emissions its production causes, has often been marginalised at COPs but for Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, the president of Mongolia, it is his top priority amid hunger and high prices around the world. \u201cHumans, food and soil are inextricably linked and fighting climate change is intrinsic to protecting soil,\u201d he says. He does not mention tackling the terrible air pollution in Mongolian cities, but says the nation has joined the methane cutting pledge started at Cop26, which would help limit the impact of Mongolia\u2019s coal mines. John Kerry, the US climate envoy, has vowed that Joe Biden\u2019s administration will press ahead on climate action regardless of the outcome of today\u2019s midterm elections, which are expected to go badly for Democrats. Kerry, speaking at the US pavilion at Cop27, said that he hoped Congress would agree to expand funding for developing countries to help deal with climate impacts but that \u201ceven if we don\u2019t, folks, president Biden is more determined than ever to continue what we are doing\u201d. \u201cMost of what we are doing cannot be changed by anyone else coming along,\u201d Kerry added, noting that cities and states across America banded together to commit to the Paris climate agreement when Donald Trump removed the US from the pact when president. US officials in Egypt hope that the inflation reduction act bill passed in August, which contains more than $370bn in climate spending and was called \u201cone of the single most important pieces of legislation over the past 50 years or so\u201d by Kerry in his speech, will drive deep cuts in emissions regardless of the midterms. It\u2019s widely expected, however, that Republicans will win at least one house of Congress in the elections. The GOP has decried what it calls Biden\u2019s \u201cradical green agenda\u201d and could stall or hamper the rollout of measures aimed at boosting renewable energy deployment. Biden arrives at Cop27 on Friday, potentially in a downcast mood following the outcome of the elections. Andrzej Duda, president of Poland, tells Cop27 the country is a \u201cmodel\u201d of sustainable development, which will surprise some in Europe who have long witnessed the coal-rich nation fighting tougher climate action. At least he didn\u2019t mention coal. Cop24 in Katowice, Poland, was infused for two weeks by the smell of burning coal. Duda also says: \u201cLet us not be hypocrites - it is easy for rich countries to boast of our action.\u201d He says if manufacturing has moved to other countries, the importing countries still bear some responsibility. \u201cThere is just one climate.\u201d Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, president of Zimbabwe, is wearing a colourful scarf in his country\u2019s national colours. The air conditioning is ridiculously cold in the plenary hall. He calls for African unity at Cop27: \u201cWe must speak with one voice [and] act as a block of climate victims. Only then are we likely to carry the day and secure a healthy planet for present and future generations.\u201d There is disagreement among African countries over the development of new oil and gas fields. Climate finance is critical for progress at Cop27 - see this piece - and Mnangagwa says: \u201cThose mostly responsible for the climate crisis must listen and prioritise climate finance.\u201d Cop27 has been termed the African Cop \u2013 but we have reported on the difficulties some African activists have faced in attending the summit. And yesterday our video reporter in Sharm el-Sheikh, Nikhita Chulani, spoke to the Ugandan activist Nyombi Morris who was turned away from the talks. When 24-year-old Ugandan activist Nyombi Morris arrived in Egypt for the Cop27 climate summit he was turned away from the high-level talks because he did not have the right accreditation. Only country delegates and some members of the press were allowed in the events for heads of states and government officials. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d, asked Nyombi, adding that the world leaders and negotiators who are currently deciding how far to push climate action need to quickly change the way they work and who they listen to, saying right now he doesn\u2019t think it is right to truly call this an African Cop. \u201cYou have to frontline the voices of African youth activists, because these are the innovators. These are the ones implementing actions, not our leaders, our leaders are just always in the office, but you are excluding us. So it is time to understand that this event is in Africa. We need to give African voices a chance ... We cannot lead without knowledge.\u201d The speeches by leaders have begun, with Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, kicking off with a legal warning to rich countries who have not provided adequate climate finance to date. \u201cWe will fight unrelentingly for climate justice,\u201d including in the international courts, he said. Browne speaks for the Alliance of Small Island States, whose countries are set to sink beneath rising oceans. Macky Sall, the president of Senegal, is next, stressing Africa\u2019s need for \u201ca just energy transition\u201d, given that 600 million people on the continent do not have electricity. Sall also echoes the words of Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, yesterday by saying: \u201cWe are being doubly punished\u201d, once for the colonialism that underpinned the industrial revolution, and now by the impacts of the carbon emissions it caused. Last year\u2019s Cop26, in Glasgow, delivered a global climate deal and lots of promises, including on coal use, deforestation, methane and climate finance. So how much progress has been made? Our Guardian US climate reporter, Oliver Milman, has done an expert analysis of five key pledges and what has been achieved, or not. \u201cThe last year has been a missed opportunity by many countries,\u201d David Waskow, the director of the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute, told him. In terms of highlights to watch out for today, Guardian reporter Patrick Greenfield has picked out the following: \u201cSouth African prime minister Cyril Ramaphosa is holding a press conference at 10am UK time where he is likely to speak about the landmark $8.5bn financing deal to help end its reliance on coal announced just a year ago at Cop26. Ramaphosa said the deal with money from the USA, EU, UK, Germany and France was a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the world\u2019s 13th largest carbon emitter, according to the Global Carbon Atlas. Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, is also holding a press conference at 2.30pm UK time. She is one of the most influential voices from the Global South on loss and damage, a key issue at Cop27. Tensions between China and Canada will raise concerns about the biodiversity Cop15, which the two countries are jointly hosting in Montreal next month. Side events for the key nature summit, where governments will agree this decade\u2019s targets for halting the destruction of biodiversity, are being held during both weeks at the climate Cop27 in Egypt. Yesterday, Justin Trudeau warned that China is \u201cplay[ing] aggressive games\u201d to undermine democratic institutions amid reports Beijing actively interfered in Canada\u2019s federal elections. It will be one to watch.\u201d Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog of the second day of Cop27, the United Nations climate conference taking place in Egypt. Yesterday, more than 100 world leaders gathered in Sharm el-Sheikh to hear the UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warn that the world was on a \u201chighway to hell\u201d and the prime minster of Barbados, Mia Mottley, condemn industrialised nations for failing the developed world on the climate crisis. You can read a full report here. Today, we\u2019ll hear more speeches from countries around the world, before the negotiations begin in earnest on Wednesday. I\u2019m Natalie Hanman, the Guardian\u2019s head of environment. Please send me any thoughts, stories or tips via email natalie.hanman@theguardian.com or Twitter @NatalieHanman."

            "content": "With that, we\u2019ll wrap up our live coverage of the day\u2019s news. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main news developments: Following years of souring relations between Australia and China, Anthony Albanese has confirmed he will meet with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in Indonesia as the leaders arrive in Bali for the G20 summit. As early voting centres opened in Victoria ahead of the state\u2019s election, Glenn Druery, a so-called preference whisperer, has told Guardian Australia he was the victim of \u201cthe most elaborate sting in minor party history\u201d after the Animal Justice party switched its allegiances at the last minute to unravel a deal he had orchestrated. The Queensland police officer in charge of the state\u2019s watch houses has publicly apologised for the \u201csickening and disturbing\u201d remarks by officers in leaked audio recordings published by Guardian Australia. Residents have described how flood waters moved through the small rural town of Molong in central-west New South Wales \u201clike an ocean\u201d, flooding homes and businesses overnight. Meanwhile in the town of Eugowra, more than one in five of the roughly 700 residents had to be rescued from flood waters in the past 24 hours. Victoria was also hit with flash flooding, while storms wreaked havoc in South Australia, triggering blackouts. An AFL umpire is among four people to have been arrested by Victorian police as they investigate allegations that someone with inside knowledge of the Brownlow medal tallies leaked information to a betting ring. The crew on an army helicopter that started Canberra\u2019s devastating 2020 bushfires were landing for a toilet break when they inadvertently ignited the monster blaze, an inquest has heard. More than a tonne of antibiotics was used to control a potentially deadly fish disease at two salmon farms in southern Tasmania earlier this year, but the companies and government made no public announcements at the time. Have a great evening, we\u2019ll be back to do it all again tomorrow. For all you Neighbours fans out there. Lior Harel, the Labor candidate in the battleground seat of Caulfield, appears to count Ian Smith, who played Harold Bishop on the long-running TV show, as a supporter. Early voting centres opened in Victoria today ahead of the state\u2019s election on 26 November. You can read the latest election coverage from Guardian Australia\u2019s Victorian state team, Benita Kolovos and Adeshola Ore, here and here. The New South Wales government\u2019s native forestry bill has been scrapped just days after it was announced, after a number of key parliamentarians confirmed they would vote against it. The agriculture minister, Dugald Saunders, on Monday evening announced the decision to scrap the bill that would have made it easier for private farmers to clear koala habitat. He said: While this bill upholds all existing protections for the environment, we will continue to have further conversations with local councils to progress legislation that unites communities and industry. There is significant public interest in this bill that warrants further consultation. A short time before, upper house independent Fred Nile confirmed he would not support the legislation because it would be a \u201clegislative precedent winding back the role of local government\u201d in the state, and that he was also concerned about koala habitats. I note that local councils are already able to divulge their local decision making powers to the Local Land Service. If a specific local council seeks to do this then they can do so but to impose that system on all local councils is undemocratic and disrespectful. You can read more about the so-called \u2018koala wars\u2019 here: Victoria\u2019s preference whisperer Glenn Druery falls victim to minor party sting It is, as victim Glenn Druery puts it, the \u201cmost elaborate sting in minor party history\u201d. For months the Animal Justice party was \u201cnegotiating\u201d with the so-called preference whisper to gain the support of other parties working with him \u2013 only to direct its own preferences to others at the last minute. But for Ben Schultz, the state election manager for the Animal Justice party and its lead candidate in the southern metropolitan region, undermining Druery\u2019s preference arrangements just minutes before group voting ticket registration closed on Sunday was a case of righting what he described as some \u201cwrongs\u201d. \u201cThe Animal Justice party does not agree with the wheelings and dealings of a preference whisperer and the backroom deals of predominantly older, white males. That time has come to an end,\u201d Schultz said. Read more of this exclusive here: As Anthony Albanese confirms he will be meeting China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, Guardian Australia\u2019s Paul Karp has the latest on the meeting and state of the bilateral relationship. Careful preparations prior to Albanese\u2019s announcement Australian officials have been very coy as we loitered on the sidelines of the Asean and East Asia Summits on Saturday and Sunday about the prospect of a meeting. But the sequence leading up to today\u2019s confirmation has been carefully choreographed. Step one: see the Chinese premier. Step two: signal willingness for a conversation without preconditions. Step three: compare notes with Joe Biden. Step four: lock in the conversation. Step five: touch down in Bali and park your plane next to Biden. Step six: wander along the red carpet to a pool of waiting journalists. Step seven: confirm you\u2019ll have the first significant leader-level dialogue with the Chinese regime in three years. It looks like the waiting game is over. A few minutes after touching down in Bali, Anthony Albanese confirmed he will meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, tomorrow at the G20. We\u2019ve been building up to this moment for the best part of a week. The prime minister broke the ice on Saturday night with Chinese premier Li Keqiang. This is a big breakthrough. But the bilateral relationship remains chock full of irritants. A flash-flooding event on Sunday left the town of Molong in the central-west region of New South Wales inundated. Video shows debris crashing into the pub. Chinese premier Li Keqiang told Anthony Albanese that China is ready to meet Australia halfway in strengthening bilateral relations, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reports. Li and Albanese spoke during a brief meeting after arriving at a dinner in Phnom Penh, Cambodia on the weekend, on the sidelines of the Asean summit. Before the dinner, Albanese had said he was prepared to have a conversation without \u201cpreconditions\u201d. According to the Xinhua report published on Monday, Albanese noted the upcoming 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Australia forged under Gough Whitlam\u2019s Labor government. The Xinhua report said \u201cnoting that he has visited China several times, Albanese said his country is willing to strengthen high-level exchanges with China and jointly promote the healthy development of bilateral relations\u201d. Xinhua paraphrased Li as saying \u201cChinese and Australian peoples enjoy traditional friendship, however, bilateral relations have gone through a difficult patch\u201d. The report also attributes one direct quote to Li: \u201cTaking office as the prime minister of the new Labor government, you expressed Australia\u2019s readiness to work with China to bring the bilateral relationship back on track\u201d. Xinhua also paraphrased Li as saying \u201cChina is ready to meet Australia halfway, and work with Australia to seize the opportunity of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations to promote sustained, sound and steady growth of China-Australia relations\u201d. SES perform 204 rescues across NSW in 24 hours State Emergency Services have performed more than 200 flood rescues across New South Wales in the past 24 hours, after widespread rainfall and thunderstorms triggered dangerous flash flooding across much of southern and western parts of the state. Overnight, over 120mm of rain fell in the Central West. SES NSW said more than 204 flood rescues had been performed across the state, and that it had received more than 855 requests for assistance in the past day. Warnings for 116 locations have been issued by the SES, including 16 current emergency warnings for residents to evacuate now to higher ground that are in place in Cowra, Canowindra, Derrinwong and Eugowra. Nine major flood warnings are in place across New South Wales, as authorities brace for worsening conditions in some communities across the central west, west and southern parts of the state. At a NSW flood update a short time ago, New South Wales emergency services minister Steph Cooke said that in the hours between midnight and 5am, 140 flood rescues were performed in the small town of Eugowra alone. More than 100 of the rescuers were from a roof. With a population of 700, Cooke said that more than one in five residents have had to be rescued by helicopter or by boat. Cooke also said 12 flood rescue operators from New Zealand are arriving in Sydney tonight and will head to Parkes on Tuesday to support emergency services. The State Emergency Services is appealing to its counterparts in Singapore and the United States to secure additional support. Banks to pay $126m over dodgy insurance Up to one million ANZ, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank customers will share in settlements worth $126m after being sold consumer credit insurance of little use, AAP reports. The CBA has agreed to pay $50m, ANZ $42m and Westpac $29m, without admitting any wrongdoing, over the sale of insurance when customers took out credit cards or personal loans. A $5m payment is being made by QBE Insurance regarding policies sold in relation to ANZ products. The settlements remain subject to court approval and follow similar action against National Australia Bank in 2019 which netted 50,000 customers $49.5m. Lawyers Slater and Gordon said many of the banks\u2019 customers were unlikely to be able to make a claim because they were already unemployed or had pre-existing health conditions or disabilities. Some never provided their consent to purchase the policies, were not informed that the insurance was optional, or were not told they would be charged for it. \u2018We\u2019re open to possible off ramps\u2019 in trade disputes with China, government says The trade minister, Don Farrell, has delivered a speech to the Australian APEC Study Centre, warning that \u201cgreat power rivalry is undermining international rules based order\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is no longer possible \u2013 if it ever was \u2013 to insulate our trade policy from geopolitics. Attempts at economic coercion and unfair targeting of Australian goods in recent years have demonstrated the risks to our economy when the rules of the road are ignored. Increasingly, economic policy and national security policy are intertwined \u2013 a resilient Australian economy underpins national security.\u201d Farrell also reprised comments he made to Guardian Australia in July suggesting a \u201ccompromise situation\u201d or \u201calternative way\u201d to settle trade disputes might emerge in talks with China. On Monday Farrell said that \u201cas with any WTO disputes, we\u2019re open to possible off ramps that result in a mutually agreed solution\u201d. Farrell set out a series of principles of Australia\u2019s trade policy, including: To \u201cdeepen and diversify trading relationships in our own region\u201d because \u201coverreliance on any partner is a significant risk\u201d Reform the international trade system, particularly the functions of the World Trade Organisation Use trade to help create jobs and higher wages The benefits of trade must be shared amongst the community Farrell confirmed that Labor won\u2019t include investor state dispute mechanisms in future trade agreements, and will review the use of ISDS clauses in existing deals. Farmer found in mud dies in hospital A Queensland farmer who survived for more than two days stuck in mud after falling off his tractor has died in hospital on the Sunshine Coast, reports the ABC. Emergency services found Tom Killen covered head to toe in mud and took him to hospital last Tuesday morning, after a friend of the 95-year-old discovered him by a dam on his property in south-east Queensland when going to check on him after days of silence. Killen remained in hospital. The ABC reports that police today said he died over the weekend. An AFL umpire was one of the four men arrested in relation to suspicious betting activity connected to this season\u2019s Brownlow Medal. On Monday, Victoria police detectives from the Sporting Integrity Intelligence Unit arrested and interviewed four men as part of an investigation, with one person with inside knowledge of the Brownlow medal tallies accused of leaking the information to a betting ring. Police are investigating how many matches may have had votes released and exactly how much money was awarded from the bets, reports AAP. At this stage, police have no information to suggest that the outcome of the votes was impacted as the allegations relate solely to the distribution of information. On Monday afternoon, a statement from the AFL said that \u201cone of the four persons arrested this morning is an AFL umpire\u201d. \u201cThe suspicious betting activity, on bets placed on round-by-round vote getters, triggered a response and notification by one of the AFL\u2019s betting agency partners,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe AFL and Victoria Police have no information to suggest that the awarding of match day votes was impacted in connection with the suspicious betting activity, as the allegations relate solely to the distribution leaking or improper communication of the 3,2,1 voting outcomes post some specific matches during the season to unauthorised persons,\u201d the statement said. AFL EGM Football and General Counsel Andrew Dillon said: \u201cI want to stress that neither Victoria Police, nor the AFL have information to suggest that the outcome of the Brownlow Medal was impacted\u201d. \u201cPost-game, the Brownlow votes are sealed and stored in a secure off-site location and not opened until they are delivered on stage on Brownlow night. The sealed vote cards are audited throughout the season by KPMG,\u201d Dillon said. Tim Wiebusch from the SES says the emergency is \u201cfar from over\u201d, with parts of the Murray not to peak until the end of the week. There are 85 warnings active across Victoria as river systems respond to heavy rainfall across the state. Overnight, we saw flash flooding \u2026 at Mount Martha through to Mornington all the way across to Hastings around 300 requests for assistance as a result of flash flooding through a storm cell that went through, leading to around 40mm of rain in a couple of hours. SES volunteers and other emergency services are still in the area assessing those impacts and still responding to around about 80 requests for assistance. There are seven homes that have been flooded above floor level, while parts of the Hume Freeway remain closed between Purnell and Chilton. We have also seen a range of roads that remain closed in the north of the state, there are almost 450 roads closed at this time. In particular, the Murray Valley Highway is currently closed as well. Across the state, we are now starting to see a range of our river systems reach the major flood levels. We have the Murray River at major flood level in various areas \u2026 we also have a range of rivers at the moderate flood level. For our Murray River communities, there is still some time to go with the flooding that is occurring. Rainfall totals up to 150mm in north-east Victoria Christie Johnson from the Bureau of Meteorology said there had been rainfall totals up to 150mm in north-east Victoria including 147mm in Mount Hotham. With that system that came in from the west, we saw some severe thunderstorms with that and did have warnings issued for parts of the south-west district, the central district and in particular, we saw some severe storms \u2026 that intensified as it moved over the bay and over the Mornington Peninsula. We did see flash flooding and heavy rainfall \u2026 we also saw rainfall totals in the north-east over the course of the last 24-36 hours and we have seen 100-150 mm up there. At the moment, the highest rainfall for the system is about 147mm at Mount Hotham. She said the system was now moving away, with a cold south-westerly moving in bringing showers across the state and isolated thunderstorms across the north. We\u2019ll see showers continue probably tomorrow also contracting to the south of the ranges but very cold air moving up. We will see snow level drop from perhaps tonight, and perhaps down as low as 800m above sea level. We can also see some small hail with some of those showers in the very cold air \u2026 that will continue on Wednesday when we will see snow level above around 1,000 metres and that will continue to move away and the showers. Another system may develop over the coming weekend but with far lower rainfall totals. \u2018Still some time to go\u2019 with ongoing flooding in Victoria Emergency services are providing an update in Victoria. They say there\u2019s \u201cstill some time to go\u201d with the ongoing flooding events. There have been more than 650 calls for assistance in the past 24 hours, the bulk of which were from the Mornington Peninsula area. Andrew Crisp said there\u2019d been \u201csignificant rainfall\u201d across the state, with a number of flood rescues and a derailed train in Geelong. What we did see \u2026 at about 5.30 this morning near Geelong was a 1.7km train with about 55 carriages, 16 of those carriages derailed down in that area. Fortunately, we have been advised there was no one injured as a result of that particular derailment. We know the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is on scene and undertaking investigation in relation of what caused the development itself. We do not have any further details of this at this point in time and will let them undergo their investigation. Army helicopter sparked massive Canberra bushfire after crew stopped for toilet break The crew on an army helicopter that started Canberra\u2019s devastating 2020 bushfires were landing for a toilet break when they inadvertently ignited the monster blaze. An inquest began at the ACT coroner\u2019s court on Monday with evidence from the man in command of the helicopter that started the fire. An MRH-90 Taipan helicopter \u2013 codenamed ANGEL21 \u2013 was scouting remote helipads that could be used by outside firefighting teams on 27 January when its searchlight ignited the blaze in the Orroral Valley.

While presenting the Kyle &amp; Jackie O Show on KIIS FM on Monday, Jackie O, real name Jackie Henderson, said she had been struggling to recover after she contracted Covid-19 earlier this year, and that she had received medical advice to stop working in order to address an enduring cough and fatigue. \u201cI\u2019ve been not very well ever since I\u2019ve had Covid, I\u2019ve been struggling with this fatigue,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cEver since picking up that virus, I\u2019ve been to the doctor several times, and he said because I\u2019ve been pushing myself every day, after the show, all I\u2019ve been doing is sleeping, and I\u2019m not getting better.\u201d \u201cI just have to take some time off, so I\u2019m ending the show today. As in now \u2026 you know how much this show means to me; you know how much I push through everything, and I would not be doing this unless I absolutely had to.

Ambassador Shingo Yamagami said Tokyo stood ready to cooperate on cutting-edge defence technology with the trilateral Aukus alliance between Australia, the US and UK. Yamagami said Japan\u2019s place may not be obvious in an alliance between three English-speaking nations with a long history of military interoperability and integrated defence industries. \u201cAt first glance, some may argue Japan has no skin in this game,\u201d the ambassador told the Advancing Aukus conference on Monday. \u201cWhy should Aukus matter to Japan? Aukus matters to us a lot.\u201d He said the primary role of the agreement through which Australia will acquire nuclear-propelled submarines was to act as a deterrent in the Indo-Pacific. This included the prospect of hosting Australia\u2019s nuclear submarines when the time came. \u201cWe are a frontline state facing challenging circumstances in the dangerous neighbourhood of Southeast Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch submarines will increase regional deterrence.\u201d While not directly referring to China as a threat, Tokyo\u2019s envoy spoke of the need for alliances to manage a more dangerous region, noting Japan\u2019s future was tied to the west\u2019s force projection. \u201cIn other words, what matters to you matters to us too,\u201d he said. Severe storms caused flash flooding in New South Wales, with the town of Forbes receiving 118mm \u2013 its heaviest rain on record this months. River levels have risen sharply as a result of the recent weather events. Footage of flooding at Safety Beach on Melbourne\u2019s Mornington Peninsula, according to Channel 7 reporter Paul Dowsley. Reports of Iran protester sentenced to death \u2018deeply disturbing\u2019, Wong says Foreign minister Penny Wong has responded to reports that a protester in Iran has been sentenced to death as \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d. In a tweet, Wong reiterated that Australia opposes the death penalty in all circumstances. \u201cWe continue to support the people of Iran and their right to freedom of expression and equality for women and girls,\u201d Wong said. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has made an appeal to Australia for coal supply and energy infrastructure including generators, after the war-torn country suffered recent damage to its energy system. Kuleba asked Anthony Albanese for the assistance in person when the pair met at the Asean summit in Cambodia in recent days, following missile attacks last weekend that damaged more than 40% of Ukraine\u2019s energy network and led to blackouts and \u201ccatastrophic\u201d problems with heating and water supply, according to the Ukraine government. In a statement released by the embassy of Ukraine in Canberra, ambassador Vasyl Myroshnychenko said Albanese and Kuleba had a \u201cvery positive\u201d discussion in Phnom Penh. Myroshnychenko said: It shows the mateship of Australia and Ukraine in standing up for democracy and sovereignty against autocracy and illegality. Ukraine really needs the mateship now. Our goal is to help our people through immediate recovery of critical energy supply, diversification of energy sources, and the development of crisis stock. It would be invaluable to Ukraine to again receive coal supply from Australia, a world leader. It is also a great engineering nation, and can help us with generators \u2013 to keep essential services like hospitals and water treatments plants going \u2013 and via transformers to restore the overall system. While Ukrainians are determined to survive this hard winter, and while our troops are making advances on the battlefield, the additional support we request from Australia would have life-saving impact. Australia could free a third of its prisoners with little risk to community, new research finds Exclusive: Australia\u2019s prison population could be reduced by one-third with little risk to community safety, according to research conducted for the Institute of Public Affairs. The research paper by Prof Mirko Bagaric, the dean of law at the Swinburne University of Technology, recommends law reform to prevent imprisonment of non-violent offenders. It adds to calls from Labor\u2019s assistant treasury minister, Andrew Leigh, and the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia to tackle Australia\u2019s rising incarceration rates, particularly among women and Indigenous women.

Premier Dominic Perrottet says families in Mount Druitt in Sydney\u2019s west, Wagga Wagga in the Riverina, Kempsey and Nambucca in the north, Bourke in the far west, and Cobar and Coonamble in the central west will be first to get on board with the program. Early childhood services in the seven locations will begin rolling out the first stage of the universal pre-kindergarten policy early next year, with interested providers urged to register now. The $5.9bn 10-year investment in universal pre-kindergarten was the centrepiece of the NSW 2022-23 budget, and was touted as a way to get women back into the workforce and tackle the gender pay gap. The government promised places would be created in Sydney\u2019s west, south-west and regional NSW, where there is less than one childcare placement for every three children. More locations will be added ahead of the state-wide implementation of a full new year of education for children by 2030. That\u2019s it from me for today \u2013 you have the wonderful Elias Visontay with you for the rest of the afternoon. In more official tweet news\u2026 Although the prime minister Anthony Albanese is overseas, he\u2019s taken to social media to acknowledge the extreme weather in the country\u2019s south east over the weekend. Australia sends condolences to Turkey following explosion in Istanbul Six people have been killed and 81 injured in Istanbul after an explosion that Turkey\u2019s president described as an act of terrorism. The minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, expressed Australia\u2019s condolences to Turkey on Twitter: Good morning from Phnom Penh. Anthony Albanese is on his way to the airport after two days in the Cambodian capital for the Asean and East Asia Summits. We fly today to the G20 in Bali, where today\u2019s focus is on the critical bilateral meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. This will be Biden\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with his Chinese counterpart since winning the presidency. On Sunday, Biden met Albanese for about 40 minutes on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit. As we reported overnight, and senior US official Jake Sullivan confirmed with US reporters afterwards, yesterday\u2019s conversation between the US and Australia was about comparing notes ahead of today\u2019s bilateral in Bali. Sullivan said Biden wanted to be \u201cwell coordinated with his closest allies\u201d. Albanese will meet the summit host Joko Widodo shortly after we land this evening, before pushing on to a business event on the sidelines of the G20. From the Australian perspective, all eyes will be on whether Albanese gets his own conversation with Xi during the G20 summit after breaking the ice with the Chinese premier at a gala dinner in Phnom Penh on Saturday night. Resource sector concedes threat from corporate \u2018gorillas\u2019 was unfortunate The Australian Resources &amp; Energy Employer Association head of policy and public affairs, Tom Reid, has appeared at the Senate inquiry into Labor\u2019s IR bill. Labor\u2019s Karen Grogan asked about comments from the AREEA chief executive Steve Knott that \u201ccorporate gorillas in the mining, oil and gas sector have said this is not on\u201d and are threatening a multi-million dollar campaign \u201clike the mining tax on steroids\u201d. Reid said the use of the term \u201cgorilla'\u201d was \u201cunfortunate\u201d: [Knott] likes to speak freely, he is quite colourful and open when talking to stakeholders about issues that have got him animated and concerned. That media comment was in the immediate aftermath of the bill coming in \u2013 Steve [Knott] was very shocked by the size of the bill, the inclusion of things with no evidence base. It was a bit unfortunate. But as for the campaign? Reid said: We have the full support of AREEA\u2019s board and broad support of the membership. We are very actively and very publicly trying to explain to the general community and parliament just how damaging parts of the bill could be. We don\u2019t apologise [for] going ahead with that, given the enormous contribution to employment and economy from our sector. Grogan then tried to cross-examine him on the revenue and tax paid by some of AREEA\u2019s larger members, but Reid said he had \u201climited insights\u201d to offer. Reid said part of the industry\u2019s campaign would highlight that the parts of the bill aiming to lift low paid workers\u2019 pay is completely different to broader changes to greenfields agreements and the single-interest, multi-employer bargaining stream, warning that the bill risks \u201cpulling the highest paid and most productive sectors of the economy\u201d into increased complexity. Labor\u2019s chair, Tony Sheldon, then attacked the \u201chighly profitable\u201d and influential miners, questioning whether AREEA were \u201ca bunch of extremists\u201d and labelling them the \u201cmonkey grinder of corporate gorilla munsters\u201d. There was a question in there \u2013 are they the \u201coverpaid gorillas of the Australian economy, telling everyone else to get out of their way?\u201d Reid again thanked Knott for the \u201cunfortunate use of the term gorillas in the press\u201d and pivoted to a very gracious answer about AREEA\u2019s concerns about the bill, refusing to take the bait. Power outages continue in SA after storms More than 33,000 properties across South Australia remain without power after weekend storms blacked out 163,000 homes and businesses in the worst outage since the statewide blackout in 2016. SA was hit with more than 423,000 lightning strikes, damaging winds and torrential rain on Saturday causing widespread damage, with 500 reports of wires down, and minor flooding. Blackouts have persisted in areas of the Eyre and York peninsulas, across the Adelaide Hills and suburbs and through the Riverland. Head of corporate affairs at SA Power Networks Paul Roberts said: SA Power Networks has mobilised all possible resources and has called in interstate field resources to assist. Rebuilding and repairing the network and restoring power will continue into Tuesday and possibly beyond. Roberts said SA Power Networks understood long delays in restoring the grid were frustrating for customers but those still without power on Monday should plan for an extended outage. \u2013 from AAP Major flooding at Bathurst could overtop levees this afternoon: BoM Adelaide has been chosen to host the first LIV Golf tournament on Australian soil with the controversial rebel tour to be held at the Grange Golf Club next year. Greg Norman, LIV Golf\u2019s figurehead, announced the venue as one of 14 on the tour\u2019s calendar on Monday and said his home country was \u201cdeserving of the world\u2019s top competition\u201d. The likes of former world No 1 Cameron Smith, and other major winners Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia, will head to Australia for the event running from 21 to 23 April. Many of the world\u2019s top golfers have eschewed playing in the hugely lucrative league, but those who have made the switch to the Saudi-backed competition have been indefinitely barred from playing on the PGA Tour. British Open winner Smith and Marc Leishman are the two most high profile Australians to have jumped ship and both are expected to return home for the event in Adelaide. Norman said: This is an opportunity to grow the game with generations of Australians while connecting them with star players like Cameron Smith who are building a new platform for golf around the globe. There is massive potential for Australia to play a bigger role in this great sport, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited to showcase Adelaide for our league\u2019s debut year. Smith, who is expected to be able to defend his Open crown next year given his victory gave him a five-year exemption, told the Sydney Morning Herald this morning he wanted the warring tours to \u201crise above politics and let us play\u201d at the majors. South-eastern flood risk to weaken in January 2023, BoM says The Bureau of Meteorology expects flooding to continue throughout the summer. Forecaster Jonathan How has told ABC News this morning: Above average rainfall with tropical moisture falling down from the north increases flooding risk. It is expected to weaken off in January 2023 and should be done and dusted with in February. A couple more months of above average rainfall. The NSW premier Dominic Perrottet also reminded Australians to follow instructions from emergency services at a press conference this morning: When the orders are made, please follow those instructions. They are not there for the sake of it. They are there to keep you and your family safe as it may be the case you don\u2019t see flooding around when the orders are in place, that is because we expect and predict further flooding moving forward. \u2018All efforts on stability\u2019: Jim Chalmers on China relationship The Australian treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has been asked on Bloomberg TV about the thawing of relations with China. He said: All of our efforts are into making this relationship between Australia and China more stable. The prime minister\u2019s schedule hasn\u2019t been finalised for the next couple of days, but we\u2019ve made it very clear we think engaging in a calm, considered, respectful and meaningful way would make a contribution to stabilising the relationship. I think it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest for our region to be peaceful, prosperous, stable and secure. To the extent we can engage to help ensure that, we\u2019re obviously very interested in doing that. To the extent we need to stand up for our national interest when it comes to trade interests, we\u2019ll do that too. Asked about China\u2019s easing of Covid zero policies, Chalmers said: One of the reasons why the Chinese economy is slowing is these Covid restrictions, and that has big implications for Australia \u2026 We don\u2019t pretend to take domestic decisions about Covid management on behalf of other countries. But the Chinese slowdown has big implications for us. We\u2019d like to see as part of the stabilising of out relationship some of those trade restrictions lifted \u2013 that\u2019s important for us, it\u2019s important for our economy. Chalmers said the Albanese government is responding to the invasion of Ukraine, high prices of fuel and food, and the China slowdown by \u201crebuilding our buffers\u201d with a \u201cmore responsibly budget\u201d. New emergency flood warnings for inland NSW NSW SES have issued several new emergency warnings in the last hour: Eugowra have been warned to move to higher ground. Western Plains tourist park and Derriwong has been warned to prepare to evacuate. Jemalong Weir and Euabalong township have been told to prepare to isolate. GPs tell NSW government to \u2018stop this madness\u2019 on expanded pharmacist role We brought you what the New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, had to say earlier in defence of the new scheme that will see pharmacists play an expanded role in the NSW health system. From today, pharmacists will be able to administer a wider range of vaccinations. In the next stage, pharmacists will be able to prescribe medication for antibiotics for urinary tract infections and the final stage will allow trained pharmacists to prescribe medications for a range of conditions such as gastro, nausea and vomiting, allergies, shingles, dermatitis, psoriasis, acne and hormonal contraception. This is what the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) had to say on the issue, warning the state government \u201cin the strongest possible terms to abandon its plan\u201d. The RACGP president, Prof Karen Price, urged the government to: Stop this madness before it\u2019s too late, this is a recipe for disaster plain and simple. Price warned that the NSW scheme could put patients\u2019 safety in jeopardy, highlighting that \u201cincidents have emerged from Queensland\u2019s urinary tract infection pharmacy pilot, which should make policymakers second guess expanding pharmacy scope of practice.\u201d GPs have reported many concerning incidents including a patient in their 50s prescribed antibiotics for a presumed UTI who turned out to have a 15-centimetre pelvic mass. There was also another patient in their 60s with a recurrent UTI being prescribed the antibiotic trimethoprim despite known resistance to the drug. Keep in mind too these are just some of the cases we know about. Meanwhile, in the UK the British pharmacists\u2019 own defence union warned of incidents of unsafe practice that have emerged with the rise of independent pharmacist prescribers. Price also said that patient care would become fragmented as a result of the plan. The shortage of GPs was one of the justifications for the plan, which Price acknowledged but said increased investment in general practice was a better answer. What\u2019s more she said handing pharmacists more responsibility \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d when their profession too is also experiencing shortages. If the NSW Government is to proceed with his pilot or something similar, the focus should be on pharmacists working as part of a team in the hospital or medical practice setting with doctors and other healthcare workers, rather than operating in an unsupervised retail space. Police have opened a critical incident investigation after a car crash in Sydney\u2019s north left five teenagers in hospital. NSW police says the single-vehicle crash occurred about 4.40pm yesterday in Cammeray shortly after police had terminated a pursuit of the car: Police had initiated, then terminated, a pursuit involving a Holden Commodore shortly before it left the road and struck a tree. A 16-year-old girl, who was allegedly driving the sedan, suffered head and spinal injuries, while a second 16-year-old girl suffered head and facial injuries. Back-seat passengers included an 18-year-old man, who has suffered head and chest injuries, and two male youths, both aged 17. They are suffering spinal injuries, with one also being treated for abdominal injuries. All are reported to be in a critical condition in Royal North Shore hospital. A critical incident team from Blue Mountains police area command is now investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident under Strike Force Mulvany. The investigation will be subject to independent review. Police are appealing for anyone with dashcam vision or who witnessed the crash to come forward. Wages, jobs and a bit of energy to stir debate this week It\u2019s one of the quirks about the Australian Bureau of Statistics that it releases numbers on consumer prices for each quarter about three weeks before it gets around to giving us the lowdown on wages. So, back on 26 October, we learned consumer price inflation had increased to 7.3% \u2013 its highest level since 1990 \u2013 but it\u2019s only this Wednesday that we find out how far wages have been lagging in \u201creal\u201d terms. The ABS now releases monthly CPI numbers (though, without a lot of coverage as they\u2019re not quite as thorough as quarterly figures). We asked why they don\u2019t give us monthly wage price index (WPI) figures too but were told it would be too costly to do so. Anyway, back to this week. Economists are estimating the WPI will come in at about 3% or just above, accelerating from 2.6% in the June quarter (itself the highest since the September quarter of 2014). A real wage decline of 4%-plus doesn\u2019t look good for workers. (Even against the Reserve Bank\u2019s (RBA) preferred inflation gauge, the gap would be about three percentage points.) We\u2019ll get a reminder of how tight the labour market is on Thursday when the ABS releases its jobless data for October. This figure is subject to various winds, such as whether the participation rate ebbs or flows. But economists think the unemployment rate will tick up to 3.6% (from 3.5%) \u2013 still not far off its lowest in half a century despite seven interest rate rises by the RBA in as many months. Speaking of which, recent comments by bank officials (and easing inflation numbers abroad) have seen expectations about how much more the central bank will need to move. A pre-Christmas cash rate rise is now just over an even bet: Another issue to watch this week will be tomorrow\u2019s AGL Energy\u2019s annual general meeting in Melbourne. There is quite a lot on the line, and not just who\u2019s on the board of Australia\u2019s biggest electricity generator. We previewed the action at Melbourne\u2019s Recital Hall (while noting the meeting of shareholders is jostling on this month\u2019s billing with acts called: big fiddle little fiddle and big thief). Victorian Liberals don\u2019t rule out deal with independents As early voting opens in Victoria, the state\u2019s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, joined 3AW\u2019s Neil Mitchell for a lengthy interview. Mitchell asks why the Coalition has preferenced the Greens above Labor. Guy says: We\u2019re talking about who\u2019s last and second last, so I\u2019d hardly say we\u2019re referencing one of the two - one\u2019s last, one\u2019s second last. But Neil, I don\u2019t intend to do any political deals with the Australian Greens and I don\u2019t intend to do any with the Australian Labor party either. Mitchell: And what about independents if you have to? Guy: Well whatever the contents of the parliament, we have to work with it. The public would expect us to do what is right for them and that is make a parliament work. Mitchell: So if you\u2019re in a position to form government, which does seem unlikely, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s more likely to be a Labor minority government? Guy: The media says that \u2013 you were writing me off two months ago and now every poll says is our primary votes are the same or better than the government \u2026 I\u2019ve been written off but everyone but we are in a position where they were absolutely winnable, I\u2019ve been saying that all along. Murray River communities warned to be on alert for flooding The Victorian SES has issued multiple watch and act warnings along the Murray River on the state\u2019s border. ASIS chief defends \u2018respect for open justice\u2019 in interview about Collaery case The outgoing head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), Paul Symon, says he sought to make clear \u201cmy respect for open justice\u201d during his involvement in the Bernard Collaery case. Speaking to the ABC, Symon was asked whether the Collaery case had harmed the agency\u2019s reputation. The commonwealth repeatedly intervened in the case in an attempt to shroud parts of proceedings in remarkable secrecy, in some cases keeping material even from Collaery and his legal team. Evidence from ASIS was used to help justify that secrecy by arguing that the open hearing of sensitive material would put Australia\u2019s national security at risk. But Symon said his affidavits to the court always made clear his respect for the need for open justice. He also said he had a legal responsibility to protect the work of ASIS. And ultimately the government has decided to drop the matter, and my comment would be that, because I had to fulfil responsibilities, and because the law has a disposition to open justice, we only got as far in this matter as a judge who\u2019s the appropriate person \u2013 not me or government \u2013 a judge was trying to balance this, on one hand, open justice and on the other hand in affidavits that I was presenting to the judge the very real concerns that I had in relation to this particular matter. And the judge \u2013 justice Mossop \u2013 was dealing with these issues, I think, with great care and attention. My approach to the affidavits I wrote absolutely and very centrally highlighted my respect for open justice as a key premise of the legal system. These are not absolute matters and it really fell to a judge \u2014 he was working through the process of how to deal with sensitive information. And now the matter is closed. I feel that with the responsibilities that I carried did that conscientiously to navigate through the precept of open justice but also the legal responsibilities that I carry in my job. Collaery was accused of unlawfully disclosing protected information about a 2004 mission to spy on Timor-Leste during negotiations to split oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea. The case against Collaery was dropped earlier this year following an intervention by the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus. One limb of the case remains ongoing \u2013 the commonwealth\u2019s attempt to suppress a pretrial judgment that it believes would disclose sensitive information. The Guardian revealed last week that the Commonwealth has spent another $250,000 on the case since Collaery\u2019s prosecution was dropped. Molong residents rescued from floods as homes and shops damaged The central west NSW town of Molong has been isolated because of flooding, and emergency services say the force of the flood waters has smashed shop windows and knocked out the back wall of a local supermarket. At least two large shipping containers were carried by floodwaters through the centre of the township, according to Fire and Rescue NSW (FRNSW). In response to the disaster, local FRNSW crews have been out rescuing trapped residents, stranded in roof-high floodwaters overnight. The Molong team of firefighters rushed into action around midnight, assisting the State Emergency Service and other agencies, door-knocking homes under threat and evacuating residents. The fire crew established an evacuation centre at the town\u2019s RSL club and set up a makeshift helicopter landing strip, with flashing guidance lights, on the oval of the Molong Central School, helping to vector in an Australian Defence Force chopper, tasked with rescuing locals from roof tops. They also rescued two people and their dog from knee-deep water inside a house in Watson Street and another couple from the top floor of the old motel. The firefighters and a police officer, from nearby Manildra, then waded through chest-high water to reach another woman, stranded in her Watson Street home. The crew helped to establish roadblocks overnight to prevent heavy vehicles passing through the floodwaters and causing further damage. The firefighters now report the floodwaters are receding as they begin clean-up operations to clear a large amount of mud and debris from Molong\u2019s streets. A train has derailed at Inverleigh, west of Geelong, this morning with multiple of containers smashed and substantially damaged. An Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) spokesperson said no one was injured in the incident and that none of the wagons were carrying dangerous goods. Guardian Australia understands between eight and 10 wagons were derailed. An ARTC spokesperson said the incident occurred about 5.30am this morning between Inverleigh and Gheringhap, approximately 30km west of Geelong. The service derailed with containers displaced on both sides of the track and some within an adjoining paddock. The incident has resulted in the closure of the Melbourne-Adelaide rail corridor. Affected customers have been notified. The Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator has been notified and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has taken control of the site. ARTC says it has immediately commenced working with customers on a recovery plan, and that further details will be provided once a full assessment of the area is complete. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has announced that the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) will be asked to develop new measures of media diversity. Traditional measures of media diversity currently measure and regulate ownership and control of traditional TV, print and radio \u2013 but not the consumption and popularity of news sources. They do not account for digital news services. In 2020 Acma released a research paper, discussing the need to measure: Source diversity \u2013 the extent to which the news media market is populated by a diverse array of content providers, Content diversity \u2013 the extent to which news media content presents different voices, viewpoints and demographic profiles, and Consumption diversity \u2013 the extent to which audiences consume a diverse array of news media content. This work will be updated with a new consultation paper about promoting media diversity and protecting our democratic processes in early 2023. Rowland said: The issue of media diversity and news media concentration is a matter of concern to many Australians. Australia needs a new framework for measuring news media diversity, one that takes account of the contemporary media environment and changing news media consumption patterns over time. This process reinforces the Albanese Government\u2019s expressed intent to pursue a principled, evidence-based and consultative approach to supporting media diversity and public interest journalism in Australia. \u2018Personally I\u2019m for the koalas,\u2019 Hazzard says, but suggests he won\u2019t cross the floor on forestry bill As a final question, Hazzard is asked about koalas once again dominating NSW politics with the National party bringing in legislation to make it easier for landholder it is to clear land. With reports some liberal MPs may cross the floor to oppose this legislation, Hazzard says he is not concerned about any display of disunity. No. What I\u2019m worried about is that people would be concerned about democracy taking its normal course. And of course people are entitled to argue the case both ways. Personally I\u2019m for the koalas, but, you know, I\u2019ll see what happens. Rowland: Will you cross the floor then? Hazzard: I don\u2019t think I have done that in 32 years. I\u2019m about to finish up my career in 32 years in politics. \u2018We\u2019ve got the tools, we just now have to behave like sensible human beings\u2019: Hazzard on Covid measures ABC News breakfast asked Hazzard about the WA government not ruling out bringing back mandatory mask-wearing, and whether NSW will be leaving the option on the table. He says he is not, and uses the opportunity to say NSW did the heavy lifting when borders were shut. No. No, we\u2019re not looking \u2013 look, New South Wales led the country, let\u2019s be honest about this. We led the country, we were the ones that were taking everybody from overseas for WA because they locked their borders, for Queensland, for Victoria, we struck the balance all the way through, our economy as a result here in New South Wales is booming. We are doing well. What are they doing in WA? No respect meant, but they put a gate across the Nullarbor. If they want to do that, that\u2019s their business, I\u2019m not going to criticise but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do. People in New South Wales know how to live with this virus and we\u2019ll continue to live with it now and we\u2019ll be cautious. I\u2019d encourage people to be cautious. I\u2019d encourage people to be cautious but not going to go down the path - I mean, three years ago, Michael, we had no vaccines, two years ago, we had vaccines, then we had antivirals, we got all those things available to us, we\u2019ve got the tools, we just now have to behave like sensible human beings and don\u2019t go to work if you\u2019re sick, wear a mask if you\u2019re in close proximity with other people. Try to get through the next five weeks of the rising numbers and we will get through it. NSW Covid peak expected by December, health minister says Michael Rowland: Covid is on the rise again, new variants, infections are increasing. How worried should people in New South Wales should be as we head into Christmas? Hazzard: There\u2019s no question that the new variants and subvariants are here in New South Wales. Right across Australia, actually, and doesn\u2019t matter where you are. And in New South Wales, alone, last week on our weekly report, it was around 2,500 a day that were being reported. That\u2019s a massive underassessment because there\u2019s no longer compulsory for people to record their rapid antigen tests. So we know it\u2019s increasing. We\u2019re expecting on the basis of the modelling that we\u2019ll see a peak towards end of this month, early December or moving into early December. The short message here is we have to live with Covid. It\u2019s here, but be sensible. Everyone has learnt the lessons, if you\u2019re indoors in an area you can\u2019t distance yourself, wear a mask. If you\u2019re feeling ill, stay home, don\u2019t go and spread your germs around at work. Wash your hands regularly, just do what we have all learnt to do and we\u2019ll do OK. The NSW health minister has explained more about the trial to expand the role of pharmacists to allow them to prescribe medications such as antibiotics. How will the plan work in practice? Hazzard: How it will work in practice is that if you have \u2013 anybody who knows mostly it\u2019s women with UTIs, for example. If you get a UTI, it\u2019s terribly, terribly painful \u2013 if you had to wait any more than a day, it\u2019s agony. So to wait possibly six weeks is just, it\u2019s out of the question. So if we can actually make sure that person can go to their pharmacist, the pharmacist will have completed a module, a training program, and is able to prescribe the relevant antibiotic. Of course, that brings almost instantaneous relief in that situation. Going back when Covid started, pharmacists weren\u2019t vaccinating for Covid. They are now, vaccinating for Covid, meningoccocal, influenza, a range of other vaccinations. So we\u2019re extending the vaccinations as of today. So they\u2019ll be able to vaccinate in a variety of range. It\u2019s all based on the work that\u2019s been done in Queensland as there\u2019s a pilot and trial operating up there and it\u2019s going well. So we think it\u2019s going to relieve the pressure on patients and that\u2019s what it should be about. Nut also \u2026 the pressure that goes on to our hospital EDs. If you can\u2019t get to see your GP, where are you going to go? You\u2019re going to sit in an emergency department. As for the criticism from the Australian Medical Association describing this as a rogue health policy and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners saying it would put patients\u2019 safety at risk, Hazzard says: We\u2019re absolutely convinced that this trial, this pilot, is going to be successful and I think the GPs just need to settle down, relax, and let the trial and the pilot take place. No one is suggesting for even a second that patients shouldn\u2019t go and see their GPs regularly. Of course they should. But if you need to get that antibiotic, for example, the UTI, you should be able to do it and you should be able to do it quickly and not wait for a GP for possibly six weeks. My message to them is \u2013 love you dearly, but you need just to relax and look at what\u2019s happening \u2026 and understand there\u2019s a bigger world out there that we need to look after our patients and should be part of the equation. From today, pharmacists in NSW will be able to diagnose and prescribe medication for patients without consulting their GP, amid strong criticism from the Australian Medical Association. A 12-month trial has been announced evaluating pharmacists prescribing medications, including antibiotics for urinary tract infections, treatments for skin conditions and infections, and birth control. Pharmacists will have to complete additional training first. The NSW health minister Brad Hazzard told ABC News this morning the plan was put in place to try to ease the shortage of GPs in the state: We have got very low numbers who are coming out of medical school who now want to be GPs. Last figure I saw was about 14% of all new graduates are choosing to go into general practice. In areas like the Hunter, the local MPs up there tell me it could take six to eight weeks to see a GP. Certainly in the city, it takes at least a week and sometimes two or three. So it\u2019s a huge problem for us and there are certain vaccinations and also other issues that need a much quicker response. Pharmacists are well placed, they have been doing this in New Zealand, in the UK, in Canada, and the world hasn\u2019t fallen in. In fact, it works well. While the AMA supported mass vaccinations through pharmacies, expanding the role of pharmacists to treat UTIs, shingles, gastroenteritis, nausea, psoriasis and prescribing oral contraceptives was not acceptable according to the peak body. \u2013 with AAP \u2018I have a responsibility \u2026 not to do just the popular things\u2019: Daniel Andrews fends off criticisms Dan Andrews has an interesting exchange with ABC News Breakfast host, Michael Rowland: Rowland: Daniel Andrews, like it or not, election contests these days are pretty much contests of personality, as they are battles of ideas. And with that in mind, do you accept you polarise people in Victoria? Andrews: Well, that\u2019s a matter for commentators, Michael. And that\u2019s a matter for others. I\u2019ve got a positive and optimistic plan ... Rowland: You don\u2019t think you trigger sharp views either side? Andrews: Again, that\u2019s \u2013 Michael, I\u2019m not here to talk about myself. I\u2019m here to talk about and work for the people of Victoria. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done ... Today, just as yesterday when we made our announcements, we\u2019re bringing back government-owned electricity. The state electricity commission is coming back. With 100% renewables to cut emissions, to cut bills, to create jobs, and to set our state up for the future. That\u2019s positive. That\u2019s optimistic. Rowland: Do you accept there are voters out there, possibly a lot of voters and possibly a lot of voters in Labor-held seats, just waiting with their figurative baseball bats wanting to punish you for the lockdowns and other Covid measures in Victoria? Andrews: Well, what I accept, Michael, is that I have a responsibility as the leader of this state not to do just the popular things, but to do the things that are right. And that meant that there were some very challenging decisions that had to be made. But people\u2019s opinions, people\u2019s views \u2013 that\u2019s what elections are about. People will cast their votes, starting today, through until the 26th of November. My job is to put forward a positive and optimistic plan. The premier referred to his \u201cpositive and optimistic plan\u201d seven times in the five-minute interview. Andrews rules out deal with the Greens and independents in event of minority government Dan Andrews was also asked what would happen if Labor finds itself in a minority government situation \u2013 will it do a deal with the Greens? He replies: No deal will be offered and no deal will be done. ABC News Breakfast\u2019s Michael Rowland asks: And independents \u2013 no deals with independents? Andrews: No deal will be offered and no deal will be done. Rowland: So if you\u2019re in a minority situation and you hold more seats than the Liberal party, what happens? You go back to another election? Andrews: Well, I think what the best thing to do, and what happens, Michael, is we work hard for the next 13 days, we work hard to put a positive and optimistic plan out there, and we\u2019ll see what the verdict of Victorian voters is. I\u2019m arguing, I\u2019m urging people to vote for a strong, stable majority Labor government, to vote for your local Labor candidate. Victoria goes to the polls on 26 November, though early voting begins today. State Electricity Commission dominates Labor\u2019s bid for re-election in Victoria Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, has done the rounds on breakfast TV this morning off the back of Labor\u2019s campaign launch yesterday. He was wearing a SEC-branded jacket \u2013 a nod to Labor\u2019s commitment to bring back the State Electricity Commission if elected on 26 November, which he explained to ABC News Breakfast: The new SEC \u2013 government-owned, not private for-profit, but government-owned electricity, so owned by every single Victorian \u2013 creates nearly 60,000 jobs \u2013 6,000 of those will be apprentices. It will be 100% renewable electricity. These companies can\u2019t be relied upon to replace themselves. They\u2019ll just put another profit machine in place. We need to make sure that we\u2019re looking after pensioners, we\u2019re looking after families and, indeed, businesses. And without electricity, there is no economy, so we have to replace them. And we choose to replace them with a public option \u2013 a government-owned option. An option that\u2019s owned by every single Victorian. Asked what the government will do to immediately help families with the rising cost of power bills, Andrews replies that 1.6 million Victorian households have applied for and received a $250 power-saving bonus. If re-elected, Labor has pledged to hand out another round of the bonus in March: We\u2019ll do another one of those next year \u2013 another $250 for every single Victorian household, and access to a trusted comparison site. Because the thing is, these big businesses rely on you not being on the best deal. They profit off that. They bank on you not being on the best deal. They don\u2019t ring you up and say, \u201cBy the way, you\u2019re paying too much for your energy.\u201d That power-saving bonus is really important. We\u2019ve done it: 1.6 million households have accessed that. And now, we\u2019re gonna do another one in 2023. So that\u2019s immediate action, as well as a medium- and long-term plan to take the profit out of your power bill. To bring back the SEC and to make sure we\u2019ve got the jobs, the renewables, the lower emissions and lower bills that Victorians want. The SEC dominated the party\u2019s launch yesterday \u2013 probably because it appeals to so many different types of voters. Here\u2019s my analysis on it: The Victorian electoral commissioner says 21 of the state\u2019s 155 early voting centres will open later than planned today due to ballot paper printing delays and wet weather. Electoral commissioner Warwick Gately says the 21 affected voting centres are in metropolitan Melbourne and will open at midday: It\u2019s disappointing that printing delays, combined with the wet weather has impacted our ability to open every early voting centre on time. However, the 21 early voting centres affected are supplementary early voting centres we added to our standard complement this year. Importantly, there will still be at least one early voting centre in every district throughout the State opening as normal at 9am. Gately urged all voters planning to vote early to check its online voting centre locator before they head off, to see which early voting centres are affected. For the first time, Victorians do not need a reason to vote early. It\u2019s expected half of voters will cast their ballot before the 26 November election. Both major parties launched their campaigns yesterday, with Labor promising Victorians another $250 cash handout while the Coalition pledged to quarantine gas supplies. Here\u2019s our wrap: Government to walk fine line on raising human rights issues with Beijing, trade minsiter says Will the government be raising human rights issues if Anthony Albanese gets that meeting with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping? Don Farrell: We\u2019re never going to do anything that effects our national interest or security \u2026 but, we\u2019re never going to stop talking about those issues which we believe in as a democratic country and that is human rights. The new free trade agreement with the UK was signed a year ago, so what\u2019s the hold-up? Don Farrell explains: Under our legal system, it has to be approved by the parliament. So when that wasn\u2019t done in the last parliament, that whole process had to start over once again. As soon as parliament resumed in August, I sent the agreement up to the treaties committee. I\u2019m expecting next week that the committee will hand down its report and recommend the approval of that agreement. In anticipation of that I\u2019ve prepared all of the legislative changes that we need to things like customs rules in order to implement that agreement. And so when parliament resumes next week, I\u2019m very hopeful that we can push those changes through and that from our side of the ledger, we\u2019ve got that all approved by the end of November. Now it also requires the United Kingdom to do to do the same. They\u2019ve started that process. I\u2019m hopeful that just as we\u2019re going to finish it in the next week or two, that they\u2019ll also finish their side of the process. Solving differences with Beijing face to face will bring quicker results, trade minister says Australia is challenging China\u2019s duties on barley and wine in the World Trade Organization, but in a speech later today at the Australian Apec Centre, Don Farrell will say Australia is keen to discuss possible off-ramps. We\u2019d much prefer to sit down face to face with the Chinese government and sort out our problems that way rather than through using the the legal processes that are available to us. One of the problems of course, with these processes is that they\u2019re very lengthy. They can take, in some cases, years to resolve so that even if you get a good result, and we\u2019re very confident of the strength of our legal argument, it takes years to get that result. Trade bans have to be lifted to to get back to normalised relationship with China, minister says There\u2019s rising hope that prime minister Anthony Albanese will meet China\u2019s President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Bali. If that happens, Albanese has said he intends to ask Xi to drop China\u2019s trade restrictions against Australia. The minister for trade and tourism, Don Farrell, spoke to ABC Radio National this morning about those trade tensions. On Australia\u2019s reliance on trade with China, Farrell said \u201cit\u2019s dangerous to have all of your eggs in one basket\u201d in the trade space. The government\u2019s strategy is to continue trading with China \u201cbut reducing our reliance on it\u201d, he said. Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asked Farrell if Albanese met China\u2019s president, what would his message, specifically around the trade ban, be? I spoke to the prime minister yesterday in Cambodia. He\u2019s hopeful of getting a meeting with the president. His message will be a pretty simple one. We obviously want to have to have a stabilised, sensible relationship with China. But part of that means that the trade blockages that we currently have in things like wine, in barley, in meat, in crayfish, for instance, the Chinese have to live lift those bans so that we can get back to a normalised relationship. And both countries can benefit we can sell our products into China, but more particularly, the Chinese consumer gets the advantage of wonderful produce that Australia can produce. Farrell admitted it was unlikely one meeting would lift all of those bans. I\u2019m not sure that one meeting will solve all of the problems that have existed over the last five or six years \u2026 If we do get the meeting with the Chinese president, I think it starts the ball rolling in putting these problems behind us and starting a new relationship that will get us back to where we want to be in terms of our trading relationship with with that largest trading partner. Flood waters carry shipping container down Molong\u2019s main street That first post mentioned the state of flooding in central west NSW. Among the towns under emergency warnings this morning, Molong is completely isolated by flood waters. You can see just how strong the current is with a shipping container being carried along the historic town\u2019s main street. Early voting opens for Victorian election Victorians will begin casting their ballots for the state election with fresh promises from the major parties ringing in their ears. Early voting centres will open across the state today, operating from 8am to 6pm until the day before the 26 November election. Unlike the federal election in May, Victorians do not need a reason to vote early or via post before polling day. The Victorian Electoral Commission is preparing for more than 50% of the state\u2019s 4.4 million enrolled voters to cast their ballot before election day. Voting is compulsory for all people enrolled in Victoria, with those who don\u2019t facing a $92 fine if their explanation is not deemed valid and sufficient. Labor and the Liberal-National parties used their official campaign launch events yesterday to promise power bill relief and attack each other. After the Coalition unveiled its \u201cbill buster\u201d policy, premier Daniel Andrews promised another round of the $250 power saving bonus if Labor is re-elected. The extra $250 payment would be made to every Victorian household that compares their energy offers from March next year. In Port Melbourne, opposition leader Matthew Guy promised a Coalition government would cut up to $235 from household electricity bills by scrapping supply charges for the first half of 2023. New gas projects in Victoria would also be quarantined to supply only the state under another new Coalition election policy. Guy said told the crowd of 300-odd party supporters: Each day I get up, I am more and more confident that we can, and we will win this election. \u2013 from AAP The prime minister Anthony Albanese will today travel to Indonesia for the G20 meeting, as speculation continues whether he will secure a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. If the meeting does go ahead, it will be the first time in six years leaders of Australia and China have had a formal meeting. Albanese told reporters in Cambodia where he was attending the East Asia and Asean summits this past weekend: [Australia] will engage constructively in dialogue with the countries that wish to engage with us. I\u2019ve said that we should cooperate with China where we can and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Albanese will also today give a keynote speech to business leaders in Bali as part of the B20 meeting, following an invitation from Indonesia\u2019s President Joko Widodo. Closer to home, Australia\u2019s south-east is seeing yet more severe weather and flooding. The central west NSW town of Molong is completely isolated by flood waters, with flash flooding making it too dangerous to evacuate. The SES is warning people in the town\u2019s low-lying areas to move to higher ground. Evacuation orders have been issued for low-lying areas of Eugowra and Canowindra, as flooding continues across western and southern NSW, in towns including Collarenebri, Walgett, Bourke, Condobolin, Hay and Albury. In South Australia, SES have received more than 2,000 calls for help over 24 hours as 30,000 homes and businesses remain without electricity after wild storms at the weekend. SA Power Networks have told the ABC many will not be reconnected until at least Tuesday. In Victoria, SES have responded to more than 400 requests for assistance as the state experiences storms and flash flooding. There\u2019s a \u201cwatch and act\u201d warning out for Mount Martha and the Mornington Peninsula communities, which have seen flash flooding after 40mm to 50mm of rain in a couple of hours this morning. Let\u2019s kick off!"
