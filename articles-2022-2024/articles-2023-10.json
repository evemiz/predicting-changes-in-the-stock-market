            "date": "2023-10-17T23:43:25Z",
            "content": "The US representative Jim Jordan faced strong opposition to his House speakership bid on Tuesday as 20 Republicans voted against him on a first ballot. The chamber adjourned for the day as the Ohio Republican worked to flip some of his detractors his way. It\u2019s the second time in this Congress that the House has faced multiple rounds of voting for speaker, following the protracted struggle in January when Kevin McCarthy won the gavel on the 15th attempt. Twenty GOP lawmakers voted for a candidate other than Jordan, as many protested the removal of McCarthy as speaker earlier this month and the process that has unfolded to replace him. Conservatives have been mounting an intense pressure campaign to persuade the final holdouts to support Jordan, but some of his opponents appear even more determined to stop him from becoming speaker. Jordan will need to flip at least 16 Republicans to become speaker, as Democrats are certain to continue backing their own nominee, the minority leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Republicans currently control the House 221-212. The House is expected to come back for a second round of voting on Wednesday. Here\u2019s what to know before more voting for speaker: When is the speaker election? And how does it work? The House gaveled into session on Tuesday at noon to hold what would be the first of several votes to elect a speaker. It\u2019s a speaker\u2019s election unlike any other following the removal of McCarthy of California, who was unexpectedly ousted from the post after just nine months on the job. Normally the speaker is elected every two years in January, when the House organizes for a new session. A new election can only be held if the speaker dies, resigns or is removed from office. On Tuesday, once the House was in a quorum \u2013 meaning a minimum number of members were present to proceed \u2013 each party nominated its candidate for speaker. Republicans nominated Jordan. As they did last week against the congressman Steve Scalise, Democrats nominated Jeffries and are expected to continue to vote for him. House members remained present during the speakership vote. It\u2019s one of the few times \u2013 including during the State of the Union address \u2013 that lawmakers are all seated in the chamber. How many votes does it take to elect a speaker? It takes a simple majority of the votes from House members who are present and voting to elect a speaker. There were 432 Democrats and Republicans in attendance during Tuesday\u2019s vote, with one GOP lawmaker absent. Two House seats are currently vacant. That means Jordan or any other Republican candidate needs 217 votes to win. Once the second roll call for speaker begins on Wednesday, members of the House will once again call out their choices. The House will vote as many times as necessary until someone wins. Jordan made clear that he was not giving up after the first ballot. \u201cThe House needs a speaker as soon as possible,\u201d Russell Dye, a spokesperson for Jordan, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Republicans to come together.\u201d It\u2019s uncertain how many rounds it might take for Jordan to clinch the gavel, but supporters have expressed confidence that the consecutive public floor votes will force holdouts to flip their way. McCarthy narrowly won the speakership in January on the 15th round of balloting, after five excruciating days. Who is supporting and opposing Jordan? Jordan, a darling of the party\u2019s hardline rightwing base, still faces opposition from some members of the conference who doubt his ability to lead. \u201cBeing speaker of the House is not being the chairman,\u201d the representative Mario D\u00edaz Balart, one of the holdouts, said Friday. \u201cBecause you deal with foreign policy, you deal with the heads of state, you deal with domestic policy and you deal with security issues.\u201d He added: \u201cI think there are a lot of questions about whether he can unify and lead the conference, and whether he can even lead his own people, his closest people.\u201d Some Republicans are upset with how the speaker\u2019s race has played out. Steve Scalise, the majority leader, first won his colleagues\u2019 nomination for speaker last week. Jordan, who came in second, threw his support behind Scalise, stating that he would support his nomination when it came to the floor and urging the rest of the conference to do the same. But more than a dozen Republicans refused, leading Scalise to withdraw a day later. Those same members who refused to back Scalise are now Jordan\u2019s strongest base of support. They spent the weekend publicly and privately lobbying each of his critics to drop their opposition and become a \u201cteam player\u201d. They say the party\u2019s grassroots base pressure could prove decisive in the vote. Other Republicans opposing Jordan\u2019s speaker bid come from swing districts and are facing tough re-election races next year."

            "date": "2023-10-09T16:52:50Z",
            "content": "Robert F Kennedy Jr, the scion of the Kennedy political family who has spent the last six months running for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, announced on Monday he would continue his long-shot pursuit of the White House as an independent. The 69-year-old conspiracy theorist and vaccination opponent gave a fiery speech from Philadelphia, declaring his \u201cindependence from the Democratic party and all other parties\u201d, and telling a gathering of several hundred supporters of his \u201cpain\u201d at leaving the party of his uncle and father, John F Kennedy and Robert F Kennedy. \u201cI\u2019m here to declare myself an independent candidate for president for the United States. I\u2019m here to join you in making a new declaration of independence for our entire nation,\u201d he said, in a lengthy and often rambling speech taking aim at Wall Street, big pharma, military contractors, the \u201cmercenary media\u201d, and the \u201ctwo-party establishment\u201d he said was \u201cleading us all over a cliff\u201d. \u201cA rising tide of discontent is swamping our country. There\u2019s a danger in this discontent but there\u2019s also opportunity and promise,\u201d he added, in what appeared to be a reference to the leading Republican candidate, Donald Trump. \u201cWe seem to be cycling from despair to rage and back to despair. This country is ready for a history making change. They are ready to reclaim their freedom, their independence.\u201d The launch, however, was glitchy, with Kennedy leaving the stage briefly as soon as he was introduced, complaining he could not see his speech on the autocue, then struggling to find his stride. And his campaign was immediately assailed as \u201cperilous\u201d for the US in a tweet by prominent Kennedy family members. \u201cBobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment. Today\u2019s announcement is deeply saddening for us. We denounce his candidacy and believe it to be perilous for our country,\u201d sisters Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend; and brother Joseph P Kennedy II said in the message. Kennedy, who announced that he was running against Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination in April, has been polling at an average of 15% among Democrats nationwide. Other polls show he is more popular among Republicans than Democratic party supporters. But while his chances of winning the election are close to non-existent, his candidacy could still play a significant role as a spoiler. Analysts are divided on whether Kennedy running as an independent would harm the Republicans or Democrats more. \u201cThe Democrats are frightened I\u2019m going to spoil the election for President Biden, and the Republicans are frightened that I\u2019m gonna spoil it for President Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, they\u2019re both right. My intention is to spoil it for both of them.\u201d Over the past six months, Kennedy, who has a track record of promoting conspiracy theories and a long history of opposing vaccines, has struggled to make inroads into Biden\u2019s support. The nephew of John F Kennedy, and son of Robert F Kennedy, both Democrats who were assassinated, has drawn ire for false comments about wifi causing \u201cleaky brain\u201d and chemicals in water causing gender dysphoria. In July he was accused of antisemitism after he claimed that Covid had been targeted to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people from the worst impacts of the disease; the same month, the Congressional Integrity Project, a political watchdog, released a report that details Kennedy\u2019s meetings with and promotion of racists, antisemites and extremist conspiracy theorists. Since launching his campaign Kennedy has repeatedly appeared on Fox News, the rightwing news channel, and has also featured in podcasts of Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser, and Alex Jones, a rightwing conspiracy theorist. Kennedy was introduced in Philadelphia by a procession of speakers, including his wife, the actor Cheryl Hines, and his campaign manager Dennis Kucinich, a Democratic congressman for Ohio from 1997 to 2013. Another speaker was Lewis Grassrope, an elder of the South Dakota\u2019s Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, who said he was using indigenous people\u2019s day to call for a healing of political division. \u201cThe left wing and right wing are always fighting. If they are always fighting, how are we to become one?\u201d he said, before delivering a prayer in a native American language. Monday\u2019s announcement was also streamed live on YouTube, the broadcast reaching barely 23,000 viewers at its peak. Republicans immediately attempted to distance themselves from Kennedy, insisting in a talking points memo there was \u201cvery little daylight between RFK Jr and a typical Democratic politician\u201d. The memo from the Republican National Committee (RNC) listed 23 reasons for Republican voters to reject him, including Kennedy\u2019s previous support for Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and support for Democratic positions over the climate emergency, the economy and abortion. \u201cRFK Jr knows full well he\u2019ll \u2018take more votes\u2019 from the Republican nominee; that\u2019s why he\u2019s running,\u201d the RNC memo said."

            "date": "2023-10-25T20:56:54Z",
            "content": "Mike Johnson\u2019s emergence as the new speaker of the US House of Representatives has earned the relatively little-known Louisiana Republican a turn in the national spotlight. In turn, that spotlight has illuminated positions and remarks many deem extreme. He tried to overturn the 2020 election In the modern Republican party, supporting Donald Trump\u2019s lie about voter fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden is hardly an outlandish position. But Johnson took it further. After the election, he voiced support for Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory that voting machines were rigged. Later, he was one of 147 Republicans to object to results in key states, even after a pro-Trump mob attacked Congress on January 6, a riot now linked to nine deaths and hundreds of convictions. Johnson also authored an amicus brief filed to the supreme court in a case in which Texas sought to have swing-state results thrown out. According to the New York Times, a House Republican lawyer said Johnson\u2019s brief was unconstitutional. Nonetheless, he persuaded 125 colleagues to sign it, using tactics some thought heavy handed. The supreme court refused to take the case. On Tuesday, Johnson refused to take a question about his work on Trump\u2019s behalf \u2013 smiling as fellow Republicans booed and jeered the reporter. He was a spokesperson for a \u2018hate group\u2019 Before entering politics, Johnson worked for the Alliance Defending Freedom \u2013 designated a hate group by the Southern Law Poverty Center, which tracks US extremists. According to the SPLC, the ADF has \u201csupported the recriminalisation of sexual acts between consenting LGBTQ+ adults in the US and criminalisation abroad; defended state-sanctioned sterilisation of trans people abroad; contended that LGBTQ+ people are more likely to engage in paedophilia; and claimed that a \u2018homosexual agenda\u2019 will destroy Christianity and society\u201d. On Wednesday, the ADF senior counsel, Jeremy Tedesco, denied the organisation was a hate group and attacked the SPLC designation as partisan. \u201cThe truth is, Alliance Defending Freedom is among the largest and most effective legal advocacy organizations dedicated to protecting the religious freedom and free speech rights of all Americans,\u201d he said. He opposes LGBTQ+ rights In state politics and at the national level, Johnson has worked to claw back gains made by LGBTQ+ Americans in their fight for equality. In 2016, as he ran for Congress, he told the Louisiana Baptist Message he had \u201cbeen out on the front lines of the \u2018culture war\u2019 defending religious freedom, the sanctity of human life and biblical values, including the defense of traditional marriage, and other ideals like these when they\u2019ve been under assault\u201d. He has since led efforts for a national \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill, regarding the teaching of LGBTQ+ issues in schools, and is also opposed to gender-affirming care for children. On Wednesday, Rev Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, executive director of the Campaign for Southern Equality, said: \u201cJohnson has made a career out of attacking the LGBTQ+ community at every turn. His positions are out of touch with the clear majority support for LGBTQ+ equality in our country. His new leadership role is just further proof of the dangerous priorities of the GOP and the critical stakes for our democracy \u2013 and for LGBTQ+ Americans \u2013 in 2024.\u201d He is stringently anti-abortion Johnson has maintained a relatively low profile in Congress but when last year the supreme court removed the right to abortion, Johnson celebrated \u201ca historic and joyful day\u201d. Though Dobbs v Jackson returned abortion rights to the states, Johnson has co-sponsored bills for a nationwide ban. And as he neared his position of power, footage spread of striking remarks in a House hearing. \u201cRoe v Wade did constitutional cover to the elective killing of unborn children in America, period,\u201d Johnson said. You think about the implications on the economy. We\u2019re all struggling here to cover the bases of social security and Medicare and Medicaid and all the rest. If we had all those able-bodied workers in the economy, we wouldn\u2019t be going upside down and toppling over like this \u2026 I will not yield I will not. Roe was a terrible corruption of America\u2019s constitutional jurisprudence.\u201d He wants to cut social security and Medicare As those comments indicate, Johnson wants to cut programs on which millions rely. Such cuts are widely regarded as a political third-rail \u2013 Trump has used the issue to attack Republican presidential rivals, saying only he will defend such benefits \u2013 but Johnson is far from alone in wanting to swing the axe. He is an advocate for \u2018covenant marriage\u2019 When he married his wife, Kelly, in 1999, the couple agreed to a \u201ccovenant\u201d marriage: a conservative Christian idea that makes it harder to divorce. The Johnsons promoted the idea on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cMy own parents are divorced,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAs anyone who goes through that knows, that was a traumatic thing for our whole family. I\u2019m a big proponent of marriage and fidelity and all the things that go with it, and I\u2019ve seen first-hand the devastation [divorce] can cause.\u201d He is a climate skeptic In 2017, Johnson told voters in his oil-rich home state: \u201cThe climate is changing, but the question is, is it being caused by natural cycles over the span of the Earth\u2019s history? Or is it changing because we drive SUVs? I don\u2019t believe in the latter. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the primary driver.\u201d He has also opposed proposals for a Green New Deal and been named an \u201cenergy champion\u201d by the American Energy Alliance, a rightwing group that has defended fossil fuel use. \u2026 and progressives are alarmed On Wednesday, Democrats and progressives greeted Johnson\u2019s ascent with criticism \u2013 and opposition research. Tony Carrk, executive director of the watchdog Accountable.US, called Johnson \u201ca far-right extremist who led a desperate attempt to subvert democracy \u2026 [who] boasts a voting record deeming him one of the most extreme members of the Republican conference. \u201cA Speaker Johnson means more of the same from the Maga [pro-Trump] majority: pointless partisan political stunts, peddling dangerous conspiracies and ultimately undermining American democracy.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-26T10:00:31Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s an off-off year for US elections, but somehow, abortion is still on the ballot. A year after nationwide rage over the US supreme court\u2019s overturning of Roe v Wade crushed Republican hopes for a \u201cred wave\u201d in the midterms, Democrats are trying to once again harness that anger to defeat Republicans in the relatively few states holding 2023 elections. The GOP, on the other hand, is still scrabbling over how to talk about an issue that could not only cost them seats this year but also lead them to lose the White House in 2024. The elections in November will help both parties fine-tune their messaging on abortion, as well as determine the future of some of the last states in the south and midwest that have access to the procedure. Here\u2019s what you need to know about where and how Americans will vote on abortion this year. Kentucky Last year, deep-red Kentucky stunned the nation when voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have clarified that the state constitution does not protect abortions. Now, abortion could be the deciding issue in the governor\u2019s race between the incumbent governor, Andy Beshear, a Democrat, and the current attorney general, Daniel Cameron, a Republican. Kentucky law currently bans abortion in almost all circumstances, including in cases of rape and incest. Cameron has long supported the ban. Although he indicated in September that he would approve a bill adding exceptions for rape and incest, he suggested a few weeks later that he would do so only \u201cif the courts made us change that law\u201d, according to a recording of a conversation obtained by the Associated Press. Beshear has attacked Cameron for his longtime hardline stance on abortion, releasing an ad featuring a young woman discussing being raped by her stepfather. \u201cI was raped by my stepfather after years of sexual abuse. I was 12,\u201d the woman says to the camera in the ad. \u201cThis is to you, Daniel Cameron. To tell a 12-year-old girl she must have the baby of her stepfather who raped her is unthinkable.\u201d Mississippi Mississippi, home to the case that toppled Roe as well as a near-total abortion ban, is one of the few places where Democrats are not relying on abortion to win races. Instead, Brandon Presley is focusing his run for governor on his pledge to expand Medicaid. Presley is explicitly trying to cast himself as a maverick within the Democratic party when it comes to abortion. In a recent ad, Presley tapped a Bible and told the camera that the text was \u201cwhy I\u2019m pro-life\u201d. New Jersey In contrast with Democrats in Mississippi, Democrats in New Jersey are hammering Republicans on abortion even though rights to the procedure are not at serious risk in the state. One Democrat running for state senate released an ad accusing her opponent of wanting to \u201cgive aborted tissue legal personhood\u201d. \u201cIf Republicans win our statehouse this year, we can expect Florida-style restrictions on our healthcare rights,\u201d she warned in the ad. Republicans\u2019 chances of winning control in New Jersey are slim. The state is home to nearly a million more registered Democrats than Republicans. Plus, New Jersey legislators have already passed laws recognizing abortion as a fundamental right. Ohio While 2022 saw a flurry of ballot initiatives on abortion rights, Ohio is the only state this year to vote directly on abortion, through a referendum on whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. The state has a six-week abortion ban, which is frozen due to ongoing litigation. It could come roaring back to life if the referendum fails. In August, Ohio voters defeated another referendum that would have made it far more difficult to amend the state constitution \u2013 which many saw as an attempt by the state GOP to hurt the November vote on abortion. Republicans won a key victory this fall when they successfully altered the text of the ballot to describe the referendum with language such as \u201cunborn child\u201d. Proponents of the referendum say the new language of the ballot, which is what Ohioans will see in the voting booth, is misleading. Still, abortion rights supporters have so far won every ballot initiative in the country on the issue since Roe fell, and their chances look good in Ohio. Nearly 60% of Ohio voters plan to vote to amend the state constitution, according to a mid-October poll from Baldwin Wallace University. Pennsylvania Pennsylvania, a historically purple state, has long been viewed as a bellwether for how issues like abortion will play with voters on the national stage. Now, eyes are on one race there: the battle for a seat on the state supreme court, between the Republican Carolyn Carluccio and the Democrat Dan McCaffery. The election will not decide party control of the supreme court, because Democrats already have a 4-2 majority. But, since disputes over abortion rights regularly end up in state supreme courts, one more Republican on the bench could make the difference in future fights. McCaffery is making abortion a key part of his campaign, frequently bringing it up on the campaign trail. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear from a personal standpoint that I believe those particular issues are best decided between a woman, her conscience and her doctor,\u201d he told Politico in August. Meanwhile, Carluccio has tried to downplay her stance on the issue. Her campaign website removed language that described her as a \u201cdefender\u201d of \u201call life under law\u201d, and demurred when a reporter asked whether the Pennsylvania state constitution contains privacy rights that may protect abortion access, as some experts have argued. \u201cThe Pennsylvania constitution is different in certain ways,\u201d she told a Pennsylvania NPR affiliate. Virginia For the past few years, control over Virginia has flipped back and forth between Democrats and Republicans. Now, with the GOP in control of one legislative chamber as well as the governor\u2019s mansion, they could once again win a trifecta in the state \u2013 and pass a 15-week abortion ban. Virginia is one of the few places where Republicans are openly discussing not only abortion, but also their interest in banning it past 15 weeks of pregnancy. If that ban goes into effect, it will affect the entire south-east United States, if not the entire country. Virginia is the only southern state that has not significantly restricted abortion since Roe fell, and abortion seekers across the south are fleeing there for the procedure. Since it has become far more difficult to get abortions, abortion providers say they are seeing patients later and later in pregnancy. For those providers, the fall of Roe has made preserving access to abortion past 15 weeks even more crucial. Abortion is one of the top issues in the election, and 72% of voters support keeping Virginia abortion law as is or making it less restrictive, according to recent polling from the Wason Center at Christopher Newport University. However, when asked about a 15-week abortion ban, voters were more circumspect. Just 54% said they oppose such a ban. Republicans and Democrats are also in a dead heat: 42% of voters say they plan to support the Democratic candidate in their local race for the state legislature, while 41% say they will support the Republican candidate."

            "date": "2023-10-02T05:00:05Z",
            "content": "\u201cWe are fighting against the presidential candidates who threaten the rights of women,\u201d says Marilyna, 28, standing hand in hand with her friend outside Argentina\u2019s National Congress last Thursday evening. Argentina is three weeks away from a national election in which the rights of women and abortion have been put on the ballot, just three years after elective terminations were legalised. Marilyna is one of thousands of women, men and children protesting on the streets of Buenos Aires. \u201cWe are afraid of the abortion referendum proposal and of the destructive policies that are being suggested in this election campaign. But we are fighting,\u201d she says. Behind her, elderly women wave green handkerchiefs, teenagers set off purple flares, and mothers march to the beat of steel drums with toddlers strapped to their backs. Abortion was legalised in Argentina in 2020 after sweeping protests known as the \u201cgreen wave\u201d movement. Previously, abortions were only permitted in cases of rape or if the woman\u2019s health was at risk. But now women fear that those hard-won rights could be under threat. On 22 October, the country heads to the polls in a highly contested election, in which the frontrunner Javier Milei has described abortion as murder. In a recent interview, Milei, a 52-year-old far-right candidate and political outsider, reportedly said that those who support abortion rights are \u201cbrainwashed by a homicidal policy\u201d. He vowed to launch a referendum to overturn the abortion law if he takes the presidency. \u201cLife starts at the moment of fertilisation. Three weeks after that, your mother decides to kill you because you are not alive yet. How come?\u201d Milei said in August. The former economist and TV pundit has also pledged to close the Ministry for Women, Gender and Diversity. Partly in response to such rhetoric, the Ni Una Menos feminist movement organised protests across the South American country on International Safe Abortion Day. Among those who gathered in the capital was 69-year-old Sandra Olue. \u201cWe are here because we want to preserve the rights of women and abortion,\u201d Olue says. \u201cWe fought for a long time, and are afraid this potential new president might cut our rights. We will not allow it.\u201d Cecilia Benitez marched holding her six-year-old daughter on her hip. \u201cThe far right is organising itself in Latin America, specifically Javier Milei and his henchmen, who are trying to undo our laws,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is organising his force like Donald Trump, and, like Trump, his proposals go against us, against women and LGBT people.\u201d The government estimates that 3,000 women died between 1983 and 2020, before the legalisation, due to clandestine abortions. Officials have said that maternal deaths have decreased by more than 40% since the law was enacted. Despite such progress, abortion remains a fraught and divisive issue in the majority Roman Catholic country, even among health workers. \u201cThere is still a lot of resistance to abortion,\u201d says Soledad Deza, a lawyer and president of women\u2019s group Fundaci\u00f3n Mujeres x Mujeres. \u201cThere are entire public and private institutions that do not guarantee abortions because all their staff are objectors. \u201cThen there is \u2018covert\u2019 conscientious objection, which is perhaps more dangerous. Health personnel, instead of openly denying the service, mask it and carry out more harmful actions: they provide false information, and provide medication in insufficient doses.\u201d Doctors who perform abortions have also reportedly been targeted with spurious legal complaints. In August 2021, one doctor in Salta, a city in north-western Argentina, was detained following an accusation that she had performed an \u201cillegal abortion\u201d. She faced almost two years of criminal proceedings before she was acquitted. Mexico\u2019s supreme court recently ruled that state laws prohibiting abortion are unconstitutional and violate women\u2019s rights, but despite the region\u2019s green wave movement, the only other Latin American countries where elective abortion is legal are Colombia, Cuba, Guyana and Uruguay. In neighbouring Brazil, the supreme court is currently voting on whether to decriminalise abortion in the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy. \u201cWomen\u2019s rights have never been fully accepted in Latin America. There is a very strong presence of religions in public spaces and a very powerful network of political neoconservatism,\u201d says Diaz. \u201cThe green wave does not stop, because we have to fight for our rights and defend them all the time.\u201d \u201cPeople gave their lives for these rights and we have to defend against a terrible enemy,\u201d says Ali Gondret, aged 64. \u201cWe are fighting for the girls who come after us, because what comes next may be very bad.\u201d"

With 90% of votes counted on Sunday night in Ecuador, Noboa had 52.29% of the vote against 47.71% for Gonz\u00e1lez, according to Ecuador\u2019s electoral council. Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, the hand-picked candidate of the former president Rafael Correa, accepted her defeat in a concession speech of the kind that is increasingly unusual in the region.

This election was held against a backdrop of a spike in violent crime fuelled by drug trafficking, which has turned the country into one of the most violent in the region, with the fourth-highest homicide rate \u2013 higher even than Mexico. Noboa, the millennial son of Ecuador\u2019s richest man and five-time presidential candidate \u00c1lvaro Noboa, was the surprise entry into the second round in August. His calm and unconfrontational style made him popular, particularly with voters aged between 18 and 29 who make up a third of the electorate. The Harvard Kennedy School graduate focused his campaign on creating jobs and the economy, recommending tax exemptions and incentives for new businesses as well as pledging to attract more foreign investment. On crime, Noboa proposed putting the most violent criminals on ships off Ecuador\u2019s Pacific coast. He also suggested boosting the military presence on the borders and coast, both of which are trafficking points for cocaine. Arianna Tanca, an Ecuadorian political analyst, said the stakes were high and urged the former congressman to think about the \u201cfuture of the country and not preserving his square metre of power\u201d. Noboa is due to be sworn in on 25 November but will only govern for 17 months until 2025 \u2013 completing the term of outgoing president, Guillermo Lasso, who dissolved congress in May during an impeachment trial and called snap presidential and legislative elections. \u201cIt\u2019s a short time but it is time that is precious and can be used for good so let\u2019s see if the politicians are up to the bar,\u201d Tanca said. \u201cEcuadoreans need peace, we can\u2019t stand the violence any more, this war,\u201d said Carla Espinoza, voting in Quito on Sunday. The presidential campaign has been marked by unprecedented violence, including the assassination in broad daylight of anti-corruption candidate Fernando Villavicencio as he left a campaign event in August. This month, seven Colombian suspects in the assassination were themselves murdered in prison. The US government has offered a $5m reward for information leading to the \u201carrest or conviction of the intellectual authors\u201d behind Villavicencio\u2019s murder. Ecuador\u2019s Pacific ports are targeted by drug traffickers smuggling cocaine, most commonly in shipping containers holding bananas, the country\u2019s top export. About 80% of cocaine smuggled from Ecuador was bound for Europe, the country\u2019s interior minister, Juan Zapata, told the Guardian, where a kilo of cocaine fetched a street price of about $50,000 \u2013 twice as much as in the US. Zapata said Ecuador, positioned between Colombia and Peru, the world\u2019s main cocaine-producing countries, needed international help to tackle a \u201ccommon transnational enemy\u201d. Homicide rates have risen fivefold since 2019, according to the Ecuadorean Observatory on Organised Crime, due to violence between local gangs allied with Mexican drug cartels, Colombian guerrilla groups and Balkan traffickers. The president-elect will hold around 10% of the seats in congress and could struggle to find consensus to push through legislation among Ecuador\u2019s fractious political class. \u201cThere is so much to do,\u201d Zapata said. \u201cI hope that the new congress dedicates itself to [dealing with the security situation], unlike the previous one that wasted so much time and hurt the country.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-23T01:34:48Z",
            "content": "The eccentric far-right populist Javier Milei has failed to win the first round of Argentina\u2019s presidential election, with the centrist finance minister Sergio Massa unexpectedly beating his radical challenger. Supporters of Milei, a potty-mouthed political outsider described as an Argentinian mashup of Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Boris Johnson, had hoped he was heading for a sensational outright victory similar to Bolsonaro\u2019s shock triumph in Brazil in 2018. However, with nearly 99% of votes counted, it was his Peronist rival Massa who won the day with 36.6% of the 27m votes cast. Milei \u2013 who has promised to abolish Argentina\u2019s central bank and shun its biggest trade partners, China and Brazil \u2013 came second with 29.9%. The third main candidate, the conservative former security minister, Patricia Bullrich, finished third, with about 23.8%. Massa, 51, and Milei, 53, will now face off in a second round on 19 November. For an outright victory, a candidate would have needed more than 45% of votes or more than 40% with a more than 10-point lead over their closest rival. Addressing hundreds of euphoric supporters at his campaign HQ, Massa gave a sober speech vowing to lead a national unity government that would kickstart \u201ca new phase in Argentina\u2019s political history\u201d. \u201cKnow that as president I will not fail you,\u201d he said, promising \u201ca country without uncertainty\u201d. \u201cArgentina is a big family and what it needs is someone to work 24/7 to protect it.\u201d Milei urged deflated followers to celebrate the \u201chistoric achievement\u201d of reaching the run-off only two years after their party, La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances), was founded. \u201cToday is a historic day because two-thirds of Argentinians voted for change,\u201d Milei declared, adding: \u201cEither we change or we sink.\u201d The result leaves Argentina poised for another month of profound uncertainty, economic turbulence and fake news before the showdown between Massa and Milei, a libertarian economist who only entered the world of politics when he was elected to congress in 2021. A Massa victory is not assured given that many of Bullrich\u2019s right-wing voters may migrate to Milei. As he cast his vote on Sunday, Milei, who shot to fame as a television pundit prone to rhapsodizing about tantric sex, claimed he could lead \u201cthe best government in history\u201d if elected. \u201cWe\u2019re going to decide whether we can make Argentina a power again or turn ourselves into the biggest shantytown on Earth,\u201d the raggedy-haired populist said after jostling through a sea of supporters and journalists to reach a university polling station. Marcela Pagano, a television journalist running for a place in congress for La Libertad Avanza, predicted angry voters were poised to \u201cboot out\u201d the traditional politicians many blame for plunging 40% of citizens into poverty and triple-digit inflation. \u201cI believe he\u2019s the only one who can get Argentina off the ground,\u201d Pagano said of Milei, who made the chainsaw one of the main emblems of his campaign \u2013 supposedly to symbolise plans to slash spending and dismember the political establishment. Prominent members of South America\u2019s extreme-right flew to Argentina hoping for a Milei triumph that would boost their movement after its leading light, Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro, lost power last year to the leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in October 2022. Bolsonaro\u2019s congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, travelled to Buenos Aires to hail Milei\u2019s \u201cunstoppable movement\u201d \u2013 comments the Argentinian newspaper Clar\u00edn said violated the country\u2019s electoral laws. \u201cThe phenomenon you see in the streets is the same phenomenon we experienced in Brazil in 2018,\u201d Eduardo Bolsonaro claimed in reference to his father\u2019s landslide win. South American leftists had also appeared in Buenos Aires in the lead up to the election to bolster Massa\u2019s initially sluggish campaign, including several Brazilian spin doctors who helped Lula overcome Bolsonaro in last year\u2019s historic election. A Brazilian-made social media video released on the eve of Sunday\u2019s election compared Milei to Bolsonaro and exhorted Argentinian voters to oppose him. \u201cThis man was elected in Brazil and it was a nightmare,\u201d a Spanish-language narrator said of Bolsonaro\u2019s administration during which hundreds of thousands died of Covid and Brazil became an international pariah. \u201cArgentina doesn\u2019t need to go through this.\u201d A Massa poster campaign warned citizens about Milei\u2019s most radical ideas, which include legalizing the sale of human organs, and claimed he would plunge Argentina into a 2001-style economic meltdown. \u201cThe Economist says Milei is a risk to Argentine democracy,\u201d said one. \u201cAre you seriously going to vote for him?\u201d Massa and his allies stepped up their campaign after Milei\u2019s stunning victory in August\u2019s primary \u2013 a dress rehearsal for the election \u2013 scrapping income tax for most citizens and seeking to distance themselves from former president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Those efforts appeared to have borne fruit on Sunday as voters turned out to choose Argentina\u2019s new president and vice-president as well as about half of its 257-member congress, a third of the senate and several governors, including those of the city and province of Buenos Aires. Axel Kicillof, a Massa ally seeking a second term as governor of Buenos Aires province \u2013 a crucial electoral battlefield that is home to nearly 40% of all Argentinian voters \u2013 also fared better than expected, winning by nearly 20%. Milei\u2019s candidate came third. \u201cThis vote means dictatorship never again,\u201d Kicillof told supporters in reference to Milei\u2019s decision to downplay the number of people killed during Argentina\u2019s military regime during his campaign. Milei\u2019s candidate to become mayor of Buenos Aires, Ramiro Marra, finished in a distant third place with just 13.9% of votes. Crestfallen Milei supporters who had gathered outside their leader\u2019s hotel claimed, without evidence, that the vote had been rigged, just as Bolsonaro devotees did after he lost the 2022 election in Brazil. \u201cIt hurts my soul. I expected he\u2019d win in the first round. I was surprised,\u201d admitted Ivan Gonz\u00e1lez, a 22-year-old Mile\u00edsta who wore a Donald Trump hat and carried a yellow Gadsden flag \u2013 an American Revolution-era banner used by the US extreme right and Milei\u2019s movement. Gonz\u00e1lez blamed Milei\u2019s \u201cfear mongering\u201d opponents for Sunday\u2019s setback but insisted he had not given up hope of a second round win."

            "title": "The Guardian view on Argentina\u2019s presidential election: the danger to democracy is real | Editorial",
            "date": "2023-10-01T17:25:01Z",
            "content": "With poverty rising, a recession approaching and annual inflation topping 120% in Argentina, it is unsurprising that voters are fed up. They would be forgiven for wanting change in the upcoming presidential election. However, voting for a far-right candidate, Javier Milei, would be a serious mistake. Mr Milei admires Donald Trump, trades in misogyny and says the outrageous to get noticed. Despite what Mr Milei claims, the Pope is not an emissary of the \u201cevil one\u201d nor is the climate crisis \u201ca socialist lie\u201d. After winning Argentina\u2019s primary election this summer, Mr Milei is, depressingly, in pole position to clinch the presidency. His pitch is that Argentina\u2019s interventionist, welfarist economic model has failed. Mr Milei is a fan of the free market missionary Milton Friedman. He thinks inflation results from too much of the Argentinian currency, the peso, being in circulation. Mr Milei\u2019s solution is to shrink the state and replace the peso with the dollar. Friedman\u2019s ideas have been debunked. But they are held with religious fervour by adherents such as Mr Milei. Argentina\u2019s problems are not fiscal, caused by excessive government spending, but external, caused by excessive borrowing in US currency. This came to a head in July when the country found itself on the brink of a dollar default, until the International Monetary Fund agreed to a bailout. The economy minister Sergio Massa, who convinced the IMF that a freak drought had wiped out Argentina\u2019s dollar export earnings, will probably end up in the presidential runoff with Mr Milei. Mr Massa\u2019s greatest strength \u2013 and biggest weakness \u2013 is the economy. He was brought in last August with the peso in freefall. Since then he has seen the economy grow after months of shrinking. Mr Massa took the IMF money, but seems to be paying lip service to the lender\u2019s conditions. Instead of reining in spending, he has turned on the taps. His strategy rests on high interest rates to make the peso more attractive than the dollar, cutting taxes for the poor and raising public spending. This should be popular \u2013 and could work. The plan seems to mirror an argument made by the economist Mat\u00edas Vernengo, who criticised the IMF for pushing ideas that benefited the international creditors it represented: \u201cWhat they want is a fiscal adjustment to shrink the economy, import less and accumulate dollars. Let people die while you accumulate reserves.\u201d The academic is right that Argentinians instead need to desire \u201cpesos and not dollars\u201d. Such insights might have come too late for Mr Massa. Argentina\u2019s traditional two-party system is coming undone. The basis for that division was laid when N\u00e9stor and Cristina Kirchner governed Argentina from 2003 to 2015. Today the differences between Kirchnerism (represented by the technocratic Mr Massa) and anti-Kirchnerism (represented by a rightwing politician, Patricia Bullrich) seem irrelevant to many struggling to make ends meet and experiencing poor public services. Mr Milei is a danger to democracy. His diehard supporters wave the yellow Gadsden flag of the US extreme right. His vice-presidential pick, sickeningly, casts the systematic extrajudicial killings of civilians by the country\u2019s dictatorship as counter-terrorism. Voters are waking up to Mr Milei\u2019s absurd plans, forcing him to backpedal. His anti-abortion stance has united a divided feminist movement against him. But Argentinians are frustrated with the established parties and anxious about the future \u2013 a combination that the far right is currently exploiting.

            "title": "Mike Pence suspends campaign for Republican presidential nomination",
            "date": "2023-10-28T20:05:03Z",
            "content": "Mike Pence, the former vice-president under Donald Trump, has suspended his campaign to become the Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election. Pence announced at an event held by the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas on Saturday that he was dropping out of the race, in which he has been lagging, along with others, far behind frontrunner Trump. \u201cI came here to say it\u2019s become clear to me this is not my time, so after much prayer and deliberation I have decided to suspend my campaign for president, effective today,\u201d Pence said. Pence, 64 and the former governor of his home state of Indiana, after representing it as one of its congressman, had been leading a struggling campaign for a while. He had not yet qualified for the third GOP debate on 8 November, falling short on required donations. But his announcement on Saturday during an event attended by other prominent candidates for the party\u2019s nomination next year, including Trump and Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, came as a surprise to most. Appearing on the stage at the event in Nevada, Pence, a Christian hard-right conservative, said: \u201cThe Bible tells us there is a time for every purpose under heaven\u201d and he went on to add: \u201cThis is not my time.\u201d As he made the announcement, with a trademark absence of visible emotion, there was a collective gasp among the audience gathered at the event, which was expecting to hear rallying remarks as he continued his campaign. Instead, Pence made his announcement drily then put more power in his voice as he said: \u201cNow, I\u2019m leaving this campaign, but let me promise you, I will never leave the fight for conservative values and I will never stop fighting to elect principled Republican leaders to every office in the land, so help me God.\u201d The crowd then broke into cheers, whistles and sustained applause, with Pence saying a quiet \u201cthank you\u201d after some minutes. His campaign for the presidency never caught fire. He was a loyal lieutenant to Trump throughout the New York Republican\u2019s controversial single term despite Trump being twice impeached, for extorting Ukraine and for inciting the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. That ended, though, when Pence made the definitive move that caused an irreparable breach between him and Trump. The then vice-president refused to go along with exhortations from Trump that he decline, in his role as president of the US Senate, to certify Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory over Trump. When Trump then condemned Pence for that via social media, as crowds of extremists were surging to the Capitol then broke in to try, in vain, to force a halt to Biden\u2019s certification, many began chanting \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d. The vice-president, in the congressional chamber to certify the result on 6 January, had to flee for his safety along with other members of Congress as the mob invaded the building. Biden\u2019s victory over Trump was certified by Congress in a battered Capitol in the early hours of 7 January, although many Republicans refused to endorse it. When Pence launched his campaign for the 2024 GOP nomination, however, in June, he chastised Trump for his \u201creckless\u201d actions on 6 January. Pence touted his record in Congress and as Indiana governor, during which he supported legislation against abortion and expanded government spending, and repeated ideas from his campaign video released hours earlier including addressing inflation, the national debt and issues at the US-Mexico border. He also pointed to his time as vice-president, touting some of the policies that he and Trump pushed forth in their term. He first noted: \u201cI was proud to stand by President Donald Trump every day\u201d, then said: \u201cThe American people deserve to know that on that day [6 January 2021], President Trump also demanded that I choose between him and the constitution \u2026 And anyone who asked someone else to put them over the constitution should never be president of the United States again.\u201d Pence is strongly anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+ equality, a fiscal conservative and a foreign policy hawk. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,\u201d Pence said at his launch, repeating a frequently used phrase. Trump\u2019s base of core supporters never forgave Pence for overseeing the certification of Biden\u2019s election to the White House, viewing it as a supreme act of disloyalty to their icon. Pence stopped short of endorsing anyone in his speech on Saturday, but in an apparent swipe at Trump, called on Americans to select someone who appeals to \u201cthe better angels of our nature\u201d and can lead with \u201ccivility\u201d. Pence failed to attract enough anti-Trump Republican primary voters, and donors, to sustain a candidacy that has languished in the low single digits in opinion polls and struggled to raise money since he announced his White House bid in June. As a result Pence, a stolid campaigner short on charisma, was low on cash by October and despite spending time and resources in the first Republican nominating state of Iowa, had failed to catch fire there. When his campaign released Pence\u2019s third-quarter fundraising totals on 15 October, his candidacy was $620,000 in debt and only had $1.2m cash on hand, far less than several better-performing Republican rivals and insufficient to sustain the financial demands of a White House race. In several past elections, former vice-presidents who have competed to become the White House nominee have succeeded, including Republican George HW Bush in 1988 and Democrat Al Gore in 2000.

            "date": "2023-10-10T19:17:35Z",
            "content": "The former Maryland governor Larry Hogan said he had not ruled out a presidential run, as he contemplated the \u201ctrain wreck\u201d his Republican party had become amid infighting in Congress and the ascendancy in primary polling of the 91-times criminally charged Donald Trump. Hogan also called the Florida congressman Matt Gaetz, the instigator of last week\u2019s historic removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the US House, \u201ca cancer on the party and on the Congress\u201d. Hogan, 67, stepped down as governor of Maryland this year after two terms in the role. He has previously backed away from a presidential run but on Tuesday, speaking to Bloomberg News in Washington, he said he still wanted to \u201cserve\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure that out, but I\u2019m not walking away\u201d from presidential politics, Hogan said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to run a race and nibble around the edges. If I thought there was a path to success to win the race, then I just said I wouldn\u2019t shut the door to that opportunity.\u201d Hogan is a national co-chairperson of No Labels, a group contemplating a third-party White House bid. Critics say the group, with donors including rightwing figures, will only succeed in damaging Joe Biden in the president\u2019s expected contest against Trump \u2013 who on 6 January 2021 incited his own supporters to attack Congress in an attempt to reverse his own election defeat. Confirmed third-party candidates \u2013 Robert F Kennedy Jr, an independent, and Cornel West, of the Green party \u2013 are also thought likely to make an impact on a race between two unpopular mainstream picks. Majorities of Americans think Biden is too old at 80 to serve an effective second term. Trump is 77 but fewer voters say the former president is too old. His popularity with the general public is low, however, as he fights criminal charges for election subversion, retention of classified information and hush-money payments, as well as civil suits over his business affairs and a rape allegation a judge called \u201csubstantially true\u201d. Among Republican voters, Trump dominates, with huge leads in national and key state polls and with a grip on Republicans in Washington through the actions of allies such as Gaetz, who initiated the removal of McCarthy that left the House without a leader. \u201cIt\u2019s a train wreck,\u201d\u2019 Hogan told Bloomberg. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s embarrassing, and I think it\u2019s terrible for the Republican party. I think it\u2019s terrible for Congress and for the country.\u201d Hogan said it was too late for serving governors such as Brian Kemp of Georgia and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, touted by some as presidential candidates with appeal to the middle ground, to enter the primary and beat Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019ve missed the deadlines already.\u201d Among Trump\u2019s confirmed challengers, Hogan said he thought Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, was \u201con the ascent\u201d \u2013 and a stronger candidate than Ron DeSantis, the hard-right Florida governor long second to Trump in polling. \u201cDeSantis has continued to fail throughout the campaign,\u201d Hogan said."

            "content": "\u2018Whoever I talk to, it\u2019s relief and hope\u2019 Wojciech Ba\u0142ka, a 42-year-old IT worker in Krak\u00f3w, has watched with concern in recent years as Poland moved away from democracy and towards autocracy. But after a landmark election on Sunday, that will probably see the ruling populist Law and Justice (PiS) party leave government after eight years, Ba\u0142ka said he\u2019s relieved. \u201cWhoever I talk to, it\u2019s relief and hope,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some anxiety \u2013 because it\u2019s not yet the change in government.\u201d Despite gaining the most votes, the rightwing PiS has no clear path to form a majority \u2013 which means Poland will most likely see a grand coalition led by the ex-prime minister and former European Council president Donald Tusk. The vote represents a setback for populism and an opportunity for Poland to change course after PiS rolled back abortion rights, eroded the rule of law and directed hostility towards minorities and immigrants. It\u2019s a significant shift for the European Union\u2019s fifth most-populous country. \u201cThe best interest of Poland is staying in the EU and supporting Ukraine,\u201d Ba\u0142ka said. \u201cKeeping this wave of autocracy and corruption as far away as possible. We can see what\u2019s happened in Hungary, for example, [which] used to be a democratic country and now it\u2019s autocratic, supporting Russia.\u201d Ba\u0142ka, who voted for the centre-right Third Way, felt PiS was reversing its initial support for Ukraine\u2019s war against Russian aggression to gain votes from farmersin an effort to protect Poland\u2019s grain market. \u201cI was really worried about it, because it\u2019s totally against the national interest,\u201d Ba\u0142ka said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much our war. We think that we are next, basically \u2013 if Ukraine doesn\u2019t stop Putin, then it\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d He was relieved that PiS has not questioned the integrity of the election result. \u201cThere were fears that they would try to do anything to stay in power,\u201d he said. Unlike many older people who voted PiS, Ba\u0142ka\u2019s 72-year-old father, who fought against communism, was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the result. \u201cMy father was an activist then and he\u2019s an activist now,\u201d he said. \u2018PiS are leaving the government but they are not leaving power\u2019 Not all voters were as optimistic, however. Pawel, a 40-year-old lawyer based in Warsaw, said: \u201cPiS are leaving the government but they are not leaving power.\u201d Pawel was referring to the fact that the president, Andrzej Duda, supported by PiS, wields veto power over legislation; to the \u201ctoxic\u201d rhetoric spread by PiS on state broadcaster TVP, which he fears will continue to divide the nation; and undermine the country\u2019s rule of law. The European Commission referred Poland to the European court of justice in February, after a 2021 ruling Poland\u2019s constitutional tribunal declared measures imposed by the ECJ unconstitutional \u2013 seen as an assault on the independence of the judiciary. Pawel, who is gay, said \u201chaving this anti-LGBT rhetoric from the government and from their controlled television and its influence on the public debate has been very unpleasant\u201d, he said. Pawel said he doubted Tusk\u2019s coalition would prioritise strengthening LGBTQ rights \u2013 such as adding sexual orientation and gender expression to Poland\u2019s protected categories in hate crime legislation. And he worried \u201cthey will not be able to do anything for as long as this president stays in power and as long as those judges are in power, they will probably block all those [LGBTQ] efforts.\u201d \u2018We felt it was our duty\u2019 More than 608,000 Poles registered to vote in the election from another country. Marta Collins in the UK was one them. She recalled getting in the car at 8am on Sunday and driving three hours to Bristol from Cornwall, waiting almost two hours in line to cast an election ballot at a Polish voting station, then going back home again, arriving at 7pm. It was worth it. As she drove along the motorway with a friend, Collins thought, \u201cevery vote will count in this situation\u201d. \u201cWe felt it was our duty,\u201d she said of Polish people voting from abroad. \u201cYou could tell that people were fed up with the government and they just wanted a change,\u201d Collins, 46, said of the queue of Polish voters in Bristol, which she described as \u201csuch a nice atmosphere\u201d. She arrived apprehensive about the chances of Tusk\u2019s centre-left coalition forming a government; after speaking to voters in the line, she left thinking: \u201cThere is hope \u2013 maybe, just maybe!\u201d Collins, a conference planner, said the turnout made her \u201cemotional and proud\u201d and that she could be \u201chopeful\u201d again under a Poland led by Tusk, who is \u201cproudly European\u201d. Since 2021, Poland has banned almost all abortions and criminalised those seeking or administering them. \u201cThere were a lot of instances where women actually died because they couldn\u2019t have an abortion in time,\u201d Collins said. She feels a \u201cvery important factor\u201d in women turning out to vote for the opposition was that \u201cunder the current government the abortion laws were so strict and conservative\u201d. Collins did not expect abortion to become as available as in the UK under Tusk, given the country\u2019s Catholicism, but said: \u201cPart of the reason why women felt so motivated to vote this time in the elections is because they want to have more tolerance, they want to have more freedom, they want to be able to make decisions about their own bodies.\u201d \u2018Nothing is clear at the moment\u2019 Other voters like Agnieszka Zieli\u0144ska think PiS might still have a chance to form a government. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult situation but it\u2019s not a victory for the opposition,\u201d she said. Zieli\u0144ska, 44, who considers herself a \u201cneutral observer\u201d and is neither pro or against PiS, said there may be hope for the party to form a coalition with the Polish People\u2019s party (PSL) and Poland 2050. \u201cNothing is clear at the moment,\u201d said Zieli\u0144ska. The university administrator from Wroc\u0142aw feels the country is \u201cvery divided\u201d and there are concerns from some about what a Tusk-led coalition might mean. \u201cLocal communities living in the countryside tend to support PiS because they fear a liberal government will lose interest in them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey worry that changing things like the benefit system will leave them poorer.\u201d Zieli\u0144ska said she is \u201clooking for stabilisation\u201d especially with what is happening in Ukraine. \u201cFor many living in the eastern part of Poland there is fear the situation may develop with Russia. \u201cPiS is right wing but doesn\u2019t want any involvement with Moscow. Tusk and the opposition might look to Brussels for help and that could take decision-making away from us.\u201d"

            "content": "The final results of Poland\u2019s Sunday election were published. Law and Justice (PiS) got 35.38%, Civic Coalition (KO) 30.7%, Third Way: 14.4%, The Left (Lewica): 8.61% and Konfederacja: 7.16% The country now waits to see how long it will take for a new governing coalition led by Donald Tusk to be formed. Tusk has asked Poland\u2019s President Andrzej Duda to move quickly. Manfred Weber, the leader of the centre-right European People\u2019s Party, said that \u201cwe are extremely happy about the outcome \u2013 the Polish people have spoken\u201d. Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda, a former Slovak prime minister, told the Guardian this morning that the outcome of the Polish election would \u201cboost the centripetal tendencies in the EU\u201d. R\u00f3\u017ca Thun, a member of Polska 2050, part of Third Way, said \u201cthis was a victory of democracy\u201d but also that there are \u201chuge challenges in front of us\u201d. The Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk has asked Poland\u2019s President Andrzej Duda for a quick decision. Duda is expected to soon indicate his preference for which party should get the first chance to form a government. Tusk said opposition parties are in constant contact and ready to take over at any time. Piotr Buras, director of the Warsaw office at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the Guardian today that the election\u2019s outcome demonstrates that iliberalism can be ended. \u201cIt will be quite an experiment to roll back illiberalism in Poland, but it has implications for other countries,\u201d he said, adding that it shows that it\u2019s possible to \u201cremove an illiberal government by democratic means, even if the level playing field is not there, even if the government has certain advantages and basically misuses power.\u201d \u201cFor Slovakia, for Hungary, for Serbia, for other countries, it should be a very positive message,\u201d Buras noted. When it comes to Warsaw\u2019s role on the European stage, Buras said: Liberal Poland is back and it could be a potentially important player in the European politics, because Poland was missing for the last eight years as a constructive power in the EU. But, he cautioned, the new government will be \u201cvery focused on the domestic challenges\u201d and that could \u201cconstrain\u201d its ability to play a big role in Europe. What would a new government mean for Polish policy? We asked Jakub Jaraczewski, research coordinator at Democracy Reporting International. Unlike passing new legislation, which will face hurdles due to a veto by President Duda, foreign policy could change swiftly, with the new government taking a more constructive pro-EU course while maintaining good relations with the US and Ukraine. An attempt at a serious revival of the Weimar Triangle \u2013 Polish-German-French cooperation \u2013 is very likely. Domestically, I expect the first six months of the new government to be less about massive legislative projects and more about a change in posturing, narrative and day-to-day policy. Hopefully, judges will no longer be told they\u2019re obstacles or enemies of the government, and prosecutors won\u2019t be directed to close investigations inconvenient for the ruling camp. Poland\u2019s electoral committee has finished counting the votes from the parliamentary election, as the country waits to see how long it will take for a new governing coalition led by Donald Tusk to be formed. Sunday\u2019s poll gave the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has ruled Poland for the past eight years, the most votes but no viable path to a parliamentary majority. The final count showed PiS had received 35.4% of the vote, while Civic Coalition, led by Tusk, a former prime minister and European Council president, had 30.7%. With the centre-right Third Way, on 14.4%, and leftwing Lewica, on 8.6%, the three groupings should be able to put together a coalition that would form a comfortable majority in the 460-seat parliament. With the vote count complete, President Andrzej Duda is expected on Tuesday to indicate his preference for which party should get the first chance to put together a coalition. Tradition indicates he will turn to PiS, as the largest party, but with all other parties indicating they are not open to cooperating with it, the opposition have called on the president to take into account the political reality and give them the chance to build their coalition. However, there remains a lingering fear of possible PiS gambits in the coming days and weeks. Caution also stems from the realisation that governing with a PiS-aligned president in office until 2025, and with numerous state institutions packed with PiS supporters, governing will not be easy. Read the full story here. We want to hear from you. Are you a voter living in Poland or another country? What are your thoughts on the election results? How will the change of power likely impact you? You can share your thoughts on the Poland election results using this form. Here is how the election results translate into the distribution of seats: Law and Justice (PiS): 194 Civic Coalition (KO): 157 Third Way: 65 The Left (Lewica): 26 Konfederacja: 18 St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, president of the centrist Renew Europe group in the European parliament, said today that \u201cwe are witnessing the democratic rebirth of Poland.\u201d S\u00e9journ\u00e9 congratulated Polska 2050, adding: \u201cWe call on the Polish president and the institutions of Poland to respect the democratic choices made by the Polish people.\u201d There is lots of excitement on the left about the final outcome. The New Left\u2019s Robert Biedro\u0144 wrote this morning that it is thanks to joint work that Poland is waking up to a new reality \u2013 and that we have a government to build. Speaking to reporters this morning, Polish member of the European parliament R\u00f3\u017ca Thun said the message to European partners is that Poland is \u201cback.\u201d Thun, a member of Polska 2050, part of Third Way, said \u201cthis was a victory of democracy.\u201d We need a strong Europe and we want to have a voice in the world - not only in the European Union. So the first thing that our European partners hear today is, we are back. And that\u2019s an extremely important message for us in Poland as well, but also for Europe. We are back. We will not show the back to the European Union anymore. We want to cooperate, we want to reinforce this Europe. And this message is extremely strong, because the victory of democratic forces is very clear. But the parliamentarian also said that there are \u201chuge challenges in front of us.\u201d First thing is of course, rule of law, independence of judiciary, back to Europe, as we call it, that we need to give, again, freedom or render those institutions free from party control and influence, and that\u2019s not only judiciary, but also military, police, public media. Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda, a former Slovak prime minister, told the Guardian this morning that the outcome of the Polish election would \u201cboost the centripetal tendencies in the EU\u201d. Dzurinda, who now heads the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies \u2013 the official thinktank of the centre-right European People\u2019s Party \u2013 also said that the opposition\u2019s strong performance in Poland \u201cwill bring new dynamism and encouragement for our EPP family\u201d. I know my friends in Poland, especially Donald Tusk, very well, and I feel very strongly that Poland with Donald Tusk at the helm of the government will strengthen or boost the centripetal tendencies in the EU, and mitigate the opposite \u2013 the centrifugal tones or tendencies. It is crucial, because we know very well that we live in very special times when we face a substantial shift of the global political landscape, so we need to be more united in Europe, in the EU. In this respect, I\u2019m happy, it is a significant step in the right direction. Poland\u2019s election is a big win for the centre-right European People\u2019s party. Civic Platform is a member of the EPP, and Donald Tusk was president of the EPP from 2019 until 2022. Manfred Weber, the EPP\u2019s current leader, told reporters this morning that \u201cwe are extremely happy about the outcome \u2013 the Polish people have spoken\u201d. Weber said he is \u201cproud\u201d of Civic Coalition members \u201cwho worked so hard for this result, especially Donald Tusk, who succeeded to break through the negativity of the ruling party and offered to the Polish people a positive perspective, a message of hope\u201d. \u201cPoland is back,\u201d he said, calling the result \u201ca new chapter\u201d. Poland has a very close relationship with the US, and what happens in Warsaw is of strategic importance for Washington. Late yesterday, a spokesperson for the US state department pointed to the country\u2019s very high election turnout, writing that it \u201cis a strong expression of the democratic will of Polish citizens\u201d. We now know the final outcome of Poland\u2019s Sunday election. While the ruling Law and Justice party got the most votes, the election was a defeat for the current government: opposition parties performed so well that they have a path toward forming a new ruling coalition. Law and Justice (PiS): 35.38% Civic Coalition (KO): 30.7% Third Way: 14.4% The Left (Lewica): 8.61% Konfederacja: 7.16% Good morning and welcome back to the Europe blog. Today we will be looking at the final results of Poland\u2019s election, and the wide-ranging implications for both Polish society and European politics. Send comments to lili.bayer@theguardian.com."

            "date": "2023-10-22T21:45:26Z",
            "content": "The rightwing populist Swiss People\u2019s party (SVP) was set to further strengthen its position as the largest political force in parliament, an early projection suggested, as voters appeared to back the party\u2019s hardline stance against mass migration and what it called \u201cwoke madness\u201d. The SVP was on track to receive 29% of the vote, an increase of nearly 3.5 percentage points over its 2019 results, pollsters GFS Bern predicted, with more than half of the results in. \u201cWe have received a very clear mandate from the Swiss population to put on the table issues which matter to them, such as illegal immigration,\u201d SVP president Marco Chiesa told national broadcaster RTS. The Greens, who in 2019 made historic gains, were expected to see their support sink to about 9%, down from 13.2%. Lisa Mazzone, a Green lawmaker seeking re-election, said the poll results showed \u201ca context of fear, and clearly when we are afraid, we forget hope\u201d. GFS Bern, which conducted the main polling throughout the federal election campaign, said it expected the leftwing Social Democrats to capture 18% of the votes while centre-right party The Centre and centrist party FDP.The Liberals were expected to capture about 15% each. Final results are expected early Monday. The early estimates suggest that despite Switzerland\u2019s high proportion of foreign residents and its status as one of the world\u2019s richest countries, SVP\u2019s stark warnings against \u201cmass immigration\u201d had resonated with Swiss nationals. Among the party\u2019s proposals was a bid to cap the country\u2019s population, now at 8.8 million, to 10 million until 2050, citing concerns over the protection of nature and overstretched infrastructure. The attacks on migration have long been a staple for the SVP, which for two decades has ranked as the largest faction in parliament. This time around, the Federal Commission Against Racism party accused the SVP of running a \u201cxenophobic\u201d campaign following social media adverts that sought to stoke fears about migrants. The posts showed bloodied knives, hooded criminals, bruised faces and frightened women, accompanied by the question of whether this could be the \u201cnew normal\u201d. SVP\u2019s campaign also sought to mine the culture wars, with vows to tackle \u201ccancel culture\u201d and combat what it described as \u201cwoke madness\u201d. The approach was captured by the SVP youth wing in a recent social media post. \u201cDrag queens, antifas and climate activists are all going to vote!,\u201d it wrote earlier this month. \u201cAt the polls, they could ruin Switzerland and our society. We won\u2019t let them!\u201d About a quarter of Switzerland\u2019s residents hail from outside the country, with nationals from Italy, Germany, Portugal and France ranking among the largest migrant communities. Only Swiss nationals, however, can vote in federal elections. The SVP \u2013 which is strongly anti-EU \u2013 also called for Switzerland to strengthen its commitment to neutrality, in line with its view that the country went too far in matching the EU\u2019s sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Switzerland is not a member of the EU. Thomas Aeschi, head of the SVP parliamentary group, told the AFP news agency that the SVP \u201cwants good relations with the European Union but what we don\u2019t want is an agreement where Switzerland must do what the EU says\u201d. Analysts predicted that the result would not lead to a significant shift in Switzerland\u2019s government, known as the Federal Council, as the seven cabinet positions are divided among the four largest parties. The newly elected parliamentarians will choose the seven members of the government in mid-December. Reto Foellmi, an economics professor at the University of St Gallen, said that the impact of Sunday\u2019s election would probably instead be felt in the tone and focus of the country\u2019s political debate. \u201cOn climate change, the government and the parliament will take the foot off the gas \u2026 and with migration the tone will get harder,\u201d he said earlier this week. The projected strong result for the SVP suggested that concerns over immigration may have trumped fears about the looming climate crisis in a country where glaciers are retreating at an exceptional rate. \u201cFour years ago, people were a bit more idealistic and progressive, which explained why the Greens did well, but now people are more concerned about security and are more conservative again,\u201d Michael Hermann, a political analyst at pollsters Sotomo, told Reuters. \u201cThe SVP has done well because it has raised fears about \u2018wokeness\u2019 and also focused on migration again,\u201d said Hermann. It appears likely that the Swiss election will add to the far-right gains being seen across Europe. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, hails from a party with neofascist roots, while the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party recently won its first district council election. In Austria, the anti-immigrant Freedom party is topping polls ahead of next year\u2019s election. In Finland, the far right is part of the new coalition government while, in Sweden, it is propping up the government in exchange for key policy concessions.

            "content": "The downward trend in support for the voice to parliament has slowed, but a majority of people are still intending on voting no, according to the latest update from Guardian Australia\u2019s poll tracker. Despite the addition of several recent polls to the Guardian\u2019s model, there is no sign of a trend back towards a yes vote for Saturday\u2019s referendum. The yes side has an estimated 41.6% support nationally and is trailing in every state except Tasmania, which has been excluded from our model due to low sample sizes. The need for a double majority to pass a referendum \u2013 a majority of voters nationally as well as majorities in four of the six states \u2013 means that the national yes vote likely needs to be closer to 53% for the yes campaign to have a good chance. Support is under 40% in Queensland and Western Australia, and is highest at 45% in Victoria. There is a lot of uncertainty around the Tasmania results, where there have been relatively few polls throughout the campaign, and many which had small sample sizes. Dr Kevin Bonham, an election analyst, estimates support is about 45.9% in Tasmania, based on a longer-term average than the measure used by Guardian Australia\u2019s tracker. The share of undecided voters nationally is between 7% and 14%, depending on pollster methodology, according to Bonham. This is roughly in line with the share of undecided voters at recent elections. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Support for the voice to parliament has declined more than 20 points since August last year. A lot of \u201csoft\u201d yes and no voters \u2013 people who weren\u2019t certain of their voting intentions, but were leaning one way \u2013 have drifted to the no camp. Some 40% of respondents in recent Essential polls have been \u201chard no\u201d, about double what it was in February. About 30% are \u201chard yes\u201d, which has remained roughly constant. Guardian Australia collated more than 60 polls from 12 different pollsters since August last year. Our tracker does not predict the referendum outcome, but gives us a rough average and trend given differing polling methodologies, sample sizes and questions across pollsters and throughout the campaign. You can read more about polling and our methodology here. The downward trend in support for the referendum has slowed in the past couple of months, with a few recent polls as high as 47%, once undecideds are removed. \u201cAs the downwards trend has trailed off, you expect to get more polls that show an insignificant upswing just by random chance,\u201d says Bonham. \u201cIn the republic referendum, there was a late upswing [in the polls] that proved to not be real.\u201d As it stands, if the referendum were to pass it would mean a polling error about three times larger than the 2019 election, which experts say is very unlikely. The ACT and the Northern Territory are not counted towards the state majority required for a referendum to pass. Tasmania contains only about 2% of the national population, making it hard to get decent sample sizes. All three have been excluded from our model. The number of undecided voters has declined by about 11 points over the past year, according to the Guardian Australia tracker. But this can be a noisy measure and some pollsters have stopped reporting undecideds/unknowns as the campaign has progressed. Bonham says the average in polls that ask two questions before marking someone as undecided is actually around 7.5%, and in polls that ask only once it is about 14%. \u201cIn the recent federal election in polls that asked twice, [the undecided vote] was down around 6%\u201d says Bonham. \u201cThere are some people who will always say that they are undecided even if you ask them on the day.\u201d A large share of voters were \u201csoft\u201d yes or no in early polls. Many would have been unfamiliar with the concept, and some details like the exact wording of the question were not revealed until later in the campaign. But the proportion of undecided voters has come down as the voice has become more prominent in the news and people have seen ads or had conversations with friends, say pollsters."

            "date": "2023-10-19T21:36:29Z",
            "content": "Polls have closed in the Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth byelections, seen as crucial in gauging the electoral fate of Rishi Sunak but difficult to predict. The Conservatives are defending majorities of nearly 25,000 in Mid Bedfordshire and close to 20,000 in Tamworth, which would normally point to an easy hold. However, their chances will be hampered by the party\u2019s dismal poll ratings and the records of departing MPs. The Mid Bedfordshire vote was triggered by the resignation of the former culture secretary Nadine Dorries in protest at her lack of a peerage from Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours. Her protracted departure drew attention to her seemingly limited involvement in local affairs. In Tamworth, Chris Pincher, the former deputy chief whip, stepped down from his seat after losing an appeal against an eight-week suspension from parliament for groping two men at a private members\u2019 club in the summer of 2022. Tamworth is a straight fight between the Conservatives and Labour. The latter held the Staffordshire seat between 1997 and 2010, when Pincher was first elected. Sarah Edwards, the Labour candidate in Tamworth, is the bookmakers\u2019 favourite to defeat the Conservatives\u2019 Andrew Cooper, but this would need a swing of more than 21 percentage points. Cooper has not helped his case after it emerged that in 2020 he shared a Facebook photo of a flowchart which said parents should only seek help with their finances if they were employed and gave up their TV and mobile phone contracts. A Labour win would not be without precedent: a byelection in 1996 in South East Staffordshire, the previous seat in the area, saw Labour defeat the Conservatives with a swing of nearly 22 percentage points. Mid Bedfordshire is even harder to call, given that both the Liberal Democrats and Labour have flung huge resources at the byelection. Labour came a fairly distant second to Dorries in the 2019 general election, and argue this makes them the obvious challengers. The Lib Dems in turn say the seat\u2019s largely rural demographics and the need to tempt wavering Tory voters to change sides mean they are better placed. The refusal of either side to back down makes it possible that even a fairly demoralised local Conservative group could win with their candidate, Festus Akinbusoye, the local police and crime commissioner. However, if the Conservatives lose, it would be \u2013 depending whose version you follow \u2013 either the biggest majority overturned in a byelection since 1945, or the biggest ever. The combined uncertainty means that unpacking the wider political lessons of the results could be complex. But losing byelections would be seen as disastrous for Sunak, and another pointer towards defeat in the general election next year. While holding one or both seats would be trumpeted by No 10 as indicating a resurgence for the prime minister, this may not be the case, given the previously huge majorities, and the fact that Labour and the Lib Dems could cancel each other out in Mid Bedfordshire."

Polling stations will open from 9am (GMT 8pm Friday) for New Zealanders wanting to vote in person. About 1 million of the 3.5 million eligible voters have already had their say during two weeks of advance voting. But after weeks of intense campaigning and non-stop political news coverage, people in New Zealand will wake up on Saturday \u2013 perhaps with some relief \u2013 to a different reality. At midnight ahead of each election, political campaigning must cease, the news media is prohibited from publishing new political stories, and thousands of political party signs that populate busy traffic intersections must come down. It is a criminal offence in New Zealand to do anything that could be seen as encouraging or persuading voters on election day, a law that stems from 19th-century England, where New Zealand gets its parliamentary model. This ban includes advertising, public statements, processions and speeches, as well as displaying candidate, party names, emblems, slogans or logos. \u201cWhat the law basically says to people is you have to quietly go to a place without any attempt to influence you or stir up your emotions, and you consult your conscience in private,\u201d said Prof Andrew Geddis, an expert in electoral law from the University of Otago. \u201cYou then cast your vote much in the same way as when you go to church and you make a little prayer to God.\u201d Voting in neighbouring Australia is a more colourful experience, where people are greeted with flyers from political party volunteers and a \u201cdemocracy sausage\u201d barbecue at many polling stations. The atmosphere in New Zealand is more \u201creflective\u201d, Geddis said. To fill the almost awkward void from absent political coverage, New Zealanders often post images of dogs waiting at polling stations. Exit polling, commonplace in the US where the media cover election day like a fast-paced basketball game, is also banned. This leaves New Zealanders in the dark about results until the media blackout lifts at 7pm. The UK maintains a similar media ban for its elections. There is yet to be anyone fined for breaking the rules, according to Geddis. During the last election in 2020, the Electoral Commission scolded numerous foreign politicians for showing their support on social media for a New Zealand party or candidate. Many of the rules are \u201chistoric legacy\u201d that doesn\u2019t suit modern voting, said Richard Shaw, a political professor at Massey University. A small number of voters are undecided when they get to polling stations so many wouldn\u2019t be swayed anyway, he said. There\u2019s also a growing number of people who vote in advance while political campaigning is at its peak. The Guardian will live blog the election results after 7pm."

            "title": "Poland exit polls: Donald Tusk claims victory based on coalition hopes",
            "date": "2023-10-15T21:37:48Z",
            "content": "Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister and European Council president, claimed victory in Poland\u2019s parliamentary election on Sunday, making the announcement just minutes after the polls closed, based on the results of an exit poll. The poll suggested the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party had won the most votes but appeared to show a route to government for a combined opposition coalition led by Tusk. PiS, which has governed Poland for eight years, has turned public television into a propaganda arm of the government, restricted abortion rights and demonised LGBTQ+ people, migrants and refugees. It has also put Poland on a collision course with Brussels over rule of law issues, which has led to tens of billions of euros in European funding being frozen. Tusk appeared on stage at the Civic Coalition election headquarters at Warsaw\u2019s Ethnographical Museum to declare victory. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the evil times, it\u2019s the end of the PiS rule, we made it,\u201d said Tusk, to cheers from assembled supporters. \u201cWe won democracy, we won freedom, we won our free beloved Poland \u2026 this day will be remembered in history as a bright day, the rebirth of Poland,\u201d he said. An updated exit poll released early on Monday put PiS on 36.6% and Tusk\u2019s Civic Coalition on 31%. However, two groups that could form a coalition with Tusk also did well, with 13.5% for the centre-right Third Way and 8.6% for the leftwing Lewica. Such a result, if confirmed, would mean that the three combined parties would have a majority in Poland\u2019s 460-seat parliament. In a further piece of potential good news for Poland\u2019s progressives, the exit poll put Confederation, a far-right coalition tipped to get about 9% of the vote, on 6.4%, lower than pre-election polls had estimated. Poland\u2019s zloty currency firmed following the result, and was about 1.3% stronger at 0515 GMT. More clarity on the results was expected in the morning, but the final outcome may only be available well into Monday or even Tuesday. An exit poll in Slovakia\u2019s election earlier this month appeared to show a victory for a progressive coalition, only for the actual results to be strikingly different. \u201c[The] president can give PiS first chance to form government, delaying opposition,\u201d said Stanley Bill, professor of Polish studies at Cambridge University, writing on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cCrucial to wait for official results (by Tuesday) - small differences could somewhat alter the picture.\u201d However, the mood at the Civic Coalition HQ was jubilant. \u201cThe next 40 hours, 60 hours will show how we build this coalition. But for us it\u2019s obvious that the [government] coalition will be us, the Third Way and the left,\u201d said Borys Budka, head of the Civic Coalition parliamentary faction. Budka also said an opposition win would mark the return of Poland to friendly relations with the EU and an end to the threat of a \u201cPolexit\u201d. Barbara Nowacka, a Civic Coalition MP who has been fiercely critical of the PiS crackdown on abortion rights, said it was clear the opposition had won, and said it was an important day for Polish women. \u201cYoung women won\u2019t be afraid to get pregnant, young women won\u2019t be afraid to go to the doctor,\u201d she said. Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, 74, the PiS chair, said his party\u2019s result was a big success, but admitted \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d whether the party had a path to government. \u201cDays of fight and tension await us,\u201d he told supporters just after the exit poll was released. If PiS is indeed the biggest party, it has the right to have the first attempt at forming a coalition. \u201cWhether we are in power or in the opposition, we will continue implementing our project and will not allow Poland to be betrayed,\u201d he said. In a bitterly divisive campaign over recent months, both sides have painted the vote as being of decisive importance for the future of Poland. Tusk had described the election as \u201cthe last chance\u201d to stop PiS from doing irreparable damage to Polish democracy. PiS ran a campaign from the populist playbook, claiming it was the only party that can protect Poland from an \u201cinvasion\u201d of refugees. The campaign has also focused on the figure of Tusk, 66, relentlessly attacking the challenger as a foreign stooge. The election was on course for a turnout of over 72%, the highest since the fall of communism. As the polls closed there were queues remaining outside many polling stations. Authorities said anyone who was queueing before the official end of voting would be able to vote. Television footage showed several hundred people, mostly young, waiting in a long line at one polling station in the western city of Wroc\u0142aw to vote. Local residents were bringing them hot tea and blankets as well as some food. Some of those in line said they waited for six hours. The polling station closed just before 3am (0100 GMT), some six hours after the voting stations were set to officially to close. Earlier in the day, at one polling station in Wola district, opposition voters expressed confidence at the chances for an opposition victory. \u201cI saw a lot of young people, more than four or eight years ago, which makes me optimistic,\u201d said Pawel, 46, who had voted for Tusk\u2019s Civic Coalition. At the same polling station Maciej, 78, said the stereotype that older people support PiS was not true. \u201cThere are plenty of us who know how to think,\u201d he said, tapping his forehead. Across town in the Goc\u0142aw district, 77-year-old Gra\u017cyna said she voted for PiS because she believed they are the \u201cfairest\u201d of all the parties. \u201cI hope they will be able to continue changing Poland for the better,\u201d she said, after queueing for 20 minutes to vote. There were also long queues at Polish consulates abroad, with more than 600,000 Poles living outside the country registering to vote. On social media, people shared photographs and videos of long queues in various cities: one person said they had waited three hours to vote in Palermo without getting to the front of the queue. Alongside the election, the government held a referendum, which asked four leading questions, including two on migration. One asked if people agree with \u201cthe admission of thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa\u201d. The referendum was seen as a way to boost turnout among the PiS support base, as well as a way to circumvent electoral funding restrictions for the government. The opposition told its supporters to request only an election ballot and decline to take part in the referendum, which requires a 50% turnout to be valid. With so much at stake in the vote, there have been some concerns of possible foul play. Tens of thousands of Polish volunteers signed up to monitor the vote at polling stations. There are also concerns about potential attempts to discredit the results or interfere in the process in the event of a PiS defeat. Electoral results are ratified by the Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs, added to the supreme court by the PiS government. Budka, however, said he believed the time for PiS was over. \u201cEven if they try any tricks it wouldn\u2019t be something which changed the result,\u201d he claimed.

            "title": "Poland election race too close to call as voters prepare to go to polls",
            "date": "2023-10-14T04:00:32Z",
            "content": "Poland is gearing up for a parliamentary election on Sunday, the result of which is likely to have a major impact on the country\u2019s direction, and polls suggest the race is too close to call. The incumbent Law and Justice (PiS) government is seeking a third consecutive term in office, fighting a challenge from the main opposition coalition led by the former prime minister and European Council president Donald Tusk. In a vicious and largely negative campaign, PiS has portrayed Tusk\u2019s coalition as traitors to Poland, while Tusk has said the vote is the last chance to save democracy in Poland after eight years of PiS rolling back democratic freedoms. Tusk has promised to relax strict anti-abortion laws and improve rights for LGBTQ+ people, and has also promised to restore relations with Brussels, which have been damaged over concerns that the PiS government has undermined the rule of law in Poland. Saturday is a day of campaign silence, meaning candidates made their final pitches to voters on Friday. PiS, which campaigned on a platform of ensuring Poland\u2019s security and keeping out migrants, had a setback on Tuesday when two of the country\u2019s top military commanders resigned, apparently irritated by the politicisation of the army. Polls have shown PiS hovering at between 31% and 36% in the polls, with Tusk\u2019s Civic Coalition trailing a few percentage points behind. The outcome is likely to depend on the performance of several smaller parties and the election may be followed by a period of tense coalition negotiations or even political deadlock, with neither side able to form a workable coalition. Tusk will be hoping he has the seats to form a government together with two other opposition forces, the centre-right Third Way coalition and the leftwing Lewica. PiS, meanwhile, may need to rely on wooing elements of Confederation, a collection of far-right nationalists, libertarians and monarchists. Ben Stanley, a sociologist and political scientist at SWPS University in Warsaw, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and variation in the polls. If the recent polls are more or less right, we\u2019re shaping up to have no clear winner.\u201d In an effort to boost turnout and circumvent campaign spending regulations, the government has organised a referendum to coincide with the election, asking voters a series of leading questions about subjects such as migration and raising the retirement age. It has also offered a series of cash prizes for various causes to reward high turnouts in small towns and villages, where PiS support is traditionally higher. The PiS-aligned president, Andrzej Duda, called on Poles to vote in the referendum in an address on public television. \u201cI strongly encourage you to express your opinion on extremely important issues regarding our security, economic and social policy. It is Poles who should decide on the most important issues concerning our homeland,\u201d Duda said. PiS has portrayed Tusk as unpatriotic and a puppet for foreign interests. The party\u2019s chair, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, has described him as \u201cthe personification of evil\u201d. Public television is strongly slanted towards PiS despite an obligation to be neutral, but has been legally required to give rare access to the airwaves to opposition politicians before the vote. In a televised debate on Monday, Tusk took on the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, with both lead candidates looking nervous and out of sorts. On Thursday, Tomasz Grodzki, the speaker of the upper house of parliament and part of Civic Coalition, used a televised address to condemn the PiS government, focusing on the army resignations. \u201cThey were educated in the tradition of the army being apolitical but have apparently had enough of attempts to change the civilian control over the army into party control,\u201d he said. Grodzki also covered traditional electoral ground such as inflation, waiting times for healthcare and education. \u201cThe time for changes has come,\u201d he said. Poland\u2019s biggest liberal newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, called on the electorate to vote PiS out of office, in an editorial published on Friday. The newspaper, which has always been strongly critical of PiS, said the vote was as important as, if not more important than, the election of 1989 that ushered in the end of communism in Poland. \u201cAnother Poland is within reach. A cheerful, friendly, cordial and open Poland, where the authorities do not separate themselves from the citizens with police cordons and do not spread hatred,\u201d it said."

            "date": "2023-10-11T16:22:49Z",
            "content": "The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he fears that the aftermath of Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel and US politics could threaten military support for his country, as he made a surprise visit to Brussels where Nato defence ministers are meeting. \u201cI want to be honest with you, of course it is a dangerous situation for people in Ukraine,\u201d he said on his first visit to Nato headquarters since Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, making an in-person plea for continued assistance at a time when turbulence in the US Congress threatens to disrupt aid for Kyiv and the world\u2019s attention is drawn to the crisis unfolding in the Middle East. Zelenskiy called for more weapons and air defences to tide his country through another winter of Russian attacks likely to target power stations and energy infrastructure. But as the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, announced a fresh $200m (\u00a3162m) military contribution to Ukraine, Zelenskiy suggested Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel at the weekend could be among the factors posing a risk to his country\u2019s defence against Russia. \u201cIf there are other tragedies in the world, there is only a certain amount of military support to share, and Russia hopes that support will be divided,\u201d Zelenskiy told reporters at the Belgian parliament. \u201cThere will be challenges with the American elections, and I talked to our partners and they said the support will stay, but who can tell that the support will stay, nobody knows.\u201d Austin said both allies will be supported. \u201cWe can do both and we will do both,\u201d he said at the Nato meeting. \u201cThe United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.\u201d Alongside the US military assistance package, the Belgian prime minister, Alexander de Croo, announced he would make F16s available to Ukraine in 2025 and immediately provide maintenance assistance for fighter jets donated by other nations. De Croo also launched a \u20ac1.7bn (\u00a31.5bn) fund that will be raised from a levy on interest made from frozen Russian assets alongside a new scheme to block Russian diamonds from the retail market. \u201cWe know what you are fighting for and we will continue to support and ensure that you will be on your side as long as necessary,\u201d De Croo said. Zelenskiy\u2019s presence underscored growing concerns about cracks in what has been staunch international backing for Kyiv in its war against Russia\u2019s invasion, and worries that Ukrainian forces haven\u2019t made measurable progress in the counteroffensive as winter closes in. He made explicit comparisons between Vladimir Putin and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, and said western military aid was crucial to put Moscow on the back foot in the war. \u201cAm I scared assistance will decrease? There are risks because of all those reasons you described, but that\u2019s not just a risk for Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t help Ukraine, Russia will gain power and the war will not end, Russia will move forward in EU countries. The cheapest option for everyone is stop warfare in our country and to get them out of our territory.\u201d He said Russia would move to exploit the conflict in Israel because its interest was \u201cpermanent destablisation\u201d and \u201cdecreasing assistance to Ukraine\u201d. Earlier he urged the west to rally around the people of Israel as they had around Ukraine last year and show them they were not alone. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said the US\u2019s decision to step up support for Israel would not come at the expense of Ukraine. Berlin would do \u201ceverything we can to ensure support for Ukraine does not crumble\u201d, Pistorius said in Berlin. Reiterating the west\u2019s pledge to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, Austin announced a new $200m defence package including air defence munitions and weapons to counter Russian drones. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Putin was \u201cpreparing once again to use winter as a weapon of war\u201d by attacking energy infrastructure in Ukraine. \u201cWe need to prevent that. With more advanced and increased capabilities for air defence, we can make a big difference,\u201d Stoltenberg said."

            "content": "Your reporting on the Karabakh Armenian exodus (\u2018It\u2019s a ghost town\u2019: UN arrives in Nagorno-Karabakh to find ethnic Armenians have fled, 2 October) does not reflect the trauma felt by Azeris when they were forced out of their homes across the disputed territory and from large swathes of Azerbaijan proper in 1992-94. I understand why the emphasis is on the tragic exodus of Karabakh Armenians from their ancestral homes, and I am no fan of Azerbaijan\u2019s autocracy, but I was in the region in 1992-94, reporting for the Guardian and the BBC, and I think some perspective is in order. I watched thousands of Azeris fleeing with all their worldly possessions on foot over mountains and across plains in the face of the Armenian advance in 1992-94. By some calculations, 800,000 Azeris lost their homes in Karabakh, the surrounding areas of Azerbaijan and Armenia during the 1988-94 period. There is the personal trauma of becoming a refugee and then there is the humiliation of a state: in 1992-94 Azerbaijan lost about 15% of its territory to the Karabakh Armenians, army units from Armenia proper and volunteers from the Armenian diaspora. Azerbaijan was always going to hanker after its lost lands, and petrol wealth was always going to make reconquest likely. That\u2019s why the Armenian exodus today is so tragic in a Shakespearean sense; the Armenians should have negotiated a sensible settlement when they were in the ascendant. Now it\u2019s sadly much too late. Alexis Rowell Paris, France \u2022 Thanks to Nathalie Tocci for her article (Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s tragedy has echoes of Europe\u2019s dark past. But a remedy lies in Europe too, 2 October). EU membership for Armenia would ensure its survival as a small, landlocked nation whose citizens have worked incredibly hard to build democracy in a region bereft of it. I sincerely hope it can be achieved. Tocci\u2019s analysis is insightful. The blame for the tragedy of Nagorno-Karabakh lies with both Azeris and Armenians, who had 30 years after the 1988-94 war to find a solution for the governance of the enclave. That they did not is a serious failure of diplomacy on both sides. However, Tocci writes that Azerbaijan\u2019s president Aliyev \u201chas not ordered the 120,000 local Armenians to leave, let alone pointed a gun at their heads\u201d. While there may not have been physical guns pointed, there were virtual guns \u2013 big ones \u2013 pointing right at them. The Aliyev regime ordered a 10-month blockade, during which time local Armenians were starved and deprived of medicine. And it ordered the shelling of Stepanakert, violating ceasefire agreements and threatening civilians with death. The regime now offers Armenians citizenship in an autocratic country in which they are widely and openly despised. The idea that there are \u201cno guns pointing at their heads\u201d is precisely the Azerbaijani state narrative. Let us not repeat it without these important qualifications.

            "date": "2023-10-29T07:00:38Z",
            "content": "Towards the end of prime minister\u2019s questions last Wednesday the Labour frontbencher Yasmin Qureshi rose to her feet to read an email from a constituent in Gaza, and to ask Rishi Sunak for his response. \u201cMy heart can\u2019t handle this any more. We are being massacred, relentlessly bombed. Homes destroyed. No water, no food, no electricity,\u201d her constituent had written. With MPs on all sides of the house silent and hanging on her every word, Qureshi, the shadow minister for women and equalities, pressed on: \u201cSave the Children reports that one child is killed every 15 minutes. As I speak, the lives of 130 babies in incubators are in danger if fuel does not reach their hospital in time. \u201cThis is collective punishment of the Palestinian people in Gaza, for crimes they did not commit. How many more innocent Palestinians must die before the prime minister calls for a humanitarian ceasefire?\u201d When Sunak replied, emphasising both Israel\u2019s right to defend itself and the importance of doing everything possible to help innocent Palestinian civilians, MPs knew the question had, in reality, been more awkward for Qureshi\u2019s own leader Keir Starmer, than for the prime minister. For the past three weeks, since Hamas\u2019s horrific attacks killed at least 1,400 Israelis, the Labour party has been struggling to hold itself together over its responses to events in the Middle East. Starmer has faced growing criticism from the left and from Muslim Labour politicians and supporters over some of his remarks in the media, and for not backing a ceasefire. On Friday both Anas Sarwar, the leader of Scottish Labour, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, threw their weight behind calls for a ceasefire, widening the split and placing Starmer under ever increasing pressure to do the same. Labour is desperately trying to prevent the strains developing into a crisis, just at a point in the political cycle where Starmer had appeared to have got most of his party very solidly behind him. Dozens of senior MPs report having had \u201cvery difficult\u201d meetings with angry constituents all week, particularly Muslim supporters, but also normally loyal party figures who believe Israel has been breaking international law in its response to the atrocities committed by Hamas. When a ninth Labour councillor in Oxford quit the party on Thursday in protest at the leadership\u2019s response to events Gaza, it cost Labour its majority on the city council. One of those who quit, Dr Amar Latif, says that it was an interview Starmer gave to LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari that caused him to step down. \u201cHe was asked if he thought the siege on Gaza was justified, and he said \u2018Yes\u2019.\u201d Latif says the Hamas attacks were abhorrent but that Starmer in his responses demonstrated \u201ca disregard for international law\u201d. Starmer later clarified his comments by saying that he supported aid and did not believe that Israel had the right to cut off water, fuel or medicines. By then it was too late. The Oxford rebels had issued a statement accusing him of being \u201ccomplicit in war crimes\u201d. \u201cStarmer has got it all wrong,\u201d says veteran Labour supporter Jo Linzey on Oxford\u2019s Cowley Road. She says that Jeremy Corbyn, who once referred to Hamas as his \u201cfriends\u201d, had the right idea. She doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019ll vote Labour at the next election. By this weekend \u2013 three weeks after the Hamas attacks and three weeks since the launch of Labour\u2019s most successful conference in years, hundreds of the party\u2019s councillors and almost a quarter of its MPs have backed calls for a ceasefire, in defiance of the leadership. Across much of Europe, the war between Hamas and Israel is causing similar strains on the political left. On the Place de la R\u00e9publique in central Paris last Sunday, up to 30,000 vocal, mainly leftwing, demonstrators gathered in solidarity with the people of Palestine, waving its red, white, black and green flag and chanting \u201cGaza! Gaza! Paris stands with you.\u201d But there were some notable absentees. As some European progressives, after decades of opposition to Israeli occupation and oppression of Palestinians, hesitate to unambiguously condemn Hamas\u2019s massacre of innocent civilians, nowhere is the left more torn than in France. So while Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the veteran leader of the radical-left France Unbowed (La France Insoumise, or LFI) showed up, the heads of all the other parties in France\u2019s leftist Nupes coalition, the Socialists, Greens and Communists, very visibly did not. The announcement of the demonstration, explained Olivier Faure, the Socialist party (PS) leader, did not describe Hamas as a \u201cterrorist group\u201d, merely \u2013 in line with M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s choice of language since the Islamists\u2019 7 October attack \u2013 condemning \u201cwar crimes\u201d. LFI\u2019s initial statement on the day of the attacks adopted Hamas\u2019s description, calling them \u201can armed offensive by Palestinian forces \u2026 in the context of Israel\u2019s intensification of its policy of occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem\u201d. The refusal of M\u00e9lenchon and his team to use the T word has profoundly divided the Nupes coalition, formed to fight last year\u2019s parliamentary election: Faure\u2019s Socialists recently suspended their participation, while the French Communist Party (PCF) called for \u201ca new type of union\u201d. M\u00e9lenchon said in a blogpost it was \u201cclear the point of no return has been reached\u201d for the alliance \u2013 although the leader of LFI\u2019s parliamentary group, Mathilde Panot, has since insisted he does not want to bury it. But the 72-year-old firebrand sparked widespread further outrage last week by accusing parliament speaker, Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet, a Jewish member of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party, of \u201csetting up camp in Tel Aviv to encourage the massacre\u201d in Gaza. \u201cNot in the name of the French people!\u201d M\u00e9lenchon said on Twitter, now known as X. Braun-Pivet retorted that she was \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d by both the allegation and the choice of words, adding: \u201cThe claim that I favour massacres is once again a new target on my back.\u201d Beyond the leftwing coalition, the veteran hardliner\u2019s stance is even creating tensions within his own party, with at least two more moderate LFI MPs sharply criticising the definition of Hamas by one of their colleagues, Dani\u00e8le Obono, as \u201ca resistance movement\u201d. Jean Garrigues, a political historian, said Nupes was always a union of convenience, assembled to ensure the left won a fair share of parliamentary seats but made up of parties with major ideological differences over everything from the green transition to support for Ukraine and French secularism. \u201cLFI\u2019s strategy of conflictualising and systematically obstructing everything in parliament has also really angered its partners,\u201d Garrigues said. \u201cIt\u2019s only logical that all this has led to rows over the Hamas massacres that reveal historical contradictions between irreconcilably different leftwing traditions.\u201d Partly, Garrigues wrote in Le Monde, LFI\u2019s stance was aimed at boosting its appeal to Muslim voters. But it was \u201calso in line with the whole history of far-left support for Palestine, rooted in blind anti-Zionism\u201d \u2013 and directly opposed to the Socialist party\u2019s tradition of seeking a point of balance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has also given rise to political and diplomatic tensions in Spain, which currently holds the presidency of the EU council. The country\u2019s acting prime minister, the socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, condemned Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel as news of the atrocities emerged. \u201cWe are following the terrorist attack with great concern and we stand with the victims and their families,\u201d he said on the day of the Hamas attacks. \u201cWe vehemently condemn the terrorism and we call for an immediate end to the indiscriminate violence against the civilian population.\u201d But Israel\u2019s embassy in Madrid later accused some members of Spain\u2019s caretaker coalition government of aligning themselves \u201cwith Isis-style terrorism\u201d after three acting ministers from S\u00e1nchez\u2019s partners in the far-left Unidas Podemos alliance suggested Israel was breaking international law and committing genocide and war crimes in Gaza. The embassy did not name the ministers concerned \u2013 Ione Belarra, the Podemos leader who serves as Spain\u2019s social rights minister, her Podemos colleague, the acting equality minister Irene Montero, and the acting consumer affairs minister, Alberto Garz\u00f3n of the United Left platform. But it condemned their remarks as \u201cabsolutely immoral\u201d and suggested they would endanger the safety of Jewish communities in Spain. Spain\u2019s foreign ministry hit back with a blunt statement, accusing the embassy of \u201cspreading falsehoods\u201d and pointing out that Spanish political leaders were free to express their opinions. Enrique Santiago, general secretary of the Spanish Communist party and an MP for the leftwing Sumar alliance, which last week reached an agreement with S\u00e1nchez aimed at winning support for a new coalition government, has refused to call Hamas terrorists and insisted on the right of occupied people to self-defence. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one international law for Ukraine and another for Palestine,\u201d Santiago posted. \u201cThe right of illegally occupied people to defend themselves ends only when they achieve their independence. The international community should compel Israel to obey UN resolutions and respect Palestine.\u201d In Germany, however, with a broad cross-party political consensus around a strictly pro-Israel stance having developed in the postwar era, the conflict in the Middle East has proved less of a wedge issue for the left than in other European countries. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), was one of the first heads of government to visit Israel after the Hamas attacks. On his trip, he reasserted that the security and existence of the Israeli state was Germany\u2019s Staatsr\u00e4son or \u201creason of state\u201d, literally tied to the foundation of modern Germany. Vice-chancellor Robert Habeck, of the Green party, expressed his solidarity with Israel in an emotional video address. His party colleague Annalena Baerbock, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, actively opposed calls for the European Union to join the UN\u2019s call for a ceasefire at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, insisting on the need to fight terrorism. Europe\u2019s agonising over how to respond played out at a European summit last week at which the 27 member states in the end unanimously called for \u201chumanitarian corridors and pauses\u201d to the shelling of Gaza to allow in food, water and medical supplies. But the deal was only reached after concessions to Spain, which had wanted mention of a \u201cceasefire\u201d in the final conclusions, and after serious internal rows among the EU\u2019s top officials. Earlier Ursula von der Leyen, the German president of the European Commission, had provoked furious responses from some EU officials for expressing unconditional support for Israel. Under the Lisbon treaty, which came into force in 2009, the EU set itself new ambitions to become a force in foreign policy. But the latest events in the Middle East have tested its unity, and therefore its ability to deliver on that goal, to the limits. It may be of little consolation to Keir Starmer, but it is not as if he and Labour are alone in struggling to find a united way forward on the escalating crisis in the Middle East."

            "date": "2023-10-25T12:32:20Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak has called for pauses to the fighting in Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to safely reach those without food, water or medicine. Though he expressly avoided backing the suggestion of a total ceasefire, the British prime minister said he recognised there needed to be a \u201csafer environment\u201d for aid agencies to help Palestinians. It came as MPs discussed events in the Middle East, with one Labour backbencher accusing Israel of levying \u201ccollective punishment\u201d on civilians for \u201ccrimes they did not commit\u201d. Sunak told the Commons on Wednesday that \u201cthe first and most important principle is that Israel has the right to defend itself under international law\u201d. He said the government wanted Hamas to release hostages, help Britons leave Gaza and ensure humanitarian aid could make it to those in need. \u201cWe recognise for all of that to happen, there has to be a safer environment, which of course necessitates specific pauses \u2013 as distinct from a ceasefire,\u201d Sunak said at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday. The UK had \u201cdiscussed this with partners\u201d on Tuesday evening at the UN, he said. According to Reuters, the US has been pushing for shorter breaks in the fighting \u2013 known as specific pauses \u2013 while Russia advocated at the UN for a complete ceasefire. Sunak said Israel had suffered \u201ca shockingly brutal\u201d attack and Hamas was \u201cresponsible for this conflict\u201d, adding that the group \u201ccruelly embeds itself\u201d among civilians. An RAF flight left the UK on Wednesday morning for Egypt, carrying 21 tonnes of aid for Gaza, including more than 75,000 medical kits, solar lights, and water filters, the prime minister revealed. He added: \u201cWe will continue to do everything we can to increase the flow of aid, including fuel, into Gaza.\u201d The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, did not mention the conflict, instead using his six questions at PMQs to criticise Sunak on the first anniversary of becoming prime minister and celebrate Labour\u2019s success in last week\u2019s byelections. After the Conservative party\u2019s candidate in Tamworth posted a graphic on social media telling some families struggling to feed their children to \u201cFuck off\u201d, Starmer said Sunak should call a general election to let voters \u201creturn the compliment\u201d. Sunak avoided condemning the remarks by his party\u2019s byelection candidate, and instead insisted the government was working to support the most vulnerable in society. However, Starmer accused him of being \u201ccompletely oblivious\u201d and \u201cjust patting himself on the back\u201d, blaming the Tories for rising costs, mortgage rates and a lack of affordable new homes. The Israel-Hamas conflict was brought up by others, including the SNP\u2019s deputy Westminster leader, Mhairi Black. She called for a ceasefire, and warned: \u201cIf we ignore this, we risk pouring petrol on a fire in a place that only requires a spark to ignite.\u201d Yasmin Qureshi, a Labour frontbencher, also said people in Gaza were being \u201cmassacred\u201d as they were left without homes, food or water. \u201cThis is collective punishment of the Palestine people in Gaza for crimes they did not commit.\u201d Sunak said he welcomed the fact there was \u201cunity\u201d between the political parties\u2019 on Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. He added: \u201cWe mourn the loss of every innocent life \u2013 people of every faith, of every nationality. And we are working as hard as we can to get as much humanitarian aid into Gaza as quickly, as practically possible.\u201d No 10 later refused to be drawn on how long the pauses in fighting should be. Sunak\u2019s spokesperson would only say the government was working towards \u201ca resolution that delivers on the UK\u2019s priorities\u201d at the UN. Meanwhile, Starmer\u2019s spokesperson declined to say whether they supported Qureshi\u2019s call for a total ceasefire. They said Labour stood behind the US position of pushing for \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d. They added: \u201cWe clearly want to see more aid going in and we want to see hostages being able to come out. We want to see regular fast and safe conditions for aid going into Gaza.\u201d"

            "content": "The Pentagon is sending military advisers and sophisticated air defense systems to Israel ahead of an anticipated ground assault into Gaza by Israel\u2019s military. One of the officers leading the assistance is Marine Corps Lt Gen James Glynn, who previously helped lead special operations forces against the Islamic State and served a high-profile role during intense combat in Falluja, one of the bloodiest and most controversial centers of battle for US forces during the war in Iraq. Glynn will also be advising on how to mitigate civilian casualties during urban warfare, a US official told the Associated Press, on condition of anonymity. Israel is preparing a large-scale ground operation in an environment in which Hamas militants based in Gaza have had years to prepare tunnel networks and set traps throughout northern Gaza\u2019s dense urban blocks. Glynn and the other military officers who are advising Israel \u201chave experience that is appropriate to the sorts of operations that Israel is conducting\u201d, the national security council spokesman, John Kirby, said on Monday in a briefing at the White House. The US advisers will not be engaged in any fighting, the US official said, adding that Glynn will also be offering guidance on mitigating civilian casualties during urban warfare. The military team is one of many fast-moving pieces the Pentagon is getting in place to try to prevent the already intense conflict between Israel and Hamas from becoming a wider war. It also is trying to protect US personnel, who in the last few days have come under repeated attacks in Iraq and Syria, chiefly as a result of armed drones, that the Pentagon has said were probably endorsed by Iran. Kirby said Iran was \u201cin some cases actively facilitating these attacks and spurring on others who may want to exploit the conflict for their own good, or for that of Iran. We know that Iran\u2019s goal is to maintain some level of deniability here. But we\u2019re not going to allow them to do that.\u201d On Monday, the US military garrison at al-Tanf, Syria, came under attack again, this time by two drones. Last Thursday, the US destroyer USS Carney shot down four land-attack cruise missiles launched from Yemen that the Pentagon has said were potentially headed towards Israel. Over the weekend, the Pentagon announced it was sending multiple Patriot missile defense system battalions and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to the Middle East, as well as repositioning the US aircraft carrier Eisenhower-led strike group to the US Central Command (Centcom) area of responsibility. Florida-based Centcom has authority over US forces in the Middle East and in west and central Asia. The ship had previously been en route to the eastern Mediterranean. The shift means that the navy will have a carrier strike group off the shore of Israel \u2013 the Ford carrier strike group \u2013 and another, the Eisenhower, potentially maneuvered to defend US forces and Israel from the Red Sea or the Gulf of Oman. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to do what we need to do to protect and safeguard our forces and take all necessary measures,\u201d the official said. \u201cNo one wants to see a wider regional conflict.

            "content": "The fact that this government has inflicted 13 years of cuts to local government budgets did not feature in debates at the Conservative party conference this week, but the impact of these budget cuts has been to rip local services to shreds and to tear the heart out of many local communities. Richard Partington (As Britain\u2019s town hall services crumble, the case for reform is overwhelming, 1 October) rightly points out that the crisis extends far beyond Birmingham and the handful of local authorities facing bankruptcy. My own local authority, once proud to be among the highest performing local government authorities in England, has had nearly 45% of its budget cut since 2012, and now flounders near the bottom of the pile. Austerity is not merely a fiscal equation on a balance sheet, but something that causes pain and distress to millions of vulnerable people, and diminishes the quality of everyone\u2019s community life. The real cost of this central government butchery can be measured in the absence of social care for the elderly and the most vulnerable; the closure of children\u2019s centres, swimming pools and libraries; a deterioration in the maintenance of recreational spaces such as parks and playgrounds; and the loss of financial support for activities that support and strengthen local communities.

            "date": "2023-10-30T16:00:17Z",
            "content": "The carbon budget remaining to limit the climate crisis to 1.5C of global heating is now \u201ctiny\u201d, according to an analysis, sending a \u201cdire\u201d message about the adequacy of climate action. The carbon budget is the maximum amount of carbon emissions that can be released while restricting global temperature rise to the limits of the Paris agreement. The new figure is half the size of the budget estimated in 2020 and would be exhausted in six years at current levels of emissions. Temperature records have been obliterated in 2023, with extreme weather supercharged by global heating hitting lives and livelihoods across the world. At the imminent UN Cop28 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates there are likely to be disputes over calls for a phaseout of fossil fuels. The analysis found the carbon budget remaining for a 50% chance of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5C is about 250bn tonnes. Global emissions are expected to reach a record high this year of about 40bn tonnes. To retain the 50% chance of a 1.5C limit, emissions would have to plunge to net zero by 2034, far faster than even the most radical scenarios. The current UN ambition is to cut emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, although existing policies are far from delivering this ambition. If it was achieved, however, it would mean only about a 40% chance of staying below 1.5C, the scientists said, so breaking the limit would be more likely than not. But, they warned, every 10th of a degree of extra heat caused more human suffering and therefore keeping as close as possible to 1.5C was crucial. The new carbon budget estimate is the most recent and comprehensive analysis to date. The main reasons the budget has shrunk so markedly since 2020 are the continued high emissions from human activities and a better understanding of how reducing air pollution increases heating by blocking less sunlight. Prof Joeri Rogelj, at Imperial College London, UK, and one the study\u2019s authors, said: \u201cThe budget is so small, and the urgency of meaningful action for limiting warming is so high, [that] the message from [the carbon budget] is dire. \u201cHaving a 50% or higher likelihood that we limit warming to 1.5C is out of the window, irrespective of how much political action and policy action there is.\u201d He said it was \u201cremarkable\u201d how much risk humanity appeared willing to take with global heating. Dr Chris Smith, at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, who was also part of the study, said: \u201cGovernments can control the emissions but, at the moment, they have not done so. This is why we have an ever-shrinking carbon budget. We are not saying we only have six years to solve climate change \u2013 absolutely not. If we are able to limit warming to 1.6C or 1.7C, that\u2019s a lot better than 2C. We still need to fight for every 10th of a degree.\u201d The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, used updated data and improved climate modelling compared with other recent estimates. It also used the latest figures showing that aerosol air pollution and the clouds it was helping to seed were better at blocking sunlight and limiting heating than previously thought. As a result, lower pollution in future would mean more global heating and therefore a smaller carbon emissions budget to remain under 1.5C. The analysis also looked at the 2C upper limit in the Paris agreement, which even if met would still mean a sharp increase in climate impacts from heatwaves to floods to crop losses. For a 90% chance of keeping below 2C, emissions would have to hit net zero in about 2035, the study found. Achieving net zero in 2050 would give a 66% chance of meeting the 2C target. Ben Sanderson, at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Norway, and not part of the study, said the remaining budget for 1.5C was tiny. \u201cThe [analysis] makes for uncomfortable reading for policymakers. The budget is consistent with net zero CO2 emissions being achieved in 2034. This is vastly more ambitious than current implemented global climate policies.\u201d Dr Gabriel Abrah\u00e3o, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said: \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overshoot the 1.5C target in this decade. Thus, the public debate and the international climate negotiations should already be discussing how to return to 1.5C after an overshoot, so that [it] doesn\u2019t end up being permanent.\u201d The calculation of carbon budget involved significant uncertainties, the researchers said. Sanderson added: \u201cThis [updated carbon budget] illustrates that any calculation, no matter how rigorous, is subject to change with revised data and understanding.\u201d Dr Robin Lamboll, at Imperial College London, said future revisions that increased the carbon budget were \u201cnot very likely now\u201d. Global carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning could peak as early as this year, according to data from the International Energy Agency, meaning they could begin to fall in 2024. Lamboll said the researchers hoped to produce annual updates on the remaining carbon budgets."

            "date": "2023-10-14T06:00:34Z",
            "content": "Labour is calling for an independent investigation into the government\u2019s \u00a3370m bungle over school budgets in England, with the shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, warning of growing mistrust among school leaders towards ministers. Phillipson has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, to request an investigation by the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, to ensure the \u201cextremely concerning\u201d errors in funding for schools in England would not be repeated. \u201cHeadteachers and school staff are rightly alarmed at the news that the funding allocations published in July are incorrect, with an average primary school now expected to be over \u00a312,000 worse off next academic year and an average secondary more than \u00a357,000 down,\u201d Phillipson said in her letter to Case. \u201cThis is creating yet more stress and pressure for headteachers, affecting staffing decisions, judgments about school purchases and additional support that can be made available to pupils.\u201d One local authority, Norfolk, is said to be receiving \u00a35.6m less for its schools as a result of the revisions, while headteachers across England have had to redraw budgets and make difficult decisions for next year. Phillipson has asked for the investigation to look at whether publication of the error was held back to avoid embarrassing ministers during the Conservative party conference that week. She has asked Case to determine when the accounting hole was discovered and when Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, and those outside the DfE were first informed. \u201cComing just days after the conclusion of the Conservative party conference I hope you will be able to provide assurance that the communication of this error was not delayed by the conference,\u201d Phillipson told Case. The \u00a3370m accounting error was revealed last Friday evening in a letter from Susan Acland-Hood, the Department for Education\u2019s permanent secretary. Acland-Hood told Robin Walker, the chair of the Commons\u2019 education select committee: \u201cI would want to express my sincere apologies that this error has occurred, and reassure you that rigorous measures are being put in place to ensure that it will not be repeated.\u201d Keegan has asked Acland-Hood to hold \u201ca formal review of the quality assurance process\u201d into the calculation of the national funding formula (NFF), after the errors meant schools will receive at least \u00a345 less per primary pupil, and at least \u00a355 less for each secondary pupil in 2024-25. Phillipson said an external, independent review was necessary, telling the Guardian the funding debacle was \u201canother hammer blow to the relationship of trust between schools, families and government\u201d. \u201cThis crucial relationship is cracking dangerously under the weight of crumbling buildings, a recruitment and retention crisis and growing persistent pupil absence. \u201cLabour will make it a priority to reset and rebuild the crucial relationship between schools, families and government, drive high and rising standards in our schools and break down the barriers to opportunity,\u201d Phillipson said. The DfE said schools had not yet received their funding for 2024-25, meaning the error would not result in any clawback from their budgets. A spokesperson for the DfE said: \u201cThe NFF allocations for schools have now been updated and published. The permanent secretary has taken full responsibility for the NFF technical error. \u201cThe secretary of state [Gillian Keegan] has asked the permanent secretary to carry out an external and independent evaluation of the quality assurance process for the NFF and improvements have already been identified to ensure that similar mistakes are not repeated.\u201d Separately, the general secretaries of England\u2019s four main teaching unions have written to Keegan asking her to restore the \u00a3370m to school budgets or break the government\u2019s commitment in the House of Commons when the original figures were published. \u201cIn light of this, we call on your government to meet that commitment to invest in education, by honouring the commitments your minister made,\u201d their letter said."

            "date": "2023-10-23T07:10:38Z",
            "content": "At 4-2 heading into their game against the 5-1 Detroit Lions, the Baltimore Ravens hadn\u2019t fully taken flight. They had the league\u2019s second-best defense but were struggling to put together a consistent offense. Unfortunately for the Lions, Baltimore were clicking on both sides of the ball on Sunday, putting together a 28-0 halftime lead and eventually winning 38-6. With the victory, the AFC North leading Ravens made a case for being potential Super Bowl champions while bringing the Lions back down to earth. The key to the Ravens\u2019 offense remains Lamar Jackson, who was boosted in the offseason by the arrival of receivers Odell Beckham Jr, Nelson Agholor and first-round pick Zay Flowers. Under new offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Jackson came out flat-footed in his regular-season debut, going without a passing or rushing touchdown in a Week 1 win over the Houston Texans. He regained his rhythm with a four-touchdown game against the Cleveland Browns in Week 4 but his team had red zone struggles as recently as last week\u2019s win against the Tennessee Titans. \u201cWe just have to a better job of \u2013 like I said \u2013 scheming it, do a better job of executing it when we have those opportunities,\u201d Monken said just a few days ago, acknowledging the offense\u2019s most pressing weakness. Whatever adjustments Monken made in the last week, they provided dividends. Against the Lions\u2019 defense, the Ravens went four-for-four in the red zone in their first four drives of the game, giving their defense more than enough cushion to render the rest of the game irrelevant. Jackson was once again their not-so-secret weapon. Although he initially had a reputation as a run-first QB \u2013 there was a time when so-called experts were telling Baltimore to convert him into a running back \u2013 Jackson is nigh-unstoppable when he has his passing game going. He certainly had it against Detroit: he went 21-for-27, passing for 357 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. He also mixed things up, rushing for 36 yards and one additional touchdown. (OK, he lost a single fumble in the game but, given everything else, we\u2019ll give him a pass on that one.) Jackson\u2019s a dangerous dual threat because of his ability to break free from defensive pressure and make plays with either his arms or his legs. Of his three passing TDs, the most impressive was only possible because of his uncanny scrambling ability as he managed to keep a play alive for a mindboggling 9.24 seconds before nailing a throw to Agholor. It was the best of times for the Ravens and the worst of times for the Lions, who stumbled after being hyped as a dark horse Super Bowl contender after the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers lost their undefeated season bids last week. As soon as boosters began making the case for Detroit having the best team in the NFL their long-suffering fans immediately feared that the Football Gods were setting them up to be exposed as Paper Tigers. It turns out they were right. The good news for the now 5-2 Lions is that they are still on top of the NFC North. In fact, no other team in their division is above .500. It\u2019s not their record that is the issue, however: the problem is that the Ravens left their defense totally exposed. It\u2019s possible that no team could have beaten Baltimore on Sunday but the beatdown was the exact opposite of a \u201cmoral victory.\u201d With the loss, their upcoming game against the Las Vegas Raiders suddenly feels like a litmus test of how real the Lions actually are. MVP of the week Myles Garrett, defensive end, Cleveland Browns. Here\u2019s a confession: it\u2019s typically easier to make an offensive player MVP of the week. Defenses tend to work as a collective, making individual contributions somewhat more difficult to track. Sometimes, however, the best player on the field is clearly a defensive one. As was the case for the Cleveland Browns during their 39-38 come-from-behind win over the Indianapolis Colts. Garrett had two strip-sacks for the Browns, one of which was recovered for a touchdown, nine tackles and a blocked field goal, during which Garrett hopped over the Colts\u2019 line. Garrett essentially wrapped up this award before the first-half was over. As the final score suggests, Cleveland needed Garrett just to stay in the game. The Browns\u2019 passing game struggled under backup quarterback PJ Walker. He came on for Deshaun Watson, who threw the team\u2019s first interception of the day (the Browns later said Watson was replaced to \u201cprotect\u201d him but did not specify an injury. Watson said he\u2019s \u201cnot sure\u201d if he reinjured the shoulder that has troubled him the last few weeks. His career in Cleveland continues to be mystifying). The Colts took a 38-33 lead late in the game but two questionable penalties set up a Kareem Hunt rushing touchdown that ended up being the difference. Thanks to Garrett\u2019s dominant first half, the Browns improved their record to 4-2 while the Colts fell to 3-4. Video of the week Think being an NFL official is easy? Imagine trying to make a ruling on whether Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Jake Bobo\u2019s leaping catch was a touchdown or not. In real-time, officials thought it wasn\u2019t but after Seattle head coach Pete Carroll challenged, replay determined that Bobo (somehow) landed in-bounds. Even if there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to overturn the call on the field \u2013 and there was in this instance \u2013 this is the textbook \u201cplay so cool that it should have been ruled a catch on vibes alone.\u201d The Seahawks went on to defeat the now 1-6 Arizona Cardinals 20-10, improving their own record to 4-2. Stat of the week 50. That\u2019s the number of times the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce have connected for a touchdown over the course of their partnership, the fourth-most by any QB and TE combination. It came on National Tight Ends Day too. Besides being a famous boyfriend and notable celebrity pitchperson, Kelce may go down as the greatest to play the position. At the moment, the recently retired Rob Gronkowski probably has that status after winning Super Bowls as Tom Brady\u2019s favorite target on two different teams. Kelce, of course, is some way off as far as rings go, but given his almost supernatural connection with Mahomes, it feels like time and health could be the biggest factors in deciding whether or not the 34-year-old eventually ties Gronk for championships. Meanwhile, he just keeps doing things we haven\u2019t seen in decades. Kelce picked up more than 100 receiving yards in the first half for the second game in a row. No tight end has done that since 2000. In fact, no player at any position has done that in the last five seasons. Mahomes, Kelce and the Chiefs beat the Chargers 31-17, improving their record to an AFC-best 6-1. Elsewhere around the league -- The New England Patriots\u2019 29-25 comeback victory marked Bill Belichick\u2019s 300th regular-season win as a head coach. But it may not have even been the biggest Belichick news of the day as it accompanied reports that the 71-year-old signed a new contract with the Patriots over the offseason. If those reports turn out to be accurate, it seems like this victory will mark the end of the \u201cis this Belichick\u2019s final season\u201d speculation. As for the Bills, they\u2019ve now lost to the 2-5 Pats, the Aaron Rodgers-less New York Jets and spluttered to victory over the woeful New York Giants. An impressive win over the Miami Dolphins aside, they do not look like Super Bowl contenders at this stage of the season. -- In what could turn out to be a preview of the Super Bowl, the Philadelphia Eagles faced the Dolphins on Sunday Night Football. After a dispiriting loss to the Jets last week, the Eagles smothered the potent Miami Dolphins offense, who were limited to just 244 yards. Philly walked away 31-17 winners and have the best record in the NFC at 6-1. -- Quarterback controversy in Chicago? Justin Fields didn\u2019t start on Sunday thanks to a thumb injury. So, instead, Chicago started undrafted rookie Tyson Bagent. Bagent didn\u2019t have eye-popping numbers against the Las Vegas Raiders \u2013 he threw for just 162 yards on 21-for-29 passing and a single touchdown \u2013 but the Bears had two rushing touchdowns and another on defense. With the 30-12 win, the Bears improved their record to 2-5. -- Quarterback controversies for everybody? Sam Howell had a pretty lousy day as the Washington Commanders\u2019 starting quarterback, taking six sacks against the Giants. The Commanders had a chance to tie the game late, but the Giants defense forced a stop to secure a 14-7 victory. With the loss, Washington\u2019s record dropped to 3-4. Meanwhile, the Giants had Tyrod Taylor as signal-caller in place of Daniel Jones, who has been recovering from a neck injury and has been rather ineffective in his first season after signing a $160m contract over the offseason. Taylor threw for 279 yards and two touchdowns as New York secured their second victory of the season, ending a four-game losing streak. -- The Denver Broncos defeated the Green Bay Packers 19-17. Considering that the Broncos are 2-5 and the Packers 2-4, this game may not end up having any significance on the postseason standings. Why mention it here? Well, it\u2019s entirely because of wide receiver Jayden Reed managing to catch a deflected Jordan Love pass for a touchdown while tumbling down in the end zone. If it weren\u2019t for Bobo\u2019s grab, this would have been the video of the week and it\u2019s proof that in the NFL, even a relatively meaningless contest can provide memorable moments. -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense made life difficult for Atlanta Falcons quarterback Desmond Ridder who lost three fumbles on the day. The most glaring was when Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 Antoine Winfield Jr knocked the ball out of Ridder\u2019s hands, turning a possible touchdown into a touchback. With Ridder contributing just a single rushing touchdown, Atlanta needed someone to step up and be a hero. That someone turned out to be kicker Younghoe Koo who went 3-for-3 on field goals, including a 51-yarder with time expiring that secured a 16-13 Falcons victory and put them top of the NFC South."

            "date": "2023-10-13T14:00:16Z",
            "content": "Plumes of toxic PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d flowing from at least 245 US military bases are contaminating or threatening to pollute drinking water for nearby communities, and hundreds more are likely at risk across America, a new Department of Defense report finds. The number of communities threatened by the military\u2019s pollution is likely to increase as further more investigations are carried out. The defense department has only looked at about one-third of more than 700 facilities suspected of having contaminated the ground with PFAS. While the report acknowledges the pollution, it does not clarify which drinking water sources are polluted, how high PFAS levels are in the polluted water systems, or provide information about the plumes\u2019 locations. The sheer number of bases and the lack of clarity is \u201cshocking\u201d, said Scott Faber, the vice-president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group non-profit, which tracks military PFAS pollution. \u201cA good neighbor would let you know that their use of PFAS was the reason your water was contaminated, and a bad neighbor would only tell you: \u2018Hey, a plume is heading in your direction,\u2019\u201d Faber said. The defense department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because most do not degrade in the environment. The military is considered one of the largest PFAS polluters in the world, largely due to its use of firefighting foam laced with the chemicals discharged during emergencies or training exercises. Some of the highest levels of PFAS in groundwater ever detected have been found around bases. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s advisory health guidelines state that less than one part per trillion (ppt) in drinking water is safe, while levels found around military bases have exceeded 2.25m ppt. Congress in recent years has included in Defense Authorization Acts requirements for the military to begin investigating PFAS pollution in and around its facilities. The defense department has so far confirmed PFAS contamination at 455 bases, it wrote in the new report, and of that group it has confirmed that 275 out of 295 checked, or about 90%, have plumes \u201cin the proximity\u201d of drinking water supplies. The report does not clarify what \u201cin the proximity\u201d means and does not specify which types of drinking water supplies are threatened. Though it provides a list of bases, public drinking water systems can draw from surface water or community wells, and it is unclear how the plumes may be impacting those pulling water from private wells. \u201cThat is what we know so far because that\u2019s all the DoD told us, and it took an act of Congress to get that much information,\u201d Faber said. Though the report does not provide clarity on which communities are drinking contaminated water, the defense department in August issued a separate report revealing that it is now providing clean drinking water to 53 communities. The military currently only provides clean drinking water for communities with levels of PFOA and PFOS, two kinds of PFAS compounds, above 70 ppt. The EPA is proposing lowering the legal limit to 4 ppt. If it does, as expected, the defense department will likely be forced to provide drinking water to most, if not all, communities around facilities where there is PFAS contamination. Even as the military uncovers more PFAS pollution in and around its sites, the amount of spending on remediation of all pollution at its bases is dropping. \u201cCommunities around the facilities must be really frustrated because they in all likelihood are drinking from wells that are contaminated by the military, but the DoD is coming up short,\u201d Faber said. \u201cInevitably we will get answers for these questions as we move through the process.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-09T13:40:34Z",
            "content": "The Republican senator Tommy Tuberville has said he will continue to block hundreds of military leadership appointments despite the Hamas attack on Israel, a close American ally, that has triggered a deadly escalation in the Middle East conflict. Tuberville has for several months put a hold on at least 300 military nominees, which are typically confirmed in a routine manner by the US Senate. His blockade is a protest over a Pentagon policy that facilitates abortions for service members and dependents. Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach turned Alabama senator, has indicated he will maintain the blockade even in the wake of the assault on Israel, in which at least 700 mostly civilians are thought to have died, including several hundred revelers killed at a music festival, while dozens more people are believed to have been taken hostage. Israel has responded with airstrikes on the Gaza Strip that authorities in the penned-in territory say has killed at least 493 Palestinian people, including entire families sheltering in their apartments. US military appointments currently in limbo include top officers slated to command American forces in the Middle East, and two picks for the joint chiefs of staff. Separately, the US also does not have an ambassador to Israel, its close ally. Democrats have called for a swift confirmation of the nominee, Jack Lew. The US Senate\u2019s foreign relations committee on Monday scheduled a hearing to discuss Lew\u2019s nomination on the morning of 18 October. Joe Biden has previously called Tuberville\u2019s stance \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d, and the president accused him of undermining the strength and capabilities of the US military. But the Alabama senator said on Sunday that even the attack on Israel would not shift his position. \u201cThe Pentagon clearly thinks forcing taxpayers to facilitate abortion is more important than confirming their top nominees without a vote,\u201d a Tuberville spokesperson told NBC. \u201cThey could end this situation today by dropping their illegal and immoral policy and get everyone confirmed rapidly, but they refuse.\u201d Invoking a name Tuberville calls himself because of his prior job, the spokesperson added: \u201cIf the Biden administration wants their nominees confirmed then Senate Democrats can do what Coach just did in September and file a cloture petition to force a vote.\u201d Military nominees are usually bundled together and confirmed by a voice vote in the Senate to speed along appointments, but under Senate rules a single senator can hold up this process. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader, has said that individual votes on each of the nominees would eat up a huge amount of time, and urged Republicans to get Tuberville \u201cin line\u201d. Tuberville objects to a Pentagon policy that does not itself perform abortions but provides time off and travel assistance to members of the military that require reproductive healthcare. The US secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, has said that the policy safeguards the healthcare and combat readiness of service members and is widely popular within the military. Abortion has been effectively banned in several states following the US supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v Wade last year \u2013 a move decried by progressives but lauded by conservatives like Tuberville. \u201cThe severity of the crisis in Israel underscores the foolishness of Senator Tuberville\u2019s blockade,\u201d said Jack Reed, a Democrat who leads the Senate armed services committee. \u201cThe United States needs seamless military leadership in place to handle dangerous situations like this and Senator Tuberville is denying it. This is no time for petty political theater, and I again urge Republican colleagues to help actively end Senator Tuberville\u2019s damaging blockade.\u201d"

            "content": "A former Bolivian president and his defence minister have agreed to pay damages to the families of people killed by the military during their government, in a landmark settlement that sets a precedent by which other foreign leaders could face accountability for human rights abuse in US courts. The settlement concerns events in 2003, when massive protests broke out over then president Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada\u2019s plan to export Bolivia\u2019s natural gas. The army was sent to clear blockades in the largely Indigenous and working-class city of El Alto, killing more than 60 protesters and injuring hundreds. Both S\u00e1nchez de Lozada and his defence minister, Jos\u00e9 Carlos S\u00e1nchez Berzain, resigned and fled to the US, where they have lived ever since. In 2007, a civil lawsuit was brought against them in the US by eight Bolivian families whose relations were killed in 2003. Eleven years later, a federal jury found them responsible for the killings and awarded the plaintiffs $10m in compensatory damages. Both defendants appealed, but as a result of the agreement on Thursday, they have withdrawn their appeal and agreed to pay an undisclosed sum in compensatory damages to the families. \u201cWith this agreement, the jury verdict remains intact,\u201d said Thomas Becker, the human rights lawyer who led the legal action. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the most important part: to send this message that no leader can kill their people and then use the US as a refuge.\u201d S\u00e1nchez de Lozada had close connections to the US: the son of an exiled diplomat, he was raised and educated in the Washington DC area. He later made his fortune through various oil and mining ventures and twice became president of Bolivia. Under subsequent administrations, Bolivia\u2019s supreme court indicted the former president and requested his extradition to Bolivia, but the requests were not accepted by the US. Asl\u0131 B\u00e2li, a law professor at Yale Law School who was not involved in the case, agreed that it set an important precedent. \u201cWhen someone this high-profile is held accountable, it sends a message,\u201d said B\u00e2li. \u201cFirst, to human rights violators, that the US will not be a safe haven, and no one is above the law. But also to victims and survivors, in Bolivia and around the world, that there are more avenues for accountability than they might realise.\u201d The case was brought under the Torture Victim Protection Act, a law that expanded US jurisdiction to cases of torture or extrajudicial killings committed outside its territory. It is, according to B\u00e2li, the most promising away to bring human rights accountability cases like this to court in the US. Such cases are few and far between because of their complexity, and the time and resources required to see them through. \u201cWith a high-profile victory like this one, we might now have more funding and resources become available to support the kinds of public interest organisations that bring these cases,\u201d said B\u00e2li. \u201cI think there is a good chance we will see more cases like this,\u201d she added."

            "content": "Jonathan Freedland tells us that \u201cIsrael\u2019s war should be with Hamas alone, not the people of Gaza\u201d (Warning: Benjamin Netanyahu is walking right into Hamas\u2019s trap, 20 October). So how is it going to do that? How do you tell Hamas militants from non-combatants? How do you know Hamas military locations from civilian buildings? The answer is that you can\u2019t. A terrorist organisation is made up of civilians who wish to fight, and they can move between being combatants and civilians at will. The locations used by terrorists can change all the time. Thus a state waging a war against a terrorist organisation can never win using military means alone. This applies as much to Israel as to the British in Northern Ireland or the Americans and British in Afghanistan. The only solution to the Middle East has to be a political one. Otherwise, Israel will just continue this indefinite war. Yoav Tzabar Edinburgh \u2022 Like Jonathan Freedland, I dread the possible Israeli invasion of Gaza. However, in 2005, when Israel ended its occupation of Gaza, the Palestinians elected Hamas, whose charter called for the destruction of Israel and its replacement by an Islamic state, something that could only be realised by the killing or expulsion of all Israel\u2019s Jews. The events of 7/10 highlight the reality that those aims are still paramount. Mr Freedland writes that Israel\u2019s mission \u201cshould be clear: to ensure that Hamas is stripped of the capacity ever to repeat what it did two weeks ago\u201d. But if, like me he doesn\u2019t want an invasion, how does he suggest that Israel completes that mission? Paul Miller London \u2022 I wish and hope that people all over the world read Jonathan Freedland\u2019s pure logic and humanity. Hamas is an enemy that goads and manipulates through unimaginable violence, torture and terror. Hamas loves to recruit the Israeli armed forces to its cause \u2013 to make Gazans suffer so much that their hate of Israel makes them, in turn, recruits for Hamas. All the while Iran, the greatest threat to peace in the region, grows stronger. Most Arab nations in the region want a compromise peace. They would all accept Israel executing a long-term, effective evisceration of Hamas if it did not entail the collateral suffering of Palestinian civilians. Historically, Israel has been very successful in conducting such campaigns. Name and address supplied \u2022 It is heartening to hear from Jonathan Freedland\u2019s article that there is a general consensus in Israel that Netanyahu\u2019s grip is failing. A new leader is needed who can bring a different dialogue. This is a sectarian conflict, which we in Britain have experience of. Northern Ireland\u2019s Catholics had reason to be angry with their fellow countrymen. They were treated as second-class citizens in their own country. Jews and Arabs have lived side by side happily before in this land and can again, but only when they are treated equally by the state. Nicola Rosen London \u2022 Can we put Jonathan Freedland in charge of the world, please? He makes so much sense out of so much chaos. Some \u201cworld leaders\u201d would benefit from his wisdom, if they could just pause for breath and listen to people outside their own dangerous echo chambers for a moment.

            "date": "2023-10-24T03:21:19Z",
            "content": "This blog is closing now, thanks for joining us. You can follow the Guardian\u2019s new live news blog on the Israel-Hamas conflict here. Israeli chief of staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi issued a statement late on Monday suggesting that Israel had no intention of curbing its strikes on the densely populated Gaza Strip and hinting that it was well prepared for a ground assault. \u201cWe want to bring Hamas to a state of full dismantling,\u201d Halevi said. \u201cThe path is a path of unrelenting attacks, damaging Hamas everywhere and in every way.\u2019 \u201cWe are well prepared for the ground operations in the south,\u201d he added, referring to southern Israel, which borders Gaza. \u201cTroops who have more time are better prepared, and that is what we are doing now.\u201d Heres a bit more from the director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza, Thomas White, who told the BBC that a shortage of shelter, food and drinking water in the south of Gaza had forced some residents to return to their homes in the north. \u201cPeople have left everything in the north \u2026 they\u2019ve come to the south where they are struggling to find shelter, food is scarce, many people are having to drink unpotable water, so the situation in the south is dire,\u201d White told the BBC. Israel delivered sweeping evacuation orders for almost half of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people on 13 October. The UN estimates that almost two-thirds of Gaza\u2019s population have been displaced over the last two weeks. The US has said now is not the time for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as the UN reports that some Palestinians who fled their homes in the north of Gaza have returned due to a lack of food and shelter in the south. On Monday, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told CNN that Israel still had \u201cwork to do to go after Hamas leadership\u201d, echoing comments from the US president, Joe Biden, that any discussions of a ceasefire could only take place if Hamas freed all its hostages in Gaza. The statement from the White House was at odds with comments from UN and EU officials who on Monday called for a humanitarian pause in fighting so that aid could be delivered into Gaza. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza, Thomas White, told the BBC on Monday that a shortage of shelter, food and drinking water in the south had forced some residents to return to their homes in the north. Here\u2019s our full report: President Joe Biden \u201cunderscored the need to sustain a continuous flow of urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza\u201d in a phone call with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House has said. The US leader also updated Netanyahu on US support for Israel and \u201congoing efforts at regional deterrence, to include new US military deployments\u201d, the statement said. The White House also said the president had welcomed the release of two hostages from Gaza and reaffirmed his commitment to securing the release of the remaining hostages as well as safe passage for US citizens and other civilians in Gaza. Here are some of the most recent images coming to us from Gaza: Israel would not allow fuel into Gaza even if all hostages are released, Mark Regev, a senior advisor to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has told CNN. He said: At the moment we have no interest in more fuel going to the Hamas military machine and we have not authorized fuel, we have authorized medicine, we have authorized water. We\u2019ve authorized foodstuffs, we\u2019ve not authorized anything else. Asked if Israel would allow fuel to enter Gaza if all hostages were released, Regev said Israel\u2019s position would not change. The government decision is that fuel doesn\u2019t go in because it will be stolen by Hamas and it\u2019ll be used by them to power rockets that are fired into Israel to kill our people. Israel will not delay a possible ground invasion of Gaza over concerns for the more than 200 hostages being held there by Hamas, the country\u2019s energy minister has told German tabloid Bild. Israel Katz, who had previously insisted that not an \u201celectrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter\u201d Gaza, until the hostages were freed, told the paper: We are doing everything we can and working with every interlocuter we can to bring those kidnapped home\u2026 But that cannot prevent our other actions, including the ground invasion, if we decide to do it, because that\u2019s what Hamas wants. Huge billboards depicting leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah looking beaten and bound as Israeli soldiers stand over them, line the main thoroughfares in the coastal city of Tel Aviv. The words: \u201cWe love you, we trust you,\u201d directed at the Israeli army and: \u201cNever again,\u201d are printed big and bold. The graphic AI-generated imagery has elicited different responses from the Israeli public; some find the campaign repugnant, many others have welcomed it. Ofer Rosenbaum, 36, whose PR work has had previous brushes with controversy, is behind the provocative campaign launched last week that he hopes will help restore trust in Israel\u2019s security forces. Observing a billboard from across the highway, retired accountant Simona Yaloz, 65, said she was disgusted by the image. \u201cI hate it, really, it\u2019s not the Israeli attitude,\u201d Yaloz said. \u201cThis is very extreme, it\u2019s too violent. There are extreme people here but we\u2019re trying to avoid it.\u201d Fashion designer Shiran, who only gave one name, said she and her husband were supportive of the billboard campaign. \u201cWe both smiled when we saw it. I think we\u2019ve been too kind and too nice for too long. We\u2019ve let people outside of Israel tell us what we can and can\u2019t do,\u201d said the 30-year-old. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte was in Israel on Monday, as international leaders continued diplomacy aimed at showing solidarity with Israel while also calling for restraint in its response to Hamas\u2019 7 October attack. It was of \u201cexistential importance for Israel to remove the Hamas threat,\u201d Rutte said in a statement after meeting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. But he added that the aid arriving in Gaza was \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d and that \u201ccivilian casualties and regional escalation must be prevented\u201d. This requires restraint from Israel when it comes to the use of force. He also called for a return to talks on a two-state solution: Though it may seem far away, peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians is only possible if prospects for a Palestinian state, alongside a secure Israel, are renewed. The Pentagon is sending military advisers and sophisticated air defense systems to Israel ahead of an anticipated ground assault into Gaza by Israel\u2019s military. One of the officers leading the assistance is Marine Corps Lt Gen James Glynn, who previously helped lead special operations forces against the Islamic State and served a high-profile role during intense combat in Falluja, one of the bloodiest and most controversial centers of battle for US forces during the war in Iraq. Glynn will also be advising on how to mitigate civilian casualties during urban warfare, a US official told the Associated Press, on condition of anonymity. Glynn and the other military officers who are advising Israel \u201chave experience that is appropriate to the sorts of operations that Israel is conducting\u201d, the national security council spokesman, John Kirby, said on Monday in a briefing at the White House. The Israeli military has confirmed Palestinian reports of an airstrike on a refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to Reuters. The Israeli airstrike targeted a staging ground for Hamas in Al-Shati refugee camp, a military spokesperson said without providing any further details. Palestinian media have reported that five people were killed while a spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry has said children and women were among the casualties. Washington is concerned that Israel lacks achievable military objectives in Gaza and does not yet have a workable plan for a ground invasion, the New York Times has reported, citing senior officials in the Biden administration. Defense secretary Lloyd J Austin has stressed the need for careful consideration of how a ground invasion would be conducted in conversations with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant, the paper wrote. It added that Biden officials still insist they support an invasion and that they are not telling Israel what to do. However the NYT also said that in conversations with Israeli officials about prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s aim of eradicating Hamas, the Americans had not yet seen an achievable plan of action and there were concerns that a ground operation could be extremely bloody for civilians as well as troops. \u201cThe first thing that everyone should know, and I think everyone does know, is that urban combat is extremely difficult,\u201d Austin told ABC News\u2019s This Week on Sunday. There was no immediate Israeli response to the report but a diplomat from the Israeli Embassy denied that the US government was advising the Israelis to delay the ground invasion, as the paper reported on Sunday. Here\u2019s a bit more from Obama\u2019s statement on the Israel-Hamas conflict, in which he said that it is important that \u201cIsrael\u2019s military strategy abides by international law, including those laws that seek to avoid, to every extent possible, the death or suffering of civilian populations\u201d. He wrote: Upholding these values is important for its own sake \u2013 because it is morally just and reflects our belief in the inherent value of every human life. Upholding these values is also vital for building alliances and shaping international opinion \u2013 all of which are critical for Israel\u2019s long-term security. He noted that this presented an \u201cenormously difficult task\u201d, one at which the US \u201chad at times fallen short of\u201d. And after an attack that evoked \u201csome of the darkest memories of persecution against the Jewish people\u201d, Israeli citizens were understandably demanding their government do \u201cwhatever it takes to root out Hamas and make sure such attacks never happen again\u201d, he said. However, he continued: In dealing with what is an extraordinarily complex situation where so many people are in pain and passions are understandably running high, all of us need to do our best to put our best values, rather than our worst fears, on display. That meant opposing anti-semitism and \u201cefforts to minimize the terrible tragedy that the Israeli people have just endured as well as the morally-bankrupt suggestion that any cause can somehow justify the deliberate slaughter of innocent people\u201d. It also meant rejecting anti-Muslim, anti-Arab or anti-Palestinian sentiment, he said. It means refusing to lump all Palestinians with Hamas or other terrorist groups. It means guarding against dehumanizing language towards the people of Gaza, or downplaying Palestinian suffering - whether in Gaza or the West Bank \u2013 as irrelevant or illegitimate. Israel\u2019s siege and bombardment of Gaza following the Hamas attack of 7 October risks backfiring and ultimately undermining long term efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region, Barack Obama has said. \u201cEven as we support Israel, we should also be clear that how Israel prosecutes this fight against Hamas matters,\u201d the former US president said in a statement that also emphasised Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend its citizens against such wanton violence\u201d. He continued: The world is watching closely as events in the region unfold, and any Israeli military strategy that ignores the human costs could ultimately backfire. Thousands of Palestinians, including many children, had already been killed by Israeli strikes on Gaza, while hundreds of thousands had been forced from their homes, Obama wrote. The Israeli government\u2019s decision to cut off food, water and electricity to a captive civilian population threatens not only to worsen a growing humanitarian crisis; it could further harden Palestinian attitudes for generations, erode global support for Israel, play into the hands of Israel\u2019s enemies, and undermine long term efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has said Beijing is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the escalating war between Israel and Hamas and called on Israel to respect humanitarian law in a phone call with his Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen, Chinese state media has reported. All countries have a right to self-defence but China condemns all acts that harm civilians and opposes any violation of the international law, Wang said, according to Xinhua. The conflict affects the whole world, he added, and \u201cinvolves a major choice between war and peace\u201d. Xinhua wrote that he stressed: The painful lesson of the repeated cycle of Palestinian-Israeli conflict fully demonstrates: only adhering to the concept of common security can help achieve sustainable security, and only adhering to the direction of political settlement can facilitate the thorough resolution of Israel\u2019s legitimate security concerns. The two-state solution is the consensus of the international community. Wang said he hoped both sides could consider \u201c long-term interests of peace and security shared by future generations\u201d and that they would resume peace talks. Israel struck a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip late on Monday, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, Reuters has reported. The Israeli military did not immediately provide comment. In a statement on Facebook, health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qudra said the Israeli bombardment targeted Gaza\u2019s Al-Shati camp, which abuts the Mediterranean coastline. Palestinian media reported that five people were killed in the camp. Reuters could not immediately confirm the reports. The wires have sent through some pictures of the hostages newly released by Hamas: I\u2019m Helen Livingstone, taking over from my colleague Richard Luscombe. It\u2019s 2am Tuesday in Gaza and Tel Aviv, midnight in London, and 7pm Monday in Washington DC. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been following: Hamas released two hostages from those it\u2019s holding in Gaza. The group named them as Israeli women Nurit Yitzhak (also known as Nurit Cooper), 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, and said they were released on \u201chumanitarian and poor health grounds\u201d. The women were transported by the Red Cross to Gaza\u2019s Rafah border crossing with Israel, then taken for medical care and a reunion with their families. Earlier, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said it believed Hamas was still holding 222 hostages in Gaza. The United Nations warned of an increasingly dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with small amounts of food, water, medicines but not fuel being delivered in a convoy of 20 trucks on Monday. Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, has called for an \u201cimmediate humanitarian ceasefire\u201d for more aid to be sent in. The UN, meanwhile, says only two days of fuel are left for its agency assisting Palestinians, and that water desalination and electricity generating plants will cease to function, affecting hospitals and other critical services. The White House, however, says the \u201ctime is not right\u201d for a ceasefire. John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, told CNN the US position was that all hostages held by Hamas in Gaza must be released first. \u201cThe message was pretty clear to Hamas: \u2018release all the hostages\u2019. That needs to be the first move here. We\u2019re not talking about a ceasefire right now. In fact, we don\u2019t believe that this is the time for a ceasefire,\u201d he said. Kirby also said Iran was behind attacks by proxy on US troops in the Middle East after a barrage of drone and missile attacks over the weekend. At a media briefing, he said the US was ramping up its military capabilities in the Middle East and warned Iran or other nations seeking to use the conflict as an excuse to attack US interests: \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d Reports from Israel suggested that the release of about 50 hostages held by Hamas could be imminent. The Tel Aviv news channel I24 reported \u201csources within Gaza\u201d as saying \u201cthe finalization of a potential deal\u201d brokered by Qatari was under way for the release of about 50 abductees who hold dual citizenship. Officials of Red Cross were believed to on their way to receive the group, I24 said, and the release could be concluded \u201cin the hours ahead\u201d if there were no obstacles. But there was no further news by Monday night. Almost 20,000 people have been internally displaced in south Lebanon and elsewhere since early October, a United Nations agency said, reflecting escalating violence on the Lebanese-Israeli border. The UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said 19,646 people had been displaced inside Lebanon since it began tracking movements on 8 October, the day after the assault on Israel by Hamas militants, the AFP news agency reported. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said at least 5,087 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since 7 October. It said the dead included 2,055 children. Additionally, it said 15,273 people had been wounded. The ministry put the death toll in the past 24 hours at 436, including 182 children. It said most of the fatalities had occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, to where Israel\u2019s military has ordered Palestinians to evacuate. The claims have not been independently verified. Israel\u2019s military said that ground forces mounted limited raids into the Gaza Strip overnight to fight Palestinian gunmen, and that airstrikes were being focused on sites where Hamas was assembling to attack any wider Israeli invasion. The IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: \u201cDuring the night there were raids by tank and infantry forces. These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for our next stage in the war. These are raids that go deep.\u201d The leaders of the US, UK, France, Canada, Germany and Italy called on Israel to adhere to international law and protect civilians, while reiterating Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terrorism. In a statement, the leaders\u2019 offices said: \u201cThe leaders reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, for his country\u2019s support as the latter visited Tel Aviv. Israel\u2019s prime minister said of the conflict: \u201cIt\u2019s a battle against civilization. It\u2019s civilization against barbarism. We\u2019re on the side of civilization. We have to unite, all together, against Hamas, which is Isis.\u201d A Palestinian photojournalist, Roshdi Sarraj, was killed in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Radio France reported. The French broadcaster said Sarraj was killed on Sunday in Israeli strikes on Tel al-Hawa, in Gaza City. His wife and one-year-old daughter were injured. Turkey sent two cargo planes to Egypt on Monday carrying further medical equipment and supplies for Gaza, the health minister Fahrettin Koca said. He said two more aircraft would be sent with more supplies. A 33-year-old Dutch woman was killed in an explosion in Gaza, the Dutch foreign ministry said. Named locally as Islam al-Ashqar, she was visiting relatives at the Nusairat refugee camp in central Gaza and was one of 22 Dutch nationals that the ministry was trying to help leave, the broadcaster NOS said. A coalition of six human rights groups has petitioned Israel\u2019s high court for the release of \u201cthousands\u201d of Palestinian workers from Gaza it says are being held illegally and without charge in detention centers. They asked the court on Monday to instruct the Israeli military, prison service and police to \u201cdisclose the names and whereabouts of all Gaza residents being held in Israeli detention centers and release any persons unlawfully detained to the West Bank until they are able to return to Gaza\u201d. The groups say that Israel started detaining an unknown number of about 18,500 Palestinian residents of Gaza who hold work permits issued by the Israeli authorities. How many were in Israel when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, or immediately thereafter, is unknown. On 10 October, the Israeli government revoked all the permits, instantly turning Palestinians who had lawfully present in Israel into illegal aliens, say the groups. The Biden administration does not believe the time is right for a ceasefire in Gaza, a senior official said on Monday evening. Speaking to CNN, John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, said the US position was that all hostages held by Hamas in Gaza must be released first. His words echoed comments from Joe Biden earlier on Monday that \u201cwe should have those hostages released and then we can talk\u201d. Kirby said: I thought the message was pretty clear to Hamas: \u2018release all the hostages\u2019. That needs to be the first move here. We\u2019re not talking about a ceasefire right now. In fact, we don\u2019t believe that this is the time for a ceasefire. Israel has a right to defend themselves. They still have work to do to go after Hamas leadership. We\u2019re gonna keep supporting them \u2026 our focus is on making sure that they have what they need to carry on this fight. China\u2019s top foreign minister Wang Yi will visit Washington DC later this week, and will meet US secretary of state Antony Blinken, Reuters reports. The rare three-day visit to the US by a senior Chinese diplomat, from 26 to 28 October, will include discussions about the Israel-Hamas conflict, the news agency said. The United Nations says a third convoy of humanitarian aid, consisting of 20 trucks, delivered water, food and medicine to Gaza on Monday, but warned that fuel was not included and reserves will run out within the next two days. Humanitarian deliveries through the Rafah crossing from Egypt began on Saturday. According to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, cited by Reuters, 54 trucks have entered in the three days since then. UN officials have said about 100 aid trucks would be needed daily to meet essential needs in Gaza, home to 2.3 million people, some 1.4 million of which are now homeless. Wrangles over procedures for inspecting the aid, and ongoing aerial attacks in Gaza, left the aid stuck in Egypt. Joe Biden received an update on the situation during a briefing at the White House on Monday afternoon. The US president, who has submitted a $106bn request to Congress including humanitarian aid for Ukraine and Gaza, tweeted his government\u2019s commitment to sending humanitarian relief. \u201cThe United States remains committed to ensuring that civilians in Gaza will continue to have access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance, without diversion by Hamas,\u201d Biden said. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, meanwhile, has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to allow more aid in. No fuel will mean water desalination and energy generating plants cannot function, and hospitals and other essential services will be without power, the UN said. Dujarric said the UN was pushing for fuel deliveries that were essential to its agency providing aid to Palestinians in Gaza. \u201cThey can see the bottom of the fuel tank. We\u2019re talking days. And when that happens, that will be truly devastating, on top of what is already a devastating humanitarian situation,\u201d he said. Two Israeli women released in Gaza by Hamas earlier on Monday are in the care of the Israeli military and on their way to a medical facility in Israel, the office of Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. Nurit Cooper (also known as Nurit Yitzhak), 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, were kidnapped along with their husbands from kibbutz Nir Oz, near the Gaza border, on 7 October. Their husbands are still being held by Hamas. Harrowing footage of killings and mutilations during Hamas\u2019s rampage in southern Israel earlier this month was shown to journalists by Israeli authorities earlier on Monday. The 43-minute compilation was screened privately at a military base in Tel Aviv to hundreds of international reporters, many of whom were visibly shaken by what they saw. Its purpose, Israel officials said, was to counter what it saw as a growing denial of Hamas atrocities. This is a report by the Guardian\u2019s Rory Carroll. It contains accounts of a number of distressing incidents: Volker T\u00fcrk, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, called on Monday for an \u201cimmediate humanitarian ceasefire\u201d in Gaza. In a statement, he said \u201cfar too many civilian lives, many of them children, have already been lost\u201d: The first step must be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, saving the lives of civilians through the delivery of prompt and effective humanitarian aid. This violence will never end unless leaders stand up and take the brave and humane choices that are required by fundamental humanity. Israel has launched repeated airstrikes against Hamas in Gaza in response to its attack on the country that killed more than 1,400 earlier this month and appears to be preparing a massive ground invasion. Palestinian authorities have said more than 5,000 civilians have been killed from the Israeli bombardment, while the international community remains divided over halting the fighting to facilitate an infusion of aid. T\u00fcrk\u2019s statement continued: Far too many civilian lives, many of them children, have already been lost \u2013 on both sides \u2013 as a consequence of these hostilities. And unless something changes, coming days will see more civilians on the brink of death from continuing bombardment. Joe Biden\u2019s earlier abrupt departure from an economic policy speech to urgently head for the White House situation room was entirely innocuous, it seems. There was speculation the US president was called away to deal with a rapidly developing issue, possibly connected to the release Monday of hostages held captive by Hamas in Gaza. Not so, it seems: Here\u2019s our video of Rishi Sunak addressing the House of Commons earlier today. The prime minister said UK intelligence had concluded that a deadly blast at al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza was caused by a rocket fired by a Palestinian militant group, and he announced a further \u00a320m in aid to Gaza. Here\u2019s the statement from the Lifschitz family following the release of Yocheved Lifschitz, one of two Israeli women hostages freed by Hamas on Monday: We can confirm that Yocheved Lifshitz, mother of British citizen Sharone Lifschitz, and Nurit Cooper, were released from Hamas captivity in Gaza. They were handed over to the Red Cross at the Rafah crossing a short time ago, from there they will be transferred shortly to Israel. The families have been informed. Sharone Lifschitz, who lives in London, said: I can confirm that my mother Yochi (Yocheved) Lifschitz was one of two hostages released to the Red Cross this evening. While I cannot put into words the relief that she is now safe, I will remain focused on securing the release of my father and all those \u2013 some 200 innocent people \u2013 who remain hostages in Gaza. Oded Lifschitz, husband of Yochved, and Sharone\u2019s father, is a veteran Israeli journalist and peace activist who was captured by Hamas with his wife. Their daughter spoke with the Guardian about their situation earlier this month, and has met UK prime minister Rishi Sunak and opposition leader Keir Starmer in recent days to seek their help facilitating her parents\u2019 release. Another elderly hostage with UK links is Ada Sagi, a woman in her 80s whose dual-national son Noam has also spoken with government officials.

Shortly after two hostages were released in Gaza, Joe Biden quickly left an event as he was needed in the White House\u2019s Situation room. At the end of an event to promote his economic policy, Biden abruptly left, telling the audience that he had to leave the event and go to the Situation room. While not confirmed, the meeting in the Situation room is likely about the hostages\u2019 release. During the same event, Biden was asked about the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza. In response, he said: \u201cWe should have those hostages released and then we can talk.\u201d From Bloomberg News\u2019 Jennifer Jacobs: The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that they helped facilitate the release of two hostages held by Hamas, in a new post to X. In the statement posted online, ICRC confirmed that they transported the two hostages out of Gaza Monday evening. \u201cOur role as a neutral intermediary makes this work possible &amp; we are ready to facilitate any future release,\u201d the ICRC post read. \u201cWe hope that they will soon be back with their loved ones.\u201d At least 35 employees with the United Nations\u2019 Agency for Palestine Refugees have been confirmed killed in violence during the Israel-Hamas conflict, the agency reported on Monday. Six staff were killed in Gaza since Saturday, according to a statement posted Monday to X, previously known as Twitter. At least half of those killed were teachers. An agency school in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, was struck and severely damaged on Saturday, with the death toll unknown. The agency added that 40 installations have also been damaged amid the outbreak of fighting. It\u2019s just after 10pm in Gaza and Tel Aviv, and here are the developments we\u2019ve been following today in the Israel-Hamas conflict: Hamas says it has released two more hostages from those it\u2019s holding in Gaza. The group named them as Nurit Yitzhak and Yochved Lifschitz, and said they were release on \u201chumanitarian and poor health grounds\u201d. There is no independent confirmation of their release yet, and their whereabouts are currently unknown. Hamas released American mother and daughter Judith and Natalia Raanan on Friday. Earlier today, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said it believed Hamas was still holding 222 hostages in Gaza. Reports from Israel suggested that the release of about 50 hostages held by Hamas could be imminent. The Tel Aviv news channel I24 reported \u201csources within Gaza\u201d as saying \u201cthe finalization of a potential deal\u201d brokered by Qatari was under way for the release of about 50 abductees who hold dual citizenship. Officials of Red Cross are believed to on their way to receive the group, I24 said, and the release could be concluded \u201cin the hours ahead\u201d if there are no obstacles. The White House said Iran is behind attacks by proxy on US troops in the Middle East after a barrage of drone and missile attacks over the weekend. At a media briefing on Monday, John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council said the US was ramping up its military capabilities in the Middle East and warned Iran or other nations seeking to use the conflict as an excuse to attack US interests: \u201cDon\u2019t do it\u201d.

The IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: \u201cDuring the night there were raids by tank and infantry forces. These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for our next stage in the war. These are raids that go deep.\u201d Washington has advised Israel to delay its expected ground invasion of Gaza in order to buy time to negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas and allow more aid in to Palestinian civilians, the New York Times reported, citing US officials. A third convoy of aid trucks entered the Rafah crossing from Egypt on Monday bound for the besieged Gaza Strip, an aid worker and two security sources have told Reuters. On Saturday and Sunday 34 trucks passed through. The number of trucks in Monday\u2019s convoy was similar to each of those days, the aid worker and security sources said. UN officials say about 100 trucks would be needed daily to meet essential needs in Gaza. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, joined calls on Monday for a humanitarian pause in the conflict to let more aid supplies into Gaza. The leaders of the US, UK, France, Canada, Germany and Italy have called on Israel to adhere to international law and protect civilians, while also reiterating Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terrorism. In a statement put out after a phone call, the leaders\u2019 offices said: \u201cThe leaders reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, for his country\u2019s support as the latter visited Tel Aviv. Netanyahu said of the conflict: \u201cIt\u2019s a battle against civilization. It\u2019s civilization against barbarism. We\u2019re on the side of civilization. We have to unite, all together, against Hamas, which is Isis.\u201d The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, has said the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip are exposed to \u201cthe Israeli murder and criminal machine\u201d. A Palestinian photojournalist, Roshdi Sarraj, has been killed in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Radio France reported. The French broadcaster said Sarraj was killed on Sunday in Israeli strikes on Tel al-Hawa, in Gaza City. His wife and one-year-old daughter were injured. Israel\u2019s military has claimed to have fired at a \u201csuspicious aerial target\u201d attempting to enter Israel from the direction of Lebanon. Turkey sent two cargo planes to Egypt on Monday carrying further medical equipment and supplies for Gaza, the health minister Fahrettin Koca said. He said two more aircraft would be sent with more supplies. A 33-year-old Dutch woman has been killed in an explosion in Gaza, the Dutch foreign ministry has said. Named locally as Islam al-Ashqar, she was visiting relatives at the Nusairat refugee camp in central Gaza and was one of 22 Dutch nationals that the ministry was trying to help leave, the broadcaster NOS said. The two hostages Hamas said on Monday it had released \u201con humanitarian grounds\u201d were named by the group as Israeli women Nurit Yitzhak and Yochved Lifschitz. There has so far been no immediate independent confirmation of their release, and the women\u2019s whereabouts are unknown. although some social media posts suggest they had reached the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Hamas, in a statement from Abu Obaida, a spokesperson for its armed Al-Qassam Brigades, said \u201ccompelling humanitarian and poor health grounds\u201d were behind its decision to release the pair. It also said it had tried to release them on Friday, but said without corroboration that Israel had \u201crefused to receive them\u201d. The Guardian spoke earlier this month to Sharone Lifschitz, who lives in London but grew up on a kibbutz in Israel near the border with Gaza. She said her parents were there when Hamas fighters broke through on 7 October, and she feared they were taken across the border as hostages. Hamas has said it released two more hostages Monday, Reuters is reporting. It comes as reports in Israel suggest a deal may be imminent to secure the release of about another 50 abductees with dual nationality. The group released Americans Natalie and Judith Raanan on Friday. No more details were immediately available about Monday\u2019s reported release, but Reuters said it was announced by the armed wing of Hamas and involved \u201cmediation\u201d by Qatar and Egypt. Kirby was also asked at the White House briefing about a possible conflict between US priorities for the war against Hamas, which include pouring in humanitarian aid to Gaza and freeing hostages, and that of Israel, which has committed to destroying the group: We agree. The priority has to be going after Hamas. There\u2019s no daylight here. We also think it\u2019s important for humanitarian assistance to flow and for our hostages to get home with their families, and we\u2019re working all three of those things. The Biden administration is warning Iran and other nations seeking to use the Israel-Hamas conflict as a conduit for attacks on US forces and personnel in the Middle East: \u201cDon\u2019t do it\u201d. Speaking after what he said was a weekend \u201cuptick in rocket and drone attacks by Iranian-backed proxy groups against military bases housing US personnel in Iraq and Syria,\u201d John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, gave the blunt warning at a lunchtime briefing to reporters on Monday: We know Iran continues to support Hamas and Hezbollah. And we know that Iran is closely monitoring and in some cases actively facilitating these attacks, and spurring on others who may want to exploit the conflict for their own good, or for that of Iran. Kirby alluded to a build up of US military capability in the region, including the deployment of two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East, and the repelling of drone and missile attacks: Iran\u2019s goal is to maintain some level of deniability, but we\u2019re not going to allow them to do that. We also are not going to allow any threat to our interest in the region to go unchallenged. We demonstrated last week that we will use the military capabilities available to us to protect and defend those interests and those capabilities are getting bigger, better every day. President Biden has said our message to any hostile actor seeking to escalate or widen this conflict is very simple: \u2018Don\u2019t do it\u2019. The White House says it cannot comment on reports from the Middle East about a Qatari-brokered \u201cdeal\u201d with Hamas to release hostages with dual nationality that it\u2019s holding in Gaza to the Red Cross. John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator at the National Security Council, suggested to reporters that negotiations were at a delicate stage: Where we are right now in the process makes it impossible for us to publicly detail the efforts that are going on. We are grateful for all the help we got getting those two Americans out, the mother and daughter, and we\u2019re glad that that they\u2019re OK. There\u2019s just a lot of effort going on, a lot of conversations and discussions with partners in the region. And I think it\u2019s just best if we don\u2019t detail that. Hamas, meanwhile, appeared to confirm that conversations were taking place towards a hostage release deal, but that Israel must stop bombing Gaza first. Speaking on Sky News, Khaled Meshaal, the Hamas group\u2019s chief hostage negotiator, said: Let them stop this aggression and you will find the mediators like Qatar and Egypt and some Arab countries and others will find a way to have them released and we\u2019ll send them to their homes. Reports from Israel suggest that the release of about 50 hostages held by Hamas could be imminent. The Tel Aviv news channel I24 is reporting \u201csources within Gaza\u201d as saying \u201cthe finalization of a potential deal\u201d brokered by Qatari was under way for the release of about 50 abductees who hold dual citizenship. Officials of Red Cross are believed to on their way to receive the group, I24 said, and the release could be concluded \u201cin the hours ahead\u201d if there are no obstacles. It is believed a suspension of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza was part of the deal to allow Red Cross teams to reach the hostages safely. Earlier today, the Israeli Defense Forces raised the number of hostages it said were being held by Hamas to 222. On Friday, Hamas released two US citizens, Natalie Raanan, 17, and her mother Judith, 59, on \u201chumanitarian grounds\u201d. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will hold public hearings to allow parties to give their views on the legal consequences of Israel\u2019s occupation of the Palestinian territories, Reuters is reporting. It will eventually issue a non-binding legal opinion. The ICJ, also known as the world court, was asked by the 193-member United Nations General Assembly in December to give its view on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinians. Hearings in The Hague will begin 19 February. The request for a so-called advisory opinion had been made before this month\u2019s Hamas attack on Israel, so the ICJ\u2019s opinion will focus solely on the Israeli occupation. The resolution passed the General Assembly with 87 votes in favor. Israel, the US and 24 other members voted against, while 53 abstained. Almost 20,000 people have been internally displaced in south Lebanon and elsewhere since early October, a United Nations agency said on Monday, reflecting escalating violence on the Lebanese-Israeli border. The UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said 19,646 people had been displaced inside Lebanon since it began tracking movements on 8 October, the day after the assault on Israel by Hamas militants, the AFP news agency reported. Most were those fleeing the south of Lebanon, while some people have also moved from other areas. Israeli authorities have also been evacuating dozens of towns and communities from the north of Israel, IOM said. Rocket exchanges between Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group and Israel have become increasingly prevalent since the 7 October attacks. The office of Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has joined with the Israel Defense Ministry and Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to issue a rare joint statement asserting \u201cclose and full cooperation\u201d between them. \u201cThere is total and mutual trust between the Prime Minister, the Defense Minister and the IDF Chief-of-Staff; the unity of the goal is clear,\u201d the statement says, insisting the cooperation will lead to \u201ca decisive victory over Hamas\u201d. Netanyahu\u2019s relationship with the military has been testy of late. Former military leaders and politicians said at the weekend his \u201cdysfunctional government\u201d bore responsibility for the attacks on Israel by Hamas. And media reports earlier this year painted a picture of hostility between Netanyahu and the country\u2019s military leaders, including that he was \u201cat odds\u201d with defense minister and former IDF commander Yoav Gallant, now a leading voice in Israel\u2019s unity government. Read more: The Israeli public has a \u201cvery high level of trust\u201d in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but much lower confidence in prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet, a survey by the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) has found. According to the survey by the Jerusalem-based policy group, 79% of respondents said they were confident Israel would win the war with Hamas, and 78% said the condition of Israeli society was either somewhat or very united. But Netanyahu\u2019s level of trust among the same respondents was only 32%, with 68% saying they had a low level trust or did not know. Yedidia Stern, JPPI\u2019s president, said the results reflected a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d for Netanyahu\u2019s unity government: The survey shows that the Israeli public believes in the capability of the state of Israel to win the war. But there is a crisis of confidence in, and much criticism of, the political leadership. We must draw lessons from the situation and rebuild mutual trust between the public and the government. The reported drone attack Monday on US troops in Syria took place at the Al-Tanf military air base, near the country\u2019s borders with Iraq and Jordan, Reuters said, citing two US officials. The officials confirmed there were no injuries. On Sunday, Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary, said he was worried about an escalation of attacks on US forces in the wider Middle East region as Israel prepared to launch a ground invasion of Gaza. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region. We\u2019re going to do what\u2019s necessary to make sure that our troops are in the right position, they\u2019re protected, and that we have the ability to respond,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s This Week. US troops have come under drone attack in Syria, Reuters is reporting. Officials told the news agency there were no immediate reports of injuries. We\u2019ll have more details soon. Here\u2019s a little more of what Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons on Monday as he pledged an additional \u00a320m for aid to Gaza: We need a constant stream of aid pouring in, bringing the water, food, medicine and fuel that is so desperately needed. We are providing an additional \u00a320m humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza, more than doubling our previous support to the Palestinian people. Foreign ministers of the European Union have agreed to \u201ckeep up the financial support\u201d for humanitarian aid for Gaza, Joseph Borrell, the EU\u2019s chief diplomat has said. He repeated the need to maintain electricity supplies to Gaza to ensure desalination plants can operate to provide potable water to citizens and hospitals. He was speaking at a press conference following a meeting in Luxembourg. The foreign ministers also all support a \u201cpause\u201d in the hostilities in Israel and Gaza to allow urgent humanitarian aid to get through to the Palestinian civilians and hospitals. Borrell said: There is a consensus on the need for a pause for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza without running huge risks the risks that would be involved if there were ongoing hostilities. I believe that the idea of a humanitarian pause to facilitate to enable the arrival of humanitarian aid, which would allow displaced persons to find shelter, is something that the leaders will support. No vote or decision was taken in Luxembourg but the temporary cessation of violence will be on the agenda of a meeting of leaders of the 27 member states this Thursday. UK intelligence services have concluded that the deadly blast at al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza was caused by a rocket fired by a Palestinian militant group rather than by an Israeli airstrike, Rishi Sunak has told MPs. Briefing the Commons after his trip last week to Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the prime minister said the explosion was likely to have been caused by a missile or part of a missile launched within Gaza and towards Israel. Sunak used this assessment to criticise some media outlets for initially reporting that the blast appeared to have been caused by Israel. Also in the statement, Sunak stressed the need for a two-state solution, saying this was \u201cessential\u201d for lasting peace. He also said the UK would provide \u00a320m for in aid to Gaza. The IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari has posted to social media to say Israel has again exchanged fire after been shot at from Lebanon. Israel\u2019s education minister has called for the immediate release of hostages by Hamas and said that \u201ctrying to kill Jews because they are Jews\u201d is \u201cnot going to be an option any more\u201d after Israel has finished its military campaign. Yoav Kisch was appearing on the GB News channel in the UK. He said: We demand the immediate and unconditional release of these hostages. We\u2019re dealing with uninvolved people, babies, kids, elderly women \u2013 it\u2019s crazy that we even have to speak about it. It\u2019s such a war crime that is even hard to imagine. So this thing has to happen immediately. We will continue our efforts to make sure that Hamas will not control Gaza. This is for the benefit of both Israel and the Palestinians. Hamas is the main cause for the suffering of both people. Kisch went on to say: \u201cI hope that this message will be conveyed not only to the Palestinians but also to Lebanon, Hezbollah and Iran so they will see that whoever is trying to kill Jews because they are Jews, like they did in the Holocaust, this is not going to be an option any more in the future.\u201d The Israel Defence Forces have posted a video to social media that they say shows regular and reserve soldiers \u201cconducting training exercises in order to improve the readiness and competence of the forces to manoeuvre in the Gaza Strip\u201d. The IDF also said meetings were being held to \u201ctighten cooperation between air and ground forces\u201d. Earlier, the IDF said it had struck 320 Hamas targets in Gaza and launched limited raids overnight into the Gaza Strip. Hamas claimed to have encountered Israeli troops. The death toll in the Gaza Strip has been put at over 5,000 since Israel began its air bombardment in response to the 7 October Hamas attack in southern Israel that killed more than 1,300 Israelis. Riham Jafari, an advocacy and communications coordinator at ActionAid Palestine, has reiterated that Gaza\u2019s hospitals and healthcare system are in grave peril. She said: Neighbourhoods surrounding hospitals have been targeted, putting those sheltering there at risk, terrified for their futures and living in a state of fear. Four hundred civilians were killed in Gaza last night, most of them were women and children. Twenty-four hospitals, including the al-Quds, are under the threat of bombing at any time due to Israeli evacuation orders they received, according to the Red Crescent. Those hospitals are filled with the sick and wounded, and their courtyards include thousands of people who were displaced and have taken refuge there to escape the continuous bombing of Gaza. ActionAid has also distributed a quote that it says comes from a pregnant mother sheltering in a school near to the city of Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza. Somaya told the charity her family had already been displaced twice since 7 October, and said: My children are screaming all night, while there is bombing on us. I am pregnant. On the 28th of the month, I am supposed to give birth, I will have a caesarean section. Where should I go? Where will it be born? When the baby comes, it must be born in a clean place. Where is the cleanliness? What can we do? The UN humanitarian office (OCHA) has said about 1.4 million of Gaza\u2019s population \u2013 more than half \u2013 are now internally displaced, with many seeking refuge in overcrowded UN emergency shelters. Israel has ordered Gaza residents to evacuate the north. But the OCHA said it believed hundreds and possibly thousands of people who had fled were now returning to the north due to increased bombardments in the south and lack of shelter, Reuters reports. An Israeli military spokesperson told Reuters: \u201cThe IDF has been encouraging residents of the northern Gaza Strip to move southward and not to stay in the vicinity of Hamas terror targets within Gaza City. \u201cBut, ultimately, Hamas has entrenched itself among the civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip. So wherever a Hamas target arises, the IDF will strike at it in order to thwart the terrorist capabilities of the group, while taking feasible precautions to mitigate the harm to uninvolved civilians.\u201d Israel\u2019s military has released satellite imagery that it claims shows Hamas rocket launchers positioned near schools, mosques and hospitals. Al Jazeera reports that another mosque has been struck in Gaza today, the Al-Noor Al-Mohammedi mosque in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood. It reports this is the 32nd mosque struck by Israel since 7 October. The news service interviewed a 21-year-old student, Tala Herzallah, who said: \u201cLast night cannot be described in words. We were literally shaking due to fear. We didn\u2019t know if we would wake up alive or not. If the morning will come for us, knowing that we could die any minute. We spent the whole night praying, asking God to keep us alive. I slept for just two hours and woke up to a series of bombings.\u201d She told reporters that she immediately began phoning family and friends to see if they had also survived the night. \u201cSome of them answered me and others did not. I don\u2019t know if those not answering means they are dead or they\u2019re just out of battery charge.\u201d Here is Bethan McKernan\u2019s latest report from Jerusalem: The blockaded Gaza Strip has been hit by one of the deadliest nights of Israeli bombing so far in the new war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. At least 400 Palestinians were killed in Gaza in the last 24 hours, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and 70 were killed overnight on Sunday in bombardments of the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp and streets close to two hospitals in Gaza City. Mahmoud Basal, a spokesperson for the strip\u2019s civil defence unit, told the independent Palestinian media organisation Wattan that rescue operations were becoming more difficult because of the scale of destruction and impeded access. \u201cOur crews are recovering victims in the form of body parts, and the chances of recovering survivors are diminishing,\u201d he said. The World Health Organization has said seven hospitals in northern Gaza have had to shut down due to damage from strikes, lack of power and supplies, or Israeli evacuation orders. Despite a second convoy of aid entering on Sunday, Cindy McCain, the executive director of the US World Food Programme, said the situation in Gaza remained \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. You can read Bethan McKernan\u2019s full report here: Israel hits Gaza with one of deadliest bombings so far in war against Hamas Al Jazeera reports that Hamas has said it encountered Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip overnight, after Israel said it had carried out limited raids. Al Jazeera writes: \u201cHamas says its fighters encountered an Israeli armored unit infiltrating in southern Gaza. The group said the infiltration took place east of Khan Younis. It added that its fighters successfully destroyed some Israeli military equipment before returning to base.\u201d It has just gone 3.30pm in Gaza City and in Tel Aviv. Here is a summary of the latest headlines in the Israel-Hamas conflict \u2026 The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said at least 5,087 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since 7 October. It said the dead included 2,055 children. Additionally, it said 15,273 people had been wounded. The ministry put the death toll in the past 24 hours at 436, including 182 children. It said most of the fatalities had occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, to where Israel\u2019s military has ordered Palestinians to evacuate. The claims have not been independently verified. Israel\u2019s military said on Monday that ground forces mounted limited raids into the Gaza Strip overnight to fight Palestinian gunmen, and that airstrikes were being focused on sites where Hamas was assembling to attack any wider Israeli invasion. The IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: \u201cDuring the night there were raids by tank and infantry forces. These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for our next stage in the war. These are raids that go deep.\u201d The number of confirmed hostages held by Hamas in Gaza after it captured them in southern Israel on 7 October has risen to 222. Hagari said the total included a not insignificant number of foreign nationals, and it had taken time to contact their families. He said: \u201cWe are working in all ways to free the hostages and bring them home,\u201d adding that the raids inside Gaza had sought to gather information on them. Washington has advised Israel to delay its expected ground invasion of Gaza in order to buy time to negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas and allow more aid in to Palestinian civilians, the New York Times reported, citing US officials. A third convoy of aid trucks entered the Rafah crossing from Egypt on Monday bound for the besieged Gaza Strip, an aid worker and two security sources have told Reuters. On Saturday and Sunday 34 trucks passed through. The number of trucks in Monday\u2019s convoy was similar to each of those days, the aid worker and security sources said. UN officials say about 100 trucks would be needed daily to meet essential needs in Gaza. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, joined calls on Monday for a humanitarian pause in the conflict to let more aid supplies into Gaza. The leaders of the US, UK, France, Canada, Germany and Italy have called on Israel to adhere to international law and protect civilians, while also reiterating Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terrorism. In a statement put out after a phone call, the leaders\u2019 offices said: \u201cThe leaders reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians.\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, for his country\u2019s support as the latter visited Tel Aviv. Netanyahu said of the conflict: \u201cIt\u2019s a battle against civilization. It\u2019s civilization against barbarism. We\u2019re on the side of civilization. We have to unite, all together, against Hamas, which is Isis.\u201d The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, has said the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip are exposed to \u201cthe Israeli murder and criminal machine\u201d. A Palestinian photojournalist, Roshdi Sarraj, has been killed in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Radio France reported. The French broadcaster said Sarraj was killed on Sunday in Israeli strikes on Tel al-Hawa, in Gaza City. His wife and one-year-old daughter were injured. Israel\u2019s military has claimed to have fired at a \u201csuspicious aerial target\u201d attempting to enter Israel from the direction of Lebanon. Turkey sent two cargo planes to Egypt on Monday carrying further medical equipment and supplies for Gaza, the health minister Fahrettin Koca said. He said two more aircraft would be sent with more supplies. A 33-year-old Dutch woman has been killed in an explosion in Gaza, the Dutch foreign ministry has said. Named locally as Islam al-Ashqar, she was visiting relatives at the Nusairat refugee camp in central Gaza and was one of 22 Dutch nationals that the ministry was trying to help leave, the broadcaster NOS said. Here are a couple of images sent over the news wires that show some aid being sorted before it is distributed to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. UN officials say about 100 trucks of aid would be needed daily to meet essential needs in Gaza. Just a fraction of that has been allowed to pass. Reuters is carrying an interview with an 18-year-old Palestinian who claims to have lost 13 members of her family after they fled from the north of the Gaza Strip to the south \u2013 as ordered by the Israeli military \u2013 only to be caught up in the bombardment there. Dima al-Lamdani said she had had to identify the bodies of her relatives at a makeshift morgue in Khan Younis after losing her parents, seven siblings and four members of her uncle\u2019s family. She said her family and that of her uncle travelled in two cars across Gaza. She said her family was staying at a temporary shelter when \u201cat 4.30am I was awake and sitting with my aunt drinking coffee. Suddenly I woke up in the middle of ruins. Everyone around me was screaming, so I screamed.\u201d \u201cThis is a nightmare. It will never be wiped from my memory,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a sister, 16. They wrote my name on the white sheet they wrapped her body in, they thought it was me. \u201cThey told us to evacuate your place and go to Khan Younis because it is safe. They betrayed us and bombed us.\u201d Turkey sent two cargo planes to Egypt on Monday carrying further medical equipment and supplies for Gaza, the health minister Fahrettin Koca said, Reuters reports. He said two more aircraft would be sent with more supplies. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said at least 5,087 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since 7 October. It said the dead included 2,055 children. Additionally, it said 15,273 people had been wounded. The ministry put the death toll in the past 24 hours at 436, including 182 children. It said most of the fatalities had occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, to where Israel\u2019s military has ordered Palestinians to evacuate. The claims have not been independently verified. Israel began launching its retaliatory strikes after the 7 October Hamas attack inside southern Israel that killed at least 1,400 people, mostly civilians, including at a music festival and in communities near the Gaza border. Israel\u2019s government has issued a readout of the meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Israel\u2019s prime minister said: \u201cI always say that the best thing about standing with Israel is standing with Israel in Israel. And you\u2019re doing that. I appreciate the solidarity of you, your government, the people of Greece, at this darkest hour. It\u2019s a battle against civilization. It\u2019s civilization against barbarism. We\u2019re on the side of civilization. We have to unite, all together, against Hamas, which is Isis.\u201d Mitsotakis said: \u201cI come here not just as an ally but as a true friend. What happened was truly horrible and we from the very first moment defended and supported the right of Israel to defend itself in line with international law. And we drew a very clear distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people. We will continue to be able to support you and to hope that whatever happens, happens without too much of a humanitarian cost. But you can count on our support and our help.\u201d Reuters is carrying some further details of the limited raids that Israel claims it has carried out within the Gaza Strip. It quotes the IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari as saying: During the night there were raids by tank and infantry forces. These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for our next stage in the war. These are raids that go deep. Reuters reports that he also said the raids tried to gather information on the 222 hostages being held by Hamas. The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, has said the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip are exposed to \u201cthe Israeli murder and criminal machine\u201d. Speaking before a cabinet session in Ramallah, he said the spectre of death threatened thousands of children and patients in Gaza\u2019s hospitals, Al Jazeera reports. Israel\u2019s military has claimed to have fired at a \u201csuspicious aerial target\u201d attempting to enter Israel from the direction of Lebanon. A third convoy of aid trucks entered the Rafah crossing from Egypt on Monday bound for the besieged Gaza Strip, an aid worker and two security sources have told Reuters.

UN officials say about 100 trucks would be needed daily to meet essential needs in Gaza. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Gaza and Israel. Reuters has a quick snap that a further convoy of aid trucks is entering the Rafah crossing. More details soon \u2026 A 33-year-old Dutch woman has been killed in an explosion in Gaza, the Dutch foreign ministry has said. Named locally as Islam al-Ashqar, she was visiting relatives at the Nusairat refugee camp in central Gaza and was one of 22 Dutch nationals that the ministry was trying to help leave, the broadcaster NOS said. On her way into a meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers in Luxembourg, the Dutch foreign minister, Hanke Bruins, said: \u201cYesterday we received the horrible news that Islam al-Ashqar passed away, and it is a great sadness for her husband and all her children, and we sympathise intensely with them. \u201cOur people in Ramallah are in touch with the family, and I\u2019m going to get in touch with the family myself.\u201d It is also now known that an 18-year-old Dutch man was taken hostage in the Be\u2019eri kibbutz, where he was visiting his girlfriend, according to an earlier statement by the Israeli embassy in the Netherlands. Asked about him on Monday, Bruins said: \u201cWe have no further information about the Dutchman who has been taken hostage at the moment. His family must also really be in huge fear and very concerned. We are obviously trying to go through all diplomatic channels and put pressure on to make sure the hostages are released.\u201d Earlier this morning Israel raised the number of hostages confirmed to have been taken by Hamas during its 7 October attack to 222. Israel said the hostages included a not insignificant number of foreign nationals. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has landed in Israel and is expected to meet Benjamin Netanyahu, Reuters reports. Thousands of civilians, including children, have been killed in Israeli strikes that have flattened residential districts in the Gaza Strip. According to health officials in the Hamas-run territory, more than 4,600 people have been killed, making the conflict the most fatal of the five wars Israel has fought against militants there since 2007. The latest escalation was triggered by the Hamas attack inside Israel on 7 October that killed more than 1,400 Israelis. Information coming out of Gaza \u2013 which is under siege \u2013 is hard to verify, but my colleagues Weronika Strzy\u017cy\u0144ska and Harriet Sherwood have put together profiles of some of the people reported to have been killed. You can read that here: Doctors, poets, families, babies: victims of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza Latvia\u2019s foreign minister and former prime minister said the EU had to encourage the return to political talks in the Middle East. \u201cThe EU needs to encourage talks, and the only way to really de-escalate is to work harder now towards the two-state solution,\u201d Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161 said. He added: \u201cIf the Palestinians had a clear state, I think that that would help also to alleviate some of the pressure, maybe a great part of the pressure, which has been building up there for years and years. So we have to work towards this two-state solution. So that there is a clear end goal where this is heading.\u201d The IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari also explained why the number of confirmed hostages was slowly rising. He said the total included a significant number of foreign nationals, and it had taken time to contact their families. Hagari said: \u201cWe are working in all ways to free the hostages and bring them home.\u201d Reuters reports that Israel\u2019s military said on Monday that ground forces mounted limited raids into the Gaza Strip overnight to fight Palestinian gunmen, and that airstrikes were being focused on sites where Hamas was assembling to attack any wider Israeli invasion. The IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari also said the military had carried out strikes to eliminate 20 Hezbollah cells in southern Lebanon since the start of the war. EU foreign ministers are in Luxembourg today, with Israel and Hamas pushing Ukraine off the top of their agenda for the first time in 18 months. Slovenia\u2019s foreign minister, Tanja Fajon, called for a pause in hostilities to let aid through. A humanitarian ceasefire means that we can provide humanitarian assistance. If you speak about self-defence, Slovenia supports the right to proportionate, urgent self-defence, but we have to be aware that strong military attack can have serious consequences and serious numbers of deaths in civilians we currently have in Gaza, more than 1 million people that have nowhere to go and this is something we have to address. Earlier this morning, the EU\u2019s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, noted that just 20 trucks got into Gaza yesterday, compared with 100 a day before the conflict. It\u2019s clear that 20 is not enough. It is important \u2026 in order to make the power station work, and the desalination station work, otherwise if there is not water, and there is not electricity, without water and electricity in hospitals can barely work. The IDF has raised the number of people confirmed to be held hostage by Hamas in Gaza since 7 October to 222. It is 11am in Gaza City and in Tel Aviv. Here is a summary of the latest headlines in the Israel-Hamas war: The leaders of the US, UK, France, Canada, Germany and Italy have called on Israel to adhere to international law and protect civilians, while also reiterating Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terrorism. In a statement put out after a phone call, the leaders\u2019 offices said: \u201cThe leaders reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians. They welcomed the release of two hostages and called for the immediate release of all remaining hostages. They committed to close coordination to support their nationals in the region, in particular those wishing to leave Gaza.\u201d The White House has promised a \u201ccontinued flow\u201d of aid into Gaza, after a second convoy entered on Sunday and Israel continued to bombard the besieged enclave into the early hours of Monday. The UN said the volume of aid entering Gaza was just 4% of the daily average before the hostilities and a fraction of what was needed, with food, water, medicines and fuel stocks running out. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that in the last 24 hours they had attacked more than 320 targets in the Gaza Strip, and they continued to attack \u201cterrorist infrastructures and military targets\u201d. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes had killed 4,741 Palestinians, with 15,898 hurt. Authorities in Gaza claimed that 40% of those killed in the Gaza Strip were children. Israel has been launching the attacks since 7 October, when a Hamas attack inside Israel killed more than 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians. Washington has advised Israel to delay its expected ground invasion of Gaza in order to buy time to negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas and allow more aid in to Palestinian civilians, the New York Times reported, citing US officials. Two Palestinians have been killed at the Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. A Palestinian photojournalist, Roshdi Sarraj, has been killed in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Radio France reported. The French broadcaster said Sarraj was killed on Sunday in Israeli strikes on Tel al-Hawa, in Gaza City. His wife and one-year-old daughter were injured. Doctors in the Gaza Strip say dwindling fuel supplies due to the Israeli siege of Gaza are putting dozens of premature babies hooked up to incubators at risk of imminent death. Two activists from a Jewish-Arab peace movement were recently detained in Israel for putting up posters with a message that police deemed to be offensive. The message was: \u201cJews and Arabs, we will get through this together\u201d. The activists, members of Standing Together, had their posters confiscated, as well as T-shirts printed with peace slogans in Hebrew and Arabic. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, joined calls on Monday for a humanitarian pause in the conflict to let more aid supplies into Gaza. UK transport secretary, Mark Harper, said: \u201cThe most important thing is to support people in the region and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been urging the Israeli government and the Egyptian government to make sure that aid can get into Gaza. We saw the first stages of that at the weekend, and that was very welcome.\u201d Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, is due to visit Israel on Monday, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will visit on Tuesday, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office has said. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate, offered a strong endorsement on Sunday of the Joe Biden White House\u2019s $106bn aid proposal to Israel and Ukraine, saying he and the president were essentially \u201cin the same place\u201d on the issue. China views the situation in Gaza as \u201cvery serious\u201d, with the risk of a large-scale ground conflict rising, Chinese state media have reported, citing the country\u2019s Middle East special envoy. The Israel Defence Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari is giving a press briefing at the moment. I\u2019ll bring you any key lines that emerge. More details soon \u2026 The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, joined calls on Monday for a humanitarian pause in the conflict between Israel and Hamas to let more aid supplies into Gaza. \u201cNow the most important thing is for humanitarian support to go into Gaza,\u201d Borrell told the media, Reuters reports, as he arrived for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. Borrell said the ministers would discuss the call for a pause. \u201cPersonally, I think a humanitarian pause is needed in order to allow humanitarian support to come in and be distributed,\u201d Borrell said. In the UK, the transport secretary has said now is not the right time to be discussing taking refugees from Gaza. Mark Harper told Sky News: Reaching for the tool of refugees at this stage is not the right one to do. I think the most important thing is to support people in the region and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been urging the Israeli government and the Egyptian government to make sure that aid can get into Gaza. We saw the first stages of that at the weekend, and that was very welcome. Harper also addressed the issue of whether London\u2019s police acted appropriately during pro-Palestinian demonstrations in the capital at the weekend. He said: I saw those clips of [protesters chanting \u2018jihad\u2019] at the weekend. I along with many people would have been disturbed by it. The home secretary will make it clear that the government thinks the full force of the law should be used. The police are operationally independent, which I think is appropriate, and they will have to explain the reasons for the decisions they have taken. He was also critical of a video that emerged that appeared to show a driver on the London underground leading a chant of \u201cfree Palestine\u201d over the train intercom, saying it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d. \u201cI want to make sure people across the country are secure,\u201d he said, \u201cand those sorts of things will have been very concerning, particularly to people in the Jewish community.\u201d Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from Khan Younis in Gaza. In its latest social media post, the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has claimed that in the last 24 hours \u201cthe IDF attacked over 320 targets throughout the Gaza Strip\u201d, saying it continues to attack \u201cterrorist infrastructures and military targets\u201d. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry claims that Israeli strikes have so far killed 4,741 Palestinians, with 15,898 hurt, since the campaign was launched on 7 October in response to the surprise Hamas attack inside Israel, which killed over 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Washington has advised Israel to delay its expected ground invasion of Gaza in order to buy time to negotiate the release of 212 hostages held by Hamas and allow more aid in to Palestinian civilians, the New York Times has reported, citing US officials. The US also wants more time to prepare for possible attacks by Iran-backed groups on US interests, the paper reported, adding that such attacks were likely to increase when Israel launches its invasion. However the paper noted that officials said the Biden administration was \u201cnot making a demand of Israel and still supports the ground invasion and Israel\u2019s goal of eradicating Hamas\u201d. The Times said the advice was being relayed by defense secretary Lloyd J Austin because the Pentagon has been advising Israel on military matters and Austin has being having near daily phone calls with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant. Two Palestinians have been killed at the Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday, Reuters reports. Residents told Reuters that Israeli forces raided the camp and carried out widespread arrests, where they clashed with gunmen and some youths who threw stones. Israeli forces have currently retreated to the outskirts of the camp, the residents added. The Israeli army has not issued a statement about the incidents. Thousands of people took part in a rally in Berlin to show solidarity with Israel on Sunday. Here are some of the images of the demonstration sent to us from the wires: With tanks and troops massed at the Gaza border, waiting for the command to cross, Israel intensified its bombardment of the enclave overnight. Israel\u2019s military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the country had increased airstrikes across Gaza to hit targets that would reduce the risk to troops in the next stage of the war. A ground invasion has been expected but its timing remains unclear. Asked by Australian broadcaster the ABC on Monday whether the invasion had been delayed in order to leave more time to get Israeli hostages out of Gaza, Israel Defence Force spokesperson Jonathan Conricus was reluctant to give any insight into the country\u2019s deliberations: That\u2019s a very good question. The answer I can provide is that we are going to dismantle Hamas totally and we\u2019re going to bring our people home. And asked whether an invasion was inevitable, he said: The aim here is to totally dismantle Hamas from its military capabilities. If that can be done from the air \u2026 with very limited exposure to our troops and less damage on the ground that would be great. If Hamas were to come out of their hiding places that they hide underneath the civilians \u2026 and return our hostages, all 212 of them, and surrender unconditionally, then the war would end. If they won\u2019t, we will probably have to go in and get it done. Fears of a widening war have grown as Israeli warplanes struck two airports in Syria and a mosque in the occupied West Bank allegedly used by militants on Sunday. The Israeli military also said it had struck targets in Lebanon overnight. \u201cOur forces struck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon, including a military compound and an observation post,\u201d it said in an X/Twitter post on Monday, adding, \u201c4 Hezbollah terrorist cells operating on the border with Lebanon were struck.\u201d China views the situation in Gaza as \u201cvery serious\u201d with the risk of a large-scale ground conflict rising and the spread of armed conflicts along neighbouring borders, Chinese state media have reported, citing the country\u2019s Middle East special envoy. The envoy Zhai Jun, who is visiting the Middle East, said spillover effects in the region and internationally are widening, as conflict along the Israeli-Lebanese and Israeli-Syrian borders spread, \u201cmaking the outlook worrisome\u201d, Reuters reported. The news wire writes: Zhai called on the international community to be \u201chighly vigilant in this regard\u201d and to take immediate action urging parties concerned to strictly abide by international humanitarian law and avoid a serious humanitarian disaster while putting in \u201cjoint efforts to control the situation\u201d. Zhai also said China is willing to do \u201cwhatever is conducive\u201d to promote dialogue, achieve ceasefire and restore peace, as well as to promote the two-state solution and a just and lasting resolution to the conflict, China Central Television said. Last week, Zhai pinned the cause of the Israel-Gaza crisis on the lack of guarantees for Palestinian rights as he met with his Russian counterpart in Qatar, a go-between in the conflict. Zhai said China will continue maintaining close communication with the international community, including the Arab countries and will next visit the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries in the region to further strengthen coordination aimed at ending the crisis. Prior to his trip, Zhai had phone calls with the foreign ministry heads of the Palestinians, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Norway, as well as with the special representatives at United Nations and European Union. The leaders of the US, UK, France, Canada, Germany and Italy have called on Israel to adhere to international law and protect civilians, while also reiterating Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terrorism. In a statement put out after a phone call, the leaders\u2019 offices said: The leaders reiterated their support for Israel and its right to defend itself against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians. They welcomed the release of two hostages and called for the immediate release of all remaining hostages. They committed to close coordination to support their nationals in the region, in particular those wishing to leave Gaza. The leaders also welcomed news that aid conveys had been allowed into Gaza and added that diplomacy aimed at preventing the conflict from spreading was continuing. The leaders committed to continue close diplomatic coordination, including with key partners in the region, to prevent the conflict from spreading, preserve stability in the Middle East, and work toward a political solution and durable peace. Two activists from a Jewish-Arab peace movement were recently detained in Israel for putting up posters with a message that the police deemed to be offensive. The message was: \u201cJews and Arabs, we will get through this together.\u201d The activists, members of Standing Together, had their posters confiscated, as well as T-shirts printed with peace slogans in Hebrew and Arabic. It was not an isolated incident. Across Israel, people are being detained, fired from their jobs, and even attacked for expressing sentiments interpreted by some as showing sympathy for Hamas after the group\u2019s murderous attack on 7 October. The definition of pro-Hamas is often widened to include expressions of sympathy for the plight of Palestinian children trapped in Gaza, or calls for peace, especially if expressed in both Arabic and Hebrew. Last week, after 15 years of service at a Petah Tikva hospital, its director of the cardiac intensive care unit was suspended from his position. Abed Samara\u2019s apparent offence was his profile picture on social media \u2013 a dove carrying an olive twig and a green flag emblazoned with the shahada, the Muslim declaration of faith: \u201cThere is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet.\u201d He had adopted the picture last year, long before the Hamas attack, but it was nevertheless seen as somehow voicing support for the outrage. Doctors in the Gaza Strip say dwindling fuel supplies due to the Israeli siege of Gaza are putting dozens of premature babies hooked up to incubators at risk of imminent death, the Associated Press has reported. The news agency writes: The UN health agency estimates there are 130 premature babies at \u201cgrave risk\u201d while some hospitals say they are hours away from running out generator fuel. Israel has barred fuel from crossing into Gaza out of fears it will end up in the hands of the Hamas militant group. The UN agency responsible for Palestinians says it only has three days of fuel stocks left to meet critical needs. Once the generators stop, the director of al-Aqsa Hospital in the central Gaza Strip, Iyad Abu Zahar, fears that the babies on the neonatal ward, unable to breathe on their own, will perish. \u201cThe responsibility on us is huge,\u201d he said. At least seven of the almost 30 hospitals in Gaza have been forced to shut down due to damage from relentless Israeli strikes and lack of power, water and other supplies. Doctors in the remaining hospitals said they are on the brink. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said Sunday it has enough fuel to last three days to serve critical needs. \u201cThe world cannot simply look on as these babies are killed by the siege on Gaza ... A failure to act is to sentence these babies to death,\u201d said Melanie Ward, chief executive of the Medical Aid for Palestinians aid group. Mitch McConnell offered a strong endorsement on Sunday of the Joe Biden White House\u2019s $106bn aid proposal to Israel and Ukraine, saying he and the president were essentially \u201cin the same place\u201d on the issue. McConnell, the powerful Republican leader in the US Senate, also rebuffed some of his GOP colleagues in the Senate who have called for a package separating assistance for the two countries, saying it would be \u201ca mistake\u201d during an interview on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. The Republican leader offered significant backing to the White House\u2019s $106bn request, including $14bn in assistance to Israel, $60bn in aid to Ukraine and another $14bn to improve security on the US Mexico border. An additional $10bn would be allocated to humanitarian relief as well as an additional $7bn to the Indio-Pacific region. Nine Republican senators wrote a letter to McConnell on Thursday saying that Ukraine and Israel aid should not be paired together. \u201cThese are two separate conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to Israel in an attempt to get additional aid for Ukraine across the finish line,\u201d the group wrote. McConnell rejected that view on Sunday. \u201cI view it as all interconnected,\u201d he said during the interview. \u201cThe Ukrainians are destroying the army of one of our biggest rivals. I have a hard time finding anything wrong with that. I think it\u2019s wonderful that they\u2019re defending themselves.\u201d\" Some of the latest pictures from Gaza sent to us by the news wires: Palestinian photojournalist Roshdi Sarraj has been killed in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Radio France has reported. The French broadcaster said Sarraj was killed on Sunday in Israeli strikes on Tel al-Hawa, in Gaza City. His wife and 1-year-old daughter were injured. The 31-year-old had worked as a \u201cfixer\u201d for Radio France since 2021, the broadcaster said. A fixer is someone who accompanies journalists, helps them find interviewees and sometimes helps with translation. \u201cThose who knew Roshdi Sarraj and worked with him praised him as an outstanding journalist,\u201d Radio France wrote. \u201cIt is thanks to his work that the life of Palestinians and the horror of the war could be told on the airwaves of [public radio channel] France Inter.\u201d Sarraj, along with his wife and friends, had founded the press agency Ain Media, which employed editors, cameramen and photographers, among others, according to Radio France. Reporter Alice Froussard, who worked with Sarraj, tweeted a photograph of him, and said his last message to her had been, \u201csending love to you\u201d. Children in Gaza are developing severe trauma symptoms alongside the risk of death and injury, according to a Palestinian psychiatrist. On Sunday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 1,750 children had been killed in the 16 days of bombardment by Israeli forces since Hamas\u2019s murderous onslaught on 7 October. That is an average of almost 110 children a day. Thousands more have been injured. The psychological impact of the war on children was showing, said Fadel Abu Heen, a psychiatrist in Gaza. Children had \u201cstarted to develop serious trauma symptoms such as convulsions, bed-wetting, fear, aggressive behaviour, nervousness, and not leaving their parents\u2019 sides.\u201d The \u201clack of any safe place has created a general sense of fear and horror among the entire population and children are most impacted,\u201d he said. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte is set to visit Israel on Monday and French President Emmanuel Macron will visit on Tuesday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office has said. Other world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, UK prime minister Rishi Sunak and German chancellor Olaf Scholz have already visited Israel in order to express solidarity with the country, and , it is thought, privately urge caution on Israel. In particular, as Patrick Wintour wrote in this weekend analysis, leaders are worried about what would come after a ground invasion of Gaza, there being little indication that Israel has a concrete plan. The White House has promised a \u201ccontinued flow\u201d of aid into Gaza, after a second convoy entered on Sunday and Israel continued to bombard the besieged enclave into the early hours of Monday. Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu agreed in a call that \u201cthere will now be continued flow of \u2026 critical assistance into Gaza,\u201d the White House said, after a second convoy of 14 trucks entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing. The UN said the volume of aid entering Gaza was just 4% of the daily average before the hostilities and a fraction of what was needed with food, water, medicines and fuel stocks running out. COGAT, the Israeli defence body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, said Sunday\u2019s second batch of aid included water, food and medical supplies and that everything was inspected by Israel before it was brought into Gaza. Israel has not allowed any fuel to enter Gaza. The delivery came as Israel continued to target Gaza with airstrikes, concentrating on the strip\u2019s centre and north, Palestinian media reported. Areas near three hospitals were reportedly hit early on Monday. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the conflict between Israel and Hamas with me, Helen Livingstone. A second aid convoy of 14 trucks has entered Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths has called it \u201ca small glimmer of hope for the millions of people in dire need of humanitarian aid\u201d. However, he added that civilians in Gaza \u201cneed more, much more\u201d. The White House has said that after talks between US President Joe Biden and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu there will now be a \u201ccontinued flow\u201d of aid into Gaza, although they did not specify how much. The talks came as Israel said it was intensifying its attacks on Gaza. Military spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the country had increased airstrikes across the strip to hit targets that would reduce the risk to troops in the next stage of the war. Fears of a widening war grew as Israeli warplanes also struck two airports in Syria and a mosque in the occupied West Bank allegedly used by militants while the military also returned fire into Lebanon after a drone and anti-aircraft missiles were fired into northern Israel. In other key developments: The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes have killed 4,741 Palestinians, with 15,898 hurt. Authorities in Gaza said 40% of those killed in the Gaza Strip were children. Israel has been launching the attacks since 7 October, when a Hamas attack inside Israel killed more than 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians. Palestinian media reported that Israel was also bombing the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. The attacks came hours after the Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari called on Gaza\u2019s residents to move south \u201cfor your own safety\u201d. The UN agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) has said 29 of its workers have been killed in Gaza since 7 October. Doctors in the Gaza Strip say dwindling fuel supplies are putting dozens of premature babies hooked up to incubators at risk of imminent death. The UN health agency estimates there are 130 premature babies at \u201cgrave risk\u201d while some hospitals say they are hours away from running out generator fuel. Israel\u2019s military said the number of people held captive was confirmed to be 212. The release of two Americans on Friday raised hopes that others might be able to return home. Israel said it had returned fire into Lebanon after a drone and anti-aircraft missiles were fired into northern Israel. The country has said it plans to evacuate 14 additional communities in the area. Israeli fighter jets launched an airstrike on the southern outskirts of Aitaroun town, southern Lebanon, the Lebanese state media of NNA reported late Sunday. Israel also struck the West Bank, hitting a compound beneath a mosque early on Sunday that the Israeli military claimed was being used by Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu warned Hezbollah on Sunday against opening a second war front with Israel. He said: \u201cIf Hezbollah decides to enter the war, it will long for the second Lebanon war. It will be making the mistake of its life. We will strike it with strength that it cannot even imagine and the significance to it and to the country of Lebanon will be devastating.\u201d Speaking to soldiers near the blue line UN-drawn boundary that separates Israel and Lebanon, Netanyahu said: \u201cI know that you lost friends, and it\u2019s a very difficult thing, but we are in the fight of our life, a fight for our home. That\u2019s not an exaggeration, it\u2019s not an overstatement, that\u2019s this war. It is kill or be killed, and they need to be killed.\u201d US secretary of state Antony Blinken and defense secretary Lloyd Austin said the US expected the Israel-Hamas war to escalate through involvement by proxies of Iran. \u201cWe don\u2019t want escalation,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see our forces or our personnel come under fire. But if that happens, we\u2019re ready for it.\u201d Joe Biden held a call on Sunday with the leaders of Canada, France, Britain, Germany and Italy to discuss the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, the White House said. Benjamin Netanyahu said that French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte will visit Israel. The Israeli prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement that the two leaders \u201cwill arrive on Monday and Tuesday\u201d and meet with Netanyahu. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will visit Tehran on Monday. Palestinian Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian discussed the means of stopping the Israeli \u201cbrutal crimes\u201d in the besieged Gaza enclave, the group said in a statement late Sunday. Turkey sent its presidential plane with a medical team and supplies to Egypt on Sunday, carrying humanitarian aid for Gaza. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said on Sunday he had \u201cno idea\u201d how many people died in a blast at an Anglican hospital in the Gaza Strip, and that assuming Israeli culpability could be tantamount to antisemitic libel. Thousands of people gathered in Berlin and London to oppose antisemitism and support Israel on Sunday. \u201cIt is unbearable that Jews are living in fear again today \u2013 in our country of all places,\u201d German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the crowd at Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate, estimated at 20,000 by organisers and 10,000 by police. Thousands of people attended a rally in Paris in the first pro-Palestinian demonstration allowed by police since the 7 October Hamas attacks. About 15,000 people showed up at the Place de la Republique, according to police figures, to express their solidarity with Palestinians."

            "date": "2023-10-05T19:18:25Z",
            "content": "Vladimir Putin has ramped up his nuclear rhetoric, saying his country had successfully tested the nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable Burevestnik strategic cruise missile, as he suggested Russia could resume nuclear testing for the first time in more than three decades. The Russian president said in a speech on Thursday at the annual Valdai Discussion Club in the Black Sea resort of Sochi that Russia had also almost completed work on its nuclear-capable Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile system, which is capable of carrying at least 10 nuclear warheads on each missile. \u201cIn the event of an attack on Russia, no one has any chance of survival,\u201d he said, adding that he was \u201cnot sure if we need to carry out nuclear tests or not\u201d. In the speech, Putin also suggested that the plane crash that killed Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in August was caused by hand grenades detonating inside the aircraft, not by a missile attack. \u201cFragments of hand grenades were found in the bodies of those killed in the crash. There was no external impact on the plane \u2013 this is already an established fact,\u201d he said. The speech came after hardline political scientists and commentators in Russia said a return to nuclear testing could send a powerful message to Moscow\u2019s enemies in the west. \u201cI hear calls to start testing nuclear weapons, to return to testing,\u201d Putin said. Some in Russia have called for Putin to detonate a nuclear bomb to show the west that Moscow\u2019s patience over its support for Ukraine and apparent unwillingness to negotiate is wearing thin. Most recently, Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the state-funded broadcaster RT, suggested Russia detonate a nuclear bomb over Siberia. Between 1945 and the 1996 comprehensive test ban treaty, more than 2,000 nuclear tests were carried out; 1,032 of them by the US and 715 of them by the Soviet Union, according to the UN. The Soviet Union last tested in 1990. The US last did so in 1992. The Russian president said Moscow could \u201ctheoretically revoke ratification\u201d of the international nuclear test ban treaty. He noted that the US had signed the comprehensive test- ban treaty but not ratified it, while Russia had signed and ratified it. \u201cI am not ready to say whether we really need to conduct tests or not, but it is possible theoretically to behave in the same way as the US,\u201d Putin said. A resumption in nuclear tests by Russia, the US or both would be profoundly destabilising at a time when tensions between the two countries are greater than at any time since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In February, Putin suspended Russia\u2019s participation in the New Start treaty that limits the number of nuclear weapons each side can deploy. In his speech at Valdai, a Kremlin-affiliated research institute, Putin also recycled some of his go-to grievances with the west, claiming that \u201cwestern influence over the world is a giant Ponzi scheme.\u201d He said there was no need to change Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, as any attack on Russia would provoke a split-second response with hundreds of nuclear missiles that no enemy could survive. \u201cEverything can be changed but I just don\u2019t see the need for it,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI think no person of sound mind and clear memory would think of using nuclear weapons against Russia.\u201d Reuters contributed to this report"

            "date": "2023-10-18T04:00:31Z",
            "content": "Finland has had increased online espionage attempts from Russia since Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, security services have said. Supo, the Finnish security and intelligence service, said the country faced various threats from Russia, including cyberattacks and disinformation. Last week, Supo said Russia was one of the most active perpetrators of intelligence operations targeting Finland, amid increased tensions after the country\u2019s accession to Nato and the war in Ukraine. \u201cRussia\u2019s espionage attempts towards us have increased during the war, mainly in the cybersphere,\u201d said Suvi Alvari, a senior analyst for Supo. Russia is understood to be shifting the focus of its intelligence collection to online activities after the expulsion of several diplomats from Helsinki. In June, the Finnish president announced the country was expelling nine people from the Russian embassy, saying \u201ctheir actions [were] contrary to the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations\u201d. Norway and Sweden have also expelled Russians in recent months amid claims they were intelligence officers. \u201cThere are quite a few immediate security issues or threats from Russia at this moment,\u201d Alvari said. \u201cWe see that Russia has increased motivation for intelligence towards us.\u201d Further cyberattacks were likely, she added. Significant areas of interest include Finnish Nato membership, support for Ukraine, and sanctions evasion through Finland. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious Russia has the capability in the cybersphere so we\u2019re prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cWe assess that it\u2019s likely that Russia will continue to use denial of service attacks [when hackers make information systems, devices and other resources inaccessible to legitimate users] towards us.\u201d The aim of such attacks was \u201cto create an image of malfunctioning services\u201d, Alvari said. \u201cBut we assess that it\u2019s unlikely that Russia would try to physically harm our critical infrastructure on Finnish soil in the near future.\u201d Sweden said on Monday that it was facing increased threats of cyberwarfare from Russia and other state actors. The Swedish armed forces\u2019 cyberdefence chief, Maj Gen Johan Pekkari, told the broadcaster SVT that the country was experiencing \u201cincreased activity in the cyber domain\u201d and preparing to protect critical infrastructure from future cyberattacks. In Finland, Alvari said the biggest change in relations with Russia since Finland joined Nato this year was \u201cRussia\u2019s attitude towards us \u2013 how Russia is speaking to us in public\u201d. Before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, she said, the two countries had \u201cfunctional relations\u201d, but now \u201cRussia considers us an unfriendly country [which] is something we haven\u2019t had for decades\u201d. With elections in Russia and Finland expected next spring, security services will be on guard for potential interference. But Supo has not so far seen any signs of it happening. Alvari said disinformation was used to project a negative image of Finland in state-run Russian media, to which Finland\u2019s 80,000-strong Russian-speaking population could be vulnerable. \u201cRussia wants to weaken the image of Finland in the eyes of its population and that\u2019s why there\u2019s a lot of negative reporting about us,\u201d she said. Last week, Finnish investigators said they could not rule out \u201ca state actor\u201d being responsible for damage to an undersea gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea. Putin has rejected any claim that Russia was behind it as \u201crubbish\u201d. In a statement released on Monday night, Finland\u2019s national bureau of investigation said its work was ongoing and that there were \u201cstill several lines of investigation\u201d. Then, on Tuesday, the Swedish authorities revealed that an undersea telecommunications cable between their country and Estonia had also been damaged. Sweden\u2019s civil defence minister, Carl-Oskar Bohlin, said the cause was unclear."

            "title": "Threat to Norway\u2019s migrant workers after new law faces challenge",
            "date": "2023-10-16T06:00:32Z",
            "content": "On a cloudy September afternoon, a string quartet plays the protest song Bella Ciao outside Oslo\u2019s parliament as a trade union demonstration gets under way. Protesters brandish placards reading: \u201cDefend permanent employment\u201d \u2013 a reference to a recent European Free Trade Association (Efta) surveillance authority decision that has put a question mark over a recent union victory. It is a small gathering to mark a seemingly obscure piece of legislation, but one with serious ramifications for the country\u2019s migrant workforce. For years, Norwegian trade unions lobbied the government to limit the exploitative potential of hiring agencies. Once rare in the country, these proliferated with the influx of eastern European immigrants in the past couple of decades. This year, the Labour government obliged, introducing a law that prohibits the use of hiring agencies by construction businesses in Oslo and the surrounding regions of Viken and Vestfold, and significantly limits the ability of all employers to use such agencies. But the Efta surveillance authority \u2013 an association between Norway, Lichenstein, Switzerland and Iceland, which operates parallel to the European Union \u2013 has said the law breaches the EEA agreement in place to create homogeneity with the EU. Efta\u2019s response has the potential to undermine the new law, which migrant workers say has already drastically improved their life. Jacek Pazdur first arrived in Oslo in 2003 after being told he could earn six times what he was earning in construction in Germany. He didn\u2019t even realise he was working for an agency until he found that the money arriving in his account was less than what was declared on his payslip. Sometimes he had to go for weeks without work or pay as there were no available projects. When he was hospitalised for 10 days with Covid in 2021, the agency refused to pay sick leave. \u201cI lost about 13,000 kroner [\u00a3975] in missing wages for each year I worked,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole system of agency employment is designed to take away the rights of migrant workers,\u201d says Joachim Espe, the leader of Norway\u2019s Construction Workers Union. \u201cIt has driven large-scale exploitation and pushed them into precarity.\u201d Three months ago, Pazdur received his first permanent contract as a direct result of the new law. \u201cIt\u2019s completely different now. I have stable hours and pay. I earn more. I can make plans for the future,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was still working at an agency, I would not be able to come here [to the protest]. I would have to work until much later. Besides, when the agency would find out that we had union meetings or protests, they would move us to remote projects so we wouldn\u2019t be able to attend.\u201d Oslo\u2019s population boom \u2013 the city has grown by 40% since the beginning of the century \u2013 sustains a healthy construction industry. Nearly 5% of people in Norway have found employment building the skyscrapers and family-friendly housing blocks that have sprung up over the past 20 years. In 2008, Norway\u2019s construction sector received another boost when Oslo authorities kicked off a regeneration project to transform the city\u2019s rundown waterfront into a sleek culture district, home to the marble opera house and the recently opened Munch Museum. Much of Oslo\u2019s new infrastructure was built by precariously employed migrants. Data suggests that more than a third of workers on Oslo\u2019s perpetually sprouting building sites were employed by agencies or subcontractors. Construction is the main employer among Poles, the country\u2019s largest migrant group. The new law is an attempt to curb exploitative practices within the industry and \u201cstrengthen serious and ordered working life\u201d, according to the labour and inclusion minister, Marte Mj\u00f8s Persen. But labour rights advocates are sceptical that the law alone will be effective in improving migrant workers\u2019 quality of life. \u201cThis law is good, but it doesn\u2019t help with working conditions for those workers who are already employed by a company with criminal intent,\u201d says Lars Mamen from Fair Play Bygg, an organisation advocating for the rights of construction workers. Employers routinely ignore the legal protections of workers already in place, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s common for employers to pay workers less than minimum wage. We come into contact with migrant workers who are not being paid at all.\u201d The protest at Oslo\u2019s parliament is not only about protecting this new law but also about many other ways in which the Norwegian state fails to protect the migrants who are constructing its capital city. EU workers were found to be at a higher risk of work-related death, homelessness and poverty, but simultaneously more likely to be denied state support to which they are entitled. A recent report by Kirkens Bymisjon, a charity fighting homelessness, found that most of Oslo\u2019s rough sleepers were EU migrants. However, union leaders worry that the Efta surveillance authority decision will act as a \u201cwet towel\u201d and discourage government from passing the expanded restrictions. \u201cI don\u2019t think this law is the solution to stopping the massive scale of work-related crime and worker exploitation,\u201d says Mamen, who would like to see more robust prosecution of employers found in breach of labour law. He also points to the lack of social security available to migrant workers. \u201cIf a migrant is judged to not have \u2018fixed domicile\u2019 in Norway \u2013 and there is no strict definition of what this means \u2013 they have no right to social support, temporary housing, or even a night shelter,\u201d says Mari Seilskj\u00e6r, a Kirkens Bymisjon researcher. \u201cIn Norway, Polish migrants are often not seen as residents entitled to protection but transient workers who are here to do a job and return to their home country,\u201d says Katrine Mayora Synnes, a sociologist at the University of Agder. In her research, she found that Polish workers struggled to access the benefits and protections to which they are legally entitled, and encountered hostility in the offices of the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration. At the recent protest, there was talk of how much more the state can do to help migrant workers. \u201cFirst, we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin,\u201d says Atle Rostad, a union representative of energy industry workers. \u201cThere\u2019s already a draft bill submitted to parliament to expand the current restrictions on Oslo building sites to other areas and industries.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about showing solidarity,\u201d says Ragnhild Nyegger, a builder who came to the union protest. \u201cBecause in Norway builders and migrants are not valued.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2023. The correct translation of the placard slogan referenced in the first paragraph is \u201cDefend permanent employment\u201d, not \u201cDemand permanent employment\u201d as an earlier version said. Also an earlier version omitted surveillance authority from the name of the European Free Trade Association surveillance authority, and mistakenly referred to the decision as a ruling. This has been corrected."

            "content": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has claimed Mohamed Salah has a physique that belies his years and an influence that continues to grow on and off the pitch at Liverpool. The phenomenal Salah set yet another record on Thursday when scoring the 43rd European goal of his Liverpool career in the 5-1 rout of Toulouse. He is now the all-time leading goalscorer in European competitions for an English club. Klopp says the 31-year-old has changed his game since the arrival of Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and departure of Roberto Firmino. The success of the adaptation, he insists, is testament to Salah\u2019s world-class talent. \u201cHe has been the man for us for a long time now,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cBut he is growing in the role he has for us in football and maybe in general to show that on top level it is nice to enjoy the moment and then you go again. That is what he is doing. \u201cThe young Mo was a super-fast player who could run in behind and play a role together with [Edin] Dzeko [at Roma]. From the first day here he had to do different things, he adapted extremely well, but the playmaker in that front row was probably more Bobby Firmino and you don\u2019t need then two players who are deeper. Now it is slightly different \u2013 especially when Darwin is playing we have another speed player up there \u2013 so that changed Mo\u2019s position. He is smart enough to adapt to all these things and there has been a massive development since he arrived. He was, in all phases, world class and that is probably the best thing you can say about a player.\u201d Klopp added: \u201cWe appreciate him and everyone will appreciate him even more after his career because then you will say: \u2018Wow, we saw something really special.\u2019\u201d Despite strong interest in Salah from Saudi Arabia that will not go away, Klopp believes the Egypt international can continue to flourish at a higher level with Liverpool for several more years. \u201cOff the pitch he behaves as a grown man, beyond that he is still a young player,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHe is top fit. I think if we were to scan him the majority of the bones would be aged 19 or 20! He just keeps himself in such good shape. \u201cWith Mo it is clear he understands the spaces much better, he knows how players react around him and, if he cannot score, he can still be a threat for us. Being constantly a threat is as important for us because that really opens up spaces for all the other boys. I cannot compare Mo to other 30-year-olds because I don\u2019t think biologically he is!\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-12T09:00:04Z",
            "content": "The Zimbabwean government has banned large gatherings in parts of the country and increased surveillance at ports of entry in an effort to contain a rise in cholera cases. With 100 suspected deaths, most of them in September, and nearly 5,000 possible cases of the water-borne disease in more than 41 districts, including Harare, authorities fear a repeat of the 2008 epidemic where 4,000 people died. \u201cWe are concerned that there is an outbreak. We need to step up our action,\u201d the government public health adviser Agnes Mahomva said. Manicaland, a province on the border with Mozambique, has recorded the highest number of cases \u2013 more than 1,000 \u2013 according to Tuesday\u2019s cabinet briefing with the government increasing cholera surveillance at ports of entry to detect any imported infections. Other areas such as Bikita, in Masvingo province, southern Zimbabwe, have been declared high risk zones. In Buhera district, large gatherings have been banned to contain the spread of the disease. No more than 50 people are allowed to attend funerals, and food cannot be served; people have also been told to avoid shaking hands, the government said last week. Government also advised the public in the provinces of Manicaland and Masvingo against attending open markets, social gatherings and outdoor church camps, where there is unlikely to be sanitation. \u201cWe continue to encourage the public to watch out and follow procedures to maintain their hygiene,\u201d said Mahomva, adding that the government is implementing a cholera response strategy around the country. Zimbabwe\u2019s perennial water shortages and an ailing sanitation system have triggered several cholera outbreaks in recent years. In some areas, especially in Harare and Bulawayo, people go for months without running water, while raw sewage is a common sight in townships. This has forced people to resort to unsafe water sources, including shallow wells which contain faecal matter from damaged sewer pipes. In Chitungwiza, a commuter town 15 miles (25km) from Harare, the stench of raw sewage fills the air and people fear their children will get sick. \u201cWe are tired of this sewage, it bursts all the time. Our children are now getting sick. This has been going on for a long time,\u201d Charles Manika, 43, said. His friend, Morehickson Manatse, 37, who runs a food cart, also fears he could be selling contaminated food as flies swarm the cooking area. \u201cWe are asking the council to fix this because we are not living like human beings. They do not live in areas infested with raw sewage themselves,\u201d said Manatse. In Harare, the townships of Budiriro and Glen View, west of the capital, have been declared red zones as they\u2019re considered high-risk areas. Although only 13 cases have been confirmed in Harare, with three hospitalised, the local authority has recorded a rise in suspected cases in the city. \u201cThe number of suspected cases is getting higher, but it is still mostly diarrhoea cases from the western suburbs. In Harare we have only had one fatality since the outbreak,\u201d said the Harare city council health director, Prosper Chonzi. Chonzi admitted that the quality of water in Harare \u201cleaves a lot to be desired\u201d. \u201cIt is contaminated with a number of things, faecal matter at times. Until we address those matters we will continue to have cholera outbreaks in Harare,\u201d he said. Inside a Harare infectious diseases hospital, the new Harare mayor, Ian Makone, is visiting some of the cholera patients receiving treatment. Frail and barely able to sit up, patients speak to the local authorities. \u201cIt started as a running stomach. I thought it was a normal bug but realised after tests that it was cholera. I am receiving treatment, nurses say I will recover,\u201d said a patient, who did not want to give his name."

            "content": "More than 75,000 healthcare workers at the US\u2019s largest non-profit private healthcare provider, Kaiser Permanente, are poised to strike on 4 October in the largest healthcare strike in US history. The workers\u2019 union contract expired at the weekend and staff are pushing for significant improvements to staffing levels and wage increases that account for recent high inflation. \u201cIt just seems like there is no concern for short-staffing and patient care. It\u2019s mind blowing to see Kaiser Permanente that was once an industry leader that liked to call themselves the gold standard of care, be so out of touch with employees, with their patients, and their more focused on putting profits over patient care,\u201d said Henry Perez, an intensive care unit secretary at Kaiser Permanente in Modesto, California, for about four years. The strike will hit hundreds of facilities in California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Virginia and Washington DC. The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions noted that if they don\u2019t see movement at the bargaining table in response to the strike, another longer strike that includes additional workers in Washington will be called. \u201cThey always praised us as healthcare heroes during the pandemic and now they\u2019re treating us like zeros by not bargaining in good faith,\u201d said Perez. He explained that working in an emergency care unit, there are days where he has to do the work of two, three or four other unit assistants, and short staffing has led to patients having long waits for assistance which poses a significant safety issue for them and claimed the problem has only worsened due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cOn top of having my unit I will have the entire hospital, which is 102 patients I\u2019m responsible for and it causes burnout, it causes mental anguish, it causes stress. I see my nurses I support and we\u2019re constantly running on fumes because of staffing,\u201d he added. Kaiser Permanente serves 12.7 million members in California, Washington, Oregon, Georgia, Hawaii, Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia. The non-profit has reported more than $3bn in profits in the first half of 2023 and has paid at least 49 corporate executives salaries exceeding $1m annually. Keven Dardon, a patient access representative at Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Sunnyside medical center in Clackamas, Oregon, for 14 years, said that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic his department was staffed with about 60 employees and now has been operating with less than 40 after cuts to the department, which has resulted in long lines and delays for patients trying to check into their appointments. \u201cIt\u2019s really taken a toll in the hospital setting and in the medical offices that we have here,\u201d said Dardon. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for. Our frontline employees are demanding Kaiser Permanente executives come to the table, we\u2019ve proposed the things that would fix the staffing issue, we\u2019ve made tons of proposals, but because our executives just aren\u2019t listening to us, they are just not coming to the table to even entertain those proposals.\u201d Jeffrey Melara, a teleservice representative for Kaiser Permanente in Sacramento, California, argued that Kaiser Permanente has been growing membership, but hasn\u2019t kept up staffing levels to handle it. \u201cWe want our patients to be safe and we want them to get the best care that they need,\u201d said Melara. \u201cNo one wants to strike. But we have to stand in solidarity because the executives that are making millions of dollars aren\u2019t thinking about anyone else but their own profit and their own increasing wages and not thinking about the rest of us, who are the patients and the staff.\u201d A spokesperson for Kaiser Permanente argued they lead total compensation in all markets where they operate and disputed short staffing crisis claims from workers and the union. \u201cDespite the acute shortage of health care workers nationally, we have been able to hire more than 50,000 frontline employees in the last two years: 29,000 people in 2022, and another 22,000 so far this year. Included in this year\u2019s new hires are more than 9,800 people hired into jobs represented by the coalition,\u201d said a Kaiser Permanente spokesperson in an email. They also noted they are continuing to bargain with the coalition to avert a strike but have contingency plans in place to continue providing care during the strike."

            "content": "By the time Israel\u2019s first retaliatory airstrike struck the Gaza Strip, Ron Finkel was already thinking two steps ahead. \u201cWe had to think \u2018what happens the day after\u2019,\u201d says the founder of the Australian charity, Project Rozana International, which has provided healthcare to Palestinians since 2013. \u201cWhenever that day after is, we need to be providing a response to the critical care needs.\u201d The charity is a player among a group of aid and development organisations anxiously waiting for the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip to reopen so they can send critical aid and start planning to rebuild what has been lost. Project Rozana has put forward a proposal to the Australian government for it to fund what the charity believes it can do to help: build a triage hospital in partnership with the Red Crescent (Red Cross) hospital in Gaza and upgrade its 20 ambulances. Only four of the hospital\u2019s ambulances are equipped to carry wounded people. The hope is the triage hospital can determine whether a patient can get the care they need in Gaza\u2019s hospitals, or if the level of care they need requires them to be taken to a hospital in East Jerusalem or Israel. It also wants to expand its current bus fleet, to help get critically ill Gazan residents to hospitals in East Jerusalem. \u201cThe initiative is to put in place something measurable, practical, and impactful,\u201d says Finkel. \u201cAnd also something that makes Australians feel that they\u2019re making a contribution and making a difference. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWe want to get this going immediately as soon as the opportunity allows.\u201d On Saturday, the foreign minister, Penny Wong, announced $10m in initial humanitarian funding to assist Palestinians in Gaza, with $3m to be committed to the Red Cross and $7m to the United Nations. The Australian Council for International Development has urged the Australian government to also call for a ceasefire, which the council\u2019s chief executive, Marc Purcell, said under the circumstances is \u201cis the only way that humanitarian access and civilian protection can be upheld\u201d. The government has called on Israel and Hamas to exercise restraint and protect civilian lives, but is yet to directly call for a ceasefire. On Monday, a resolution put forward by the Russian Federation in the UN\u2019s security council calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza was rejected by France, Japan, the US and the UK. Project Rozana International\u2019s plan builds on the existing work the charity already does to reveal the significant disparities between the healthcare systems in Israel and Gaza. A core part of its work, through a network of Palestinian and Jewish volunteers, is to take critically ill Gazan residents \u2013 particularly children who can\u2019t access cancer or dialysis treatment in Gaza \u2013 to hospitals in East Jerusalem. The former Australian of the year Dr Jamal Rifi, who works with the charity, says since the escalation between Hamas and Israel began none of the children the charity supports have been able to cross the border to get dialysis or cancer treatment. Israeli volunteers would meet the children and families at the border then take them the rest of the way to the hospital \u2013 but the volunteer network has also fractured amid the conflict\u2019s escalation. Rifi says they fear for the whereabouts of one of the volunteers, who was living in a kibbutz near the border and would take the children to hospital three times a week. They have not heard from her since the escalation began. \u201cWe have a cohort of patients who haven\u2019t had dialysis for the past two and a half weeks and we need to be ready for when we can get them there,\u201d says Rifi. When Rifi heard the news of the blast at the Gaza hospital that the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said killed at least 500 people and which both Israel and Hamas deny they caused, he said he felt physically ill, first and foremost at the loss and disregard for life. It was also another hit to a healthcare system that, before the conflict, was already \u201cdoing the best it could with what little it had\u201d. \u201cPalestinians are resilient people,\u201d says Rifi. \u201cThe doctors, they work hard and they don\u2019t do it for money but for the love of the profession. \u201cWithout any doubt they will work until exhaustion, but we need to be ready to relieve them.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-29T17:00:49Z",
            "content": "Soaring use of private healthcare for tests and treatments is piling pressure on overstretched GP surgeries, with family doctors warning that standard NHS care is being squeezed as a result. Record numbers of people are paying for private healthcare, with some having procedures such as cataract surgery and hip replacements, amid mounting frustration at NHS hospital waiting lists. Others are opting for private health checks, genetic testing or cosmetic surgery such as liposuction. But the surge in private healthcare use is increasing the workload of GPs, many of whom say they are increasingly having to interpret questionable health checks done privately, organise blood tests or scans and manage additional administration related to private care. Some say more of their hours are being taking up providing follow-up appointments after patients paid for treatment or surgery abroad. One GP said that \u201cNHS general practice is being abused and subsidising lucrative private practice that is charging patients extortionate fees\u201d. Another family doctor said having to deal with questionable medical requests for patients from private healthcare providers that \u201cwe don\u2019t clinically agree with\u201d was taking time and appointments away from standard NHS patients. Dr John Puntis, the co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign group, said: \u201cThis is a sorry picture not only of hard-pressed GPs having their workloads and stress levels unnecessarily increased, but also patients duped by the private sector into paying out cash for sometimes dubious tests, diagnoses and procedures without adequate provision for follow-up advice and care.\u201d The workload of almost half of GPs has grown as a result of people using more private healthcare, according to the results of a survey reviewed by the Guardian and undertaken by Pulse, the family doctors\u2019 magazine. In the survey of 860 GPs, 46% of family doctors report that their workload has increased amid the surge in private healthcare use. One in 10 said their workload had \u201csignificantly increased\u201d as a result. Dr Emma Nash, a GP in Portchester, Hampshire, said she had seen a huge increase in workload related to private healthcare. \u201cFirst, it\u2019s additional administrative workload for us \u2013 things like blood test requesting and reviewing results and communicating, as well as time spent reading extensive reports. This extra to our usual \u2013 already excessive \u2013 workload. \u201cHowever, the most frustrating bit is when we receive reports or requests that we don\u2019t clinically agree with or don\u2019t understand the rationale behind. These then do take appointments away from NHS patients because once we\u2019ve received information we can\u2019t \u2018un-know\u2019 it.\u201d Nash said this mainly applied when someone has a \u201cvast array of tests\u201d with a private health firm who then leave it to GPs to discuss the results with the patient. \u201cOther time is spent on consultations where the private clinician has recommended a referral. Sometimes this is inappropriate because the patient doesn\u2019t meet the criteria, other times it should have just been done by the private clinician. This can be a challenging consultation \u2013 again one that wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d Requesting tests is \u201cmore than just ticking boxes\u201d, Nash said. \u201cWe become legally responsible for reviewing, interpreting and acting on results which is time-consuming.\u201d She added: \u201cAlthough we are not obliged to do these tests or prescriptions, it can be very difficult when a patient has been told what to expect. The NHS has to pick up the products of private work \u2013 however appropriate or inappropriate they are. \u201cWhile not all aspects of this take away time provision for standard NHS care, many do. It\u2019s also the psychological impact of this workload too \u2013 we\u2019re already swamped by our own work \u2013 NHS-generated. This is an escalating problem that is eroding morale and contributing to burnout.\u201d Dr David Coleman, a GP in Doncaster, said private ADHD queries alone were generating a \u201ccouple of hours extra work every week for the practice at the moment\u201d. Dr Zishan Syed, a GP in Kent, said: \u201cNHS general practice is being abused and subsidising lucrative private practice that is charging patients extortionate fees while expecting GPs to soak up the complicated administrative work pro bono. This is ridiculous and makes a farce of the NHS and the taxpayer.\u201d Syed said current guidance on the private and NHS interface was \u201claughable\u201d. Nash also said the rules were \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. Cat Hobbs, the director of public-ownership campaign group We Own It, said: \u201cWe need the government to reinstate our NHS as a fully public service and fund it properly. Otherwise we will continue to drift into a wasteful, American-style two-tier system where our GPs increasingly can\u2019t cope.\u201d Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, warned the UK must \u201cguard against creating a two-tier system that favours those who can afford to pay and disadvantages those who can\u2019t\u201d but said she understood why some patients facing NHS waits turn to private healthcare. \u201cMany private clinics pass back results to the NHS, often via general practice, to be assessed and followed up,\u201d she added. \u201cSome private companies routinely advise clients to routinely speak with their NHS GP about their results or treatment, even when this has gone well, further adding to workload and leaving other patients facing even longer waiting times for a GP appointment.\u201d"

The former Republican representative, Joe Harding, faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but was sentenced to four months in federal prison. Following his prison sentence, Harding will have two years of supervised release, the Department of Justice said in a press release. Harding pleaded guilty in March to several charges, including wire fraud, for fraudulently collecting $150,000 in pandemic relief funds earmarked for small businesses. Harding\u2019s brother-in-law, Patrick Walsh, was sentenced to more than five years in prison for a separate scheme to obtain small-business funds during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the justice department. Walsh fraudulently received nearly $5m in pandemic-related aid. Federal prosecutors accused Harding of providing false information to obtain Covid-19 small business-relief funds. Harding applied for loans in 2020 with the Small Business Administration (SBA) for a company called the Vak Shack Inc, but Vak Shack had not been in business in 2019 or 2020, the Tampa Bay Times reported. He also attempted to fraudulently obtain a loan for a second business, but was denied. Harding was first elected to Florida\u2019s house of representatives in 2020 and re-elected for a second term in 2022, the Tampa Bay reported. He was indicted in December 2022, shortly into his second term and later resigned from office. Harding gained national attention for sponsoring Florida\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill, legislation that LGBTQ+ advocates have denounced as discriminatory and harmful. The notorious legislation outlawed the teaching of sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. The ban was later expanded to all grade levels, after being approved by the Florida board of education in April. Georgia lawmakers attempted to pass a similar bill last March that would prohibit education on sexual orientation and gender identity in private schools. The law is one of many passed in the past year that target LGBTQ+ rights in Florida, including legislation signed in May by the governor, Ron DeSantis, banning gender-affirming care for anyone under the age of 18. The law, which also places restrictions on treatments adults can receive for gender dysphoria, has already faced legal action."

            "date": "2023-10-31T19:08:46Z",
            "content": "Even given all that is already known about poor decision-making, avoidable deaths, lockdown-breaking parties and atrocious procurement, the evidence being related to the Covid inquiry has the power to shock. Though Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are not due to testify for a few more weeks, the reflections of Dominic Cummings, Lee Cain and other key figures at No 10 shine an unforgiving spotlight on the heart of government. On Monday it was revealed that Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, described the \u201cEat out to help out\u201d scheme launched in August 2020 as \u201cEat out to help out the virus\u201d. On Tuesday Mr Cummings said that the prime minister was routinely described as \u201cthe trolley\u201d \u2013 a reference to his erratic nature and chaotic changes of policy direction. From the man who went from being Mr Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser to his enemy, such contempt might be viewed as sour grapes. But a diary kept by Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, revealed that he too saw Mr Johnson as \u201cweak and indecisive\u201d. Simon Case, the cabinet secretary whose evidence has been delayed for health reasons, complained that Johnson \u201ccannot lead\u201d. Mr Cain, the former head of communications, put it more gently when he told the inquiry that the pandemic was the \u201cwrong crisis for his skillset\u201d. Questions to Mr Cummings from Hugo Keith KC rightly probed the sequence of events leading up to the about-turn in mid-March 2020, when it was decided that a policy of mitigation had been a mistake and a lockdown began to be envisaged. Mr Cummings\u2019 disdain for Whitehall is well known, so his criticisms of \u201cPotemkin\u201d meetings, conducted for show and little else, were unsurprising. So were his views on \u201cpop-ins\u201d to the prime minister\u2019s office by civil servants eager to influence him. But his account of inconsistent data, communication failures between the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies and Downing Street, and the lack of pandemic planning, all point to problems that go beyond personalities. So does the well-documented hiatus in mid-February, when the prime minister and numerous others went on holiday in the midst of a national crisis. Such complacency is inexcusable. But it was never the whole story, as political calculations continued to influence decision-making alongside scientific evidence. Lord Bethell, a former health minister, said this week that Mr Johnson treated the pandemic as secondary to Brexit. Witnesses at the inquiry have described his oscillation between a libertarian impulse to \u201clet the virus rip\u201d \u2013 partly on grounds that those most likely to die were already old \u2013 and a more cautious approach that put public health first. This seesaw went beyond the chaotic early months. In one message, Mr Case referred to the prime minister\u2019s wish to abandon restrictions as \u201cTrump-Bolsonaro levels of mad and dangerous\u201d. Such recklessness was not limited to No 10. Sir Gavin Williamson, then the education secretary, was said to have rejected mask-wearing in schools on the quite disgraceful grounds that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to give an inch to the unions\u201d \u2013 a bullish approach endorsed by Matt Hancock and Grant Shapps. The inquiry has a long way to run. The situation in Gaza, among other factors, means it is not dominating headlines in the way that might have been expected. But judging from this week\u2019s evidence, there are huge lessons to be learned not only about appalling errors in the way the pandemic was handled, but also about the Conservative party in government."

            "title": "Scotland\u2019s government pushed to release all its pandemic WhatsApp messages",
            "date": "2023-10-26T14:25:19Z",
            "content": "The Scottish government has been ordered to release all its WhatsApp messages from during the coronavirus pandemic after it failed to disclose them to the UK Covid inquiry. The inquiry heard on Thursday that none of the private messages written during the Covid crisis by Nicola Sturgeon, who was then first minister, or by her health and finance ministers, had been disclosed despite repeated requests dating to 2022. Jamie Dawson KC, the Scottish counsel to the inquiry, said there were suggestions these messages had been deleted, potentially in breach of the rules on retaining government records. His intervention sparked a heated row at Holyrood where Humza Yousaf, the first minister, was challenged by Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative party leader, to explain why the devolved government had failed to disclose any messages. If they had been deliberately withheld \u201cit would be a shocking display of secrecy, it would potentially break the law\u201d, said Ross. Yousaf denied there had been an attempt to withhold material and said that morning he had appointed Ruth Charteris KC, the Scottish government\u2019s solicitor general, to investigate. Yousaf said he, his ministers and his officials were aware of their legal duties to retain that information and knew they were bound by a \u201cdo not destroy\u201d policy. \u201cI can give an absolute assurance to those families listening, where we hold any relevant information that will be passed on,\u201d he said. This row has strong echoes of the long-running dispute between the Scottish government and a special Holyrood committee set up to investigate the inquiry into alleged sexual misconduct by the former first minister Alex Salmond in 2020. There were repeated arguments between MSPs on the committee and Sturgeon\u2019s, deputy, John Swinney, over the failure to find and then release government papers, culminating in a legal battle over disclosure of the government\u2019s legal advice. Speaking on Thursday morning, Dawson said it appeared that 137 messaging groups had been used during the pandemic, with the conduct of about 70 Scottish witnesses now under scrutiny, including officials at Public Health Scotland agency. The inquiry had struggled to understand what the government\u2019s policies and practices were, because its replies to the inquiry\u2019s requests for information, about who used these messaging apps and how, were incomplete or vague. He said that three weeks ago the Scottish government suddenly said it needed a formal order under section 21 of the Inquiries Act 2005 before it could release this kind of information, because of data privacy concerns. \u201cThe inquiry expects that what has ultimately been provided to us by the Scottish government comprises the full disclosure which the first minister promised would be provided,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cIf it transpires that this is not the case, the inquiry will wish to know why.\u201d Dawson said the inquiry \u201cintend to keep an open mind\u201d about the content of those messages but said it was surprising so much had been destroyed when the UK government\u2019s WhatsApp messages were largely retained. \u201cA clear theme of the overall response received from and via the Scottish government is that although such messaging systems were used in the pandemic response, including by some key decision-makers and others, generally very few messages appear to have been retained,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is surprising, in particular in light of the apparent availability of such messages in high volumes within the UK government.\u201d Aamer Anwar, the solicitor for the Scottish Covid Bereaved group, which is a formal participant in the inquiry, described Dawson\u2019s disclosures as \u201cdevastating\u201d. He said: \u201cThe families we represent deserve the truth. The Scottish Covid bereaved find it inconceivable that the most senior figures in the Scottish government from Sturgeon, Swinney, and [finance secretary] Kate Forbes, to the present first minister, Yousaf, failed to retain their WhatsApp messages over the two-year period of the pandemic.\u201d"

            "content": "Israel says it has refused a visa to the UN humanitarian affairs chief, Martin Griffiths, as a result of comments at the UN by secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said on army radio: \u201cDue to his remarks we will refuse to issue visas to UN representatives. We have already refused a visa for the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs Martin Griffiths. The time has come to teach them a lesson.\u201d Israel called on UN secretary general Guterres to resign after he said the \u201cappalling attacks\u201d by Hamas against Israel on 7 October cannot justify the \u201ccollective punishment of the Palestinian people\u201d, and spoke of \u201cthe clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza\u201d. Guterres had said: \u201cNothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians \u2013 or the launching of rockets against civilian targets. All hostages must be treated humanely and released immediately and without conditions.\u201d Addressing the UN, the secretary-general went on to say the attack on Israel did not happen \u201cin a vacuum\u201d and followed \u201c56 years of suffocating occupation\u201d for the Palestinian people by Israel, adding: \u201cThey have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.\u201d Erdan said Guterres should resign, calling the speech \u201cshocking\u201d, saying \u201che views the massacre committed by Nazi Hamas terrorists in a distorted and immoral manner\u201d. The Palestinian Authority\u2019s foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki, a rival of Hamas, denounced inaction by the UN security council. \u201cThe ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel \u2013 the occupying power against the Palestinian civilian population under illegal occupation \u2013 must be stopped. It is our collective human duty to stop them,\u201d he said. The UN\u2019s agency for the relief of Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) last night warned it would be forced to halt its operations in Gaza due to a lack of fuel as of Wednesday night. UNRWA also said that its shelters are now four times over-capacity, with more than 600,000 internally displaced people sheltering in 150 facilities. It said \u201cmany people are sleeping in the streets as current facilities are overwhelmed\u201d. In response, Israel\u2019s military posted a picture of what it said were fuel tanks inside Gaza. \u201cThey contain more than 500,000 litres of fuel,\u201d it wrote. \u201cAsk Hamas if you can have some.\u201d Israel\u2019s ambassador to Australia has insisted the humanitarian situation in Gaza is \u201cfair\u201d after the Australian foreign minister Penny Wong\u2019s warning that the besieged strip had \u201cnowhere near enough\u201d access to aid supplies. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said 6,546 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip by Israeli airstrikes since 7 October, including 2,704 children. The figure includes 756 people \u2013 344 of whom were children \u2013 killed in the last 24 hours. It said 17,439 had been wounded in total. It has not been possible for media organisations to independently verify the casualty figures being issued from Gaza. The rate of death and injuries of children in Gaza is \u201csimply staggering\u201d, Unicef\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and north Africa has said. The UN\u2019s children\u2019s organisation said that a reported 2,360 children had been killed in Gaza due to \u201cunrelenting attacks\u201d. Adele Khodr said the number of child casualties were a \u201cgrowing stain on our collective conscience\u201d. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has told a group of MPs from his Justice and Development party (AKP) that Hamas is not a terrorist organisation, Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza are \u201csavage\u201d, and that he has cancelled a planned trip to Israel. Turkey\u2019s president was swiftly criticised for the comments, which Italian deputy PM labelled as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani of Qatar expressed the hope that there might be some movement on the release of hostages \u201csoon\u201d. He condemned what he termed \u201cthe collective punishment policy\u201d inflicted by Israel on Gaza, saying that the only way to reach a peaceful solution in Gaza is to keep communication channels open. Eight aid trucks were allowed into Gaza late Tuesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said as the US President, Joe Biden, said efforts to deliver help via a crossing from Egypt were \u201cnot fast enough\u201d. The UN had earlier said about 20 trucks had been unable to cross into Gaza from Egypt via the Rafah crossing. Eight Syrian military personnel have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on Deraa, Syrian state media has reported. The strikes targeted the Daraa countryside overnight, and came from the direction of the Golan Heights. Syrian state TV also reported an Israeli air attack targeted Aleppo international airport. Three people were killed in the West Bank, medics have said, after the Israeli military launched a drone attack on what it said was a group of armed Palestinians who \u201cfired and hurled explosive devices\u201d. The Israeli military has accused Iran of having ordered recent attacks by Tehran-backed militias in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. It also claimed Iran was providing Hamas in Gaza with intelligence, and helping stoke anti-Israel sentiment globally with an online messaging campaign. Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said the 2023-24 national budget was \u201cno longer relevant\u201d given the war against Hamas and would be amended. He put the direct cost of the war at $246m a day (\u00a3202m/\u20ac232m). French president Emmanuel Macron will meet today the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo. Czech prime minister Petr Fiala and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer are to arrive in Israel. Commentators have speculated that the stream of international leaders arriving in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem may also be partly aimed at delaying the expected ground invasion of Gaza. Pope Francis has renewed his calls for the release of hostages held by Hamas and for humanitarian aid to be allowed into the Gaza Strip. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has written to prime ministers and presidents across the EU ahead of a summit tomorrow afternoon to express \u201cgrave concern\u201d at the growing crisis in Gaza. UK immigration minister Robert Jenrick has suggested that visitors to the UK will be removed if they incite antisemitism, even if their conduct falls \u201cbelow the criminal standard\u201d. The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has said on social media that a plane delivering humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians is en route to Egypt. A Palestinian American woman whose six-year-old son was killed in a Chicago suburb in what police called a hate crime has asked the public to \u201cpray for peace\u201d as she recovers from her injuries."

            "content": "And that is that. Congratulations to Wales on winning Pool C and sealing a quarter-final in Marseille next Saturday. And well done to Georgia on putting up a very decent showing today. Niall McVeigh has England v Samoa, live and direct, right here: Au revoir. Hamish Stuart is on the scene for us in Nantes. Here\u2019s the match report: Peter Jackson points out that Big George North will make history with his fourth straight Rugby World Cup quarter-final appearance next weekend: FINAL SCORE. Sheer simplicity from the WRU\u2019s social team. Gareth Davies\u2019 attempt to tackle Niniashvili before the third Georgian try was certainly notable for its amateurishness. He won\u2019t enjoy that one in the video analysis room. Overall Wales look in excellent physical shape, as I mentioned earlier, but that performance will also give any quarter-final opponent hope that they can cause Gatland\u2019s side problems. \u201cUnless and until Welsh players tackle properly there will always be a likelihood of conceding tries and penalties that would otherwise be avoided,\u201d emails Leigh. \u201cThe standing up \u201ctackle\u201d is ineffective and potentially dangerous. Welsh defensive play is awful at times. Lydiate\u2019s low, hard, chop tackles are the way to go.\u201d Rees-Zammit\u2019s hat-trick sees him join Darcy Graham (Scotland), Damien McKenzie (New Zealand) and Henry Arundell (England) on five tries. They\u2019re all joint second in the race for the golden, er, something. Damian Penaud has six for France and tops the charts. We\u2019ll have a match report coming up soon. Later today there is the small matter of England v Samoa, followed by Ireland v Scotland, which has all the potential to be a classic. Georgia fail to repeat their heroics of Cardiff last November, but they certainly made a game of it. Wales had a mixed afternoon, and there will be areas of concern for Gatland, but qualifying as pool winners with four wins out of four is not to be sniffed at. Wales\u2019s quarter-final will be at 4pm UK time next Saturday in Marseille. They will face either Japan or Argentina. It\u2019s there! Big George North gets the try his excellent performance deserves, nipping in around the covering defence on the right wing. Costelow converts. And that\u2019s it. 77 min: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the TMO cock up like VAR,\u201d emails Phil Haran. \u201cMost people think TMO is always right!\u201d \u201cOne just has the feeling that if Georgia had scored those last two Rees-Zammit tries, they would have been brought back for a forward pass and no downward pressure,\u201d chips in Hugh Molloy. Well well well. Rees-Zammit chases a kick into the in-goal area. Kveseladze is there too. It looks like the wing knocks the ball on as he stoops down, with the ball also ricocheting off Kveseladze\u2019s foot. Anyway, the TMO has a look and awards the try. The conversion is missed. But Wales have this match in the bag. It has, however, been a proper test. Both teams down to 14 for the remainder of the match. 70 min: A huge fight kicks off with more than 20 players involved. Taine Basham starts it with a neck-grab on Niniashvili, who has the ball. Niniashvili reacts angrily, which seems fair enough to me. Everyone piles in and it looks like a few punches are thrown in the melee. Or certainly a few leading elbows. Raynal, the referee, chooses to send both Basham and Niniashvili to the sin bin. Niniashvili reacts with some disbelief at being sent for a sit down for 10 minutes. 70 min: The attacking bonus point for four tries means Wales will top Pool C. Their quarter-final is in Marseille in seven days\u2019 time. Order, from a Welsh perspective, is restored. The full-back Liam Williams bursts down the right wing and chips ahead. Rees-Zammit comfortably has the gas to outpace the covering defenders, gather the ball and dive over the line to touch down. Costelow converts and Williams is immediately withdrawn from the action. Mason Grady comes on. 65 min: Wales get a penalty and Costelow will kick. It\u2019s right in the middle of the field and very kickable, but he scuffs it, doesn\u2019t get the distance, and Georgia can clear. 63 min: Dee, Smith, Thomas, Basham and the aforementioned Gareth Davies are all on for Wales now. Karkadze, Abuladze, Aptisiauri, Chachanidze, Aprasidze and Tapladze are on for Georgia. Wow! Costelow hands the initiative to Georgia again when he makes a hash of a clearing kick. From the resulting lineout, Niniashvili gets a head of steam up running down the left wing, he palms off a poor attempted tackle by Gareth Davies, and has a clear run to the line where he swan dives over! Conversion missed, but Georgia can win this! Georgia make progress down the left wing. They win an attacking lineout, again, five metres out. And this time they nail it! Vano Karkadze, the replacement hooker, delivers the ball to the lineout and then joins the drive for the try-line. He gets his hands on the pill and flops over! Matkava converts. Have we got a game on again?! 53 min: Tabutsadze, the wing, is nearly in at the corner for Georgia on the right! But he\u2019s marginally forced into touch by some desperate last-ditch defending. Georgia immediately come again, on the left this time, and Tabutsadze is at it again, jinking past a tackle or two and making inroads into the Welsh 22. But again Gatland\u2019s side scramble sufficiently well to keep Georgia out. There is no question that Wales look extremely fit, and their defence has largely been exemplary. 52 min: Raynal awards Georgia a penalty at that scrum. They kick for the corner but Wales steal their lineout ball again. Very frustrating for the Georgian coaching team, not to mention their fans, and the players, and even the neutrals, and probably another group of people I\u2019ve forgotten. 50 min: There is a scrum. It\u2019s reset once or twice. The stadium DJ is playing a bit of Freddie Mercury call-and-response, to give the crowd something to do. 47 min: I think we can safely say that Wales are going to be top of Pool C. They need one more try for an attacking bonus, but even if Georgia were (for example) to score 25 unanswered points and win the match, Wales would still top the pool with a losing bonus point. Georgia begin the half in determined style. They keep the ball in the hands and move the ball right, moving into contact with plenty of intent and also keeping the attack moving smoothly \u2026 but then Kveseladze, the No 13, whips an attempted pass back in the other direction, from right to left. It\u2019s a horrible effort that bounces up and finds George North\u2019s hands, and the Georgian defence is completely exposed when Louis Rees-Zammit gets the ball thanks to a simple pass from North. The Gloucester wing runs in a try from long distance with utter nonchalance. \u201cThe Welsh diaspora in Zambia are watching the match,\u201d says Stephen Bickers on Twitter. \u201cBut we also think those passes were forward!\u201d What \u2013 all of them? Good to have you on board anyway. Will Gatland be happy with that? Yes and no. Wales were firmly in control for most of the half, but Georgia impressively fought back in the final 10 minutes or so, and Sharikadze\u2019s try has put them in with a shout. See you soon for more. 39 min: Faletau clumsily spills the ball in contact around the Wales 22. Georgia nab it and attack into the danger zone. Tomos Williams makes a good tackle on the No 6, Gachechiladze, and Wales immediately turn the ball back over. Raynal awards Georgia a scrum put-in and it\u2019s a promising position for them, but then a penalty comes for a high tackle, and that\u2019s half time. This is a tremendous score for the Lelos, considering how much pressure they have been under. They get the lineout right, five metres out, and form a driving maul. Wales hold firm for quite some time, but then Georgia spin the ball through the hands into the middle of the pitch after someone makes a dart from the side of the maul. The captain Sharikadze has plenty of work to do when he gets his mitts on the ball about five metres out but manages to power through a challenge and touch down. Excellent try. Matkava converts, and we have a ball game. 33 min: For the first time Georgia get some attacking continuity together. Niniashvili has a dart on the right wing and stoops into a tackle \u2013 it\u2019s what might be considered a high hit but the referee tells him he\u2019s \u201cfalling down\u201d so there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. Lineout for Georgia five metres out now \u2026 30 min: Big George North is a livewire once again with the ball in hand and offers up an offload for Costelow to run on to. Williams is then wrapped up by a big tackle and I think the referee, Raynal, has a check with the TMO about that or something else. I\u2019m watching on French telly so I don\u2019t have the luxury of English commentary. The young fly-half has slotted into this side seamlessly, which is not easy to do when you didn\u2019t expect to start. He\u2019s three from three off the tee and created the second try with a wonderful pass to Williams too. A strong scrum for Wales leads to a move down the blindside with Dyer, again, having a glimpse of space out wide. Faletau then takes it up but is driven back into touch by two or three tacklers. Wales manage to win the resulting lineout, Tomos Williams feeds his No 10, Costelow, and Costelow in turn loops a lovely pass to Liam Williams in plenty of space. The full-back is a vision of composure as he jinks beyond one tackler and touches down with another opponent threatening, but not succeeding, to make a tackle. Costelow strokes the conversion through the posts. This is ominous for Georgia. A neat lineout move sets up a driving maul for Wales from five metres which Georgia do well to repel initially. Wales keep the ball in hand, though, and Francis crashes through a tackle to score from a couple of metres out. Costelow converts. That was a powerful and efficient score of the sort that reduced Australia to a quivering mess. 13 min: Mike Forshaw, the Wales defence coach, spoke about how well Georgia defended against Fiji. They are picking up where they left off and staying very solid. As I type, space opens up for Wales on the left wing, and it looks like Rio Dyer might have a run at the line. But sure enough another Georgian tackler appears. 11 min: George North, AKA \u201cBig\u201d George North, has a run towards a cluster of would-be tacklers in midfield. He shows lovely footwork to step away from a couple of them but is eventually scragged. 9 min: Wales enjoy some territory around the Georgia 22, working through a few attacking phases with some carrying down the middle. Costelow then tries a grubber kick for a couple of back line colleagues to chase but he overcooks it and it squirts harmlessly out in-goal. It remains scoreless. 7 min: It\u2019s been an all-action start. It doesn\u2019t look like a match with nothing riding on it, and I guess that\u2019s because it\u2019s not. Wales can secure top spot and Georgia can restore a huge amount of pride with a win. Georgia win an attacking lineout cleanly and spin the ball out to the right but the Welsh defence is well positioned to keep them out. 4 min: Liam Williams is hit in the air and ends up in a heap. Initially it looks like he might be badly hurt but he has a quick lie down and then gets up. Raynal, the referee, has a few words with both teams and awards a penalty against Dewi Lake for a neck roll, I think. 2 min: Wales kick off. Georgia box kick. Costelow of Wales kicks it back. Luka Matkava, the Georgia No 10, has a run from deep but is swiftly munched by some strong Welsh tackling. Here we go. Huw Thomas has some thoughts on Wales strategy: \u201c1. Keep it tight 2. Throw it about when it\u2019s won - act like the perennial World Cup winners - ruthless, clinical and focused.\u201d Works for me. Georgia\u2019s team belt out their anthem. There was a lot of hugging going on in the changing room five minutes ago too. Rest assured, they are up for this. Here come the teams. It\u2019s a quite frankly ludicrous 27C in a very sunny Nantes, and will be hotter than that in the stadium. Time for the anthems. Wales fans, what are you thoughts on today, and indeed what are your expectations for the last eight? You can email me or tweet @LukeMcLaughlin Will Rowlands, who is joining Racing 92, was asked this week if he is enjoying a taste of French culture at the World Cup. \u201cVery much so,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible month out here, I\u2019ve loved the four cities we\u2019ve been to. Great support, great atmosphere everywhere and I\u2019m very excited to continue to journey. My French [learning] is on the go. I used to speak ok French when I was at school so it\u2019s rusty but the basics are there.\u201d Bien. Terrible luck for Anscombe, but a great opportunity for the 22-year-old Sam Costelow of the Scarlets, who began his career at Leicester Tigers and to date has six caps for Wales. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of work with Neil Jenkins in training,\u201d Costelow told the WRU website in August. \u201cHe has been helping me with kicking and the game-management side of things. It is about keeping on improving.\u201d Wale\u2019s selected fly-half, Gareth Anscombe, has injured his groin in the warm-up and has been ruled out at the last minute. That means Sam Costelow starts at No 10 and Dan Biggar is drafted into the replacements. (The official team announcement mentioned that Biggar is injured, but that was of course five days ago \u2026) And here is the Wales v Georgia preview wot I wrote yesterday. Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes, of course, was the venue when Fiji stunned Wales back in 2007. And Wales have the memory of last year\u2019s defeat by Georgia still fairly fresh in their minds. In the parallel universe in which Wales needed to win this to stay in the tournament, the omens would not be looking good. In Lyon last night, France hammered Italy to reach the last eight: While Ireland and Scotland will duke it out for a quarter-final spot in Paris ce soir: Six changes for Wales, with the co-captain Dewi Lake slotting into the front row at hooker, and Gareth Anscombe starting at fly-half in place of the injured Dan Biggar. Tommy Reffell, the scrum-half Tomos Williams and wing Rio Dyer are also in. Warren Gatland, in what might be described as a statement of intent, named his team five days ago. Five changes for Georgia following their gutsy loss against Fiji last weekend. The coach Levan Maisashvili has given Guram Gogichashvili and Shalva Mamukashvili the nod in the front row, while Nodar Cheishvili comes in at lock. The captain, Merab Sharikadze, returns at inside-centre while full-back Lasha Khmaladze makes his first appearance at Rugby World Cup 2023. Wales: L Williams; Rees-Zammit, North, Tompkins, Dyer; Anscombe, T Williams; G Thomas, Lake (capt.), Francis, Rowlands, D Jenkins, Wainwright, Reffell, Faletau. Replacements: Dee, Smith, H Thomas, Tshiunza, Basham, G Davies, Costelow, Grady. Georgia: Khmaladze; Tabutsadze, Kveseladze, Sharikadze (capt.), Niniashvili; Matkava, Lobzhanidze; Gogichashvili, Mamukashvili, Gigashvili, Cheishvili, Mikautadze, Gachechiladze, Saginadze, Jalagonia. Replacements: Karkadze, Abuladze, Aptsiauri, Chachanidze, Tsutskiridze, Aprasidze, Abzhandadze, Tapladze. Referee: Mathieu Raynal (Fra) Today\u2019s game comes with a pleasing lack of jeopardy for Wales who are safely through to the quarter-finals. Warren Gatland\u2019s resurgent side require just a point from this match to assure top billing in Pool C, but whatever happens they are into the last eight. Similarly, there is not very much riding on this for Georgia, in view of the fact they are already eliminated. A second win against Wales in the space of a year would be an immensely satisfying way to sign off, however, following defeats by Australia and Fiji and a memorable draw with Portugal. Levan Maisashvili\u2019s side are unlikely to get much change from a group of Wales players who fancy their chances of a deep tournament run, though, while Gatland has the luxury of managing resources before their assault on the knockout stages. Who knows \u2013 it might be close \u2013 it might even be fun. Team news and more coming up. Kick-off: 2pm UK time"

After questions emerged from the UK Covid inquiry whether the former Scottish first minister had kept all her WhatsApp messages, there were reports at the weekend they had all been deleted. The inquiry\u2019s Scottish counsel, Jamie Dawson KC, stated that WhatsApp messages from 70 ministers and officials, including senior public health officers \u2013 some of whom were involved in 137 WhatsApp groups \u2013 had not been disclosed despite repeated requests. \u201cVery few messages appear to have been retained,\u201d he said, potentially in breach of requests to retain the records and legal orders to keep them, which were issued later. In her first public statement about the allegations, Sturgeon insisted she was committed to \u201cfull transparency\u201d about her conduct during the pandemic, adding: \u201cI have nothing to hide.\u201d Yet, flanked by her former deputy John Swinney, she was asked four times by reporters at Holyrood whether she had kept or deleted her WhatsApp messages and on each occasion refused to say. On Monday, Humza Yousaf, her successor as first minister, said publicly he had kept all his WhatsApp messages and was providing them to the UK inquiry, adding to the pressure on Sturgeon. She stated on Tuesday she followed all the necessary rules and was in the process of writing her third statement to the inquiry. She would be in breach of her obligations of confidentiality to the inquiry if she disclosed what that evidence said, she added. \u201cI will be very clear to the inquiry what I hold and what I don\u2019t hold and why that is the case but let me say again, I wasn\u2019t a member of any WhatsApp groups,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t manage the Covid response by WhatsApp.\u201d The uncertainties over Sturgeon\u2019s handling of her messages will be central to the evidence she is expected to give to the UK inquiry early next year. In May 2020 Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, pledged there would be a public inquiry. In May 2021 the UK Covid inquiry was formally confirmed; lawyers for the Covid bereaved believe that should have triggered a formal data retention rule for ministers. In August 2021 Sturgeon promised all WhatsApp messages would be kept for a future Scottish public inquiry. In November 2021, the UK inquiry issued its first do-not-destroy instructions. In June 2021, and again in February and October 2022, the UK government wrote to all devolved governments asking for all data to be retained."

            "content": "The Scottish government has been ordered to release all its WhatsApp messages from during the coronavirus pandemic after it failed to disclose them to the UK Covid inquiry. The inquiry heard on Thursday that none of the private messages written during the Covid crisis by Nicola Sturgeon, who was then first minister, or by her health and finance ministers, had been disclosed despite repeated requests dating to 2022. Jamie Dawson KC, the Scottish counsel to the inquiry, said there were suggestions these messages had been deleted, potentially in breach of the rules on retaining government records. His intervention sparked a heated row at Holyrood where Humza Yousaf, the first minister, was challenged by Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative party leader, to explain why the devolved government had failed to disclose any messages. If they had been deliberately withheld \u201cit would be a shocking display of secrecy, it would potentially break the law\u201d, said Ross. Yousaf denied there had been an attempt to withhold material and said that morning he had appointed Ruth Charteris KC, the Scottish government\u2019s solicitor general, to investigate. Yousaf said he, his ministers and his officials were aware of their legal duties to retain that information and knew they were bound by a \u201cdo not destroy\u201d policy. \u201cI can give an absolute assurance to those families listening, where we hold any relevant information that will be passed on,\u201d he said. This row has strong echoes of the long-running dispute between the Scottish government and a special Holyrood committee set up to investigate the inquiry into alleged sexual misconduct by the former first minister Alex Salmond in 2020. There were repeated arguments between MSPs on the committee and Sturgeon\u2019s, deputy, John Swinney, over the failure to find and then release government papers, culminating in a legal battle over disclosure of the government\u2019s legal advice. Speaking on Thursday morning, Dawson said it appeared that 137 messaging groups had been used during the pandemic, with the conduct of about 70 Scottish witnesses now under scrutiny, including officials at Public Health Scotland agency. The inquiry had struggled to understand what the government\u2019s policies and practices were, because its replies to the inquiry\u2019s requests for information, about who used these messaging apps and how, were incomplete or vague. He said that three weeks ago the Scottish government suddenly said it needed a formal order under section 21 of the Inquiries Act 2005 before it could release this kind of information, because of data privacy concerns. \u201cThe inquiry expects that what has ultimately been provided to us by the Scottish government comprises the full disclosure which the first minister promised would be provided,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cIf it transpires that this is not the case, the inquiry will wish to know why.\u201d Dawson said the inquiry \u201cintend to keep an open mind\u201d about the content of those messages but said it was surprising so much had been destroyed when the UK government\u2019s WhatsApp messages were largely retained. \u201cA clear theme of the overall response received from and via the Scottish government is that although such messaging systems were used in the pandemic response, including by some key decision-makers and others, generally very few messages appear to have been retained,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is surprising, in particular in light of the apparent availability of such messages in high volumes within the UK government.\u201d Aamer Anwar, the solicitor for the Scottish Covid Bereaved group, which is a formal participant in the inquiry, described Dawson\u2019s disclosures as \u201cdevastating\u201d. He said: \u201cThe families we represent deserve the truth. The Scottish Covid bereaved find it inconceivable that the most senior figures in the Scottish government from Sturgeon, Swinney, and [finance secretary] Kate Forbes, to the present first minister, Yousaf, failed to retain their WhatsApp messages over the two-year period of the pandemic.\u201d"

Questions about how lockdown policies affected young people \u201cweren\u2019t even asked\u201d, said the barrister Jennifer Twite, giving evidence on behalf of Save the Children UK, Just for Kids Law and the Children\u2019s Rights Alliance. Twite said: \u201cWe fear that the answer does not simply lie in the erratic decision-making and the failures of Mr Johnson or the distractions of Brexit. Although we accept those are unlikely to have helped.\u201d Instead young people fell foul of systemic failings, she said. \u201cWhose role was it to consider the interests of children and make sure their needs were not forgotten in a crisis?\u201d Twite asked. Children were at the back of the queue when the government made its biggest decisions about lockdown and reopening the economy, said Twite. Prioritisation of venues meant that pubs, restaurants and sports clubs were allowed to reopen before schools, nurseries and other places for children\u2019s activities. The 1:1 rule, where adults were allowed to meet a friend outside, meant that younger children who needed supervising were not able to do the same, Twite said. The lack of consideration disproportionately affected children in poverty who were isolated in their homes without adequate replacements for learning, food and emotional support. This was against the rights of children as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Twite said. She added: \u201cThe charity Playing Out wrote to the children\u2019s minister and under-secretary of state because they were considerably concerned about the rules about children playing outdoors. He wrote back to say that outdoor play was not in his remit because the children\u2019s minister role sits in the Department for Education. \u201cWe know that Gavin Williamson [the education secretary] was so incidental to decision-making that it is the current position of this inquiry not even to call him to give evidence in this module. So who was there to consider the rights for children in England, and perhaps more importantly, who should have been.\u201d The inquiry has said it will embark on a targeted research project to hear from young people. Twite said the government must appoint a cabinet minister for children with cross-departmental responsibility for driving forward implementation of a child rights action plan. She also called on the government to classify schools and early years settings as essential infrastructure for future health emergencies."

            "date": "2023-10-06T08:51:48Z",
            "content": "JD Wetherspoon has bounced back to profit for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic three years ago, as budget-conscious consumers flocked to the low-cost pub chain amid the cost of living crisis. Wetherspoon\u2019s, which runs about 830 pubs across the UK and Ireland, reported a pre-tax profit of almost \u00a343m in the year to 30 July. It is the first time the pub chain has reported an annual profit since 2019, when it made profits of \u00a3102m. It announced a \u00a330m loss in its previous results. The start of the pandemic in 2020 fuelled the first annual loss since the company was founded by Tim Martin in 1984. The company made three consecutive annual losses \u2013 in 2020, 2021 and 2022 \u2013 totalling \u00a3230m. \u201cWetherspoon\u2019s continues to recover from the pandemic hangover which has left some stains on the business, but where progress is increasingly evident,\u201d said Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor. The company reported annual sales of \u00a31.9bn, up 12.7% on a like-for-like basis, as cash-strapped consumers turned to its cheaper food and drink offerings. Bar sales increased by 9% year on year, food sales soared by 16.7%, hotel room revenue increased by 11.8%, and sales for the pub chain\u2019s slot and fruit machine operations rose by 26.4%. Martin said trading in Wetherspoon\u2019s new financial year has been strong, with sales up 9.9% year on year in the nine weeks to 1 October, but was more cautious about prospects for the full year. \u201cAs we said last year, perhaps the biggest threat to the hospitality industry is the possibility of further lockdowns and restrictions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe company currently anticipates a reasonable outcome for the financial year, subject to our future sales performance.\u201d Despite the return to profitability, the company decided against reinstating a dividend for investors, which, combined with a less than bullish outlook for the year, led to shares in Wetherspoon\u2019s falling by 4% on Friday \u2013 making it one of the biggest fallers among FTSE 250 companies. Wetherspoon\u2019s also revealed that executive and non-executive directors took home \u00a32.4m in total remuneration last year, slightly down on the \u00a32.58m last year. While no cash bonuses were paid out to top executives, they received shares in the company\u2019s long-term incentive scheme. The highest-paid director was John Hutson, the chief executive, who took home a total remuneration package of \u00a31.07m, his biggest pay packet since 2018. For this year he will receive a 6% rise to his 638,000 annual salary, while staff will receive a 6.7% average rise. Wetherspoon\u2019s, which employs 42,000 staff, said that employees received \u00a336m in bonuses and share awards, of which 98.6% was paid to staff below board level and 83.4% was paid to staff working in pubs. This compares with \u00a330m in its last financial year. The company kept a tight control of costs, which have been hit by food, energy and labour cost inflation, which rose by about \u00a3100m to \u00a31.8bn. Employee costs rose 5.5% from \u00a3692m to \u00a3730m, while administration costs grew from \u00a345m to \u00a353m. The company\u2019s operating margin was 5.6%, an improvement on the \u201cwafer-thin\u201d 1.5% the previous year. \u201cWhile sales may have returned to something resembling normality, the pressure on margin and profit remains evident,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cWetherspoon\u2019s has been able to pass on some of the inflationary costs without diminishing its appeal, but equally, it will be mindful that this particular strategy needs to be reined in where possible in order to maintain its no-nonsense and no-frills value offering.\u201d"

            "content": "More than 1,300 live music venues and stages across Australia have been lost permanently since Covid restrictions began, shrinking the live music scene for small to medium gigs by one-third over the past three years, according to Apra Amcos\u2019s annual report. Australian music fans flocking to large-scale concerts by huge international acts such as Ed Sheeran, Elton John and Harry Styles has delivered a record year in licensing fee earnings for Australasia\u2019s music rights collecting agency Apra Amcos. However, recovery at the grassroots level of the local music industry has been shackled by a dearth of venues, said the agency\u2019s chief executive, Dean Ormston. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely at a crisis point,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market has been decimated and we\u2019re asking the government to look at this with some urgency.\u201d Although Victoria recorded the world\u2019s longest lockdown during the pandemic, it was New South Wales which permanently lost the highest percentage of pre-Covid live music venues \u2013 almost one in three \u2013 followed by the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia. Victoria saw a 24% reduction in venues, according to Apra Amcos\u2019s annual report. Ormston said the industry had been lobbying the federal government to introduce tax incentives to kickstart the sector. Tax offsets for live music venues could operate on a similar system to those in the local screen industry, where rebates are claimable if productions meet local content and employment quotas. The offsets, which largely benefit Hollywood studios shooting in Australia, were almost doubled to 30% by the Labor government in the May budget. \u201cIt really is a simple ask, it\u2019s affordable and it will absolutely jumpstart businesses presenting live music on a national basis, and that\u2019s what we need,\u201d Ormston said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for years and years for venues to organically come back online, we need something more immediate than that. \u201cPubs and clubs are really where Australian bands get to cut their teeth, develop their own audiences, build their own profile and fan base and develop their own careers. With so many venues now lost, it\u2019s absolutely a crisis point. We need an intervention.\u201d Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In January, Music Australia, a new national body to develop and support new contemporary music, was created as part of Labor\u2019s national cultural policy. On Thursday Millie Millgate, the former head of Australia\u2019s music export program Sounds Australia, was announced as its inaugural director. In a statement issued on Thursday, Apra Amcos said the creation of Music Australia was proof the federal government now recognised the sector as a legitimate industry \u201cworthy of investment\u201d. Guardian Australia has sought comment from the federal arts minister, Tony Burke. While the agency\u2019s annual report found that the small to medium live music sector was struggling, a slew of Australian artists achieved significant success on the international stage in 2022. R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol, the Kid Laroi, G Flip, Flume and King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard were just some of the artists who contributed to a record year for the agency, with international income from affiliate collecting agencies exceeding $70m for the first time, a 17.7% year-on-year increase. That contributed to total gross revenue of $690.5m, an increase of 12% on the previous year. According to the same data, music festivals appear to have recovered fully from lockdowns, but possibly to the detriment of nightclubs, where crowds have almost halved since pre-pandemic trading, dropping from 2.8 million in 2019 to 1.6 million in 2022."

            "content": "A highly effective malaria vaccine has been recommended for widespread use by the World Health Organization. The R21/Matrix-M vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, is only the second malaria vaccine to be recommended by the WHO. It is the first to meet the WHO\u2019s target of 75% efficacy. Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, claims half a million lives every year and mostly affects children under the age of five, and pregnant women. \u201cAs a malaria researcher, I used to dream of the day we would have a safe and effective vaccine against malaria. Now we have two,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO. Demand for vaccines is huge. However, available supplies of the RTS,S vaccine, the first malaria vaccine approved by the WHO in 2021, are limited. A second WHO-recommended vaccine is expected \u201cto protect more children faster, and to bring us closer to our vision of a malaria-free future,\u201d said Tedros. The world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer by doses \u2013 the Serum Institute of India \u2013 is already lined up to make more than 100m doses a year and plans to scale up to 200m a year, the BBC reported. Each dose costs between $2 and $4; four doses are needed per person. That is about half the price of RTS,S. So far, there are only 18m doses of RTS,S. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa, said: \u201cThis second vaccine holds real potential to close the huge demand-and-supply gap. Delivered to scale and rolled out widely, the two vaccines can help bolster malaria prevention and control efforts, and save hundreds of thousands of young lives in Africa from this deadly disease.\u201d At least 28 countries in Africa plan to introduce a WHO-recommended malaria vaccine as part of their national immunisation programmes. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has approved providing support to roll out malaria vaccines to 18 countries. The RTS,S vaccine will be available in some African countries in early 2024 and the R21 malaria vaccine is expected to become available to countries in mid-2024, according to the WHO. Observers heralded the announcement, but warned the vaccine was \u201cno magic bullet\u201d in the fight against malaria and that it should be used in tandem with other measures, such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor spraying to prevent the disease. Dr Michael Charles, the chief executive of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, said the announcement was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but that there were still \u201cmajor hurdles to overcome\u201d. \u201cIn the face of significant funding shortfalls and the growing threats of insecticide and drug resistance, and climate change, further investment must be urgently mobilised to scale up, manufacture and roll out malaria vaccines to ensure they are readily accessible to countries that decide to use them,\u201d he said. Gareth Jenkins, the executive director of advocacy and strategy at Malaria No More UK, said: \u201cThe reality is that malaria financing globally is far from where it needs to be and annual deaths from malaria rose during the pandemic and are still above pre-pandemic levels, so we cannot afford to be complacent as new tools are developed.\u201d Megan Greischar, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University, who studies parasites and the transmission of infection, said eliminating vector-born diseases such as malaria is incredibly difficult even with an effective vaccine. \u201cThe current and new malaria vaccines face many hurdles, including multiple doses required to achieve protection. Vaccines will not, on their own, meet the goal of malaria elimination, except perhaps in places like the US where transmission is already rare. In areas where malaria is common, evolution \u2013 both of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes and drug resistance in malaria parasites \u2013 continues to erode public health gains by making existing tools less effective,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2023-10-02T12:17:51Z",
            "content": "Two scientists have been awarded the 2023 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their contributions to RNA biology that contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during the Covid pandemic. Prof Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Prof Drew Weissman share the 11m Swedish kronor (\u00a3823,000) prize announced on Monday by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. The Nobel committee awarded the prize for their discoveries concerning \u201cnucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against Covid-19\u201d. These vaccines work by smuggling the genetic instructions for making viral proteins into our cells, enabling them to churn out large amounts of this protein and prime the immune cells to fight the virus. A significant obstacle in the development of such vaccines was early prototypes of these synthetic mRNAs provoked inflammatory reactions, making them unsuitable for medical use. Together, Karik\u00f3 and Weissman discovered that by making small chemical tweaks to the mRNA molecules, they could not only abolish these unwanted inflammatory responses, but also markedly increased production of the target protein. This approach became the basis for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Prof John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist at Imperial College London, said: \u201cThey demonstrated that changing the type of the RNA nucleotides within the vaccine altered the way in which cells see it. This increased the amount of vaccine protein made following the injection of the RNA, effectively increasing the efficiency of the vaccination: more response for less RNA. \u201cThis was a vital building block of the success of the RNA vaccines in reducing disease and death during the pandemic.\u201d Prof Robin Shattock, also at Imperial College London, added that these discoveries \u201cwill be key to the successful use of future RNA vaccines and new RNA-based medicines\u201d. Karik\u00f3, a research professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and external consultant to BioNTech in Germany, was said to be \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the announcement \u2013 particularly as she endured decades of scepticism over her work, and was even demoted by the University of Pennsylvania in the mid-90s because of the lack of funding she was generating for her research. She is still an adjunct professor at the university\u2019s Perelman school of medicine. Karik\u00f3 grew up in a small town in central Hungary, where her family lived in a single room with no running water, no refrigerator and no television. After gaining a postdoc at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Szeged, she sold her car, sewed the money into her daughter\u2019s teddy bear and moved her family to Philadelphia, US. She met Weissman, now a professor of vaccine research at the Perelman school of medicine, in the late 1990s over a departmental photocopier at the University of Pennsylvania, where Karik\u00f3 was printing research papers. The pair struck up a partnership and began investigating mRNA as a potential therapeutic, initially using Weissman\u2019s funding to finance their experiments. Karik\u00f3 previously told the Guardian she never doubted that their approach would work. \u201cI always wished that I would live long enough to see something that I\u2019ve worked on be approved,\u201d she said. BioNTech and Moderna licensed the modified mRNA technology developed by Karik\u00f3 and Weissman for their vaccines. Weissman has gone on to develop RNA vaccine candidates against flu, herpes and HIV. Speaking at the announcement of the prize in Stockholm on Monday, the chair of the Nobel committee, Prof Gunilla Carlsson, stressed that their discovery was critical for making the mRNA vaccine platform suitable for clinical use, rapidly, when it was most needed. \u201cI think in terms of saving lives, especially in the early phase of the pandemic, it was very important,\u201d she said. Karik\u00f3 and Weissman\u2019s work has previously been recognised with the \u00a32.2m Breakthrough prize and numerous other international awards. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2023. The Nobel prize in physiology or medicine is awarded by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, rather than the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences."

When my team asked children in Edinburgh during a public outreach event with schools, they said sharks, alligators, spiders and lions. All good guesses, but none on target. The deadliest animal is the mighty mosquito, which kills more than 1 million people a year. Almost 700 million people contract a mosquito-borne illness each year. Mosquitoes carry serious diseases like malaria, dengue fever, West Nile virus, Zika virus and chikungunya that not only kill, but also result in pain, disability and prolonged illness. Among mosquito-borne diseases, malaria is the most deadly. Scientists believe it has killed more people than any other disease spread by the insects in history. And it remains stubbornly present in the modern world: there were 619,000 deaths and 247m cases of malaria in 2021. African children are the main victims: 96% of deaths to malaria are in Africa, and children under five make up roughly 80% of the victims. Within that region, deaths are mainly concentrated in four countries: Nigeria, DRC, Tanzania and Niger. It might feel like a disease that is far away and a low-income world problem, but with the climate crisis and broader roaming ranges of mosquitoes, mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue are re-emerging in the US and Europe. This past summer, my home state of Florida had local transmission of malaria, meaning several residents caught the disease from being bitten by a mosquito at home, rather than travelling abroad. These were the first cases of malaria in the US in 20 years. Part of what makes malaria so hard to eliminate is the wily mosquito itself. In regions where mosquitoes are ubiquitous, avoiding getting bitten is pretty much impossible, especially for young children. Public health workers have tried things like insecticide-treated bednets, only to find that it is difficult to make children sleep under them and that mosquitoes can develop resistance to insecticides. For decades scientists have hoped a vaccine could provide a straightforward solution, but that has also been a challenge. Malaria is not caused by a virus, but by a more complex parasitic species called plasmodium that is excellent at evading our immune system by constantly shape-shifting inside the body \u2013 all of which makes it very hard to target with a vaccine. Yet persistence, brilliance and creativity have come together for a team at the University of Oxford, who have finally succeeded with a new malaria vaccine called R21. A Lancet preprint paper reports that R21 is 75% effective at preventing disease in areas where malaria is seasonal, for example where it tends to emerge only during the rainy season, and 67% effective where malaria is standard, in children aged between five and 36 months. A world-first malaria vaccine developed by the pharmaceutical firm GSK in 2021 showed similar effectiveness data, but the R21 vaccine is half the cost, coming in at $2-4 per dose. A difference of just a few dollars may not seem like much, but in nations where malaria is prevalent, per capita health spending is very low. In Nigeria it\u2019s $15 a year, in DRC it is $13 a year and in Tanzania it is $35 a year. Compare this with the UK, where health spending was \u00a34,188 per person in 2021. The authors of the preprint also report that it is already possible to manufacture 100-200 million doses of R21 a year at the Serum Institute of India, with Ghana, Nigeria and Burkina Faso already approving the vaccine for use. In the countries hit hardest by malaria, there is very little money available for basic healthcare: cost makes the difference in what life-saving vaccines and medicines are available, or not. This is why the Oxford vaccine integration of science, cost and supply could massively reduce the lives lost to malaria. Malaria was endemic in the southern US until public efforts by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to eliminate the disease, which was achieved in 1951. As long as we have mosquitoes \u2013 which outnumber us humans by 16,000 to one worldwide \u2013 and we live on the same planet with temperatures rising, diseases in one part of the world can easily spread anywhere else. But regardless of malaria\u2019s future trajectory and geographical spread, it is estimated that the new R21 vaccine will save tens of thousands of lives, especially in young children. That\u2019s pretty amazing news for global health \u2013 and for humanity. Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"

            "content": "A new vaccine against malaria \u2013 which kills 600,000 people every year, mostly children \u2013 is to be injected into babies\u2019 arms in 18 countries where the disease is most deadly. That\u2019s joyous news. But the unbridled enthusiasm the announcement has generated says as much about the sorry state of malaria control as the brilliance of scientific invention. Because this is an imperfect vaccine that at best will protect 75% of those given it. That\u2019s the top figure from the clinical trials. In the reality of village life in poverty-ridden parts of Africa, it may keep fewer than half safe. It\u2019s still hugely important to get vaccination programmes going in the 18 countries that will now be funded to run them, because many deaths will be averted. But it\u2019s not the end of malaria. Nowhere near. The R21/Matrix-M vaccine from Oxford University and the Serum Institute of India, which ran the trials and will manufacture it, is the second to be dispatched into the field. The first was RTS,S \u2013 trade name Mosquirix \u2013 made by GlaxoSmithKline. It was created in 1987, then trialled and piloted in 2019 in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. There is little difference between the outcomes of the two vaccines, which are designed and made in a very similar way. We\u2019re not looking at a breakthrough mRNA vaccine here, using brand new technology of the kind involved in the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna Covid vaccines \u2013 although there are groups working on early-stage development of one. The big difference is price and supply. There are only 18m doses of RTS,S available. The Serum Institute has undertaken to make 100m doses of the Oxford vaccine and double that in the following year. The price will also be a lot lower \u2013 in line with that of other childhood vaccines that are generally used across Africa. That\u2019s the really good news. You can\u2019t use a vaccine to save lives if you can\u2019t afford it or obtain it. The comment from Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa, was telling. \u201cThis second vaccine holds real potential to close the huge demand-and-supply gap,\u201d she said after WHO announced its approval. Malaria is the disease families fear in endemic regions. They want a vaccine. They have seen too many children sicken and die. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, will now stump up the money to get the vaccine out as widely as possible. That\u2019s as it should be. But this is not a one-shot vaccine. It\u2019s four shots. And because the vaccine works best in smaller babies, the first three shots will be given at monthly intervals, starting at five months old, followed by a booster at two years old, which will not coincide with the routine childhood immunisation schedule. Families may have to travel to clinics, taking time out from the fields or hard work at home, perhaps bringing other children too. Even in affluent countries, children are not always brought back for second vaccine doses. Prof Nick White of Mahidol University in Thailand and Oxford, one of the world\u2019s leading malaria experts, said that in Africa, malaria maps to its wars. In conflict zones such as the DRC, immunisation is often a casualty. \u201cLarge swathes of Africa will not be able to receive this,\u201d he said. Nobody is pretending the vaccine alone is enough. It has to be used in combination with other measures, such as insecticide-impregnated bednets. And it is vitally important that clinics have the gold-standard malaria treatment for those who show symptoms. Those are the artemisinin combination drugs that work really well until the malaria parasites, transmitted to a child in a mosquito bite, become resistant to them. White believes the eradication of seasonal malaria should be the goal wherever possible. The two vaccines have a part to play in that, given to village populations together with artemisinin drugs as prevention of malaria infection, rather than cure. Malaria cases have gone up rather than down in the past couple of years, to everyone\u2019s dismay. The climate crisis, conflicts and drug resistance may all have played a part. But there has also been a weariness in those fighting the battle, as one technology after another fails to deliver a killer blow. The Gates Foundation, after many years of big investment in the Mosquirix vaccine, stopped funding it in favour of other preventive measures such as better bednets. In July 2022, Philip Welkhoff, the Gates Foundation\u2019s director of malaria programmes, told AP that the vaccine had \u201ca much lower efficacy than we would like\u201d, and said they had to make hard decisions on cost-effectiveness. Funding has generally been a struggle because there are no clear wins in malaria. The approval and funding of the Oxford/Serum Institute vaccine may have an additional benefit in boosting morale and hopefully leveraging more money and enthusiasm for the fight. It\u2019s not a gamechanger, but it is another real step in the right direction."

The health service is asking eligible patients to arrange appointments for both vaccines to avoid a potential \u201ctwindemic\u201d of flu and coronavirus this winter, which would pile further pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries. \u201cYou are a priority for seasonal flu and Covid-19 vaccinations,\u201d the two-page letter tells recipients. \u201cThis is because you are aged 65 or over (by 31 March 2024). \u201cHaving your flu and Covid-19 vaccinations will reduce your risk of serious illness and help you recover more quickly if you catch the viruses.\u201d However, some of the letters, which contain personal information such as NHS numbers, have been sent to people who died years ago. Others have been sent to people who are not eligible for the vaccines, with no connection to the addressee. \u201cJust got home to find a letter addressed to my mother who died over 20 years ago from Covid Vaccination Programmes NHS England,\u201d posted one user on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSomething obviously gone wrong here \u2026 \u201d Another user wrote on X: \u201cIt\u2019s so upsetting to get a letter asking your mum to go for a Covid booster when she died 8 years ago! I sincerely hope the dodgy system that sent this to me is not sending them to loved ones who have died of Covid! So much for technology!\u201d A third user said on X that their father-in-law had received \u201chis first ever priority flu jab NHS England letter\u201d despite him having \u201cbeen dead over 15 years\u201d. In an update, they added: \u201cOmg we got another one, identical just a day later.\u201d Another user said on X that NHS letters \u201call addressed to the wrong people\u201d had been received by several people on their street. \u201cHow many of these have been incorrectly sent?

It declined to answer questions about when the error was first discovered, what had caused it and how many people had been affected. \u201cWe have been made aware of some letters sent in error and appreciate this may have been upsetting for those who received it \u2013 we are working as quickly as possible to investigate this,\u201d a spokesperson for NHS England said. The latest Covid-19 vaccine is now being rolled out across the UK, with more than a third of people aged 65 and over in England estimated to have received a jab. The jab is being offered to everyone in the UK aged 65 and over, along with care home residents, frontline health and social care staff, those at increased risk because they are pregnant or have a certain underlying health condition, unpaid carers, and household contacts of anyone with a weakened immune system. The rollout was brought forward as a precaution against the latest Omicron subvariant, BA.2.86. However, experts say there is no evidence that the new variant is more likely to make people seriously ill than others in circulation, while vaccination is likely to provide ongoing protection. Health experts have warned to expect \u201cfurther increases\u201d in Covid-19 as the weather gets colder and people mix more indoors, along with a likely rise in other respiratory viruses such as flu."

            "date": "2023-10-22T09:46:51Z",
            "content": "Skateboarding may be more usually associated with riders refining their tricks in urban parks or cruising along sun-dappled beachside promenades. But the British professional skateboarder Barney Page went for something very different \u2013 a gruelling road trip of almost 1,000 miles from John o\u2019Groats in Scotland to Land\u2019s End in Cornwall. A film detailing Page\u2019s journey, called Land\u2019s End, is being screened across Europe and North America, attracting plaudits not only for Page\u2019s spirit of adventure but for the way it tackles the issue of mental health and suicide. As well as describing the adventures, near collisions and strength-sapping climbs, the 80-minute movie tells the story of Page\u2019s friend Ben Raemers, another professional skateboarder, who killed himself aged 28 in 2019. Page, 32, trained for the trip by riding alongside the river in his home city of Exeter and taking boxing classes to toughen up. He began the journey with a trick called a \u201cnollie flip\u201d but he did not have much spare energy for many other stunts. \u201cIt was tough on the body, quite a strenuous things to be doing, but I had my friends with me,\u201d he said. Page was supported \u2013 and protected from the traffic \u2013 by a van staffed by a driver and navigator and accompanied by the film-maker Ryan Sherman and a photographer. They tried to stay off the busiest roads but there were near misses. \u201cThe most dangerous part was when you came across a driver without a lot of patience, especially around 5pm when they\u2019re trying to get home,\u201d Page said. \u201cPeople would be abusive sometimes, effing and blinding at you. That could bring the morale down but the majority of people were supportive.\u201d When he felt he was struggling to keep going, he would imagine Raemers laughing at him and carry on. The Scottish Highlands were the hardest physically. \u201cThere are a lot of hills but the beauty is incredible. The Midlands was more boring but good that it was flat, and when we hit Devon and Cornwall it was magnificent again. \u201cIt was definitely an adventure, winding through the country. It was a beautiful way to see the country piece by piece, a chance to explore the UK in a unique way.\u201d Touring the film around is another adventure. It will eventually be available to be streamed but for the moment the communal screenings are leading to conversations about mental health. \u201cI tragically lost a friend,\u201d Page said. \u201cIt opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes in the skate community. Creating that awareness is a very important thing. Lots of people open after watching the film. It helps create a safe space.\u201d There was sellout screening in Exeter last week and a second screening is taking place at a larger venue in the city on 1 November. That screening, which will include a Q&amp;A, is part of a festival of social science and organised by Paul O\u2019Connor, of the University of Exeter, who researches the lives of skateboarders and the impact of the sport on society. O\u2019Connor described the film as \u201cbittersweet\u201d. \u201cThere is a lot of joy in the film. Barney is a remarkable ambassador for the joy of life. But it talks seriously about young men\u2019s, and more generally everyone\u2019s, mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cSkateboarding is really progressive in terms of inclusivity, sexual orientation, gender identity. It\u2019s way ahead of other sports because it\u2019s a community, a lifestyle, a philosophy. Skateboarders are really good at trying to fix things that are problematic. \u201cBarney and Ryan want to use the film as a springboard for more people to have these conversations, to check in with each other, ask difficult questions.\u201d \u2022 Tickets for the free Exeter screening can be booked at festivalofsocialscience.com."

            "date": "2023-10-22T08:00:10Z",
            "content": "The BBC is offering extra support to staff who are facing abuse and attacks over the corporation\u2019s Israel-Hamas coverage. Some staff have reported being targeted online or verbally attacked for working for the BBC, while also dealing with distressing footage from the conflict. BBC News chief operating officer Sam Taylor told staff in an email: \u201cI know from my experience working on upsetting, running news stories over the years that you can be doing fine, but sometimes that can change, and you need a bit more help or to talk things through. So, in addition to the staff sessions and resources already available, our safety and mental health specialists are offering more targeted support where needed.\u201d \u201cSadly the current situation has meant that some people are experiencing abuse, either online or in person,\u201d said Taylor, along with the \u201ctrauma caused by viewing specific images, working closely with distressed individuals, or undertaking assignments on the ground\u201d. Tensions have been heightened for BBC staff after a number of incidents, initially over the corporation\u2019s editorial policy of not using the word terrorist to describe Hamas, saying instead that it is \u201cproscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and other governments\u201d. Then, last Saturday, the BBC\u2019s central London headquarters was sprayed with red paint by a pro-Palestinian protest group, which accused the broadcaster of having \u201cblood on its hands\u201d over its Israel-Hamas coverage. One BBC insider said \u201cit is proving really stressful\u201d facing the additional \u201crage\u201d at the BBC\u2019s coverage, as \u201cit\u2019s stressful enough reporting on the [conflict] because \u2026 it\u2019s appalling\u201d. Last week, the Israeli government accused the BBC of perpetuating a \u201cmodern blood libel\u201d over the reporting of the explosion at Gaza\u2019s al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza on Tuesday evening. Immediately after the incident, a BBC reporter said there was a lack of clarity but suggested that Israel might be at fault. The Israeli government claimed that the initial take by the BBC and other media organisations further destabilised the region and led to the cancellation of a summit in Amman between the US president Joe Biden and Egyptian and Palestinian leaders. On the Today programme on Radio 4 on Thursday, security minister Tom Tugendhat said that while the BBC is \u201cincredibly important not just here in the UK but around the world \u2026 to see a BBC reporter say that the Israeli military have said they are investigating but it\u2019s hard to see what else this could be other an Israeli air strike ... at a time when it was uncertain is really serious\u201d. The Today presenter and former BBC political editor Nick Robinson responded citing comments from BBC international editor Jeremy Bowen. He said: \u201cJeremy was on this programme pointing out that viewers of the 10 o\u2019clock news and people across our footage were left in no doubt that there was no clarity about who\u2019d carried it out. I think you\u2019re talking about a broadcast that was in the immediate aftermath of the explosion.\u201d Robinson, who has faced intimidation himself (in 2014 he was given a bodyguard after 4,000 people marched on BBC Scotland to demand his resignation), discussed the issue on the Today Podcast and told the Observer it was important to understand why some audiences were angry. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to recognise that people are feeling not just hurt \u2026 but fear for themselves and the people they love. Of course they feel passionate about anything or anybody they don\u2019t think is entirely on their side. It would be odd if they didn\u2019t and we\u2019ve got to allow for that and allow people to express that, and listen.\u201d The BBC subsequently said the reporter \u201cwas wrong to speculate\u201d and on Thursday night at a Media Society event, the director of journalism and BBC News deputy CEO Jonathan Munro acknowledged that \u201clanguage is critical\u201d and \u201cthat on one report about the hospital \u2026 that language wasn\u2019t quite right. \u201cThe impression is left that we were speculating [and] it\u2019s important to correct that, which we\u2019ve done \u2026 it\u2019s a lesson for all of us. We\u2019re running live coverage literally around the clock in radio, television and online. We\u2019re covering this in 43 different languages \u2013 somewhere along the line human beings are going to make a mistake.\u201d The National Union of Journalists\u2019 ethics council chair Chris Frost said: \u201cWe want to support journalists who are trying to ensure they are reporting fairly and presenting both sides. The BBC is quite rightly trying to avoid taking sides.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-22T13:06:06Z",
            "content": "Every pound spent on helping young people access activities and support in the community could save nearly twice as much in dealing with longer-term mental health problems, according to new analysis. The children\u2019s charity Barnardo\u2019s is urging the government to introduce a national strategy for \u201csocial prescribing\u201d for young people in England amid a youth mental health crisis that is placing unprecedented demand on child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs). Social prescribing refers to non-clinical treatments targeted at children who are experiencing mental health problems such as isolation, anxiety, low mood and low self-esteem, and is aimed at preventing these from deteriorating into more serious conditions. This could be as simple as encouraging them to get to a local park, for example by providing a bus fare or by building their confidence after a bad experience such as getting stopped and searched. It could involve helping the young person enrol in group activities, creative hobbies or sports, as well as signposting counselling and help with referrals to other health and social care services. Referrals are made through GPs, teachers and local authorities to a link worker who can match children with local services, coordinate their access by resolving financial, cultural or emotional barriers, and provide emotional support. Lynn Perry, the chief executive of Barnardo\u2019s, said she had seen through the charity\u2019s work with children and young people that \u201cthis can really help to turn their lives around\u201d and prevent a need for clinical NHS services. \u201cChildren and young people are having to wait for months, even years in many cases, to get the help and support they need when they are struggling with their mental health. Their condition often just intensifies while their names sit on long waiting lists,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on the government to put the backbones of funding and infrastructure in place to ensure social prescribing is available to all children and young people who need it throughout the country.\u201d Social prescribing is particularly important for families who feel socially excluded, said Becky Rice, who authored the Barnardo\u2019s report, as well as to combat high levels of anxiety and school absence among children. \u201cChildren and young people have been shut inside due to Covid, isolated from school, family, friends and the community, and now there\u2019s the cost of living situation where families are struggling to afford essentials, let alone after-school clubs. They\u2019ve been isolated from community assets \u2013 nature spaces, clubs, activities \u2013 which we know is having an impact on health and development,\u201d she said. Yet the report warns that current models of social prescribing and training for link workers are inconsistent and fragmented across the country, as well as focused on adults, with no dedicated funding streams for children despite their different needs. Barnardo\u2019s calculated that every \u00a31 spent on social prescribing delivers long-term benefits of about \u00a31.80 in terms of reduced pressure on the mental health services as well as indirect impacts including on antisocial behaviour, A&amp;E hospital presentations, housing problems, children being taken into care and truancy from school. Since one in five GP appointments are for non-clinical issues, the Open Data Institute estimated that social prescribing could reduce the need for GP appointments by 2.5-3% annually, or 2.8m-3m appointments. Kathryn Ridley credits social prescribing with saving the life of her child Beth, 14, who received support from the Link service in Penrith after struggling to get help through Camhs for challenges with mental health and gender identity, including isolation, panic attacks, hallucinations, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. A GP referred the family to a Link worker who developed a trusting relationship with Beth, providing emotional support and helping them get a referral for LGBTQ+ counselling, as well as taking them to the Pride in North Cumbria (PiNC) youth charity. She also helped them secure a part-time timetable with the school, and later obtain an autism diagnosis. Beth said being taken to PiNC was \u201ca big thing\u201d as it enabled them to meet people who were facing the same challenges, and \u201cit\u2019s not something I would have done on my own\u201d. Kathryn added: \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute lifeline and early intervention is so important to stop it getting out of hand. It\u2019s such a shame more young people don\u2019t have access to this service, and we\u2019re very lucky in our area. Literally it\u2019s been a lifesaver for Beth, and for us as a family. It was a very difficult time.\u201d Beth is now going back to school, where they are doing well academically and have taken up dancing classes and joined an after-school drama club. Kathryn said: \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a point where Beth didn\u2019t want tomorrow to come to now having all these hopes and dreams and enthusiasm. Every day is not rosy, there\u2019s still ups and downs, but Beth\u2019s been given the right tools to deal with that.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cSocial prescribing can be an empowering and potentially life-changing intervention for those that need it, and has a key role to play in cutting waiting lists \u2013 one of the government\u2019s five priorities. \u201cOver 2.3m referrals have been made to social prescribing services \u2013 more than double our target \u2013 while the NHS has recruited 3,475 social prescribing link workers to put people in touch with social prescribing services that will support their health and wellbeing.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-02T05:00:04Z",
            "content": "For a man who died in 1890, Vincent van Gogh seemed remarkably au fait with 21st-century parlance. Asked why he had cut off his left ear, the artist replied that this was a misconception and he had in fact only cut off \u201cpart of my earlobe\u201d. So why did he shoot himself in the chest with a revolver, causing injuries from which he died two days later? \u201cThis is still a subject of speculation among historians and specialists. The truth of my motivation remains a mystery even to me. Thank you for understanding my mental health struggles,\u201d he says. This is artificial intelligence Van Gogh, part of a crowd-pulling feature for an exhibition of the artist\u2019s last works at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay in Paris, which also includes a virtual reality experience based on his last paint-encrusted palette. In May 1890, Van Gogh arrived in the village of Auvers-sur-Oise, 30km north of Paris, to be near his brother Theo and be cared for by Dr Paul Gachet, a specialist in the \u201ctreatment of melancholy\u201d. In what would be a final creative frenzy, he produced 74 paintings and 33 drawings in just two months, among them the famous Church at Auvers-sur-Oise, portraits of Gachet and the doctor\u2019s daughter, Marguerite, and his last canvas, Les Racines (Roots), completed just 36 hours before he shot himself. It is these works, mostly held by the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam \u2013 which has never previously loaned them \u2013 that have been assembled for the first time. Emmanuel Coquery, the exhibition curator, said: \u201cIn this unique exhibition we see an astonishing variety of paintings. This work carries much weight because it is the period in which he will end his life. The question everyone asks is why, and the answer is that we just don\u2019t know. Did he feel he had finished his oeuvre or was it an ultimate crisis that was bigger than him? \u201cWe also wanted to break the myth of the cursed artist who was unloved and unrecognised when he died. He was in full ascension at the time, his paintings had begun to sell and he was recognised.\u201d Coquery says Van Gogh\u2019s final act appeared to be premeditated and the end was not precipitated by crisis but was calm. \u201cIt is extraordinary that he painted so many of these extraordinary paintings in his last days.\u201d Before entering the exhibition, visitors are invited to the interactive experience, based on the artist\u2019s last paint palette, held by the museum and on display in the exhibition. \u201cIt gives visitors a new way of looking at the art,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Jarry from Paris-based Lucid Realities, which co-produced the interactive experience with Vive Arts and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. \u201cWe used the last ever paint palette used by Van Gogh to show the colours as they were at the time and added the touches he used in the paintings to create a virtual landscape.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the first time the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay has put on a VR experience with an exhibition,\u201d she said. At the end of the exhibition, which opens on Tuesday and runs until February next year, visitors can pose the artist\u2019s AI incarnation questions in a feature developed by the technology start-up Jumbo Mana, which claims its speciality is \u201cbreathing life into historical figures\u201d. Visitors see Van Gogh at the moment he has finished one of his most famous late works, Le Champ de Bl\u00e9 Aux Corbeaux (Wheatfield With Crows). His responses are based on scientific research involving the analysis of the numerous letters the painter wrote \u2013 mostly to his brother \u2013 carried out by Wouter van der Veen, a Van Gogh specialist who oversaw the project. Christophe Leribault, the president of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, said the exhibition combined with the AI and VR experiences opened up a new way of looking at an artist who \u201ceveryone knew\u201d, which he described as \u201ca revelation\u201d. \u201cThis is a very unusual and powerful exhibition showing that despite his struggles during the last two months of his life, he continued to experiment and we see a great variety of subjects and how inventive he was with paint, canvas and frame,\u201d Leribault said. \u201cWe have many letters from Van Gogh. It is rare that an artist left so many manuscripts and from these it was possible to develop software to have Van Gogh\u2019s responses to our questions, though of course it remains a game. With the VR experience we can immerse ourselves in Van Gogh\u2019s world via the artist\u2019s palette. \u201cThis all gives us a variety of approaches to Van Gogh as a painter who was immensely popular.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-02T03:07:06Z",
            "content": "International students in crisis are not accessing mental health support services they need, a Victorian coronial inquest into suicide deaths has found. The inquest examined the deaths of five international students who took their own lives in 2020. The students were born in different nations, attended four institutions in the state and had various living circumstances. Police were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that they had committed suicide. The coroners court of Victoria heard the \u201cstriking feature\u201d of the students\u2019 circumstances was how little engagement they had with student services and external health services. Some hadn\u2019t disclosed their mental health issues or suicidal ideation with family and friends. Victorian coroner Simon McGregor said there was \u201cno concern\u201d with the design or delivery of student services that had been provided by the universities during the investigation. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He said the tertiary sector was facing a different challenge \u2013 how to encourage international students to seek help and improve engagement with services on offer. \u201cNone of the five international students engaged with health services in [the] wider community \u2026 The challenge may be even broader than this,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cHow to encourage international students to seek help at all.\u201d The inquest followed a 2021 Victorian coroner\u2019s report that found 47 international student suicides had occurred in the state in the decade to 2019. McGregor acknowledged there were cultural, linguistic and financial barriers to seeking help in certain communities that had been longstanding, adding he feared a coronial investigation wasn\u2019t the \u201cmost suitable mechanism\u201d for reform. In 2019, Victorian coroner Audrey Jamieson passed down her findings into suicides of international students who hadn\u2019t sought health or wellbeing support from their universities or in the community before taking their lives. During the investigation, the coroners prevention unit (CPU) found there was a lower prevalence of diagnosed mental illness among international student suicides (14.8%) compared with the Australian-born student suicide cohort (66.7%). It also found just 22.2% of the international student suicide cohort attended a health service for a mental health-related issue within six weeks of death. By contrast, 57.1% of the Australian-born student suicide cohort had such an attendance within six weeks of death. The CPU concluded there was an \u201cunderlying systemic issue\u201d with engaging international students in mental health treatment in Australia. At the time, Jamieson acknowledged greater international student engagement with mental health services was a goal \u201cfar easier articulated than achieved\u201d. McGergor said he \u201cresonate[d] strongly\u201d with her experience. \u201cUnfortunately I\u2019ve not developed any clear insights into how help-seeking amongst international students might be promoted,\u201d he said. \u201cA coronial investigation may not be most suitable mechanism.\u201d He recommended the Victorian Department of Health develop a resource targeting international student wellbeing and ways for individuals experiencing crisis or suicidality to seek help. He also suggested the Suicide Prevention Response Office review its quality evaluation framework and work relating to international students, to consider what resources would best assist universities to support health and wellbeing. In February, research published by the University of Melbourne and Orygen found international student deaths by suicide would continue if gaps in delivering targeted mental healthcare weren\u2019t addressed. It found evidence-based programs catering to international student suicide prevention still didn\u2019t exist despite record numbers of students returning this year. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

            "date": "2023-10-01T23:01:09Z",
            "content": "Suella Braverman\u2019s claim that most asylum seekers are economic migrants has been challenged by an analysis which suggests that three out of four people crossing the English Channel in small boats this year would be granted asylum if their claims were processed. Using Home Office statistics on Channel crossings, the Refugee Council said that 74% of arrivals in 2023 would be recognised as asylum seekers, an increase from 65% last year. The figures contradict Braverman\u2019s claim, made in December last year, that \u201c70% of individuals on small boats are single men who are effectively economic migrants\u201d. The report comes hours after the home secretary was attacked by her predecessor, Dame Priti Patel, for attention-seeking by attacking multiculturalism. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cThe reality is that the men, women and children who come to the UK by taking terrifying journeys across the world\u2019s busiest shipping lane are desperately seeking safety, having fled persecution, terror and oppression. \u201cClosing down the asylum system will simply result in vast cost, chaos and human misery with tens of thousands of people stuck in permanent limbo.\u201d The report, entitled The Truth About Channel Crossings and the Impact of the Illegal Migration Act, analyses Home Office statistics on Channel crossings. Based on current grant rates by nationality, the report estimates that 14,648 people who have crossed so far this year would be recognised as refugees if their claims were processed. This represents 74% of all small boat arrivals in 2023 to date. This compares with nearly two-thirds of those arriving in small boats in 2022 according to similar analysis from the Refugee Council, showing more refugees are coming across the Channel. The charity also found that more than half (54%) of arrivals are from just five countries \u2013 Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea, Syria and Sudan. If the plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda fails, 35,409 people who arrive in the UK by small boat could be left in limbo each year, the charity said, having had their asylum claim deemed permanently inadmissible but not having been removed. The Refugee Council also warned that, by shutting down the asylum system, the Illegal Migration Act will mean that people can\u2019t be removed to their country of origin. Earlier this year, court of appeal judges ruled that the government\u2019s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda to have their claims processed is unlawful. The government is appealing against the decision, but even if it wins in the supreme court case on the Rwanda agreement, the Refugee Council says it has applied a \u201cgenerous\u201d estimate of 10,000 people being removed to the central African country each year. This would still mean that more than 25,000 people would be left in a state of legal limbo, unable to work and at risk of destitution, exploitation and abuse. In a controversial speech in the US, widely seen as a move to become the standard-bearer of the Conservative right after a general election, Braverman on Tuesday called for world leaders to consider whether the Refugee Convention was fit for the modern age. \u201c[Migration] is an existential challenge for the political and cultural institutions of the west,\u201d she said. The treaty obliges signatories, including the UK, to grant asylum to people fleeing persecution. She also claimed that multiculturalism was a \u201cmisguided dogma\u201d that had allowed people to \u201clive parallel lives\u201d. Around a dozen Conservative MPs have complained to the chief whip about Braverman\u2019s speech, amid reports that Rishi Sunak is being urged to sack her. It was also criticised by the UN refugee agency and celebrities such as singer Sir Elton John. In an interview with Trevor Phillips on Sky News on Sunday, Patel suggested that Braverman had failed to provide \u201csome perspective and context\u201d around the situation in Britain, saying there had been \u201cwider issues\u201d around community flare-ups in places such as Leicester, which saw community unrest last year. \u201cYou and I are sitting here today, we are the products of actual integration, multiculturalism, dynamic communities, people who love our country, want to contribute to our country, along with a hell of a lot of other people that have done exactly the same. \u201cI think that is something we should be proud of in our country,\u201d she said. The row comes as rival groups of Conservatives plan to set out their plans for immigration during the conference. Before a rally of the New Conservatives Group on Monday, a poll commissioned for the group claimed that voters supported \u201creplacing the current European system of human rights laws applied in Britain with new British laws that protect rights like free speech but enable the government to promptly deport illegal migrants\u201d. Braverman will address the Conservative party conference on Tuesday afternoon. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cTackling illegal migration is a top priority for the government. Through our Illegal Migration Act and last year\u2019s Nationality and Borders Act, the government has raised the threshold to qualify for refugee status in the UK, as part of our commitment to stop the boats. \u201cWe will continue to provide protection to those most in need through our safe and legal routes and will shortly consult to understand the capacity of local authorities to house and support those arriving through these routes. \u201cThis is a complex issue, requiring innovative solutions, such as our migration partnership with Rwanda which we remain fully committed to.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-08T04:00:30Z",
            "content": "Last week\u2019s turmoil in the global bond markets will be playing on the minds of finance ministers and central bank governors when they gather in Marrakech this week for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. After the triple shocks of the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the surge in inflation, the mood may be less febrile than it was a year ago, but few if any of those travelling to Morocco \u2013 which suffered a devastating earthquake last month \u2013 would dare say that the crisis era is over. Most will be wondering what might go wrong next. The list of possible flashpoints is long: a recession as the sharp increase in interest rates over the past two years bites; a financial crash as investor confidence is punctured; a developing-country debt crisis; a catastrophic climate event; an escalation of the war. It will be a big meeting for the leaders of the IMF and World Bank \u2013 the two multilateral institutions that emerged from the 1944 Bretton Woods conference. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the IMF, wants to see inflation tamed without triggering a recession, an acceleration of the green transition, a replenishment of her institution\u2019s coffers, an agreement for rich countries to provide cash for zero-interest loans to low-income nations, and faster progress in debt relief. It is quite a wishlist, particularly given the damage the pandemic and its aftermath have caused to the public finances in the developed west, and the tension \u2013 if not outright hostility \u2013 that exists between many of the world\u2019s biggest economies. As Georgieva told the Guardian last week, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has added to the sense of fragmentation. The days when globalisation was seen as an unstoppable force have come to an end, but the need for multilateral cooperation is as acute as it has ever been. The World Bank has had a lower profile than the IMF in recent years, but will also come under the spotlight this week when its new president, Ajay Banga, delivers his mission statement for the organisation together with plans to increase its lending capacity. Banga says the dual goal of the bank should be the eradication of poverty on a livable planet, but there is plenty to do before either objective is met. As the bank itself said last week, Africa faces a lost decade of weak growth and rising instability, while the United Nations has estimated that developing countries will need $2tn a year until 2030 to cope with climate breakdown. That will require a stepping-up of developed-country assistance, substantially more concessional lending from the World Bank, and a massive increase in private investment. David Malpass, Banga\u2019s immediate predecessor, was pushed out for his lack of ambition when it came to sweating the bank\u2019s balance sheet to provide more climate finance, and the new president is already coming under pressure to deliver. Romilly Greenhill, UK director for lobbying organisation The One Campaign, said: \u201cWe are starting to see a welcome increase in available finance for vulnerable countries from global institutions like the World Bank and other multilateral development banks. But this still isn\u2019t happening at anything like the speed or scale needed to tackle the generational challenges staring us in the face.\u201d From a parochial British perspective, this year\u2019s meeting will be hard pressed to match last year\u2019s gathering in Washington for drama. Nothing is ever certain, but it is a reasonable bet that Rishi Sunak will not do to Jeremy Hunt what Liz Truss did to Kwasi Kwarteng and summon him home from the IMF meeting to be sacked. But while some of the UK\u2019s problems have eased over the past 12 months, the challenges for the IMF, the World Bank and the global economy remain both numerous and pressing."

            "content": "The Stormont executive and assembly have been suspended for 20 months, hospital waiting lists are the worst in the UK, schools, roads and housing are decaying, and the police service is in crisis. Dysfunction is taking hold in Northern Ireland. Here we take a look at some of the key difficulties facing the country: Education Schools across Northern Ireland are struggling to pay bills and maintain services. Stormont\u2019s education budget for 2023-24 was cut by \u00a366.4m (2.5%) and the education authority is estimated to have a financial deficit of \u00a3300m. The result is the stopping of benefits such as the school holiday food grant, or \u201choliday hunger\u201d payment, and less money to pay staff, repair buildings, supply books and subsidise uniforms. Health More than a quarter of Northern Ireland\u2019s 1.9m population is waiting for elective care, a 185% rise since 2014 blamed on an ageing population, staff shortages, antiquated structures, Covid-19 and insufficient funding. Waiting list performance levels are \u201csignificantly worse\u201d than other UK regions, according to the NI Audit Office. About 122,000 patients are awaiting surgery and 378,400 are waiting to see a consultant for the first time. The health service has \u201cfallen off the cliff edge\u201d, according to the Royal College of Nursing. Policing Simon Byrne resigned as the PSNI chief constable in September after a series of crises. Unprecedented data breaches leaked details of more than 10,000 officers and employees, exposing them to potential targeting by dissident republicans. A court ruled that Byrne acted unlawfully in taking action against two officers over an intervention during a pandemic lockdown. Unionist politicians accuse the police of kowtowing to Sinn F\u00e9in. Yet the proportion of Catholics in the force has dwindled to 31.7% and few reach senior positions. Environment Campaigners say the Lough Neagh, the largest freshwater lake in the UK, which supplies nearly half of NI\u2019s drinking water, is \u201cdying in plain sight\u201d because of vast algal blooms. Farm slurry, human sewage, sand dredging, rising temperatures and an invasive zebra mussel species have all contributed. Dozens of governmental agencies and private organisations are responsible for the lake, splintering management and accountability. Stormont insiders say agricultural interests routinely trump environmental concerns at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera)."

            "date": "2023-10-11T14:00:41Z",
            "content": "This week the International Monetary Fund released its latest six-monthly world economic outlook and global financial stability report. As you might imagine with reports that have \u201cworld\u201d and \u201cglobal\u201d in their titles, they cover a wide range of issues, so let\u2019s breakdown what you need to know. 1. Rough times ahead The outlook\u2019s title is \u201cNavigating global divergences\u201d, which is economic-speak for saying things are good in some places and bad in others. For Australia the story is that this year should be better than the IMF expected back in April, but still worse than it expected a year ago. Meanwhile, next year looks to be a shocker \u2013 the IMF has revised GDP growth for 2024 from a projected 1.7% in April down to 1.2%: If the graph does not display click here But here\u2019s the thing: 1.7% is already terrible; 1.2% is historically bad. From the end of the 1990s recession to the year before the pandemic, median annual GDP growth was 2.9%. The IMF does not expect us to achieve annual growth greater than 2.3% out to 2028: If the graph does not display click here The GDP per capita story is even worse \u2013 the IMF projects our economy next year to only increase due to population growth. 2. Higher unemployment and inflation Back in April, the IMF thought Australia\u2019s unemployment next year would be 4.1% before rising to 4.7% in 2027. Now it estimates unemployment will be up to 4.3% in 2024 and hit 4.9% in 2028: If the graph does not display click here The good news is the IMF is more optimistic about unemployment for this year than it was six months ago, but you can\u2019t predict historically low economic growth in 2024 and not expect that to affect jobs. We know that the Reserve Bank thinks we need unemployment to rise to 4.5% to get inflation back below 3%, so it is a bit concerning that these new estimates of higher unemployment are not accompanied by new estimates of lower inflation. In fact, the opposite: If the graph does not display click here In April the IMF thought inflation would be under 3% by 2025; now it projects that occurring in 2027. The IMF did report that across the advanced economies \u201cthere is scant evidence of a \u2018wage-price spiral\u2019 and real wages remain below pre-pandemic levels\u201d and that \u201ccompany profits have increased robustly over the past two years, with wages having risen more slowly than prices\u201d. This is expected to reverse over the next few years as workers attempt to recover the lost value of their wages. But the IMF notes that inflation generally comes down faster when firms and employees adopt a \u201cforward-looking\u201d expectation rather than a backwards-looking one. That highlights just how tough it will be for workers to regain the value of their wages, when the pressure will be for them to pursue wage growth over the next two years that ignores the past two. 3. Paying off a mortgage in Australia is harder than elsewhere The global financial stability report found that over the past year, house prices in many major economies have declined in real terms (ie that house prices have risen by less than inflation), but these declines \u2013 sharp as they may be \u2013 have not eroded the big surge in prices since 2019: If the graph does not display click here It also found that across the major economies, only the US had bigger interest rate raises than here. But because Australia has more mortgages with variable rates, the impact of rate rises here is much bigger. One other reason the impact is bigger is that the cost of mortgages relative to income is much bigger here than the other nations the IMF examined: If the graph does not display click here 4. India is not the new China There have been a few stories around recently about how China\u2019s economy is struggling and that India is about to overtake China\u2019s population. This will have an impact on Australia, of course, given China is our biggest trade partner. But we need to pump the brakes on the hot takes suggesting that India is the new global economic wunderkind. China\u2019s economy over the next four years is still expected to grow at around 4% a year, although this is well down on the 10% average growth during the boom. But India is expected to grow at around only 6% a year over the next few years. Fast, yes, but not China-like (nor even like Japan and Korea after the second world war): If the graph does not display click here While India will overtake China as the most populous nation, its economy is much smaller. It might become the third-biggest economy in the world by the end of the decade, but that is still much smaller than China or the United States: If the graph does not display click here All of which means that until 2029 at least, the US and China will still drive the global economy: If the graph does not display click here But as with all things, this assumes that the predictions come true, and as every IMF outlook shows, even six months can drastically change the outlook, let alone six years. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "date": "2023-10-11T20:41:20Z",
            "content": "Shares in Birkenstock fell 12.6% after landing on the US stock market, valuing the German shoemaker at $7.5bn as investors bet there was less mileage in consumer demand for its cork-soled sandals, which have become an unlikely fashion success story. On Tuesday evening the footwear firm priced its shares at $46 ahead of the first day of trading in New York, where it is using the symbol \u201cBIRK\u201d. That figure was in the middle of the $44 to $49 guidance provided last week and valued the company at $8.6bn (\u00a37bn). The shares promptly fell as trading commented on the New York Stock Exchange, however, and closed at $40.20 on Wednesday. Birkenstock executives, including its chief executive, Oliver Reichert, waved the shoes aloft as they launched the stock market float on Wall Street earlier on Wednesday. After plodding away successfully for decades the Birkenstock brand hit the big time during the pandemic when the shift to working from home saw shoppers seek out companies that offered both comfort and heritage. With workers now back in the office, more relaxed dress codes mean there has been no need to switch back to traditional work attire. This relaxed mood helped Birkenstock shift 30m pairs last year, with sales up almost 30% to \u00a31.1bn, resulting in a bottom line of \u00a3162m. With a customer base that is 72% female, Birkenstock is also benefiting from a change in mindset among young women who no longer subscribe to high heels and delicate footwear as a feminine ideal. The initial public offering is raising about $1.5bn for the 250-year-old orthopaedic shoe brand. A third of it will be used to repay debt with the rest going to the private equity owner L Catterton, which acquired a majority stake in 2021. As part of the company\u2019s sales pitch to investors, Birkenstock\u2019s chief executive, Oliver Reichert \u2013 who became the first non-family member to run it when he took the helm in 2013 \u2013 set out plans to sell other types of shoes, including clogs, trainers, shoes and boots, as it looks to end its reliance on sandals. However, analysts have warned that the shoemaker is making its debut as a public company in difficult market conditions. Investors are worried about the gloomy economic backdrop and declining consumer confidence, as well as the poor performance of initial public offerings by other footwear brands such as Dr Martens, which has suffered a collapse in value since its 2021 listing. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there is some caution among investors about the path ahead for the brand,\u201d said Susanna Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, who pointed to the \u201cdisappointing trajectories\u201d of Dr Martens and Allbirds since their respective arrivals on the market. \u201cInvestors who want to buy may have to buckle up for a potentially volatile ride ahead,\u201d Streeter added, as \u201ca spurt of uncertainty often follows high-profile listings.\u201d It comes after a handful of highly-anticipated arrivals on the market tested demand after a prolonged slump in activity. While the chip designer Arm Holdings and grocery delivery app Instacart initially enjoyed robust debuts, they both came under pressure on Wednesday."

            "content": "Birkenstock, the resurgent German sandal maker once beloved by healthcare workers, is set to be valued at up to \u20ac9.2bn ($9.7bn) when it floats on the stock market this month. Around 32.2 million ordinary shares will be put on the New York Stock Exchange in an initial public offering. On Monday, the company priced its shares at $44 to $49 each, which could see the company raise up to $1.58bn. The German brand has seen somewhat of a resurgence over the past two years, and are now a favourite among celebrities and influencers, with fans including Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid and Sienna Miller. One of its brands was featured in the Barbie movie, with Margot Robbie seen donning a pair of pink Birkenstock. Last year they were one of the UK\u2019s most purchased fashion items. The stock flotation \u2013 due to take place on 11 October, according to industry reports \u2013 marks a milestone for the company founded in 1774 to make orthopaedic shoes. By 1897, Konrad Birkenstock had made the first flexible sole fitting the contours of the feet. The company remained in the hands of the founding family until 2021, when it sold a majority stake to private equity group L Catterton and the family holding fund of French luxury magnate Bernard Arnault. But the sandals, with their broad straps and cork and latex soles, had begun to gain international acclaim well before that. Brought to the United States in the 1960s, the sandals were quickly adopted by hippies who took to their no-frills comfort and claimed their utilitarian look as an anti-fashion badge. But it was when supermodel Kate Moss donned them for a fashion shoot in the 1990s that the sandals were propelled into standard footwear for A-listers. Brands from Paco Rabanne and Valentino to Celine have customised their versions of Birkenstocks, even putting them on runways. Actress Frances McDormand padded on stage at the Oscars in February 2019 in a yellow pair \u2013 vindicating the idea that footwear does not need to be painful to be glamourous. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cFashionistas can be fickle and while Birkenstock may be basking in rays of popularity right now, it\u2019s going to have to run fast to keep up in the stylish stakes. Counterfeit goods could also cause the company to lose its footing in the fast-moving fashion environment.\u201d In the nine months ending 30 June this year, Birkenstock recorded revenues of \u20ac1.11bn ($1.17bn), up 21% from the same period a year earlier. Net profit for the nine months was \u20ac129.1m, down 20% from \u20ac103.3m euros a year ago. While other companies have shifted production to places where labour is generally cheaper, such as Asia, Birkenstock says 95% of its products are assembled in Germany. Headquartered in the western city of Linz am Rhein, the company has several manufacturing sites in the country, and around 6,200 employees worldwide. Birkenstock, which will list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cBIRK\u201d, also revealed the nomination of Alexandre Arnault, the son of billionaire LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, to its board.

Our second year of rampant cosmos suphureus, originally from a friend in Vancouver. Maybe the easiest of all seed to save. Howard also grew them at home. Our flower palette pretty much sticks to sweet peas, yellows, oranges and reds. Constant sunflowers, nasturtiums and calendula, and scarlet tagetes Ildkongen. This was the year, though, I fell for African marigolds (tagetes erecta), in lemon and classic orange. We will grow them again. Our second year too of glorious Grandpa Ott morning glory. A new addiction for me. As always, we asked Jane Scotter from Fern Verrow to sow sweet peas for us in her propagating greenhouse. Transplanted to the plot in May. My favourite flower scent of all. We grew a stunning red Thai corn from Kala\u2019s travels, more pumpkins and cougettes than before, mostly from Franchi (Seeds of Italy), bought off a rack in Camisa, a favourite Soho Italian deli. Highly recommended for bold beautiful packets with generous amounts of seed. A few other of the smaller suppliers we rate: Brown Envelope Seed, Vital Seeds, Real Seeds, Plants of Distinction, Tamar Organics, Suffolk Herbs, Chiltern Seeds, and Higgledy Garden, of course. I was, though, saddened to see the Seed Co-operative fail. We had a mixed time with French beans (climbing, in numerous colours), due to my absence and rampant tiny snails. Perhaps the same story with the tear peas. Many of the edible leaves grew well and we have hopes of Japanese mustards and various chards lasting late into the year, maybe more. The constant self-seeding orache and crimson amaranth thrived as always. But now winter is knocking. Much of our early planting is composting and our horse manure order\u2019s in. So please tell me, what worked well (and less well) where you grow? Allan Jenkins\u2019s Plot 29 (4th Estate, \u00a39.99) is out now. Order it for \u00a38.49 from guardianbookshop.com"

            "date": "2023-10-30T19:51:39Z",
            "content": "The White House is urging all schools to carry the emergency overdose reversal drug naloxone and train students and faculty on how to administer it. A letter from the US education department and the White House\u2019s national drug control policy office, first obtained by Axios, urged schools to \u201cfocus on measures to prevent youth drug use and ensure that every school has naloxone and has prepared its students and faculty to use it. \u201cOur schools are on the frontlines of this epidemic, but our teachers and students can be equipped with tools to save lives,\u201d the education secretary, Miguel Cardona, and Rahul Gupta, the director of the national drug control policy office, wrote in the letter. According to an education department spokesperson, the letter will be sent to every state education agency, intergovernmental groups, and local, state and national education associations, Axios reports. \u201cOverdose deaths among adolescents doubled from 2019 to 2020 and continue to rise, even though youth rates of drug use have remained stagnant. That\u2019s because a teenager today can log onto social media with a smartphone and buy what they think is an opioid pain medicine or a prescription stimulant to help them study \u2013 and instead die from one pill that actually has fentanyl in it. Just one pill,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAnd data show that two-thirds of adolescent drug poisoning deaths occurred with a potential bystander nearby, but naloxone was often not administered,\u201d it added, citing a recent study that found that among persons aged 14\u201318 years, overdose deaths increased 94% from 2019 to 2020 and 20% from 2020 to 2021. The study also found that the median monthly overdose deaths among persons between 10 and 19 years old increased 109% from July\u2013December 2019 to July\u2013December 2021. Moreover, the study found that potential bystanders were present during two-thirds of overdose deaths among adolescents but only 30% of the deaths had evidence that naloxone was administered. Naloxone is medication approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), which is designed to rapidly reverse an opioid overdose from drugs such as heroin, oxycodone, morphine or fentanyl. It is a temporary treatment and public health officials say urgent medical care should be sought as soon as possible in the event of an overdose, including where an emergency naloxone dose is given. \u201cStudies show that naloxone access can reduce overdose death rates, that its availability does not lead to increases in youth drug use, and that it causes no harm if used on a person who is not overdosing on opioids,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIt is important to note that individuals should not be afraid to administer naloxone, as most states have Good Samaritan Laws protecting bystanders who aid at the scene of an overdose,\u201d it added. In March, the FDA approved the sale of Narcan, a brand of naloxone, without a prescription, making it the first opioid reversal drug to be sold over the counter. Recent reports reveal that schools across the country have started to stock up on Narcan and allow students to bring their own supply of the overdose reversal drug. In March, the Gazette in Iowa reported that schools in the state have started adding naloxone to their medical emergency tool kits after a state law passed last year that allows schools to stock and administer the drug in cases of opioid overdose. In May, Axios reported a number of schools in the Washington DC area also added Narcan to address the overdose crisis, with several school administrators and safety coordinators telling the outlet that they have emergency boxes of naloxone stocked in middle and high schools. A CBS report in June revealed that New York City public school nurses have started to receive Narcan training. Meanwhile, high schools and school buses in Fresno, California, have supplies of Narcan, ABC30 reported in August."

            "date": "2023-10-23T10:53:55Z",
            "content": "Chevron has announced plans to buy the oil producer Hess Corporation in a $53bn (\u00a344bn) deal, becoming the second American energy giant to place a vast bet on fossil fuel production this month. The all-stock takeover, which will increase Chevron\u2019s presence in oil-rich Guyana, was unveiled less than two weeks after another of the world\u2019s largest oil companies, Exxon Mobil, said it would acquire the shale group Pioneer Natural Resources for $59.5bn. Such major acquisitions have raised expectations of further consolidation across the industry. \u201cWe\u2019ve got too many CEOs per BOE [barrels of oil equivalent] so consolidation is natural,\u201d said Michael Wirth, chief executive of Chevron, who added that the world could expect to see other deals. Guyana has become a leading oil producer in recent years after huge discoveries by Exxon, its partner Hess and China\u2019s CNOOC, which together produce 400,000 barrels a day of crude from two offshore vessels and have said they could develop up to 10 offshore projects. To buy Hess, Chevron is offering $171 a share, a premium of about 4.9% on the stock\u2019s last closing price. The smaller company\u2019s chief executive, John Hess, is expected to join Chevron\u2019s board of directors once the deal is closed in the first half of 2024. The combined company was expected to grow production and free cashflow faster and for longer than Chevron\u2019s current five-year guidance, the companies said. Chevron\u2019s vice-president and chief financial officer, Pierre Breber, said \u201cWith greater confidence in projected long-term cash generation, Chevron intends to return more cash to shareholders with higher dividend per share growth and higher share repurchases.\u201d While the Biden administration has sought to hasten the shift towards renewable energy in the face of the climate crisis, this acquisition underlines the confidence of US oil giants that fossil fuel output will not be significantly hampered in the coming years. Wirth said: \u201cThis combination positions Chevron to strengthen our long-term performance and further enhance our advantaged portfolio by adding world-class assets.\u201d Both companies are focused on \u201cdelivering higher returns and lower carbon\u201d, he claimed. But campaigners have criticized such deals, questioning how consolidation in the oil industry will help the world to achieve climate targets. Cassidy DiPaola, campaign manager at Fossil Free Media, described the takeover as \u201cyet another concerning sign that the fossil fuel industry has no intention of slowing down, despite increasingly dire warnings from climate scientists\u201d. The boards of Chevron and Hess have unanimously approved the deal, which is subject to regulatory scrutiny. Shareholders in Hess must also approve it. Shares in Chevron slipped 2.4% during early trading in New York. Shares in Hess rose 0.8%. Reuters contributed to this article"

            "date": "2023-10-18T08:04:31Z",
            "content": "The latest inflation figures will be a huge disappointment to Rishi Sunak, as they will be to millions of households across the UK who long for the cost of living crisis to end. Economists expected a small fall in September from August\u2019s 6.7% inflation rate, but instead it remained stubbornly unchanged. The prime minister promised in January to halve last year\u2019s 10.7% rate by the end of 2023 and that looks in jeopardy. To steal the words of the former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson when he acknowledged how the closing stages of the men\u2019s 2003 Premier League title race was a close-run thing, it\u2019s squeaky bum time inside No 10. For those advisers who told Sunak the target was a surefire winner, giving Jeremy Hunt some room for manoeuvre in his autumn statement on 22 November and more importantly in his pre-election budget next year, life is going to be uncomfortable. There was better news from a fall in food prices, which dipped month on month by 0.1%, compared with a rise of 1.1% between the same two months a year ago. This brought the annual rate of food inflation down to 12.2% from a recent high of 19.2%. Next month, there is likely to be a one percentage point drop in the consumer prices index (CPI) from gas and electricity prices, which have stabilised since the dramatic increases seen last year. James Smith, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the effect of the energy price cap increase last year dropping out of the CPI comparisons would be even larger, sending inflation below 5% and handing Downing Street a comfortable victory. Suren Thiru, economics director at the accountancy body ICAEW, was not so sure, saying only that the fall in energy costs would only bring inflation below 6%. The wild card is the cost of petrol, which offset the drop in food last month and could continue to climb if the crisis in the Middle East escalates. Thiru said September\u2019s \u201csticky inflation\u201d meant a Bank of England meeting to set interest rates in November was \u201con a knife-edge\u201d. Another interest rate rise risked \u201cneedlessly suffocating economic activity and deepening the financial distress for people and businesses\u201d, he said, but it was possible if policymakers decided to take a hard line. Smith said he was concerned that ministers would choose to ignore September\u2019s inflation figure when setting benefits next year. The September figure is supposed to be the basis for the increase in benefits the next April, allowing 9 million recipients a chance to plan their household incomes. He said a decision to limit the increase, as it has done seven times since 2010, would mean many low- and middle-income families across Britain \u201cwill pay a heavy price\u201d. He added families who receive benefits would experience a fall in incomes of \u00a3460 on average from a freeze, \u201cwhile many low-income families with kids face much higher income losses, rising to \u00a31,200 for a low-income couple with two children\u201d. It is an indication of the difficulties faced by all households when inflation remains elevated, eating into disposable incomes. A rise in interest rates from 5.25% will bring extra pain running into thousands of pounds a year for mortgage payers, posing another headache for the prime minister as he tries to navigate his way to sunnier economic uplands."

            "title": "UK inflation expected to fall to 6.5% in September",
            "date": "2023-10-16T04:00:31Z",
            "content": "Headline inflation eased again in September, official figures are expected to show this week, while pay growth is slowing. Economists polled by Refinitiv expect the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to say annual inflation fell slightly to 6.5% in September from 6.7% in August. However, that is still well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. A steeper fall in prices growth was likely until oil prices jumped, with the cost of a barrel of Brent crude up $10 over the month to a peak of $97 at the end of September. It has since fallen back to $90. Motorists in the south-east have seen petrol prices at the pumps rise above \u00a31.56 a litre and the cost of a litre of diesel increase to \u00a31.60, according to the AA motoring group. The jobs market has also weakened, increasing unemployment and reducing the need for employers to keep pushing wage bills higher. The ONS said last month that total earnings (including bonuses) in the three months to July 2023 were 8.5% higher than in the same period a year earlier \u2013 the highest since modern records began in 2001 other than during the Covid-19 pandemic. Most analysts said the exceptional increase in average incomes \u2013 boosted by bonuses to NHS workers \u2013 most likely weakened in August to 8.3% or lower. Earnings growth without bonuses is expected to be unchanged at 7.8% in the three months to August compared with a year earlier, according to economists polled by Refinitiv. Michael Stull, a senior executive at the recruiter Manpower, said the demand for workers was weaker than a year ago, though there were \u201cmixed messages\u201d from employers. \u201cTech firms and consultancies that over-hired staff during the pandemic are making layoffs while other firms that need skilled IT people are hiring. And there is still an unsatisfied demand for drivers and skilled technical workers,\u201d he said. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said concern among mortgage holders that \u201csticky inflation\u201d would persuade Bank of England policymakers to raise interest rates for a 15th time in 21 months when they meet in November was misplaced. Beck, who has forecast inflation to remain at 6.7% in September, mainly due to the rise in oil prices, said there would probably be a steep fall in the last three months of the year, taking inflation towards 4%. \u201cInflation is now expected to fall slightly faster than was forecast in the summer, and could reach 4.5% by the end of 2023, before hitting the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target during the second half of 2024,\u201d he said. He expects Threadneedle Street to hold rates at 5.25% in November for a second consecutive time and begin cutting them next May to help revive what he expects will be a stagnant economy. Bank of England officials said last week that the decision would be a nail-biter, especially with mounting political uncertainty because of the conflict in the Middle East. Chief economist Huw Pill described the next interest rate decision as \u201cfinely balanced\u201d while Governor Andrew Bailey said it would be a tight affair and there was \u201can awful lot left to do\u201d to bring down inflation to the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Gas prices have added to the upward pressure on inflation, increasing by even more than oil prices over the last two months. A reduction in the government\u2019s energy price cap will still go ahead in October, though a sustained increase in the cost on international markets could force a reversal next year. Analysts said they were concerned that the Israel-Hamas war could lead to boycotts and blockades that restrict supplies and send prices even higher. Ruth Gregory, a senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said a rise in oil prices to $100 a barrel \u201cwouldn\u2019t boost inflation by much\u201d. However, she said: \u201cThe longer the conflict goes on, or the more widespread it becomes, the greater the upside risks to inflation. If oil prices were to rise to $100 a barrel and the recent rise in gas futures pricing were maintained, then the average inflation rate in 2024 would be one percentage point higher than our forecast.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-19T14:36:28Z",
            "content": "The Treasury\u2019s independent economic forecaster has admitted it underestimated the scale of the inflation shock sparked by the Covid pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Blaming the rapid succession of shocks hitting the economy, the Office for Budget Responsibility said it \u201csignificantly underestimated the strength and persistence of inflation\u201d. It also found corporate profits had been significantly stronger than expected in the past two years, including a 50% increase in finance industry profits fuelled by a boom in the banking industry, rather than the 13% rise it had anticipated. In its annual forecasting evaluation report, the OBR said it had made some \u201cgenuine errors\u201d, but that many of the differences between its predictions and the outcomes for the economy had been difficult to anticipate. \u201cTo a significant extent these differences between outturns and previous forecasts are inevitable given the inherent difficulty in forecasting the path of the economy and the consequent effect on the public finances, which has been amplified recently by unforecastable shocks that hit the economy.\u201d The OBR has faced a barrage of criticism for its forecasting record from MPs, particularly from rightwing Conservatives who had sought to curb the watchdog\u2019s influence under Liz Truss\u2019s short-lived premiership. Evaluating its March 2021 and March 2022 forecasts for the 2022-23 financial year, the OBR defended its record by saying its judgments were made before the invasion of Ukraine, while last year\u2019s estimates came before the full impact of the conflict could be quantified. It also said it had underestimated how damaging rocketing energy prices could be for the UK economy, while arguing Bank of England interest rate increases had taken longer than expected to counter the inflationary fallout. The indirect effect of the energy shock feeding through to other prices \u2013 including food and other goods \u2013 had been almost twice as large as its initial estimate, the OBR said, after it made incorrect assumptions about changes in the UK economy since the 1970s that could have helped limit the impact. Although there had been a decline in the overall energy intensity of the economy in the past 50 years and the structure of the Labour market had changed, the impact was compounded by the gas price surge coming on top of disruption from Covid supply bottlenecks in global trade. A labour shortfall after the pandemic had also helped workers to negotiate higher wage settlements than anticipated. The OBR said it would revisit its assessments in its next forecasts, which will be published alongside next month\u2019s autumn statement and used by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to inform the government\u2019s tax and spending plans. Inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022, the highest level for more than 40 years, with an annual average of more than 8 percentage points higher than the OBR had anticipated two years ago. While its March 2022 forecast factored in some of the pressure on energy prices from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it still expected a significantly lower inflation peak of 8.7%. Alongside higher inflation, the OBR said it had underestimated government borrowing, as higher government spending on cost of living support outweighed a rise in tax receipts from more resilient household spending, wage growth, and company profits. Highlighting the unexpected strength of corporate profits, it said non-oil and non-financial company profits had risen by 7.3% in 2022, against predictions for a fall of 1.4% assumed in its March 2022 forecast. Banks in particular benefited from a rise in their net interest margins, the OBR said, reflecting gains from rising Bank of England interest rates on the difference between the interest lenders charge on loans and deposits."

            "date": "2023-10-27T13:15:01Z",
            "content": "Russia\u2019s central bank has increased interest rates by more than expected, to 15%, after a steep rise in inflation. The bank blamed the war-torn economy\u2019s limited capacity to respond to an increase in consumer demand for the rise in inflation to 6.6% in October, from 6% in the previous month. Even with the increase in borrowing costs, inflation is expected to carry on climbing to 7.5% by the end of the year, the central bank said, before falling back to 4% next year. \u201cCurrent inflationary pressures have significantly increased to a level above the Bank of Russia\u2019s expectations,\u201d the bank said. \u201cHigher inflationary pressures are seen across an increasingly broader range of goods and services. This means that a steady rise in domestic demand is progressively exceeding the capabilities to expand the production of goods and the provision of services. These conditions boost businesses\u2019 appetite to pass higher costs on to consumers, which is driven among others by the weakening of the rouble and labour shortages.\u201d Seasonally adjusted price growth \u2013 a measure of rising prices that indicates the underlying pressures facing Russian businesses \u2013 averaged 12.1% in annualised terms in the third quarter, up from 5.1% in the three months to the end of June. Nevertheless, the two-point increase surprised analysts, who had expected a one percentage point rise. With much of Russia\u2019s manufacturing production geared towards the war effort after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the economy remains unable to respond to a rise in private consumer spending, which has spent most of the last 18 months about 10% below levels seen before the invasion. The central bank governor, Elvira Nabiullina, said that while the situation in the Middle East had clouded the outlook, she had no choice but to counteract the inflationary effect of Moscow\u2019s budget increases. Earlier this month the rouble slumped to 102 for each $1, before the imposition of capital controls on the flow of roubles leaving Russia triggered a recovery to 93 roubles this week. The depressed value of the currency has increased the cost of imports and provided another impetus for rising prices. Before the invasion of Ukraine, 75 roubles could buy $1. Russia\u2019s GDP will expand by 2.2% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s most recent prediction. Much of the increase follows a surge in spending on equipment for the military. The defence budget has risen to an equivalent of 3.9% of GDP this year, from 2.7% in 2021, the year before the invasion of Ukraine. It will jump by more than 70% in 2024, reaching about 6% of GDP, according to Reuters\u2019 assessment of official plans. Consumers have more to spend after an increase by Moscow in welfare benefit payments to families and older people, seen by many analysts as an effort by Vladimir Putin to shore up domestic support for the war. Putin has greater funds after a 70% increase in gas prices over the past three months and a rise in oil prices. The National Bank of Ukraine was able this month to cut interest rates by four percentage points to 16%, deeper than the 18% forecast in a Bloomberg survey. After collapsing by almost 30% last year following Russia\u2019s attack, Ukraine\u2019s gross domestic product will climb 4.9% in 2023, up from a forecast of 2.9%, the central bank said."

            "date": "2023-10-26T12:15:46Z",
            "content": "The European Central Bank has paused its toughest cycle of interest rate increases since the launch of the euro amid growing fears about the eurozone economy. In a decision widely expected in financial markets, the ECB left its key policy rates unchanged for the first time in more than a year, halting a round of 10 previous increases in the cost of borrowing after concluding it had done enough for now to tackle the rising cost of living. Although inflation remains higher than the bank\u2019s 2% target, concerns are mounting about the impact of rate rises on European economies, with warnings of a recession in the single-currency area led by a downturn in Germany, where a manufacturing slump led to business activity contracting for a fourth straight month in October. \u201cThe economy is likely to remain weak for the remainder of this year,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, the ECB president. \u201cBut as inflation falls further, household real incomes recover and the demand for euro area exports picks up, the economy should strengthen over the coming years.\u201d Speaking after the decision in Athens, Lagarde warned that weaker growth in the global economy would weigh on the eurozone, with risks from geopolitical tensions amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. \u201cThis may result in firms and households becoming less confident and more uncertain about the future, and dampen growth further,\u201d she said. Thursday\u2019s decision leaves the key deposit rate, paid on commercial bank deposits, at 4% \u2013 the highest since the euro was launched in 1999. The main refinancing operations rate, providing the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, was left unchanged at 4.5%, while the marginal lending facility rate, offering overnight credit to banks, was left at 4.75%. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are widely expected to keep rates on hold at policy meetings next week. With inflation at more than twice the central bank\u2019s target, economists expect borrowing costs will remain at elevated levels for a prolonged period of time across the 20-country bloc. The ECB said it was determined to ensure inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target, saying its key interest rates were \u201cat levels that, [if] maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal\u201d. The decision aligns the ECB with the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, as the world\u2019s leading central banks pause to take stock after the sharpest cycle of interest rate increases in decades. It comes at a delicate moment for the world economy as rising oil prices add to inflationary pressures, while US growth remains more resilient than expected. Figures from the US economy showed growth accelerated in the third quarter to 4.9% on an annualised basis \u2013 stronger than forecast by economists. Lagarde said the ECB stood ready to take further action on borrowing costs as inflation was \u201cexpected to stay too high for too long,\u201d but said that previous rate rises were increasingly dampening demand and would help to bring inflation down again over time. Inflation across the eurozone fell sharply in September to 4.3%, from 5.2% in August. A year earlier, the rate was 9.9% after the increase in global energy prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, higher borrowing costs, stubbornly high energy prices and a wider slowdown in international trade are having a worsening impact, with Germany \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest economy \u2013 especially hard hit. Business surveys show private-sector activity in Germany contracted for a fourth straight month in October amid a collapse in manufacturing output, suggesting the country may already have entered recession. Germany\u2019s dominant industrial sector suffered a new shock on Thursday, when shares in the engineering firm Siemens Energy plunged as it sought a bailout from the German government, after a string of technical problems and higher costs at its wind turbine arm. The Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, said on Monday that its economy was likely to have shrunk in the third quarter of 2023. Germany posted zero growth in the second quarter and its economy contracted by 0.1% in the first three months of the year. Economists regard two consecutive quarters of falling economic output as a recession. Marcus Brookes, chief investment officer at Quilter Investors, said the ECB was unlikely to raise rates again. \u201cThe pressure will quickly shift to cutting rates given the lack of economic growth. This is the problem facing central banks now. \u201cThey have successfully guided economies to this level of rates without tipping them into full-blown recessions, although Germany is experiencing one and others will have felt like they were in one.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-31T12:32:24Z",
            "content": "The eurozone is teetering on the brink of a winter recession after the latest official figures showed its economy contracted by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2023. In a worse than forecast performance, the 20-nation single currency zone has now failed to grow in three of the past four quarters, leaving its economy only 0.1% higher than it was a year earlier. Business surveys have pointed to further weakness in the months ahead, despite a sharp fall in the eurozone\u2019s annual inflation rate from 4.3% in September to 2.9% in October. A recession is defined as two successive quarters of falling activity as measured by gross domestic product. Higher interest rates from the European Central Bank, the dampening impact of inflation on consumer spending power and the weakness of exports as a result of a slowing global economy have led to the flatlining of the eurozone in the past year. The wider EU economy grew by 0.1% in the third quarter and was also 0.1% bigger than in the July to September period of 2022. Of the zone\u2019s four biggest economies, Germany contracted by 0.1%, France grew by 0.1% and Italy remained unchanged, while Spain grew by 0.3%. Ireland suffered the biggest contraction (-1.8%), while Latvia (+0.6%) and Belgium (0.5%) posted the strongest growth. Excluding the sharp quarterly contraction in Ireland, eurozone GDP was unchanged. Bert Colijn, the senior eurozone economist at ING bank, said: \u201cA drop in eurozone GDP keeps a small technical recession in the second half of 2023 a realistic prospect. With inflation falling faster than expected, the debate within the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council is set to turn more dovish, but don\u2019t expect rate cuts any time soon.\u201d The sharper-than-expected drop in the eurozone\u2019s annual inflation rate was largely the result of movements in food and energy prices. Core inflation \u2013 which excludes food and energy \u2013 fell from 4.5% to 4.2%. Jack Allen-Reynolds, the deputy chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe eurozone economy contracted in the third quarter and the continued weakness of the surveys at the start of the fourth quarter suggests that the outlook is poor.\u201d Analysts said the ECB \u2013 which has raised interest rates by a total of 4.5 percentage points since the summer of 2022 \u2013 was likely to keep borrowing costs on hold despite the latest drop in the eurozone inflation rate."

            "date": "2023-10-12T08:42:50Z",
            "content": "The UK economy returned to growth in August, as activity picked up after a worse-than-expected slump in July. A modest 0.2% rise in gross domestic product in August was driven by a jump in business services output that offset a downturn in manufacturing and the negative impact of the US film and TV writers\u2019 strike, which has closed down large parts of the British film industry. A previous estimate of GDP in July of 0.5% was revised down to 0.6% to leave growth over the the three months to August \u2013 a closely watched figure in the City \u2013 up by 0.3%. Despite the modest growth in August, concerns are rising that the UK economy is heading into recession as higher interest rates weigh on demand. Bank of England policymakers last month left interest rates on hold for the first time in nearly two years, keeping them at 5.25% in response to a weak outlook for the economy and despite high inflation. Swati Dhingra, one of the Bank\u2019s nine rate-setters, said on Thursday that most of the impact of 14 rate rises was yet to be felt. \u201cThe economy\u2019s already flatlined, and we think only about 20% or 25% of the impact of the interest rate hikes have been fed through to the economy,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s also this worry that that might mean we\u2019re going to have to pay a higher cost than we should be paying.\u201d The main driver of growth in August was the services sector, which grew by 0.4%, the Office for National Statistics said. A return to more normal levels of school attendance across the eduction sector was another boost for GDP, the ONS said, while both computer programmers and engineers both had strong months. Growth was restricted by the manufacturing sector, which had a setback in August after a strong June and July spurred by a rise in car factory output. The construction sector slipped by 0.4% in August after a 0.5% fall in July. The arts, entertainment and recreation sector fell by 7.4% in August. after a 6.8% expansion in July. Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, predicted the UK economy would shrink in the July-September quarter, and again in October-December. That would mean two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession. Gregory said: \u201cThe 0.2% month-on-month rise in GDP in August will raise hopes that the economy has escaped a recession. But some of the strength of GDP in August was due to temporary factors and the timelier survey measures of activity point to a drop in real GDP in September. \u201cSo we are sticking to our below-consensus forecast that the economy will shrink by 0.2% quarter on quarter in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter.\u201d Labour said the figures showed the economy remained trapped in a \u201clow growth, high-tax cycle\u201d that was \u201cleaving working people worse off\u201d. However, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the rise in GDP showed the economy was resilient. Hunt said: \u201cThe UK has grown faster than France and Germany since the pandemic and today\u2019s data shows the economy is more resilient than expected. While this is a good sign, we still need to tackle inflation so we can unlock sustainable growth.\u201d Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said high interest rates were hurting growth, pushing the economy \u201cuncomfortably close to recession\u201d into 2024. \u201cThis disappointingly weak return to growth points to an economy fraying at the edges as inflation and higher interest rates hinder businesses and consumers,\u201d Thiru said. \u201cWith inflation, higher taxes and the lagged impact of previous interest rate rises weighing heavily on consumer demand and business activity, the UK is likely to remain uncomfortably close to recession well into next year. At the International Monetary Fund conference in Marrakech this week, the Washington-based body said its latest forecasts showed the UK economy would grow by 0.5% this year, overturning an earlier estimate that it would shrink by 0.3%. However, the IMF said the UK would be the slowest growing economy in the G7 club of advanced countries next year, with a growth rate of just 0.6%, weaker than growth of 0.9% and 1.3% expected for Germany and France respectively."

            "content": "Central banks risk tipping a stalling global economy into a full-blown recession unless they relax their 2% inflation targets and adopt a more pro-growth stance, the economic arm of the UN has warned. Pointing to evidence of a looming debt crisis in poor countries, the UN said the sharp rises in interest rates from the major central banks since 2021 had increased inequality and reduced investment but proved a blunt anti-inflation weapon. The annual report from the Geneva-based UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) said global growth was set to slow from 3% in 2022 to 2.4% in 2023, with little sign of a rebound next year. Richard Kozul-Wright, the director of Unctad\u2019s globalisation and development strategies division, said: \u201cThe global economy is stalling, with Europe teetering on the edge of recession, China facing strong headwinds and financial stresses are reappearing in the United States. \u201cAt this moment, pushing down on the fiscal brakes and keeping interest rates high is the wrong policy combination for steadying the global economy.\u201d Unctad said the global economy was \u201cat a crossroads\u201d and poorer countries were being disproportionately hurt by the higher interest rates in advanced countries such as the US. A widening wealth gap threatened to undermine the fragile economic recovery and the aspirations of developing nations to meet the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals. \u201cDebt burdens, the silent weight on many developing countries, remain a major concern,\u201d the 2023 trade and development report said. \u201cRising interest rates, weakening currencies and sluggish export growth have combined to squeeze the fiscal space for essential needs, transforming the growing debt service burden into an unfolding development crisis.\u201d Warning that almost a third of low- or lower-middle income \u201cfrontier economies\u201d were on the precipice of debt distress, the UN body said addressing the issue was paramount since meeting the demands of their creditors was \u201ccrushing too many developing countries\u201d. Inflation had come down from its highs in late 2022 but its descent had been uneven and was caused largely by the easing of supply-side pressures, Unctad said, adding that the recent rise in oil prices would add to cost of living concerns at a time when insufficient wage growth was squeezing household budgets. \u201cTighter monetary policy has so far contributed little to price easing and at a steep cost in terms of inequality and damaged investment prospects,\u201d Unctad said. \u201cCentral bankers should relax their 2% inflation target and assume a wider stabilising role.\u201d The report said reducing inequality should be a policy priority in developed and developing countries, with a close watch kept on the share of national income going to workers. It said real \u2013 inflation-adjusted \u2013 wages should increase in line with productivity growth, with concrete commitments toward comprehensive social protection. Unctad\u2019s secretary general, Rebeca Grynspan, said: \u201cTo safeguard the world economy from future systemic crises, we must avoid the policy mistakes of the past and embrace a positive reform agenda. \u201cWe need a balanced policy mix of fiscal, monetary and supply-side measures to achieve financial sustainability, boost productive investment and create better jobs. Regulation needs to address the deepening asymmetries of the international trading and financial system.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-20T13:43:41Z",
            "content": "British consumers cut back on spending last month, according to official figures, amid growing fears the retail industry has plunged into a recession before the key festive shopping season. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed retail sales volumes in Great Britain fell by 0.9% in September compared with a month earlier, as mild weather limited sales of colder weather gear and consumers cut back on non-essential spending. Sounding the alarm over the outlook for the British economy as inflation remains stubbornly high, the figure wiped out retail sales growth of 0.4% in August and was worse than City economists\u2019 forecasts for a 0.2% monthly decline. \u201cThe sector may already be back in recession,\u201d said Alex Kerr, an assistant economist at Capital Economics. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t bode well for retail sales growth in the run-up to Christmas.\u201d Industry leaders expect consumers to buy fewer and cheaper presents before the festive season as high household energy bills \u2013 with less government assistance for many this year \u2013 and rising grocery prices continue to put pressure on budgets. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Friday he expected a \u201cnoticeable drop\u201d in inflation over the coming months, helped by the reduction in the Ofgem energy price cap from October. While suggesting that Rishi Sunak was still on track to meet his promise to halve inflation this year, Bailey told the Belfast Telegraph there was still \u201cquite a way to go yet\u201d before it fell back to the Bank\u2019s 2% target. The figure unexpectedly remained unchanged at 6.7% in September, after economists had predicted a fall. According to the latest snapshot for high street and online spending, clothing sales plunged by 1.6% in September from the previous month. Retailers reported that the unseasonably warm weather had hit sales of autumnwear, after the joint-warmest September since records began in 1884. Department store and household goods sales fell by 1.6% and 2.3% respectively month on month as consumers cut back on big-ticket purchases, highlighting the pressure on households amid the cost of living crisis. With households under pressure from higher prices and a sharp rise in borrowing costs after 14 consecutive Bank of England rate increases, retail sales are expected to remain subdued in the run-up to Christmas. Economists said the monthly drop in September meant that overall economic growth had probably flatlined or even fallen. \u201cWhile no one was expecting the month to be a bright spot for the high street, the full picture suggests a harsher-than-expected reining-in of discretionary spending,\u201d said Sophie Lund-Yates, the lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cThis is a worse slide than expected and speaks to growing anxiety and the potential that we\u2019re looking at a steeper consumer pullback than forecast as we head into the Christmas trading season.\u201d UK consumer confidence continues to tumble, with GfK registering the biggest monthly fall since 1994, excluding the coronavirus pandemic, this month as households grow more nervous about the prospects for their personal finances and the wider economy. The latest gauge of consumer optimism from GfK dropped to a three-month low of -30 in October, down from September\u2019s reading of -21. \u201cThis sharp fall underlines that the cost of living crisis, and simply not having enough money to make ends meet, are still exerting acute pressure for many consumers,\u201d said Joe Staton, the client strategy director at GfK. There was a modest 0.2% rise in the volume of sales at food stores and supermarkets in September, although this was down on the 1.4% monthly increase reported in August. Fuel sales volumes rose 0.8% in September, as rail strikes prompted more people to travel by road despite a surge in the cost of petrol and diesel over recent months, in a return to growth after a drop of 1% in August. Jacqui Baker, the head of retail at the accountancy firm RSM UK, said that price-sensitive consumers were likely to have tightened their spending before the festive shopping season to hold out for Black Friday deals. \u201cConsumer confidence fell sharply in October, with remortgaging at the forefront of many consumers\u2019 minds. This will continue to weigh heavily on consumer spending, meaning retailers will have to work hard to come out on top in this year\u2019s Golden Quarter,\u201d she said. Britain\u2019s stock market saw further losses on Friday, with the FTSE 100 share index falling 1.3% to finish at its lowest closing level since late August."

Justice minister Vincent Van Quickenborne said late on Friday that he and other officials had been searching for details to understand how Abdesalem Lassoued had disappeared off the map two years ago after being denied asylum. \u201cThis morning at nine o\u2019clock, I remarked the following elements: on 15 August, 2022, there was an extradition demand by Tunisia for this man,\u201d Van Quickenborne told reporters. \u201cThis demand was transmitted on 1 September, as it should have been, by the justice expert at the Brussels prosecutor\u2019s office. The magistrate in charge did not follow up on this extradition demand and the dossier was not acted upon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an individual error. A monumental error. An unacceptable error. An error with dramatic consequences,\u201d Van Quickenborne said in announcing that he had submitted his resignation to prime minister Alexander De Croo. \u201cI am not looking for any excuses. I think it\u2019s my duty,\u201d to resign, he said. \u201cThis new information coming from the prosecutors hits me deeply as I have done everything possible to improve the judicial system.\u201d On Monday night, Lassoued shot dead two Swedish men and wounded a third man with a semiautomatic rifle. The attack forced the lockdown of more than 35,000 people in a football stadium where they had gathered to watch Belgium play Sweden. The 45-year-old attacker was fatally shot in a police operation on Tuesday. Official documents showed Lassoued had lodged asylum applications in Norway, Sweden, Italy and Belgium. He had stayed in Belgium illegally after his bid for asylum was rejected in 2020. Lassoued had applied for asylum in Belgium in November 2019. He was known to police and had been suspected of involvement in human trafficking, living illegally in Belgium and of being a risk to state security. Information provided to the Belgian authorities by an unidentified foreign government suggested that the man had been radicalised and intended to travel abroad to fight in a holy war. But the Belgian authorities were not able to establish this, so he was never listed as dangerous."

Researchers at the Technical University of Berlin said people come to see robots as part of their team. Where they think a colleague \u2013 or the technology \u2013 performs particularly well, or where they think their own contribution would not be appreciated, people tend to take a more laid-back approach, the scientists suggested. \u201cTeamwork is a mixed blessing,\u201d said Dietlind Helene Cymek, the first author of the study, which appears in the journal Frontiers in Robotics and AI. \u201cWorking together can motivate people to perform well but it can also lead to a loss of motivation because the individual contribution is not as visible. We were interested in whether we could also find such motivational effects when the team partner is a robot.\u201d The team tested their hypothesis by asking a cohort of workers to check the quality of a series of tasks; half of whom were told the tasks had been performed by a robot. While they did not work directly with the robot, named Panda, those people had seen it and were able to hear it operating. The workers were all asked to carry out checks for errors on circuit boards. Their activity was monitored by the researchers, who blurred out the images of the boards the workers received, only showing them an image they could check once they actively opened it. Initially, they said they found no statistical difference in the time the two groups \u2013 those who were told they were working with a robot and those who were not \u2013 spent inspecting the circuit boards, or in the area they searched for errors. However, when the researchers investigated the participants\u2019 error rates, they found those working with Panda were catching fewer defects after they had seen the robot had successfully flagged many errors. They said this could reflect a \u201clooking but not seeing\u201d effect, where people engage less once they feel a colleague or resource is reliable. While participants \u2013 who were asked to rate their own performance \u2013 thought they were paying an equivalent amount of attention, the researchers felt that subconsciously they had begun to assume Panda had picked up defects well. \u201cIt is easy to track where a person is looking, but much harder to tell whether that visual information is being sufficiently processed at a mental level,\u201d said Dr Linda Onnasch, a senior author of the study."

            "content": "John Vidal, the Guardian\u2019s former environment editor, has died aged 74. He died peacefully on Thursday in hospital, where he was being treated for cancer. Vidal reported on the environment for the Guardian for almost three decades until retiring in 2017, calling it \u201cthe greatest job on Earth\u201d. Afterwards, he continued to report from around the world with his trademark energy and enthusiasm and published a book, Fevered Planet: How Diseases Emerge When We Harm Nature, in June this year. The tributes to Vidal remember his pioneering environmental journalism and highlight his passion for social justice, the underdog and putting people at the centre of his stories. Katharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, said: \u201cJohn was a passionate, warm, kind, unforgettable man and brilliant journalist \u2013 a one-off and a true Guardian legend. His commitment to covering the climate and nature crisis was clear in his gripping and important reporting, rich with humanity \u2013 and he got there before anyone else. He was much loved by his colleagues, and we will miss him deeply.\u201d Sir Jonathon Porritt, one of the UK\u2019s earliest and best known environmentalists, said: \u201cI\u2019ve never known any journalist who so effectively combined uncompromising integrity, understated courage, mischief, irreverence and hard-hitting, compassionate eloquence in all his writing. He was just a wonderful friend and true champion for the environment.\u201d Paul Webster, the editor of the Observer, said: \u201cJohn provided vivid and vital journalism and wrote beautifully and passionately about the environment, pioneering coverage of issues that are now central to public life. He was an indefatigable reporter and a warm, witty and generous colleague who was much loved by his fellow journalists.\u201d Vidal was born in Ghana in 1949, and returned 60 years later to find the midwife who had delivered him as part of a story on population growth. Before joining the Guardian, he worked for Agence France-Presse, North Wales Newspapers and the Cumberland News. He also wrote McLibel: Burger Culture on Trial, a book about the suing of campaigners by McDonald\u2019s. Vidal\u2019s reporting took him to every corner of the world, particularly the troubled places where people were suffering, such as the Niger delta, Rwanda and Kabul. A series of epic reporting trips took him on climate journeys from the Himalayan glaciers of Nepal to the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh in 2009; to the glaciers of the Andes to the Amazon rainforest in 2010; from Egypt and war-torn Sudan to South Africa in 2011; and down the length of the great Mekong River in 2015. One trip, reporting on hunger in Malawi, led Vidal to set up the Gumbi education fund to educate children in one of Malawi\u2019s poorest villages. It continues its work today. Vidal also often caused \u201cgood trouble\u201d. His revelation of a leaked draft agreement at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen caused uproar, with developing countries reacting furiously to a text they saw as handing more power to rich nations. He was also imprisoned in the Faroe Islands while reporting on whaling. Paul Brown, who as environment correspondent sat next to Vidal in the Guardian newsroom for 16 years, said: \u201cJohn\u2019s talent was partly his skill as a writer, where he wrote persuasive copy that made environmental subjects come alive. It was also his unorthodox approach that got his stories in the paper, for example where he got a job as a security guard to report from the other side on how the authorities dealt with the Newbury anti-bypass protesters. Above all he was a champion of the underdog, always cheerful but relentless in pursuit of a story he thought worth telling.\u201d John Sauven, the former head of Greenpeace UK, called Vidal a legend: \u201cHe was an irresistible, booming presence at so many key moments. He was there in the Amazon and the Arctic long before they became celebrated causes \u2013 in fact he was often the reason an environmental threat was finally recognised. John was a tremendous friend to Indigenous peoples and to campaigners risking their lives on the frontline. But most of all he was a fine journalist.\u201d Tom Burke, a former special adviser to several UK environment ministers and a head of Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cJohn was a very influential environmental journalist. He, more than anyone else I remember, made visible the link between the environment and development. The idea that you could not protect the global environment in the absence of social justice is commonplace today but it was not when John first began writing about it. He was clear, consistent and correct in his passion to connect the empirical to the moral.\u201d The Green party MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cEver since I started my political life, John has always been there, shining an unflinching light on the environmental horrors that need to be exposed, and on the solutions that need to be spread. Always at least one step ahead when it came to identifying new issues and stories, he was fearless and funny, and driven by a profound passion to create a greener, fairer planet. He will leave a huge hole in journalism and in the wider movement\u201d. The environmentalist and former MP Zac Goldsmith tweeted: \u201cJohn was a pioneer and a hero. He did immeasurable good through his work shining a light on environmental destruction, highlighting good and bad \u2013 and always from a position of integrity. We are indebted to him.\u201d Geoffrey Lean, a veteran environmental journalist and a contemporary of Vidal\u2019s, said: \u201cJohn was one of the very best, pioneering coverage of the environment \u2013 initially in a quite hostile political and media atmosphere \u2013 from the late 1980s onwards. He was always on the cutting edge, exposing abuses all over the world, fearlessly and in depth. He did a huge amount to set the stage for today\u2019s proliferation of excellent environmental journalists.\u201d Vidal is survived by his wife and his niece."

            "content": "Your editorial (The Guardian view on class in Britain: the government doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, 14 September) purports to lay bare the problem with social mobility in the UK. But it simply reproduces an out-of-date narrative. It accuses the Social Mobility Commission of obscuring the centrality of class. Yet our latest report is not an effort to \u201credefine\u201d social mobility. In fact, occupational class is used in the main measure of socioeconomic background and as an outcome. But we also present evidence relating to other outcomes such as income, education, housing and wealth, because these also matter to people. Further, and for the first time, we have presented breakdowns by ethnicity, gender, disability and geography. What emerges is a complex picture of opportunity. This might frustrate those looking for simple solutions, but it gives a more detailed understanding of how people from different backgrounds experience social mobility. It lays the essential groundwork for future policy recommendations. Of course, data provides a picture based on averages. And within these averages are many examples of people bucking the trend, such as British people of Chinese and Indian background, who do extremely well on many outcomes even if their parents had low incomes or lower working-class jobs. We need to understand what helps them achieve this. It could shed light on how to improve social mobility for all. There will always be work to do in this field, and differences of opinion about what the priorities should be. But the more fundamental point is this: no meaningful progress can be made unless we start with the evidence. Alun Francis Chair, Social Mobility Commission \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "content": "The world\u2019s first master\u2019s degree in reparatory justice has been launched by Glasgow University, in partnership with the University of the West Indies (UWI), as the global campaign for financial reparations for transatlantic slavery gathers momentum. Glasgow is one of a number of universities to have researched the extent to which they were funded by or supported slavery. A year-long study established that although the university took an anti-slavery position during the 18th and 19th centuries, it benefited from the equivalent of tens of millions of pounds donated from the profits of slavery. The degree was established as part of a reparative justice programme at Glasgow, and the first cohort of students \u2013 nine in total, some of whom are based in the UK and some in the West Indies \u2013 began their studies this week. The UWI is a world-leader in academic research underpinning claims for reparations for slavery. The course will focus on the Caribbean but will also draw on case studies of campaigns for reparative justice elsewhere in the world. Dr Christine Whyte, a lecturer in global history and co-founder of the Beniba centre for slavery studies at Glasgow University, said: \u201cClaims for reparations for historical slavery have never been more prominent and never been closer to success. \u201cWhat our programme aims to do is uncover and explore the historical legacies that led to these claims, investigate the different legal, political and social means of making those claims, and give students the skills to go out into different workplaces and try to redress historical injustices.\u201d Cordelia Asmoah, who will be studying at Glasgow, said: \u201cFinding solutions to repair the negative impacts of slavery that continue to plague society is critical to the progress of humankind. I therefore feel both privileged and excited to be in the first cohort for this important and groundbreaking programme.\u201d Fellow student Graham Campbell, a Glasgow councillor, veteran political campaigner and community activist, was one of the three advisers to Glasgow\u2019s history of slavery report. \u201cI am looking forward to hearing about the international legal jurisprudence and discussion on the human rights dimension of the case for reparatory justice,\u201d he said. Jheanelle M Owens will be based at the UWI Mona campus in Jamaica, which still bears the marks of a place steeped in plantation history. \u201cThe case for reparations has become severe, and this programme is so timely. This master\u2019s programme gives me hope that we are moving in the right direction as a global community,\u201d she said. Vakeesha John, a fellow student enrolled at the UWI Cave Hill campus in Barbados, likened her personal journey as a Black Caribbean woman to the process for making coconut milk. The coconuts are grated, diluted then squeezed. \u201cThe juice separates itself into a filtered form, taking most of the nutrients of the coconut, and the residue remains, drained of its richness and, in most cases, is simply discarded. This reminds me of the journey of the Black, enslaved man and woman. \u201cOur riches, our culture, our strength were squeezed out of us; we\u2019ve been drained of our very essence, our social and spiritual nutrients. And the residue that most of our societies have to deal with contains poverty, a lack of awareness, illiteracy, a feeling of inferiority, inequalities. \u201cI have experienced this, and my goal is to empower myself with knowledge to better edify my people through activism, writing and teaching, and to fight for us to get back to our purest form.\u201d Last month the UN published a report calling on countries to consider financial reparations for transatlantic slavery. Campaigners hailed the report as a significant step forward."

            "date": "2023-10-12T16:54:30Z",
            "content": "Even at the distance of half a decade, the chaotic collapse of Carillion shocks. One of the country\u2019s biggest construction and contracting firms, embedded in schools and hospitals, failed with liabilities of \u00a37bn and just \u00a329m in cash. The company\u2019s pension schemes were underfunded. Almost 3,000 employees lost their jobs and the implosion ricocheted through supply chains. The government had to spend \u00a3150m to maintain basic services, such as the cleaning of hospitals. The detail that astonished everybody was that it took only six months from Carillion\u2019s first profit warning in July 2017 for the entire pack of cards to fall over. That should not be possible at a large quoted company. It was therefore no surprise to hear \u2013 finally \u2013 formal confirmation that KPMG disgraced itself in its role as Carillion\u2019s long-serving auditor. Thursday\u2019s verdict from the Financial Reporting Council revealed negligence on the part of KPMG over many years. Carillion \u201cwas not subject to rigorous, comprehensive, and reliable audits in the three years leading up to its demise\u201d, said the watchdog. The inadequate 2016 audit was compounded by \u201cbreaches of the ethical standards relating to the fundamental principles of objectivity, independence, and integrity\u201d. KMPG has been fined \u00a321m, which is a record. By rights, the sum should be multiples higher. Yet there is a second failure here. It is the government\u2019s reluctance or basic inability to do what it said it would do and legislate to enforce higher standards in auditing by creating a new regulator. Carillion\u2019s collapse was meant to be a kind of \u201cEnron moment\u201d for the UK \u2013 a realisation that deep problems in corporate reporting could no longer be ignored. Investors, employees, suppliers, governments had to be able to trust the numbers. Two select committees of MPs said Carillion had exposed the big four auditors as a \u201ccosy club incapable of providing the degree of independent challenge needed\u201d. At the end of 2018, the government\u2019s reviewer, Sir John Kingman, said the FRC had taken \u201can excessively consensual approach to its work\u201d and should be abolished, to be replaced by a new Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (Arga) with stiffer powers. The government agreed. A proposal to create Arga was announced in March 2019. It would be a statutory body that could interfere proactively and make direct changes to accounts. Audit reform was mentioned in the Conservatives\u2019 \u201cget Brexit done\u201d election manifesto. A draft bill was eventually published in 2021. The FRC, under new bosses, was told to prepare for the big switch. Yet the wait for legislation goes on and on. The bill didn\u2019t make it into Queen\u2019s speeches of 2021 or 2022 (Boris Johnson\u2019s advisers thought auditing was \u201cboring\u201d, reported the FT) and nobody thinks it\u2019ll make the cut in next month\u2019s king\u2019s speech. It is still not clear when Arga will arrive. To be fair to the FRC, a deferred death sentence has been good for it. The watchdog has shown more bite. It has forced through operational separation of the big four\u2019s audit and advisory arms on a voluntary basis. And it has been more aggressive in policing audit quality. Yet Arga and its statutory powers are plainly still needed. Other fundamental issues, such as the chronic lack of competition in audit, won\u2019t be addressed otherwise. Nor can the current regulator hold to account directors who are not members of accounting bodies. Now remember what happened in the US after it had its actual Enron moment in 2001 \u2013 the bankruptcy of a major energy company amid accounting scandal. Within a year, the US passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which created criminal penalties for corporate misreporting and gave regulators new powers. Or look at the fate of the respective auditors. Enron\u2019s auditors, Arthur Andersen, didn\u2019t survive. In the UK, the Insolvency Service pursued KPMG for \u00a31.3bn over Carillion but reached a settlement this year on terms that were \u201cconfidential\u201d. We wait to discover if the sum was large enough to hit the wallets of today\u2019s KMPG partners in the UK (average remuneration: \u00a3757,000 last year). In terms of pure numbers, Carillion was smaller than Enron. Yet, on a comparative basis, the shambles caused by collapse was arguably just as great, and the need for sweeping market-wide improvements in audit just as pressing. Since Carillion failed in January 2018, we\u2019ve had four prime ministers and seven secretaries of state for business, which partly explains the drift. It does not excuse it. Audit is indeed boring in the sense that it is dry and technical. But Carillion\u2019s pensioners, employees and shareholders know that it matters. Rotten standards inevitably lead to dire outcomes somewhere. The government\u2019s inertia on reform is itself a scandal."

            "date": "2023-10-20T08:43:12Z",
            "content": "Swimming Australia has averted a governance crisis after its member associations voted to accept constitutional reform at a special general meeting on Friday. Swimming Australia\u2019s voting members polled 8-1 in favour of adopting a new constitution, which meets the governance requirements of World Aquatics (AQUA) and the Australian Sports Commission (ASC), and had the support of the Swimming Australia board. Crucially, the resounding vote means Swimming Australia has avoided the threat of expulsion from the sport\u2019s global governing body. The new constitution, which aims to be more representative and inclusive while giving athletes and coaches more of a voice, will come into effect after next Wednesday\u2019s annual general meeting. \u201cSwimming Australia\u2019s new constitution introduces a range of reforms aimed at delivering a more stable overall environment for the sport and better outcomes from the grassroots and community level through to high-performance,\u201d a Swimming Australia statement read. It will also create an athletes\u2019 commission which will nominate candidates to the Swimming Australia board as athlete director. The number of members entitled to vote will be increased while a formal role of vice-president will be introduced. The proportion of votes that a director needs to be appointed president will also be increased. SA\u2019s board had urged its nine members \u2013 comprising the seven state organisations, the Australian Swimmers Association, and the coaches and teachers\u2019 association \u2013 to adopt the amendments amid threats of expulsion from World Aquatics (AQUA) if the proposals were not adopted. As a member federation of AQUA, Swimming Australia\u2019s corporate governance must comply with the constitution and rules of World Aquatics. Had the proposal failed to pass on Friday, AQUA could have suspended or expelled Swimming Australia. AQUA could even have established a stabilisation committee, which would effectively have seen it take control of the federation and run the sport in Australia. The development is the latest in a long saga of governance and leadership challenges the sport has faced in recent years. Amid a high turnover of board members, Swimming Australia has cycled through four different chief executives since 2017. Eugenie Buckley stepped down after just 18 months earlier this year, and Steve Newman is now in the position in an interim role. The besieged organisation has also been forced to address a toxic culture within the sport after a bombshell independent review. It also lost a major source of funding in September 2021 when Gina Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting Swimmers Support Scheme, which had made a significant financial contribution to the sport over many years, was ended. Rinehart was reportedly unhappy over a number of late payments made to athletes, and subsequently requested access to accounting records, which she was denied. A request for a seat on the Swimming Australia board for her company Hancock Prospecting was also rejected amid concerns over her influence as a sponsor. Swimming Australia was quoted by the Daily Telegraph as saying \u201cduring the re-negotiation process it was clear a number of Hancock Prospecting\u2019s terms, including the mandating of board and executive positions, were not capable of acceptance\u201d. Rinehart was reported as saying that she did not \u201cthink it is an unusual or unfair expectation for any sponsor of sports to be sure its funds are going to the athletes and if applicable for agreed purposes\u201d and that a \u201cvoiceless observer\u201d was \u201chardly an interference with the board\u201d. Since the 2021 split, Rinehart has continued to fund close to 100 swimmers by channelling money through Swimming Queensland, one of Swimming Australia\u2019s member associations. Swimming Australia will receive more than $14m in federal government funding in 2023-24, the vast majority for high performance. Australia\u2019s swimmers enjoyed a record medal haul at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and topped the medal table at this year\u2019s world championships in July. Hopes are high for another big haul at next year\u2019s Olympics, and Australian athletes have been assured the disruption at governance level will not affect them at global events. Josephine Sukkar, the Australian Sports Commission chair, said the ASC would continue to work with swimmers and coaches ahead of the Games in Paris and ensure preparations were not affected. \u201cChange of this nature is never easy and was done with the future generation of Australian swimmers in mind,\u201d Sukkar said. \u201cThe changes to Swimming Australia\u2019s constitution provides athletes with an unprecedented voice at the board table to ensure current and future swimmers can enjoy swimming in a safe and supported environment.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-10-01T18:27:18Z",
            "content": "In most of Britain\u2019s towns there are buildings hinting at a more prosperous past. Vast stone public libraries, swimming baths and theatres; all encircling the grand town halls that once controlled them. Many are long shut, converted or owned by someone else. But the symbolism remains \u2013 local government used to do stuff. Today, England\u2019s councils are in the worst crisis since the foundation stones of these municipal palaces were laid. Birmingham, the largest local authority in Europe, is the tip of the iceberg in its effective bankruptcy. Croydon, Northamptonshire, Slough, Thurrock and Woking have all gone bust. Dozens more are perilously close \u2013 from \u201cred wall\u201d Stoke-on-Trent to the blue-blooded Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. As the Conservatives hold their annual conference in Manchester this week, the collapse of the English system of local government ought to worry Tory MPs far more than HS2, taxes or the rights of motorists to drive faster than 20mph. In the backyards of current and former cabinet ministers, in important target seats, and across the country at large, a wave of local austerity is coming. \u201cI often quote it, and misquote it \u2013 but the phrase here is Denis Healey\u2019s \u2018the sky is darkening with the wings of chickens coming home to roost\u2019,\u201d says Tony Travers, a professor of local government at the London School of Economics. \u201cHad the government wanted to go out of its way, back in 2010, to ensure nearly 15 years later that people were absolutely aware of how austerity was being delivered, they couldn\u2019t have gone about it in a better way than this.\u201d England\u2019s councils are facing a collective multibillion-pound black hole in their finances, up to \u00a33.5bn on one estimate, as the impact from an almost 60% cut in central government funding since 2010 collides with stubbornly high inflation and pressure on services from an ageing population. The result will be yet deeper cuts to public services, council tax rises and ever higher fees for parking and other council charges. Already since 2010 there have been \u00a315bn worth of public assets flogged to help plug holes in council budgets. But, where there is anything left to cut, close, privatise or pass into charity hands, get ready for that too. Just ask people in Woking and Kirklees, where plans announced in recent weeks include the closure of swimming pools, care homes, sports facilities, public toilets and community schemes. For Birmingham the tragedy is most pronounced, as the cradle of modern local government \u2013 where Joseph Chamberlain put into action the \u201cCivic Gospel\u201d of improvement that helped define the Victorian age. As the city\u2019s Liberal mayor, he pioneered the building of municipal swimming pools and schools, and used corporation funds to buy the town\u2019s gas and waterworks. After Birmingham\u2019s financial implosion, Rishi Sunak sought to pin blame on the council\u2019s Labour leadership. The local party isn\u2019t without fault, to say the least. But context also matters: for every Labour-run authority in dire straits, there is at least another Tory or Liberal Democrat one in a similar predicament. Michael Gove, who as levelling up secretary is in charge of local government, should know better than most. Surrey Heath borough council, in his constituency, is close to effective bankruptcy, while six of its near-neighbours were on a Moody\u2019s watchlist published earlier this month. The mess in this leafy London commuter belt should have more Tories worried. The party dominates here in parliamentary elections, but several councils have fallen from its control after racking up vast debts \u2013 including Spelthorne, in former chancellor\u2019s Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s seat, and Windsor and Maidenhead, in Theresa May\u2019s. The wider economic context matters, too. To offset austerity-era cuts, many councils took on their debts while borrowing was cheap in the period of low interest rates after the 2008 financial crisis. The money went into schemes to generate financial returns to plug gaping budget shortfalls, or into town centre regeneration. Projects meeting both criteria were prized most. However, they were often on to a losing bet. Town centres have been drained of life in recent years by the rise of online shopping, as well as benefit cuts and sluggish wage growth sapping consumer spending power. The Covid pandemic then turbocharged these trends, leaving any council that had been acting as a buyer of last resort in a deeper mess. Even for authorities that steered clear of the property market, the cost of providing services has ballooned as Britain grapples with the highest inflation in the G7, while the cost of living crisis leads more households to need their help. Deep divisions in economic prosperity between Britain\u2019s richest and poorest areas also make it a tougher crisis to fix. Urgent solutions are clearly required. Aiming to plot a way forward, a forthcoming report from the Fabian Society thinktank recommends greater devolution of tax and spending powers to local communities. It\u2019s a tough sell when so many councils are going bust. But it is not without merit. England is one of the most centralised nations of its size in the developed world, with central government involved in almost every aspect of how councils operate. As much as 95p in every \u00a31 of tax raised goes to the Treasury, which then decides on how best to reallocate money to local areas \u2013 often grudgingly. Greater devolution could help sidestep the postcode lotteries and council bidding wars witnessed with Boris Johnson\u2019s centralised pots of levelling up money, which were often spent on pork barrel schemes in Tory target seats anyway. However, any increase in local power will require serious efforts to bolster local governance structures to prevent future town hall financial scandals. The case for reform is overwhelming. Voters will not thank any party, locally or in national government, for the steady demise of the most visible aspects of the public realm: town centres, public buildings, parks, streets and services. It\u2019s about time local government did stuff once again."

            "title": "Can republicans rally after Australia\u2019s resounding no to constitutional reform on the voice? | Paul Karp",
            "date": "2023-10-22T14:00:19Z",
            "content": "Anthony Albanese once declared that \u201cAustralians don\u2019t rush to tinker with the constitution but nor do they avoid it altogether\u201d. He made that claim in November 2019 in a speech to the Australian Republican Movement (Arm), in a section expressing optimism that an Indigenous voice and an Australian head of state were both ideas whose time had come. It feels like a lifetime ago. The then-opposition leader joked that Prince Andrew\u2019s train wreck interview about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein all but guaranteed \u201cwe\u2019ll become a republic next year\u201d. The republic, which was behind the voice in the government\u2019s order of priority, has only got further and further away. Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 whose reign was considered the biggest obstacle to a republic because of Australians\u2019 special affection for her \u2013 has died. But few outside the Greens used that moment to call for an Australian head of state. Albanese swore his allegiance to King Charles III, declared a republic was not \u201cimminent\u201d, and that he didn\u2019t want to be a prime minister who \u201cpresides over just constitutional debates\u201d. If that was his disposition when the Indigenous voice was riding high in the polls, then enthusiasm for another crack at constitutional reform now must be near-zero. The yes vote for the voice failed to reach 40%, making the 45% achieved in the 1999 republican referendum look respectable. The assistant minister for the republic, Matt Thistlethwaite, has told Guardian Australia the voice result makes a republic \u201ca lot harder\u201d although Labor \u201cremains committed\u201d to the idea. To see why it\u2019s much harder, consider the record. Support for the voice started sky-high, with as many as 65% of Australians in favour in August 2022. Roughly one in four Australians who wanted to vote for it had lost their nerve by referendum day on 14 October. When Guardian Essential polled the issue in May 2023, some 54% of voters said they would vote for Australia to become a republic compared with 46% for keeping the monarchy. A bare majority is a poor start before the scare campaigns start. The poll question did not specify a direct election or appointment model for the head of state \u2013 and that\u2019s what split supporters in the 1999 referendum. Arm\u2019s national director, Isaac Jeffrey, says the voice constitutional alteration was \u201cshort and simple\u201d but the republic would require more \u201cextensive changes\u201d, everything from term lengths and limits to the method of selection for the head of state. We don\u2019t even know what an Australian head of state would be called \u2013 but after Donald Trump and January 6 the term \u201cpresident\u201d is likely to be out of the question. As Albanese has noted since the voice defeat, no referendums have been successful without bipartisan support. Thisthlethwaite agrees this will be critical for the republic. But the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, who helped tank the voice, was prepared to start a political brawl with Labor over replacing the queen on the $5 note. You\u2019d have to be looking elsewhere for bipartisanship. The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, does have a republican streak. Arm and Thisthlethwaite are confident that plenty of Liberals and Nationals support a republic but it would need to secure a commitment to a free vote at least, which shadow ministers were denied on the voice. The biggest problem is the care factor. In a News Corp poll before the 14 October referendum, voice was ranked just 17th in the order of priority for Australians. One shudders to think where a republic would rank, presumably somewhere behind internet/5G, refugees and religion, the 18th, 19th and 20th issues. Thisthlethwaite describes the republic as part of Labor\u2019s \u201clonger-term vision\u201d. Its immediate priority is \u201cproviding relief to Australians dealing with cost of living pressures\u201d. The republic is likely to be off the agenda until after Indigenous leaders decide how to advance reconciliation and closing the gap if not through a voice. We\u2019ll also need to be past the cost-of-living crisis and require a change of opposition leader. Jeffrey doesn\u2019t agree there is any need to change the timeline. He wants a vote in the next term of government but concedes if it \u201ctakes a little longer\u201d to win community support \u201cthat\u2019s what matters\u201d. Thisthlethwaite is blunter: the voice result \u201cwill delay [the republic] by a reasonable amount\u201d. As he visited the UK to attend the coronation in May, Albanese told Piers Morgan that the push must be \u201ca feeling from the bottom up\u201d. \u201cA demand for another vote isn\u2019t something that can be imposed from the top because it won\u2019t be successful,\u201d he said. So how will the republican movement get off the mat and back on the agenda? Jeffrey says Arm will conduct community consultations next year to get maximum buy-in for a specific model of republic. Thistlethwaite canvasses a range of ways to get Australians engaged \u2013 including a constitutional convention or a citizens\u2019 assembly. Even former Labor leader Bill Shorten\u2019s old proposal for a plebiscite to test public support and pick a model is on the table. Perhaps it will take an external shock to get things moving. Speaking to Arm, Albanese noted: \u201cThe united nature of the kingdom is strained by Brexit-fuelled disquiet in Northern Ireland and fresh stirrings of independence in Scotland.\u201d A majority in Britain still approve of the monarchy but support is at an all-time low. It would be a testament to how conservative Australia is and how high a bar our constitution sets for change if the UK falls apart or turns against its monarch before we do. After 14 October you couldn\u2019t rule it out."

            "content": "Starbucks recently announced that it has developed six new varieties of coffee seeds that can withstand the effects of climate change, which some experts say is \u201ccritical\u201d for the future of coffee. People in the US drink about 517m cups of coffee a day collectively, with the average American consuming three cups on a daily basis. But coffee, like many other crops, is under threat due to the climate crisis \u2013 subject to diseases, droughts and extreme weather conditions. Most of the coffee consumed worldwide comes from two species \u2013 arabica and robusta. Accounting for 70% of global coffee production, the arabica bean is more popular and for a good reason. Its smoother flavor, lower acidity and fruity hints rank paramount to robusta\u2019s grainy, more bitter flavor. Native to Ethiopia and predominantly grown in Central and South America, arabica is the only bean that Starbucks uses in its nearly 37,000 locations worldwide. But its sensitivity to rising temperatures makes it especially vulnerable to premature ripening and crop loss. \u201cMore researchers doing work that will provide climate resilient varieties is critical,\u201d said Sarada Krishnan, a coffee grower and scientist at the Crop Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to conserving crop diversity. Robusta, a thicker bean, is generally more favorable to heat, and therefore easier to grow. Arabica on the other hand, with its low genetic diversity, is more susceptible to diseases like coffee leaf rust \u2013 a fungus that can overtake the plant when the conditions are warmer and wetter. \u201cWhen smallholder farmers get that, they lose and their whole income for the year is gone,\u201d Krishnan, who owns an arabica coffee farm in Jamaica and knows the challenges of dealing with the disease first-hand, said. \u201cLast year toward the end of the harvest, the rust came, and if you let the rust take over then you lose the plant and it will take five years to get a fruit crop.\u201d Starbucks-developed arabica seeds are cultivated to resist the leaf rust and tests have been shown to generate a higher yield in a shorter period of time. According to the company, the Starbucks agronomy team plants several different varieties and hybrids of seeds, monitoring the trees\u2019 resistance to diseases and nutrient absorption through at least six generations or about 12 years. \u201cStarbucks is committed to ensuring the future of coffee,\u201d said a representative of the company in an email. \u201cWe have a responsibility to care for the entire supply chain and the many people who make coffee possible, from bean to cup, farmer to customer.\u201d The company is giving away its six climate-resilient coffee tree varieties to farmers who are free to sell the resulting crop to buyers other than Starbucks. The coffee giant buys from about 400,000 farmers across 30 countries, and over the last five years, it has given away three million climate-resistant seeds annually, developed by others to farms in Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, Mexico, China, Indonesia, Guatemala and Nicaragua. This article was amended on 4 October 2023 to correct the number of Starbucks locations worldwide and the number of seeds given away each year."

            "date": "2023-10-17T15:32:08Z",
            "content": "The UK is making a series of changes to its climate finance definitions as a way to meet its target to spend \u00a311.6bn over five years in the developing world to help combat the climate crisis, Andrew Mitchell, the development minister, has said. Rich countries have long promised to provide finance \u2013 in the form of loans or cash \u2013 to help poor countries cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis. However, leaks in the summer showed UK ministers were warned they were massively off track to meet their targets and could only do so by raiding the aid budget. Boris Johnson\u2019s government, with Rishi Sunak as chancellor, committed in 2019 to ramping up its international climate finance (ICF) in order to reach a target of \u00a311.6bn between the financial years 2021-22 and 2025-26. Mitchell, in a Guardian interview, said recent changes involved three new assumptions that would help the UK meet that target. First, in the allocation of humanitarian spending in the 10% of the poorest countries, the UK will in future assume 30% was spent on internal climate finance, without making a precise calculation. Describing the move as good housekeeping, Mitchell said this was in line with practice in other major countries delivering aid. Second, the UK will no longer assume only 30% of spending by the UK aid investment arm, British International Investment (BII), goes on climate finance, which could be much higher. Third, for the first time the UK will also include UK aid spending on climate sent to multilateral development banks as part of the \u00a311.6bn spend. Mitchell defended himself from the charge of a \u201csleight of hand\u201d by describing the changes as \u201cclarifications and not definitional changes. We will now more accurately reflect what we spend on climate.\u201d He pointed out that other countries, unlike the UK, included climate-related loans to developing countries as part of their climate finance budget. The UK was also not including dividends from the BII\u2019s investment in climate-related projects. If included \u2013 something the government did not intend to do \u2013 this would have been worth \u00a3750m over two years, he said. Similarly, none of the $5.8bn (\u00a34.77bn) of guarantees provided to the Africa Development Bank, World Bank and Asia Development Bank that he said would release $3.2bn (\u00a32.63bn) of climate finance in the time period in question, would be allocated to meeting the target. Mitchell said if all this spending was defined as climate-related by the UK, the total UK international climate finance budget would be closer to \u00a316bn. The new changes will have to be reported to the DAC, the international development watchdog in Paris, but officials expect there to be no pushback since none of the changes breach DAC definitions. The redefined \u00a311.6bn will be included as part of the pledge by developed countries to direct at least $100bn a year of climate finance to the developing world from 2020, a commitment first made at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, which has still not been met. Officials claim the UK is coming into line with other countries\u2019 more liberal definitions of what constitutes climate finance. Responding to the government statement, Sophie Powell, Christian Aid\u2019s chief of advocacy and policy, said it looked \u201clike an exercise in double counting\u201d. She said: \u201cAs Cop28 nears, where the UK used to lead on climate, it is now lowering the bar at every turn, which is a disaster for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\u201d Mitchell promised that the white paper would show how the UK would contribute to the world getting back on track to meeting the UN sustainable development goals. He claimed there was more flexibility in the aid budget due to a tightening in the amount of official development assistance being spent on housing first-year asylum seekers in the UK. A leak to the Guardian in July suggested officials had in effect been advising ministers to drop the \u00a311.6bn target. Government officials had calculated the leak showed that it would have to spend 83% of the Foreign Office\u2019s official development assistance budget on the international climate fund. Civil servants said in the leaked document that this \u201cwould squeeze out room for other commitments such as humanitarian and women and girls\u201d."

            "date": "2023-10-20T10:00:15Z",
            "content": "The night before publication, Henning Steinfeld was halfway across the world dealing with panicked politicians and an outbreak of avian flu. His report, and how it would be received, was frankly the last thing on his mind. With a small group of officials, Steinfield, head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\u2019s livestock policy branch, had been working for months on a report analysing the link between the six major species of livestock and climate change, which they all knew could be explosive. \u201cI was very frustrated by the fact that the livestock-environment issue hadn\u2019t resonated even though people accepted in private that it was a big issue \u2013 for climate change, and also water and biodiversity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one was interested in getting into it because I think they were afraid of what it could mean.\u201d Another FAO official, \u201cMichel Criollo\u201d (not his real name), remembered: \u201cNo one wanted to go to the next step of saying agriculture is a problem for the planet and we need to mitigate it \u2013 including by potentially reducing production levels or changing things in less profitable ways.\u201d It was 2006. The issue of climate change was climbing the international agenda, although the bitter rows and collapsing dialogue of the Copenhagen summit were still three years in the future. But although the link between climate change and fossil fuels was accepted and widely discussed, somehow the farming sector had managed to dodge the spotlight. Scientists were aware that the methane produced by grazing cattle \u2013 around two-thirds of livestock emissions come from cows \u2013 was a significant chunk of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases that were heating the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Still, there had been no attempt to quantify how large a chunk it might be; the scientific community was largely focused elsewhere, while politicians were finding it hard enough to cope with the political realities of reducing fossil fuel consumption. The FAO was not the obvious candidate to jump into the breach. Founded in 1945 with the remit of ending hunger and improving nutrition by increasing agricultural \u2013 and livestock \u2013 production, it was a country-based organisation, which felt that part of its mission was to represent the industry rather than scrutinise it. The small group of researchers who worked with Steinfeld had been discussing this issue for several years and felt the time was right to dig into it. But they knew that they would face resistance from the organisation and from beyond. \u201cEveryone knows that meat and other livestock products are closely connected to culture and ways of living,\u201d Steinfeld said, \u201cto traditions, beliefs, religion and identity issues that define people, and here we have something that challenges that.\u201d But none of them were quite prepared for the storm that broke over their heads when Livestock\u2019s Long Shadow (LLS) finally came out, cracking through the taboos. Now, for the first time, some of them have spoken to the Guardian about a period and a working culture in which, they say, they were censored, sabotaged, undermined and victimised. It is so unusual for officials working in a UN agency to allow a peek behind the scenes that almost all of them would only speak on condition of anonymity, still, to some extent, marked by the battles they fought while working at the FAO. Livestock\u2019s Long Shadow was the first elementary lifecycle analysis for livestock and, crucially, the first tally of the meat and dairy sector\u2019s ecological cost. The report estimated that livestock were responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 including nine percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, mostly due to deforestation for (pasture and) feed crops, 37% of anthropogenic methane emissions, largely from cow burps, 65% of anthropogenic nitrous oxides, overwhelmingly from manure and 64% of anthropogenic ammonia emissions. It was a bombshell. Environmental scientists and campaign groups were rapturous, and a wave of popular documentaries such as Meat the Truth and Cowspiracy followed. But the report had sent shockwaves through the meat industry and the tremors travelled quickly. Steinfeld remembered hearing complaints that \u201cthe FAO has fallen into the hands of vegan activists\u201d and personal threats such as \u201cthe anti-livestock people are a pest that needs to be eradicated\u201d. Pressure came from all sides. The big meat-producing countries \u2013 Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Australia and the US \u2013 all complained to the FAO\u2019s higher echelons, according to Steinfeld, while protests also flooded in from \u201cthe private sector, the large-scale meat, feed and dairy producers\u201d. Another FAO official \u201cAngus Green\u201d remembered the shock that the FAO would produce a report on this topic. \u201cPeople were complaining: \u2018Why do we need such a report? Livestock is so important. It\u2019s the best way to alleviate poverty for farmers in poor countries.\u2019 You can\u2019t imagine how controversial the subject of climate change in agriculture was at that time.\u201d Hans R Herren, a World Food Prize winner and co-chair of the UN/World Bank Global Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology (IAASTD), told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is corridor pressure by the main agri-producers in the FAO. It\u2019s indirect because it comes from outside, but everybody knows how powerful some of those countries are. People think they have to pass on the message to whoever \u2018priced\u2019 those reports. There is a chain of pressure because the FAO, like most agencies, depends on external funds, so that\u2019s one way of exerting pressure.\u201d The pressure was soon to become more intense. LLS had included a line saying that livestock emissions were \u201can even larger contribution [to global heating] than the transportation sector worldwide\u201d. One of the paper\u2019s authors described the factoid as a \u201cslight methodological error\u201d that had only been inserted because of a request from the FAO press office, which \u201cwanted to add some hype to the report. They suggested this might be included as a statement and we didn\u2019t think about it enough.\u201d The line was eventually cut from the paper but the error was seized on by the report\u2019s critics. International press such as the BBC and Daily Telegraph jumped on the story with CNN, running it under the headline \u201cScientist: Don\u2019t blame cows for climate change!\u201d The leadership at the FAO were taken by surprise by the backlash, according to sources, and the impact would be felt for the next decade, just at the moment that it became ever more important to look honestly at agriculture\u2019s planet-heating role. In a sign of the atmosphere in the FAO at this time, a fourth veteran insider, \u201cMary Wagyu\u201d, claims to have been admonished after preparing Meatless Monday leaflets for distribution in the cafeteria of an FAO heads of state food security summit in 2008. \u201cRemove and destroy them,\u201d a senior FAO executive said, according to Wagyu. \u201cThese will not be put in people\u2019s trays.\u201d In 2009 a second FAO report called Livestock in the Balance was delayed for several months while the FAO\u2019s leadership tried to dilute references to harm caused by the meat industry, arguing that this had already been covered by Livestock\u2019s Long Shadow. When the research team resisted the pressure, management stepped in and manually rewrote key passages over their heads, sparking what Steinfeld called \u201ca mini-revolution\u201d. About a dozen staff members involved in preparing the report withdrew their names from the paper in protest. \u201cWe took a collective stand to defend \u2013 in our view \u2013 the professional integrity of this report,\u201d Steinfeld said. \u201cThis was the first time there was visible opposition [on the livestock question].\u201d Steinfeld recalled being told by a senior official in the director general\u2019s office: \u201cEven if livestock contributes 18% to climate change, the FAO shall not say that. It\u2019s not in the interest of the FAO to highlight environmental impacts.\u201d The report was seen as \u201cvery problematic and the DG\u2019s office wanted to dampen its messages,\u201d according to \u201cDavid Holstein\u201d, another former official. \u201cThe issue was [the report] presenting statements that livestock was not hunky dory. The response was, therefore, censorship.\u201d In the end, the second report was published with its references to environmental impacts intact. That same year an IAASTD study called Agriculture at the crossroads by Herren was co-sponsored with the FAO. The paper outlined the environmental problems caused by livestock, singling it out as a \u201cmajor contributor\u201d to global heating and \u201cprobably the largest sectoral source of water pollution\u201d. \u201cThe report was basically buried at the FAO,\u201d Herren said. He described \u201chuge pressure\u201d not to publicise the paper from funding countries such as the US and Australia \u2013 which entered \u201creservations\u201d about the report as an annex. \u201cWhen I was invited to give a talk to the FAO plenary, the organiser told me: \u2018You\u2019re welcome to talk but you cannot mention the IAASTD report.\u2019 He didn\u2019t say why but I believe it was because the report recommended a food system transformation that was not in line with what some of the major FAO-supporting countries had in mind.\u201d And meanwhile the impact on the lives and careers of the rebellious researchers had been profound, according to Steinfeld. \u201cWe were considered a difficult group and difficult individuals, and this is how others described us. We were not [with] the party line.\u201d Not all ex-FAO officials the Guardian spoke to agreed that the careers of colleagues who spoke out on livestock issues suffered as a result. But another FAO researcher at the time, \u201cJean Charolais\u201d, remembers the atmosphere. \u201cThere was substantial pressure internally and there were consequences for permanent staff who worked on this, in terms of their careers. It wasn\u2019t really a healthy environment to work in,\u201d he said. Several former staff members compared the power of the agribusiness lobby over FAO policy to that of the oil and gas giants on energy policy. As Green put it: \u201cIt is all about money, similar to the fossil fuel industry.\u201d Between 2012 and 2019, \u201cthe lobbyists obviously managed to influence things\u201d, Holstein said. \u201cThey had a strong impact on the way things were done at the FAO and there was a lot of censorship. It was always an uphill struggle getting the documents you produced past the office for corporate communications and one had to fend off a good deal of editorial vandalism. You had to accept relatively small steps forward in changing the narrative on livestock.\u201d Steinfeld added that meat lobby representatives and diplomats would talk to senior FAO managers and encourage them not to invest in work that dealt with environmental impacts. The group set up an umbrella organisation \u2013 the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock (GASL) \u2013 to bring together NGOs, scientists, industry and governments and focus on the issue. But GASL was undermined by the FAO leadership, which suffered from \u201ca lot of incompetence and ignorance\u201d and at senior levels \u201cactually did not understand different greenhouse gases and sources of emissions\u201d, according to Steinfeld. The FAO leadership did all they could to \u201cobstruct and torpedo our effort\u201d, he continued. When one minister from a Latin-American country flew to Rome in 2017 to meet the group \u2013 after offering to host a GASL meeting \u2013 Steinfeld claimed that he was picked up at the airport by a senior FAO official and, by the time he reached the organisation\u2019s headquarters, had changed his mind, and no longer wanted the meeting. Meanwhile, livestock industry supporters had set up a rival organisation \u2013 the Livestock Global Alliance (LGA), whose declared first priority was \u201cto advocate for the global public good dimension of livestock\u201d. It also reportedly sought to \u201cimprove the image of the livestock sector, particularly in response to the FAO report on Livestock\u2019s Long Shadow\u201d. LGA meetings were attended by at least one FAO executive and, according to Wagyu, the group\u2019s objective was to obtain financing for industry-friendly research that could be fed back into the FAO policy-making process to influence the developing scientific consensus. \u201cPrivate companies wanted to finance the science to achieve more outcomes that were biased in the direction they wanted, and this happened,\u201d said Wagyu. \u201cAll of a sudden the trickle of scientific studies going in the livestock industry\u2019s direction exploded.\u201d Criollo described some of the LGA proposals as \u201cspin-off mechanisms from industry that tried to push for certain positions\u201d, but he said that these had not affected FAO models or data outputs. Steinfeld, who attended some LGA meetings, said simply: \u201cThey discussed world domination. They discussed how everything could be brought into their fold and establish the World Bank and World Organisation for Animal Health as the true world guardians of livestock and everything else should disappear.\u201d As well as advocacy, the counter-group\u2019s modus operandi was messaging to change the narrative on livestock. \u201cIt was a lot about counteracting the so-called damage done by the Long Shadow, and the idea, of course, to write proposals that would be attractive to donors was also there,\u201d he added. The LGA has since folded. How can methane emissions be falling if people are eating more meat? One of the greatest concerns for environmental scientists has been the progressively falling FAO estimate of livestock\u2019s overall contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The 18% number in 2006 was revised downwards to 14.5% in a follow-up paper, Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock, in 2013. It is now being revised downwards again to about 11.2% based on a new \u201cGleam 3.0\u201d model. The issue is acutely important as the FAO will present a blueprint for pegging global temperature rises to 1.5C at the next Cop in November. The latest analysis assumes a 13% reduction in its estimate of livestock emissions \u2013 from 8.1bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2017 (using data from 2010) to 6.19bn tonnes in 2022 (using data from 2015). This seems counter-intuitive, given that during the same period, the FAO recorded a 39% increase in global meat production. Most of the 20 plus former and serving FAO officials and consultants spoken to in the research of this story denied that pressure from agribusiness or states had affected their estimates of livestock emissions. But nevertheless, they continued to cite 18% or 14.5% as their preferred figure. Many scientists plot farm emissions on a very different trajectory, with one recent study concluding that greenhouse gas emissions from animal products made up 20% of the global total. One recent paper by Matthew Hayek, the assistant professor in environmental sciences at New York University, said that the FAO\u2019s use of emissions modeling \u2013 without using verifiable atmospheric data \u2013 could underestimate methane emissions from livestock by up to 47% in countries such as the US. \u201cModels are only estimates that need to be constantly validated \u2013 and there\u2019s been an alarming lack of validation over the now decades that this [FAO] research has been produced,\u201d he said. Anne Mottet, the FAO\u2019s livestock development officer, stressed that the changing figures reflected best practices and evolving methodologies, rather than an assumed cut in livestock numbers. \u201cLivestock is part of the FAO\u2019s strategy on climate change and we work with governments and farmers and industry on this programme as well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the main actors of the sector but there has been no particular pressure from them.\u201d As the only body overseeing global agriculture, the FAO is walking a thin line on livestock emissions, with gale force headwinds from both sides ready to batter any politician that joins in. Although there is growing awareness of the impact that high meat and dairy consumption has on certain countries\u2019 carbon footprints, politicians are, in the main, profoundly reluctant to tackle the issue, particularly in this era of culture wars. Reducing meat and dairy consumption \u2013 even by a small amount \u2013 is scientifically proven as an effective way to reduce emissions, but almost no government will include that as part of their environmental messaging. The Netherlands, one of the few countries to have bravely announced a livestock reduction plan (although officially to reduce nitrogen \u2013 rather than methane \u2013 emissions) has seen a huge political challenge from the rightwing Farmer\u2019s Party as a result. The UN has struggled to incorporate the farming sector in its climate summits as well. Cop27 in Egypt saw the first ever food pavilion, and the first ever mention of food in the final statement, but, as George Monbiot, an outspoken critic on this issue, has pointed out, there has never been reference to \u201clivestock reduction\u201d in any of its texts. Monbiot noted: \u201cIn the 20 years to 2018, global meat consumption rose by 58% \u2026 An analysis by Our World in Data shows that even if greenhouse gas pollution from every other sector were eliminated today, by 2100 food production will, on its current trajectory, bust the global carbon budget two or three times over. This is largely because of animal farming, which accounts for 57% of greenhouse gases from the food system, though it provides just 18% of the calories.\u201d The FAO did not respond to more than a dozen questions sent to it by the Guardian. But Hayek said that the Guardian\u2019s investigation shed new light on a change in the FAO\u2019s framing of livestock emissions after 2006 \u2013 into an \u201copportunity\u201d for industry rather than a problem for the planet. He said: \u201cThe insertion of officials and donors into rigorous data-oriented research has a potentially biasing effect. My overriding concern is that people with contrary views might not be at this organisation any more, thanks to conflicts instigated by lobbies, countries and contributing parties.\u201d Jennifer Jacquet, professor of environmental science at the University of Miami, added: \u201cIt\u2019s a story as old as time, that the meat and dairy industry has enormous influence over the policy-making apparatus. It\u2019s no coincidence that industry\u2019s involvement has led to lower overall relative estimates of emissions for livestock. Industry was taken aback by Livestock\u2019s Long Shadow. It caught them on the backfoot and they had to regroup, double down and figure out how to get control of the narrative \u2013 and over the science to some degree.\u201d In her own research into how agribusiness reacted to Livestock\u2019s Long Shadow, Jacquet found \u201cclear evidence that the industry saw it as a threat and something that they needed to control. They call it \u2018a major PR problem\u2019. It set off an industry lobbying coalition somewhat comparable to the oil and gas industry\u2019s efforts against the Kyoto Protocol, with an enormous amount of coordination aimed at infiltrating and controlling climate science and, moreover, our understanding of the problem.\u201d It is often said that policymaking is like sausage production in that, however delicious the results, you wouldn\u2019t want to see how they are made. But as the sacred cow of agribusiness prepares to belch again in the FAO\u2019s forthcoming emissions report, its assemblage this time around looks set to provide the scientific community with more food for thought than usual."

            "content": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s reversals on key climate policies have damaged the UK\u2019s ability to meet its carbon-cutting goals and will keep energy bills high for millions of households, with the effect of \u201cmaking net zero considerably harder to achieve\u201d, the UK\u2019s climate watchdog has warned. Rowing back on policies to phase out gas boilers and petrol and diesel vehicles, and the general sense that the government is \u201cweakening its commitments\u201d to shifting to a green economy, have also harmed the prospects of inward investment into the UK, and sent adverse signals to consumers, businesses and other governments. Scrapping plans to force landlords to improve the energy efficiency of rented accommodation will also cost renters about \u00a3325 a year in higher bills, the report found. In a damning verdict on the prime minister\u2019s announcements last month, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) warned of a \u201csubstantial policy gap\u201d that was putting the UK off track to meet its crucial 2030 carbon targets. Piers Forster, the acting chair of the CCC, said: \u201cThe prime minister has relaxed important policies to decarbonise buildings and transport and sent a message to business and the international audience that he will allow more time for the UK to transition to key clean technologies.\u201d He added: \u201cWe remain concerned about the likelihood of achieving the UK\u2019s future targets, especially the substantial policy gap to the UK\u2019s 2030 goals.\u201d The CCC found there were \u201cinsufficient\u201d plans to meet about a fifth of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to hit the government\u2019s international goal of cutting carbon by 68% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Renewable energy is another source of concern, as no contracts were awarded at the last auction for offshore wind developments last month, as wind companies turned away from the UK. Labour has said that if elected it would restore some of the previous policies, such as the former 2030 deadline for phasing out fossil fuel cars, but there are question marks over the proposed phase-out date for gas boilers. But Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for net zero, told the Guardian that Labour would commit to stringent action on emissions and investment in green growth, which he has said are the only way to tackle the cost of living crisis. He said: \u201cThis is damning evidence from the government\u2019s own watchdog that Rishi Sunak\u2019s decisions to force renters to live in damp homes and delay the transition to electric vehicles will increase costs for families across Britain. This report also confirms that this government is seriously off track to meet its climate targets, storing up costs and damage for future generations. The Conservatives have no solution to the cost of living crisis, and Rishi Sunak is only raising bills and making Britain more insecure.\u201d The statutory adviser\u2019s assessment of Sunak\u2019s U-turns, published on Wednesday, also criticised the government\u2019s \u201cunhelpful\u201d failure to make any estimates of the likely impacts of the policy changes on the UK\u2019s ability to meet its legally binding carbon budgets, and to provide essential detail on the changes. There were a few words of praise amid the criticism, for instance over the government\u2019s support for electrification of the steel industry at Port Talbot, and the decision to retain a 2030 target for 80% of new vehicles sold to be electric, despite postponing the phase-out of sales of new fossil fuel cars by five years to 2035. Ministers also set out measures that would raise the price for carbon emissions under the UK\u2019s emissions trading scheme, which the CCC said would have a positive effect, though it was \u201cat the looser end\u201d of the possible range. Forster also noted that the government\u2019s actions would have an impact on Cop28, the crucial UN climate summit that begins late next month. \u201cOur position as a global leader on climate has come under renewed scrutiny following the prime minister\u2019s speech. We urge the government to restate strong British leadership on climate change in the crucial period before the next climate summit, Cop28 in Dubai,\u201d he said. Green experts and campaigners called for Sunak to change his stance. Danny Gross, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis assessment highlights the glaring inconsistencies between the government\u2019s rhetoric and action. Rishi Sunak has said he will honour his commitment, made at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt, to cut the UK\u2019s carbon emissions by over two-thirds by 2030. His climate advisers are telling him loud and clear that his plans just don\u2019t add up and the target will be missed.\u201d He added: \u201cThe prime minister is scrapping policies that would reduce harmful emissions and cut sky-high energy bills. He claims his government will be one of integrity, so he should stop trying to pull the wool over people\u2019s eyes by pretending he can deliver on promises with a climate plan that\u2019s just not up to scratch.\u201d Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said Sunak\u2019s policy rollbacks had left the UK more dependent on imported oil and gas, and that the failure of the offshore wind auction would mean people\u2019s energy bills would be \u00a31bn higher than necessary. She added that there was damaging lack of clarity over many of the policies. \u201cBy failing to prepare for off-gas grid boiler phase-out \u2013 a policy that would have affected 0.2% of homes a year from 2026 \u2013 the seeds of confusion are sowed not only with homeowners but with investors too who are seeking to build new, clean industries as the UK tries to compete in the global race for green growth,\u201d she said. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK remains a global leader on climate \u2013 cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country \u2013 so we are confident that we will meet our future carbon commitments, including net zero, just as we have overdelivered on every carbon target to date. We are taking a fairer and more pragmatic approach to meeting net zero that eases burdens on families \u2013 saving households up to \u00a315,000 on upfront costs to upgrade their homes. \u201cWe will continue to meet our international commitments under the Paris agreement, while embracing the opportunities of clean industries \u2013 supporting thousands of British jobs, driving economic growth \u2013 while protecting national security and bringing down energy bills in the long term.\u201d"

            "content": "The carbon budget remaining to limit the climate crisis to 1.5C of global heating is now \u201ctiny\u201d, according to an analysis, sending a \u201cdire\u201d message about the adequacy of climate action. The carbon budget is the maximum amount of carbon emissions that can be released while restricting global temperature rise to the limits of the Paris agreement. The new figure is half the size of the budget estimated in 2020 and would be exhausted in six years at current levels of emissions. Temperature records have been obliterated in 2023, with extreme weather supercharged by global heating hitting lives and livelihoods across the world. At the imminent UN Cop28 climate summit in the United Arab Emirates there are likely to be disputes over calls for a phaseout of fossil fuels. The analysis found the carbon budget remaining for a 50% chance of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5C is about 250bn tonnes. Global emissions are expected to reach a record high this year of about 40bn tonnes. To retain the 50% chance of a 1.5C limit, emissions would have to plunge to net zero by 2034, far faster than even the most radical scenarios. The current UN ambition is to cut emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, although existing policies are far from delivering this ambition. If it was achieved, however, it would mean only about a 40% chance of staying below 1.5C, the scientists said, so breaking the limit would be more likely than not. But, they warned, every 10th of a degree of extra heat caused more human suffering and therefore keeping as close as possible to 1.5C was crucial. The new carbon budget estimate is the most recent and comprehensive analysis to date. The main reasons the budget has shrunk so markedly since 2020 are the continued high emissions from human activities and a better understanding of how reducing air pollution increases heating by blocking less sunlight. Prof Joeri Rogelj, at Imperial College London, UK, and one the study\u2019s authors, said: \u201cThe budget is so small, and the urgency of meaningful action for limiting warming is so high, [that] the message from [the carbon budget] is dire. \u201cHaving a 50% or higher likelihood that we limit warming to 1.5C is out of the window, irrespective of how much political action and policy action there is.\u201d He said it was \u201cremarkable\u201d how much risk humanity appeared willing to take with global heating. Dr Chris Smith, at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, who was also part of the study, said: \u201cGovernments can control the emissions but, at the moment, they have not done so. This is why we have an ever-shrinking carbon budget. We are not saying we only have six years to solve climate change \u2013 absolutely not. If we are able to limit warming to 1.6C or 1.7C, that\u2019s a lot better than 2C. We still need to fight for every 10th of a degree.\u201d The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, used updated data and improved climate modelling compared with other recent estimates. It also used the latest figures showing that aerosol air pollution and the clouds it was helping to seed were better at blocking sunlight and limiting heating than previously thought. As a result, lower pollution in future would mean more global heating and therefore a smaller carbon emissions budget to remain under 1.5C. The analysis also looked at the 2C upper limit in the Paris agreement, which even if met would still mean a sharp increase in climate impacts from heatwaves to floods to crop losses. For a 90% chance of keeping below 2C, emissions would have to hit net zero in about 2035, the study found. Achieving net zero in 2050 would give a 66% chance of meeting the 2C target. Ben Sanderson, at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Norway, and not part of the study, said the remaining budget for 1.5C was tiny. \u201cThe [analysis] makes for uncomfortable reading for policymakers. The budget is consistent with net zero CO2 emissions being achieved in 2034. This is vastly more ambitious than current implemented global climate policies.\u201d Dr Gabriel Abrah\u00e3o, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said: \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we will overshoot the 1.5C target in this decade. Thus, the public debate and the international climate negotiations should already be discussing how to return to 1.5C after an overshoot, so that [it] doesn\u2019t end up being permanent.\u201d The calculation of carbon budget involved significant uncertainties, the researchers said. Sanderson added: \u201cThis [updated carbon budget] illustrates that any calculation, no matter how rigorous, is subject to change with revised data and understanding.\u201d Dr Robin Lamboll, at Imperial College London, said future revisions that increased the carbon budget were \u201cnot very likely now\u201d. Global carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning could peak as early as this year, according to data from the International Energy Agency, meaning they could begin to fall in 2024. Lamboll said the researchers hoped to produce annual updates on the remaining carbon budgets."

            "content": "A climate researcher who refused to comply with his employer\u2019s demand to fly at short notice back to Germany from Bougainville, off the coast of Papua New Guinea, says he has been fired from his job. Gianluca Grimalda is still waiting in Bougainville for a cargo ship, set to depart on Saturday, to begin his return journey to Europe, after six months investigating the impacts of climate breakdown and globalisation on the island\u2019s inhabitants. Grimalda, who has avoided flying for more than a decade, said he had promised the people he met during his field work \u2013 some of whom had been displaced by rising waters \u2013 he would minimise his carbon emissions on his return journey. But he faced a dilemma two weeks ago when his bosses at the Kiel Institute for Worldwide Economy (IfW) gave him a deadline to return to his desk that meant he had to travel by air, or face losing his job. He refused and on Wednesday, he said they informed him his contract had been terminated. \u201cIfW seems to ignore that we have entered the Anthropocene era and that the most important Earth ecosystems are close to collapse, if not already collapsed,\u201d Grimalda said. \u201cIn this era, wasting 4.5 tonnes of CO2 (the difference between the flight emissions and the slow-travel emissions) to comply with the absurd request to be physically present in Kiel at such short notice is morally unacceptable and epitomises the ultimate privilege of the global elites. \u201cIt is the sign that IfW is still living in an era that will be wiped out by the incoming climate collapses.\u201d Writing in the Guardian\u2019s opinion section on Thursday, Grimalda said the carbon that would be emitted by his one-way flight to Europe from Solomon Islands archipelago is more than the average person living there uses in an entire year. Grimalda said he intended to appeal against the IfW\u2019s decision to sack him, and said he had asked for the help of his trade union. But, he added: \u201cIn this case, the initial impression is that IfW actions are justified legally.\u201d A spokesperson for IfW said that it stood by its policy of not discussing or commenting on staff issues in public. \u201cIn general, the institute encourages and supports its staff to travel climate-friendly,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe are committed to do without air travel in Germany and in other EU countries as far as we can. When flights are unavoidable, we pay to Atmosfair to offset flight emissions through climate protection projects. \u201cWhat is public and obvious: Dr Grimalda planned his trip to Papua and his research stay with our support. We supported a second \u2018slow travel\u2019 trip of his before. So we have no general reservations about slow travelling.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 October 2023. Bougainville is an autonomous island of Papua New Guinea in the Solomon Islands archipelago, but is not part of the country of Solomon Islands, as an earlier version implied."

            "date": "2023-10-04T23:01:07Z",
            "content": "Carbon emissions from the global electricity sector may peak this year, after plateauing in the first half of 2023, because of a surge in wind and solar power, according to a climate thinktank. A new report on global electricity generation found that the growth of renewables was so rapid that it was close to the incredibly fast rate required if the world is to hit the tripling of capacity by the end of the decade that experts believe is necessary to stay on the 1.5C pathway. It also noted that there had been only a slight increase in emissions in the first six months of the year, compared with the same period a year before. The findings suggest the world may be close to reaching the peak of the global power sector\u2019s carbon emissions, and they could soon even begin to fall in line with global climate targets. The report, by the climate thinktank Ember, compared electricity data from January to June 2023 to the same period last year, across 78 countries representing 92% of the world\u2019s electricity demand. Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, Ember\u2019s senior electricity analyst and the lead author of the report, said: \u201cIt\u2019s still hanging in the balance if 2023 will see a fall in power-sector emissions.\u201d \u201cThe world is teetering at the peak of power-sector emissions, and we now need to unleash the momentum for a rapid decline in fossil fuels by securing a global agreement to triple renewables capacity this decade,\u201d she said. The report found that global power-sector emissions rose by 0.2% in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year. However, it also found that wind and solar power had climbed to a combined total of 14.3% of the world\u2019s electricity, up from 12.8% last year. Solar power in particular grew by 16% in the first half of the year, compared with the first six months of 2022, after 50 countries set new monthly records for solar generation, according to Ember. Wiatros-Motyka told the Guardian that tripling the world\u2019s renewable energy capacity was the \u201csingle biggest action that governments can take to put the world on a course for a 1.5C-aligned pathway\u201d. Carbon emissions from generating electricity need to fall to net zero by 2045 globally, and by 2035 in advanced economies, in order to reach the Paris agreement\u2019s goal of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, according to modelling by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA\u2019s influential net zero roadmap suggests that the combined share of solar and wind power would need to increase from 12% last year to 40% in 2030 to remain on track. To achieve that, global renewable capacity would have to triple by the end of the decade, which would require solar power to grow by 26% every year, while wind power would need to grow by 16% a year. \u201cTo put this in context, last year\u2019s year-on-year growth was 25% for solar and 14% for wind, so almost exactly what is needed,\u201d said Wiatros-Motyka. \u201cRapid growth in solar and wind has so far kept pace with pathways aligned with 1.5C. But to keep up these high growth rates throughout this decade, countries need to deploy bigger and faster.\u201d Fossil fuels were also kept at bay by a global slowdown in the world\u2019s growing demand for electricity, according to the report. It found that global electricity demand rose by 0.4% in the first half of 2023 compared with the same period last year, well below the 10-year average of 2.6% before that."

            "date": "2023-10-24T15:35:32Z",
            "content": "The EU must cut greenhouse gas pollution almost three times more quickly than it has over the past decade to meet its climate targets, a European Commission report has said. In an attempt to stop weather growing more extreme, the EU has promised to pump 55% less planet-heating gas into the air in 2030 than it did in 1990. But over the past three decades it has cut emissions by just 32%, leaving behind \u201csignificant gaps\u201d for the next seven years, the commission found in its latest State of the Energy Union report. Current policies will cut emissions in 2030 by just 43%, according to new estimates from the European Environment Agency project. The figure rises to 48% if they include policies that have been planned but not yet put in place, but still leave a deficit in climate action of seven percentage points. \u201cTo fully achieve these targets, the pace of emissions reductions needs to step up,\u201d said Wopke Hoekstra, the EU\u2019s new climate commissioner. The commission report praised efforts to quickly ditch gas from Russia in the wake of its war in Ukraine, which rapidly pushed up energy prices. The EU slashed imports of Russian gas from 155bn cubic metres in 2021 to 80bn cubic metres in 2022 and to an estimated 40-45bn cubic metres in 2023. The EU also oversaw a boom in clean technologies such as wind turbines and solar panels, the report found, but the commission cautioned that renewable energy needed to grow much faster than it had over the past decade. On average, the share of renewables in European energy has grown 0.67 percentage points each year to hit 21.8% in 2021. Reaching the EU target of 42.5% by the end of the decade \u201cwill require a much faster growth in the coming years\u201d, the report found. Emissions are falling steadily but three things stand out, said Hoekstra. \u201cOne, significant emissions cuts are needed in buildings and transport. Progress in these sectors has been sluggish at best. Two, the natural carbon sink needs to grow. In certain places the carbon sink has become a source of emissions, and that is worrying. And three, we need much more substantial progress in cutting emissions in agriculture.\u201d Hoekstra, a former employee of oil firm Shell and consultancy McKinsey, also said fossil fuel subsidies were \u201cunhelpful\u201d for the clean energy transition and reminded national governments of their promises to get rid of them. Most EU member states responded to the energy crisis by making it easier for people and industries to buy and burn fossil fuels. Subsidies surged to \u20ac123bn in 2022, half of which do not have an end date this decade, the report found. At the Cop28 climate summit next month the EU has said it will push for a global phaseout of unabated fossil fuels \u2013 ie those where the planet-heating gases emitted are not captured \u2013 and certain subsidies. Hoekstra said: \u201cIn the Cop28 mandate, all member states \u2013 I\u2019ll say again, all member states \u2013 agreed fossil fuel subsidies that do not address either energy poverty or the just transition must be phased out as soon as possible.\u201d Several European governments have dragged their feet on climate action in recent months despite prodding from the EU. Only a handful of member states met the commission\u2019s June deadline for submitting their draft climate and energy plans and action plans are still missing from three of the five biggest polluters: Germany, France and Poland. According to a new report from the European branch of campaign group Climate Action Network (CAN), the policies in the drafts that were submitted are not enough to keep the planet from heating by 1.5C above preindustrial levels. They are also too weak to comply with minimum EU climate and energy requirements for 2030. Chiara Martinelli, the director of CAN Europe, called on governments in the EU to \u201cmatch the magnitude of the challenge\u201d in their action plans. \u201cThis report starkly highlights the glaring contrast between the urgent demand for accelerated climate action and the sluggish on-ground progress.\u201d"

            "title": "California to require big firms to reveal carbon emissions in first law of its kind",
            "date": "2023-10-09T17:40:36Z",
            "content": "A groundbreaking California law will force large companies doing business in the state \u2013 including major global corporations \u2013 to disclose their planet-heating carbon emissions. The measure, signed into law by the governor, Gavin Newsom, on Saturday, will be the nation\u2019s first of its kind, serving as a blueprint for national climate accountability. It comes as federal regulators have dragged their feet on crafting similar rules, which could be finalized this month. SB 253 will require California regulators to create rules by 2025 for public and private companies whose annual revenues exceed $1bn. That affects about 5,300 corporations, including Chevron, Wells Fargo, Amazon and Apple. By 2026, those companies will have to publicly disclose how much carbon is produced by their operations and electricity use. Critically, by 2027, they will also be required to report emissions generated by their supply chains and customers, known as \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions, which are highly controversial among business interests, including the fossil fuel industry. A companion bill passed by the state\u2019s legislature, SB-261, would additionally require businesses with more than $500m in yearly revenue to disclose their climate-related financial risks beginning in 2026, or face annual penalties. Both bills will make new data public beyond California\u2019s borders, which supporters say could be game-changing. \u201cThe disclosure requirements would really pull back the curtain on the biggest climate destroyers in the oil industry and make it harder to greenwash,\u201d said Hollin Kretzmann, a senior attorney at the environmental advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity, which supported the bills. Yet Newsom\u2019s signatures came with caveats. In two similar signing statements, he raised concerns about the bills\u2019 implementation deadlines and the costs they will impose on businesses. He previously said approval would be subject to \u201csome cleanup\u201d in language, sparking concern that the laws will be weakened. \u201cI thank the governor and the bill authors for their leadership, but the hard work of implementing these laws must prove our shared commitment to California\u2019s climate leadership,\u201d said David Weiskopf, senior policy advisor at advocacy group NextGen. The measures come as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finalizes a long-awaited, similar federal mandate. Last year, the agency proposed regulations that would likewise require publicly traded companies to notify investors of their emissions \u2013 including scope 3 emissions \u2013 and climate-related risks. Business lobby split The bills faced staunch opposition from the state\u2019s chamber of commerce and powerful oil lobby, who argued they will lead to inaccurate reporting and create costs that could be passed on to customers. This spring, fossil fuel giant Chevron spent $1.27m on lobbying in the state, according to disclosure records. The trade group Western States Petroleum Association spent $2.38m over the same period. \u201cThe reporting requirements are unprecedented, undefined and will do nothing to reduce emissions,\u201d said Kevin Slagle, Western States Petroleum Association\u2019s vice-president of strategic communications, declining to specify how much the association spent to fight the bills. Spokesperson Bill Turenne said Chevron already voluntarily reports its emissions, including Scope 3, and \u201cwill continue our mandatory and voluntary financial disclosures in the jurisdictions where we operate\u201d. Reports show oil companies\u2019 scope 3 reporting processes are inconsistent. Marathon Petroleum, the California Independent Petroleum Association, and the American Chemistry Council also fought the bills, a new analysis from climate research group Sunstone Strategies shows, as did other fossil fuel interests. Other business interests, however, joined environmental advocates in supporting the measures. Tech giants Apple, Google, Salesforce, Microsoft and Adobe backed it, as did businesses that tout their sustainability practices such as Ikea, Patagonia and Amalgamated Bank. Ivan Frishberg, chief sustainability officer at Amalgamated Bank, which has published emissions and climate risk reports for years, said his firm\u2019s climate-focused practices have spurred more business. \u201cWe\u2019re making a lot of money by doing the right thing,\u201d said Frishberg. Even companies whose focus is selling planet-heating products should realize more climate disclosure is on the way, he said. The EU has already adopted regulations mandating climate disclosure by large companies doing business there and is building out additional requirements, which could apply to many companies affected by the California laws. Federal regulations The SEC chair, Gary Gensler, said the measures could \u201cchange the baseline\u201d for the long-awaited federal rule. \u201cIf those companies were reporting to California, then it would be in essence less costly because they\u2019d already be producing that information,\u201d he said during a house oversight hearing last month. The agency has faced pressure to weaken its proposal from oil interests including ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66 and trade group the American Petroleum Institute. The opposition will likely be \u201crenewed and vigorous\u201d in the wake of the California victories, said Jackie Fielder, co-director of the corporate accountability coalition Stop the Money Pipeline. Advocates say the statewide fight should show federal regulators not to cave to meet polluters\u2019 demands. In California, lawmakers amended both bills to delay phase-in dates, lessen noncompliance penalties, and reduce the frequency of reporting requirements, but could not win oil companies\u2019 support. \u201cThe big lesson is that the fossil fuel industry aren\u2019t good faith negotiators,\u201d said Kretzmann. Advocates on the lookout Kretzmann said the bill shows California can be a \u201cclimate leader\u201d. Last month, Newsom also brought a much-lauded lawsuit against oil companies for allegedly misleading the public about the climate crisis. But the governor could go even further, said Kretzmann, by imposing additional requirements for fossil projects or even directing regulators to halt new oil and gas permits altogether. Advocates will be closely watching for changes to the legislation. . Last month, Newsom said his staff would do \u201csome cleanup on some little language\u201d on the bills without specifying his desired changes. \u201cThat definitely made us raise our eyebrows,\u201d said Fielder. Newsom has not stated plans to remove scope 3 requirements or otherwise weaken the measures, but will likely face pressure to do so. California\u2019s chamber of commerce says it will push for language tweaks to help protect business interests, which could signal a desire to \u201cgut\u201d the disclosure policy, bill author Scott Weiner told Politico. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching,\u201d Fielder said."

The risk would be higher for critical infrastructure services, including finance, energy, utilities or government, as well as those that have a presence in or partnership with Israel or the surrounding regions. While the firm said there was a real chance that Australian and New Zealand organisations would be targeted in direct response to the government\u2019s condemnation of Hamas in the next month, other regions would likely be a higher priority target in the near term. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that some groups, including several with ties to Russia, had begun attacking Israeli government and media websites since the conflict began. The cybersecurity director of the US National Security Agency, Rob Joyce, indicated earlier this week there had not been any major cyber-attacks arising from the war so far. The group that claimed to take down the Home Affairs website last week said it was done in response to Australia\u2019s continued support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion."

            "date": "2023-10-26T05:03:23Z",
            "content": "Anthony Albanese is in the final stages of an official visit to Washington. He wanted to engage the president of the United States, Joe Biden, on a range of policy fronts during the four-day trip. Here are the key takeaways from the visit. Trouble with nuclear submarines When the prime minister arrived in Washington, dysfunction in the legislature was on full display. The House of Representatives had been paralysed for three weeks because there was no speaker. This chaos affects the biggest defence project in Australia\u2019s history. The Biden administration needs to be able to pass legislation underpinning the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine pact. Three bills sit in the queue: ship transfer legislation, export control legislation, and a supplementary budget request for submarine industrial base support. Whether they emerge from the queue remains anyone\u2019s guess. Also anybody\u2019s guess: whether Biden\u2019s commitment to Aukus will be honoured by Maga Republicans in the event they win back the White House in 2025. Given the known unknowns, Albanese needs the incumbent president and key US lawmakers to focus on assembling and future-proofing the Aukus nuts and bolts. Ensuring the right people are focused was one of the key objectives of this visit. Biden was asked by a reporter whether he could give a personal guarantee Aukus-related legislation will pass. As it happened, the president could not. In response to the question, the president said: \u201cDo you know anyone in an elected office [who] can give a personal guarantee that it happens?\u201d The journalist persisted: \u201cWell, we\u2019d like you to try.\u201d Biden responded: \u201cI\u2019m going to try. And I believe it will get done.\u201d Keeping US eyes on the Pacific Just as Australia needs Biden to be focused on Aukus, both the Albanese government and the Dutton opposition want the US focused on, and engaged in, the Pacific. The reasons for this are obvious. China is becoming the regional hegemon. Australia remains dependent on the US for our security. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Albanese and Biden have unveiled a number of joint measures in the Pacific, including co\u2011financing infrastructure projects in Kiribati such as the rehabilitation of Kanton wharf and Charlie wharf in Tarawa. According to a joint statement from the leaders, Australia and the US will engage Pacific nations to develop and deploy a pilot initiative in the region to increase national cyber resilience. There are also joint climate change-related commitments, including a bonds program to help small firms in the Indo-Pacific work on the energy transition and an effort to ensure financing from the green climate fund is targeted to \u201cthose most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including least developed countries and small island developing states\u201d. The race to net zero Sticking with the energy transition, another key focus of the trip has been a bilateral discussion about critical minerals. Gaining reliable supply of the commodities required to power the net zero world is one of the biggest emerging geopolitical power plays. As the US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, noted this week: \u201cChina has a headstart, and that means we have to work a little harder and a little faster. [China has] the technology and sustained investment over a long period of time, particularly in midstream processing and refining, to dominate the market for critical minerals.\u201d The US wants a secure supply chain of commodities to build batteries and electric vehicles. Australia also wants to develop a domestic battery industry. Raimondo again: \u201cAs we race towards a more stable supply chain, there\u2019s a moment for us, US and Australia, to partner as it relates to critical minerals to our mutual benefit.\u201d Albanese put it this way: \u201cWe want to move Australia up the international value chain in critical minerals, energy and manufacturing.\u201d As a downpayment on this objective, Australia announced an expansion of the existing critical minerals facility during this Washington visit. The expansion was worth $2bn. But industry players say much more needs to happen, and soon. Cyber and space Albanese opened his trip by confirming a significant new investment by the US computing giant Microsoft in Australia\u2019s hyperscale cloud computing capacity and cyber defence. The announcement in Washington came ahead of the government\u2019s release of a new Australian cybersecurity strategy covering the period to 2030. Release of the new Australian strategy is expected within weeks. The two leaders are also collaborating on policies related to space. The strategic competition between the US and China extends beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. There is a renewed space race between countries and between billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Biden and Albanese will sign a new technology safeguard agreement that will allow more launches of US rockets from Australia. The two leaders also welcomed progress in negotiations of a \u201cbilateral space framework agreement\u201d to facilitate private investment in assets like commercial spaces stations. Canberra, Beijing, Washington, Tokyo With strategic competition with China the consistent backdrop to the trip, the two leaders also took steps to bring Japan closer. Albanese and Biden said they would explore trilateral cooperation with Japan on drones to \u201cenhance interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy\u201d. Biden said the whole piece \u2013 Aukus, cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the Quad grouping with India and Japan \u2013 was not an attempt by the US and its allies to surround China. It was an attempt to maintain stability. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about \u2026 it\u2019s about maintaining stability. Stability. The Taiwan Straits, the Indian Ocean, that whole area. And I think it\u2019s going to increase the prospects for long-term peace rather than anything else.\u201d"

            "content": "Microsoft says it will invest an additional $5bn in Australia over the next two years to expand hyperscale cloud computing capacity while collaborating with the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) to boost domestic protection from cyber threats. Anthony Albanese confirmed the new investment on the opening day of his state visit to the United States during an event at the Australian embassy in Washington, flanked by Microsoft\u2019s vice-chair and president, Brad Smith, and Microsoft Australia and New Zealand Managing director Steven Worrall. The announcement in Washington comes ahead of the Albanese government articulating a new Australian cybersecurity strategy covering the period to 2030. Release of the new Australian strategy is expected within weeks. After starting his day in the US capital with a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider at Arlington National Cemetery and a visit to the gravesites of two Australians buried there, Albanese confirmed Microsoft\u2019s plans at an event during the afternoon. Microsoft says the collaboration with the Australian government to boost domestic cybersecurity will enhance \u201cjoint capability to identify, prevent and respond to cyber threats, which are growing in both frequency and severity\u201d. In a statement, the computing giant said the exchange of cyber threat information leads to better protection for Australian residents, businesses and government entities. Microsoft said the focus of its activity would be on detecting, analysing and defending against sophisticated nation-state cyber threats. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The director general of ASD, Rachel Noble, said the investments would strengthen the agency\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership with Microsoft and \u2026 turbocharge our collective capacity to protect Australians in cyberspace\u201d. A recent threat report from the Australian Cyber Security Centre found one incident is reported on average in Australia every seven minutes. More than 76,000 incidents of cybercrime were reported in 2021-22. Albanese said he welcomed Microsoft\u2019s collaboration with ASD because a strong economy required protection from cyber threats. The prime minister also characterised Microsoft\u2019s commitments as \u201ca major investment in the skills and workers of the future, which will help Australia to strengthen our position as a world-leading economy\u201d. Microsoft says the new investment in Australia will increase its computing capacity by around 250% over the next two years, enabling the company to meet growing demand for cloud computing services. It would also help Australia capitalise on \u201cthe significant economic and productivity opportunities presented by the latest AI technology\u201d. The computing giant has committed to supporting an additional 300,000 Australians as part of its global skills programs and is \u201cworking towards\u201d launching its first Datacentre Academy in Australia in early 2024, in partnership with Tafe NSW. The computing giant says the enhanced funding is the single largest investment in Australia during its 40-year presence in the country. Worrall said in a statement the proposed infrastructure, skilling and cybersecurity investments and initiatives would \u201cbuild on our long-term commitment to Australia, but are squarely focused on the future\u201d. \u201cThey will not only enable a safer and more secure digital economy, but also provide a platform to foster growth and innovation in the era of AI,\u201d Worrall said."

            "content": "The department responsible for Australia\u2019s cybersecurity, national security and immigration has confirmed it was hit with a distributed denial-of-service attack on Thursday night that took its website offline for five hours, after a pro-Russia hacker group said it would target the site over Australia\u2019s support for Ukraine. The group posted on Telegram on Thursday night that it was targeting the home affairs department with a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack after Australia announced this week that Slinger technology aimed at combating drones would be sent to Ukraine in the push back against the Russian invasion. \u201cA state from the distant mainland of Australia decided to keep up with the global Russophobic trend and announced the transfer of the Slinger \u2018drone killer system\u2019 to Kyiv,\u201d an English translation of the post stated. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame (not really) that Australia doesn\u2019t have systems in place to track our DDoS attacks!\u201d A DDoS attack floods a site with traffic in a coordinated way in an attempt to make that service inaccessible.

A spokesperson for the department said the outage had been \u201cbrief\u201d overnight, and no data was accessed by the threat actor. \u201cAn investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident is under way, but initial assessments indicate that the DDoS attack was solely designed to prevent access to our websites,\u201d the spokesperson said. The department has notified the required authorities about the attack. It is understood that as of Friday afternoon the department was still experiencing intermittent performance issues on its website as a result of the attack. The group has been targeting countries lending support to Ukraine since March last year, including Canada, the US, Denmark, Germany, Norway and Poland, but it is believed this is the first attack targeting Australia from the group. Parliament House\u2019s website was also experiencing issues on Friday, with a number of pages not loading. However, a spokesperson for the Department of Parliamentary Services, which manages the website, said the issues were unrelated, and not due to a cyber-attack. \u201cThe APH website has been intermittently unavailable due to a vendor infrastructure issue,\u201d a DPS spokesperson said. \u201cThe issue is being resolved. The issues are not cybersecurity related.\u201d As of 12 July, Australia\u2019s total assistance to Ukraine was $890m, with $710m in military assistance."

            "content": "Some people who have had dealings with Australia\u2019s privacy regulator were only informed this week that their personal information, including banking data, was caught up in the hack of the law firm HWL Ebsworth. The Russian-linked ransomware group ALPHV/BlackCat hacked the law firm in April. In September the group published on the dark web 1.1TB of the data it claimed to have stolen \u2013 later established to be 3.6TB. Among those affected were 65 government departments and agencies that HWL Ebsworth had provided legal services, including the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), which serves as Australia\u2019s privacy regulator. In a letter sent by the law firm to one individual this week, seen by Guardian Australia, HWL Ebsworth said data gathered in its capacity providing legal services to the OAIC was obtained via \u201cunauthorised access to a portion of HWLE\u2019s IT environment\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, the incident involved the theft of data from HWLE\u2019s systems, and some of your personal information that is relevant to your dealings with the OAIC was taken as a result.\u201d The information obtained included name, encrypted messaging contacts, bank details, address and signature. The letter notes that the firm took out an injunction in the New South Wales supreme court that \u201cseeks to prohibit further access to, use, dissemination or publishing of the data disclosed on the dark web, including by the media\u201d. The injunction has meant those who had their data posted on the dark web could only find out from the company itself, resulting in the longer period before they were informed. HWL Ebsworth said the reason it had taken six months since the hack to notify the individual was \u201cbecause a very large volume of data was extracted but it was not immediately apparent the extent of the impact to personal information\u201d. \u201cA complex manual review was needed to assess what personal information was involved and identify affected persons.\u201d Last month Australia\u2019s national cybersecurity coordinator, Air Marshal Darren Goldie, defended the time taken to inform those caught up in the breach as a measure to avoid sparking anxiety. \u201cWhile there is some benefit in getting that information into the public domain early on, I made the decision to allow HWL Ebsworth to notify individuals through NDIS providers and caregivers first before making the information public,\u201d he said. Goldie said at the time that the government\u2019s 16-week formal coordinated response to the attack had ended, but criminal investigations continued. A spokesperson for HWL Ebsworth referred Guardian Australia back to previous statements made by the company. The company has previously said it had been attempting to inform those affected as swiftly as possible. Guardian Australia has sought comment from the OAIC."

            "date": "2023-10-06T14:38:32Z",
            "content": "The US workforce added 336,000 jobs last month, much more than expected, as the world\u2019s largest economy remained resilient in the face of higher interest rates. The sharp acceleration in hiring saw non-farm payrolls rise during September by almost double the rate anticipated by economists. Readings for July and August were also revised higher, with 236,000 and 227,000 jobs added, respectively. Employment growth had been fading in recent months, according to official data, but remained largely resilient while the Federal Reserve battled to get inflation under control. This bolstered hopes that the central bank will manage to guide the US economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, where price growth normalizes and recession is avoided. The closely watched monthly report is seen on Wall Street and in Washington as a key indicator of the health of the US economy. It excludes farms because of seasonal variation. The headline unemployment rate held firm at 3.8% last month. The leisure and hospitality sectors helped drive the jump in payrolls growth, adding 96,000 jobs. Government employers also added 73,000 jobs. The news comes as policymakers at the Fed prepare to meet on Halloween for their latest rate-setting meeting. They are expected to hold rates steady. When officials convened last month, documents released by the central bank revealed that they on average expected unemployment would rise to 4.1% next year, down from a median projection of 4.5% earlier this year. The latest report \u201csuggests the labour market is enjoying a soft landing\u201d, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said. \u201cThe surprisingly strong 336,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in September adds to the evidence on real activity that the economy is holding up well despite the headwind from higher interest rates.\u201d Benchmark 10-year US treasury yields hit their highest levels in 16 years following the release, and leading share indices declined on Wall Street, as investors considered whether the Fed would raise rates further in the months ahead. Jerome Powell, the central bank\u2019s chair, has previously described a \u201csoft landing\u201d as plausible, but not his baseline expectation. He said factors outside the Fed\u2019s control, such as the autoworker strike and the threat of a government shutdown, could knock the US economy. Jason Furman, former chair of the White House council of economic advisers under Barack Obama, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: \u201cFirst reaction to jobs numbers: Shock. Second reaction: Nervousness. Further reflection: This could be quite good... We could be in the middle of a sustainable increase in labor supply.\u201d The latest data \u201cwill reaffirm the market\u2019s conviction that rates will stay higher for longer,\u201d Mike Bell, a market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said. \u201cIt also increases the probability of another rate hike from the Fed this year.\u201d Payroll company ADP released its latest national employment report on Wednesday, showing that private-sector employers added 89,000 jobs in September, far fewer than expected. Economists approach such readings with care, however. The reading is an \u201cunreliable indicator\u201d of official data, Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said."

            "content": "The US economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the third quarter as higher wages from a tight labor market helped to power consumer spending, again defying dire warnings of a recession that have lingered since 2022. Gross domestic product increased at a 4.9% annualized rate last quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021, the commerce department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its advance estimate of third-quarter GDP growth. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 4.3% rate. The US\u2019s economic resilience faces challenges. Interest rates remain high and are likely to remain so as the Federal Reserve continues its fight against rising inflation. War in Ukraine and the Middle East may also hit the economy, as could the looming likelihood of a US government shutdown next month. Growth could also slow in the fourth quarter because of the United Auto Workers strikes and the resumption of student loan repayments by millions of Americans. But the US has shaken off previous threats to the economy, which grew at a 2.1% pace in the April-June quarter and is expanding at a rate well above what Fed officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%. Most economists have revised their forecasts and now believe that the Fed can engineer a \u201csoft-landing\u201d for the economy, bringing down inflation without triggering a recession. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, was the main driver of growth, rising at an annual rate of 4.0% over the quarter. A strong labor market and wage growth that is slightly above the rate of inflation lifted households\u2019 purchasing power. The US economy has achieved a remarkable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic downturn. The annual rate of inflation has fallen to 3.7% from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 and unemployment is close to a 50-year low. Joe Biden has, however, received little credit. A Harris poll conducted for the Guardian showed two-thirds of Americans believe the economy is worse than is being reported. Reuters contributed to this article"

This seems the right moment to remind our leaders that one of the most effective ways of boosting the economy is by ending child poverty. Driving down poverty eases pressure on local resources, people are healthier, they gain more from learning, there\u2019s less strain on mental health services, more jobs are taken up and crime drops. This isn\u2019t some overoptimistic artist\u2019s impression: studies confirm the economic benefits. Yet, sadly, talk is of cutting welfare spending, and it seems the two-child benefit cap, long considered one of the biggest drivers of child poverty, won\u2019t be lifted any time soon. Why?

Tarry has also been flagged as a possible new chief executive for Asda, a post which remains vacant, although the business is led by co-own Mohsin Issa. The US economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the third quarter as higher wages from a tight labor market helped to power consumer spending, again defying dire warnings of a recession that have lingered since 2022, my colleague Dominic Rushs reports. Gross domestic product increased at a 4.9% annualized rate last quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021, the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its advance estimate of third-quarter GDP growth. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 4.3% rate. Estimates ranged from as low as a 2.5% rate to as high as a 6.0% pace, a wide margin reflecting that some of the input data, including September durable goods orders, goods trade deficit, wholesale and retail inventory numbers were published at the same time as the GDP report. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the April-June quarter and is expanding at a rate well above what Fed officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%. While the robust growth pace notched last quarter is unlikely sustainable, it was testament to the economy\u2019s resilience despite aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Growth could slow in the fourth quarter because of the United Auto Workers strikes and the resumption of student loan repayments by millions of Americans. More here: Time to wrap up\u2026 Here are today\u2019s main stories, first on the ECB rate decision and the strong US growth figures: And also\u2026. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, predicts that today\u2019s dovish pause by the ECB will eventually be seen as the end of the hiking cycle. He told clients that eurozone rates have peaked, unless the eurozone economy \u201cmiraculously rebounds\u201d: After the September meeting, many ECB officials didn\u2019t like the market interpretation of a dovish pause and therefore kept the door to further rate hikes wide open. If anything, today\u2019s meeting actually further established the concept of a dovish pause. The ECB has never been more worried about the growth outlook and relatively relaxed about potential new inflation waves, stemming from oil prices With the European Central Bank press conference now over, reaction continues to flood in. Neil Shah, executive director at Edison Group, predicts today\u2019s vote to hold eurozone interest rates will be followed by similar moves next week in the US and UK. \u201cA highly-anticipated bellwether decision from the ECB to pause interest rates will no doubt be mirrored by the Bank of England and the Fed next week. Halting its unprecedented streak of rate increases at four per cent, the ECB\u2019s decision is a direct reaction to concerns over eurozone inflation and a weakening European economy. Indeed, this may signal a new long-term strategy with rates to be set at \u201csufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary\u201d. The ECB must now pivot its defences to protect against a potential recession, an unwelcome challenge as economic volatility looks set to carry on into 2024\u201d Christine Lagarde also declined to indicate whether she thought eurozone interest rates have reached their peak yet, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to pass a judgement to say that \u2018We are at peak\u2019. We are data-dependent, and we are going to meeting after meeting assessing on the basis of the three criterias - the inflation outlook, the underlying inflation and the strength of our monetary policy transmission whether or not our interest rates are delivering sufficiently.\u201d Christine Lagarde was reminded that she\u2019s almost halfway through her eight-year term at as ECB president \u2013 has she any regrets about decisions? Lagarde insists she has \u201cno regrets\u201d, adding: \u201cI am not going to sing it to you, but there is a famous French singer that has done that much better than I could ever to do. So no regret.\u201d She then adds that today\u2019s decision was unanimous. Christine Lagarde also insisted during today\u2019s press conference in Athens that the decision to leave interest rates on hold was still a \u2018meaningful\u2019 action. Asked about today\u2019s governing council meeting, she says: There was a general, well-shared assessment of the current situation, the judgment that we have made, and the monetary policy decision that we took, which after 10 different hikes over the last 15 months is for the first time a \u2018hold\u2019. Sometimes inaction is action, and a decision to hold is meaningful.\u201d Q: Might your economic forecasts be a little too optimistic, given the vigour of monetary policy transmission and the added uncertainty from the Israel-Hamas war? Christine Lagarde points out that the ECB will issue new forecasts in December, at its next governing council meeting. We know for a fact that growth has weakened, she adds, citing recent PMI data [surveys of purchasing managers]. Q: Sweden\u2019s Riksbank (not a eurozone member) has warned it needs 80bn Swedish krona to repair its balance sheet \u2013 do you expect any similar capital injections from eurozone central banks? Christine Lagarde says all the eurozone\u2019s central banks are in different situations, and there is \u201cno one-size-fits-all\u201d. What I know is that as a euro system and as the ECB we have one mission which is price stability. And we don\u2019t have as a purpose to show profits or to cover losses. It would be actually wrong if our decisions were guided by our P&amp;L [profit and loss] accounts rather than for pure monetary policy purposes in order to bring inflation back to 2% in the medium term.\u201d Q: Is the ECB comfortable with the recent widening in the spread between Italian government bond yields and German bond yields? Lagarde says the ECB\u2019s mission is price stability, defined as 2% inflation. The best tools to achieve that is by changing interest rates, and holding rates today does not mean that we will never hike again, Lagarde says. But, she adds: \u2026..we also have to make sure that there\u2019s proper transmission of our monetary policy throughout the whole euro area and to all countries in the euro area. \u201cAnd we have all the adequate tools in order to make sure that that happens.\u201d Q: Are you confident that the Greek economy can return to normality, to its levels before the debt crisis when it was rated A+ (by credit rating agencies). Lagarde answers a slightly different question, saying Greece\u2019s economy back above its pre-Covid situation, adding: Greece compares extremely well with other countries. She says Greece has shown \u201cphenomenal recovery capacity\u201d, and has achieved a stellar performance. Q: How much of the impact of your previous interest rate rises has hit the real economy? Christine Lagarde says the ECB is seeing a \u201cvery strong\u201d transmission of its monetary policy in the banking sector, which leads to lower inflation and dampened demand. She cites recent bank lending data, which showed a decline in demand for borrowing. \u201cWe know there is still more to come,\u201d Lagarde adds, pointing out that monetary policy operates with a lag. Q: How would you react to a spike in energy costs as a result of conflict in the Middle East? Would you immediately react, or wait for second-round effects? Lagarde says the ECB is learning lessons from the last energy crisis, and that work is ongoing. She points out that the eurozone economy is very different than it was before the recent energy shock \u2013 inflation has been very high, interest rates are already at the \u201cvery high level of 4%\u201d, it has strong employment, which is weakening. All those factors would be taken into account when assessing how a potential jump in energy costs would hit GDP and inflation. But, she insists, the ECB\u2019s determination to bring inflation down to 2% is intact. Q: Are you concerned about the rise in yields on US government bonds [they hit 16-year highs this week]? Christine Lagarde says this \u2018external tightening\u2019 is not directly relevent to the fundamentals of the eurozone economy, but are a tightening factor as they affect long-term rates. We take this spillover into account, Lagarde explains. Q: At what point might the ECB cut interest rates \u2013 is it when inflation has fallen to 2%, 2.5% or 3%? Christine Lagarde says the ECB will be \u2018data dependent\u2019 when deciding how long to keep interest rates high, and refuses to give any \u2018forward guidance\u2019 about what might trigger a change of policy. She says: At this point in our fight against inflation, and after 10 successive hikes, now is not the time for forward guidance. Now is the time to really stick to our data dependency knitting, and we shall do so. Lagarde adds that the question of when the ECB might cut rates \u201cwas not discussed at all\u201d. This debate would be \u201cabsolutely premature\u201d, she insists. Onto questions: Q: Did the governing council discuss ending the PEPP reinvestment (the reinvestment of bonds acquired under the ECB\u2019s 2020 pandemic emergency purchase programme), or raising bank reserve requirements? Christine Lagarde says neither of these issues were discussed at this month\u2019s meeting. Q: What role did the recent weak economic data, and the war in Gaza, play in today\u2019s discussion? Lagarde says the ECB is monitoring the situation in Israel, and \u201cvery attentive\u201d to the economic consequences to the impact it could have, either to energy prices or economic confidence (as flagged in her previous comments). A weaker world economy would weigh on growth in the eurozone, Christine Lagarde warns. The ECB president singles out the Ukraine war, and the Israel-Hamas war, as key risks, saying: Russia\u2019s unjustified war against Ukraine, and the tragic conflict triggered by the terrorist attacks on Israel, are key sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and households becoming less confident and more uncertain about the future, and dampen growth further. Conversely, Lagarde adds, growth could be faster than expected if the \u201cstill-resilient labour market and rising real incomes\u201d mean people and businesses become more confident and spend more, or if the world economy grows faster than expected. Lagarde points out that core inflation in the eurozone fell to 4.5% last month, from 5.3%. She credits this fall to improving supply conditions, the pass-through of previous falls in energy prices, and the impact of tighter monetary policy on demand and corporate pricing power. The ECB president adds that eurozone governments should continue to roll back their support for energy bills, as the energy crisis fades. Otherwise, Christine Lagarde warns, inflationary pressures will be driven up, requiring even tighter monetary policy (eg, higher interest rates). Christine Lagarde add that there are signs that Europe\u2019s labour market is weakening, even though the eurozone unemployment rate was a historical low of 6.4% in August. Fewer new jobs are being created, including in services, consistent with the cooling economy gradually feeding through to employment. Christine Lagarde then warns that the euro area economy \u201cremains weak\u201d, with manufacturing output continuing to fall. She tells today\u2019s press conference that subdued foreign demand and tighter financing conditions are \u201cincreasingly weighing on investment and consumer spending\u201d. The services sector is also weakening, she adds, as weaker industrial activity is spilling over into other sectors, plus the boost from reopening after Covid-19 lockdowns is fading, and higher interest rates are also hitting demand. Lagarde says: The economy is likely to remain weak for the remainder of this year. But, as inflation falls further, household real incomes recover, and the demand for euro area exports picks up, the economy should strengthen over the coming years. ECB president Christine Lagarde begins today\u2019s press conference by confirming that the central bank left interest rates unchanged. She then reads out the statement released half an hour ago (see earlier post), explaining that recent economic data has confirmed the ECB\u2019s previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook, but that inflation is still expected to stay too high for too long. The European Central Bank is holding a press conference at the Bank of Greece, in Athens, to explain today\u2019s decision to leave interest rates on hold. Bank of Greece governor Yannis Stournaras starts by pointg out this is the first time in 15 years that Athens has hosted the ECB\u2019s governing council (dating back to before the eurozone debt crisis). Stournaras (who served as Greece\u2019s finance minister during part of the debt crisis) says: It has been a rather long time, 15 years, since we last met here\u2026.. We are all now wiser, stronger, closer to each other, better prepared to tackle difficulties, and if I may say so, more European. Newsflash: America\u2019s economy grew faster than expected last summer, as it fended off fears of a recession. US GDP expanded at an annualised rate of 4.9% in July-September, higher than the 4.3% expected, and a sharp acceleration on the 2.1% recorded in Q2. That means GDP grew by just over 1.2% during the third quarter, as the US economy continues to shrug off the impact of higher interest rates. [Annualised GDP multiplies the quarterly growth by 4, to show how fast GDP would have risen over 12 months]. Richard Garland, Chief Investment Strategist, Omnis Investments, says the ECB has officially joined the Pause Party of central bankers in wait and watch mode. Garland explains: This makes sense - inflation is falling quite sharply and they had signalled last month that the direction of travel for rates will be sideways. Higher for longer is also be a mantra the ECB will be keen to repeat for a while, ensuring their work to date won\u2019t be undone by markets anticipating rate cuts too soon. Marcus Brookes, chief investment officer at Quilter Investors, argues that something \u201cvery unexpected\u201d would need to happen for eurozone interest rates to be raised again, given Europe\u2019s stagnating economy and the fact other central banks have moved into a holding pattern. Brookes says: \u201cFollowing the most aggressive series of rate hikes in its history, the European Central Bank has joined the Federal Reserve and Bank of England in hitting the pause button and assessing exactly what impact its actions are having to date. Eurozone inflation has come down significantly and is expected to moderate further, although it is still some way off target. \u201cIt seems, however, that Christine Lagarde does believe that 4% is the ceiling for rates this time around and should help moderate inflation further, although much of that is out of their control. There remain several risks that may keep inflation stubbornly high including increasing wage growth and the uncertainty in the Middle East which is pushing up energy prices. Going forward, like other central banks it will say the market needs to expect higher interest rates for longer, with the door being left open should we see inflation spike again. Dean Turner, Chief Eurozone and UK Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts the first eurozone interest rate cut could come next summer: Turner says: \u2018The decision by the ECB to keep rates on hold was well flagged, and therefore came as no surprise to investors. Although the messaging in the press release remained largely unchanged, with an ongoing emphasis on data dependency, and the need to ensure that inflation returns to target, it seems clear that the rate hiking cycle is over. Nevertheless, policymakers are rightly focused on the still high levels of inflation in the Eurozone and given some signs that the pace of decline is slowing, they are likely to err on the side of caution when it comes to the next move. It is unlikely that policymakers will feel comfortable enough to cut rates before the summer. We look for the first cut to come at the June 2024 meeting. The European Central Bank has paused its toughest cycle of interest rate increases since the launch of the euro, amid growing fears over the eurozone economy, judging previous rises are doing enough to tackle inflation, my colleague Richard Partington writes. In a decision widely expected in financial markets, the ECB left its key policy rates unchanged for the first time in more than a year \u2013 halting a round of 10 previous increases in the cost of borrowing. It comes as concerns grow over the impact of previous increases on European economies, with warnings of a recession in the single-currency area led by a downturn in Germany, where a manufacturing slump saw business activity contract for a fourth straight month in October. With inflation at more than twice the central bank\u2019s target, economists expect borrowing costs will remain at elevated levels for a prolonged period to cool price growth across the 20-country bloc. More here. The EB also says it will take a \u201cdata-dependent approach\u201d when setting interest rates. It explains: In particular, the Governing Council\u2019s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Today\u2019s ECB decision is largely as investors expected \u2013 here\u2019s some snap reaction: The ECB\u2019s Governing Council adds that it is \u201cdetermined\u201d to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target \u201cin a timely manner\u201d. It says: Based on its current assessment, the Governing Council considers that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal. The Governing Council\u2019s future decisions will ensure that its policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. Newsflash: the European Central Bank has pressed pause on its cycle of interest rate rises. The ECB\u2019s governing council has voted to leave its benchmark interest rates unchanged, at its latest meeting in Athens today. This means the ECB\u2019s deposit rate, paid on commercial bank deposits, remains at 4% \u2013 the highest since the euro was launched in 1999. Its main refinancing operations rate, which sets weekly borrowing costs for commercial banks, was left unchanged at 4.5%, while the marginal lending facility rate, offering overnight credit to banks, sticks at 4.75%. The decision ends, at least for now, a cycle of 10 interest rate rises. The ECB started raising interest rates for the first time in a decade in July 2022, after the Ukraine war drove up energy and food prices. Eurozone inflation fell last month to 4.3%, down from 5.2% in August, giving some hope that inflationary pressures were easing. The decision also comes after new data this week showed the eurozone economy has weakened. A survey of purchasing managers showed the biggest fall in business activity since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Announcing the decision, the ECB says: The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. The incoming information has broadly confirmed its previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Inflation is still expected to stay too high for too long, and domestic price pressures remain strong. At the same time, inflation dropped markedly in September, including due to strong base effects, and most measures of underlying inflation have continued to ease. The Governing Council\u2019s past interest rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully into financing conditions. This is increasingly dampening demand and thereby helps push down inflation. Tension is building in the eurozone ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate decision, due in half an hour. As covered in the introduction, economists broadly expect the ECB to leave borrowing costs unchanged at 1.15pm BST today. But there is considerable interest in what the ECB might say about the path of interest rates in future. Charalampos Pissouros, senior investment analyst at XM, explains: When they last met, ECB officials raised interest rates by 25bps, but they signaled that this was probably the last hike in this tightening crusade. Since then, several officials have argued that inflation could return to their 2% objective even without any additional hikes, while economic data continues to point to a wounded euro area economy. This convinced market participants no more rate increases will be delivered and allowed them to price in around 65bps worth of cuts for next year. Therefore, the attention will fall on clues and hints on whether policymakers are indeed considering the reduction of interest rates at some point next year, with anything validating this notion having the potential to further hurt the euro. Newsflash: Investors in music rights fund Hipgnosis have staged a shareholder revolt today. Hipgnosis shareholders have voted against a plan to sell $440m of music rights to a group backed by private equity firm Blackstone at an annual meeting today. They have also refused to support a Continuation Resolution, which could lead to the fund being wound up. Thirdly, they opposed the re-election of chairman Andrew Sutch, who had already pledged to step down by next year\u2019s AGM. Hipgnosis says it will now put forward proposals for the reconstruction, reorganisation or winding-up of the Company to Shareholders for their approval within six months, adding: These proposals may or may not involve winding-up the Company or liquidating all or part of the Company\u2019s existing portfolio of investments. Hipgnosis had pioneered the idea of buying up the rights to music from top stars, promising a revenue stream from popular back catalogues. It has acquired the rights to songs from artists including Barry Manilow, Blondie, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Shakira, Metallica and Michael Bubl\u00e9. But rising interest rates have hampered its efforts, dampening interest in alternative assts, and prompting it to slash its dividend last week. Britain\u2019s retail sector remains in \u201ca perilous position\u201d as the festive period approaches, according to the latest survey from the CBI. Its latest distributive trades survey has found that retail sales fell in the year to October, and at a faster pace than in September. This marks the sixth month in a row in which annual sales have declined. Sales volumes are expected to continue falling next month, the CBI adds. Back in the financial markets, Israel\u2019s currency has hit its lowest in over a decade against the US dollar. The shekel has fallen 0.25% today to 4.07 to the dollar, the weakest since 2012, as traders continue to anticipate a ground invasion in Gaza. On 6 October, the day before Hamas\u2019s surprise attack on Israel, the shekel had traded at 3.83 to the dollar. Today\u2019s losses come after Israel said its tanks had taken part in a \u201ctargeted raid\u201d overnight in northern Gaza. Business news weekly WirtschaftsWoche reports that Siemens Energy is seeking up to \u20ac15bn of guarantees. WirtschaftsWoche says the company is proposing that the federal government should guarantee 80% of the first tranche of \u20ac10bn, with its banks liable for 20%. Under the proposal, a second tranche of \u20ac5bn would be guaranteed by Siemens AG, which spun off Siemens Energy on the stock exchange three years ago and still holds 25% of its shares. However, Siemens AG is currently showing little inclination to accept responsibility, WirtschaftsWoche says, citing information from\u201cfinancial and government circles\u201d. A spokesperson for the German economy ministry has confirmed it is in talks with Siemens Energy, describing the discussions as \u201cclose and trustworthy\u201d, according to Reuters. Germany\u2019s Siemens Energy are reportedly in talks with the Berlin government to secure billions of euros in state guarantees as it struggles to shore up its troubled wind-turbine unit. Shares in Siemens Energy have dropped by almost 29%, after news website Der Spiegel reported that the company\u2019s CEO, Christian Bruch, is negotiating with the federal government for several billion euros in guarantees. This funding would allow Siemens Energy \u2013 one of the largest makers of wind turbines -to continue financing new business despite the high losses in the wind turbine business. Siemens Energy has confirmed this morning that it is evaluating various measures to strengthen its balance sheet, and is in \u201cpreliminary talks with different stakeholders\u201d, including banking partners and the German government over fore more guarantees which are \u201cnecessary to facilitate the anticipated strong growth\u201d. It also warns that order intake and revenue at its wind business, Siemens Gamesa, are expected to be lower than market expectations for fiscal year 2024, and net losses and cash outflow are expected to be higher than market forecasts. The company says: In light of recent media reports regarding talks with the German government, Siemens Energy AG states the following: Siemens Energy financial results for fiscal year 2023 are expected to be fully in line with guidance. The former Gas and Power businesses are expected to continue their excellent performance in fiscal year 2024 and are on track to achieve their mid-term targets (fiscal year 2025). The wind business Siemens Gamesa is working through the quality issues and is addressing the offshore ramp up challenges as announced in the third quarter communication for fiscal year 2023. As Siemens Gamesa is for the time being not concluding new contracts for certain onshore platforms and is applying strict selectivity in the offshore business, order intake and revenue are expected to be lower than market expectations for fiscal year 2024, and net losses and cash outflow are expected to be higher than market forecasts. The strong growth in order intake, particularly in the former Gas and Power business areas, leads to a rising need of guarantees for long-term projects. Considering this requirement, the Executive Board is evaluating various measures to strengthen the balance sheet of Siemens Energy and is in preliminary talks with different stakeholders, including banking partners and the German government, to ensure access to an increasing volume of guarantees necessary to facilitate the anticipated strong growth. Unemployment in Spain has risen, giving the European Central Bank\u2019s policymakers something to ponder as they set interest rates today. The Spanish jobless rate rose to 11.84% in the third quarter of the year, statistics body INE reports, up from 11.6% in Q2. Wouter Thierie, economist at ING, suggests the uptick might be caused by seasonal factors. Thierie says: The labour market benefited from strong growth in the more labour-intensive service sector, which was underpinned by a strong tourist season. In addition, the labour market is also suffering from a structural supply shock. For instance, the average number of hours worked per worker is still lower than before the pandemic, which means more labour is needed to cover the same amount of hours. This exerts downward pressure on the unemployment rate. INE also reports that the number of employed people in Spain increased by 209,100 in the third quarter of 2023, a rise of almost 1%, to 21,265,900, suggesting demand for labour remained robust. European stock markets are in the red as traders await today\u2019s ECB interest rate decision at lunchtime. The pan-European Stoxx 600 inded has lost around 1%, with Germany\u2019s DAX down 1.3%. Shares in Mercedes Benz Group are down over 5% after it reported a 6.8% drop in operating profits, and warned that the electric vehicle market was \u201cbrutal\u201d due to a flurry of price cuts. In London the FTSE 100 is down 62 points, or 0.85%, pulled down by Standard Chartered (now -12.9%), while Unilever are still down almost 3%. A takeover battle over the owner of Wagamama is brewing. The Restaurant Group has told the City that the owner of Pizza Express, Wheel Topco, have asked to see financial information so they can decide whether to make a takeover offer for the company. It told shareholders: The Board of TRG confirms that it will provide diligence information to Wheel Topco in accordance with its obligations under the Code. If any proposal is provided by Wheel Topco, the Board of TRG will carefully consider its terms, in conjunction with its advisers. Restaurant Group has already accepted a \u00a3506m takeover offer from the US buyout group Apollo, which values it at 65p per share. Shares in TRG have risen 1.8% to 67.6p, as traders anticipate a possible bidding battle. Back in the City, shares in Standard Chartered bank have tumbled over 11% after it missed profit expectations and took a hit on its exposure to China. Standard Chartered, the Asia Pacific-focused bank, reported that pretax profits more than halved in the last quarter to $633m, down from $1.391bn in Q3 2022. The drop in profits was mainly caused by a $697m cut to the carrying value of Standard Chartered\u2019s investment in China Bohai Bank. Its credit impairment charges also rose, including $186m related to the China commercial real estate sector. CEO Bill Winters says: We have continued to make strong progress in the third quarter against the five strategic actions outlined last year, delivering a solid set of results. Wealth Management has continued its recovery with double digit income growth and the Financial Markets performance has been resilient against a strong comparator period. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde was in upbeat mood last night, ahead of today\u2019s interest rate decision. Lagarde told a dinner in Athens that Greece has made an impressive comeback from the Covid-19 pandemic. She said: Real GDP per capita is now almost 10% above its pre-pandemic level \u2013 a much stronger performance than the euro area as a whole. The unemployment rate has also declined steeply, and was 10.9% in August, the lowest level since the end of 2009. And with a stronger economy, the country has been able to work further through its debt challenge. Greece\u2019s public debt-to-GDP ratio has dropped 35 percentage points from its peak of 206% in 2020, one of the fastest falls in the world. Two rating agencies recently upgraded Greek government bonds to investment grade status. The ECB\u2019s Governing Council is in Athens as part of its policy of regularly holding meetings around the eurozone, rather than at its headquarters in Frankfurt. And here\u2019s Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, on Unilever: Unilever reported underlying sales growth of 5.2%, missing analysts\u2019 expectations. While prices grew by 5.8% actual volumes of goods sold fell by 0.6%. However price growth slowed from 9.4% in the first half of 2023. Its personal care division outperformed with growth up 8% but ice cream lagged, falling by 2.8%. Unilever has named Fernando Fernandez as its new CFO today who will take over from Graeme Pitkethly. New CEO Hein Schumacher who took to the helm in July said \u201cour performance in recent years has not matched our potential. The quality of our growth, productivity and returns have all under-delivered.\u201d He said the company plans to focus on 30 key brands accounting for 70% of its sales and does not plan to carry out any major acquisitions. Unilever hopes that Schumacher\u2019s appointment will help the company turn over a new leaf after recent criticisms of \u2018profiteering\u2019 from the inflationary environment and the failed \u00a350bn bid for GSK\u2019s consumer healthcare division under former CEO Alan Jope prompting Unilever\u2019s activist investors to fight for a C-suite shake-up. Shares in Unilever have fallen sharply today echoing a similar performance from rival Reckitt which saw its shares slump yesterday. Unilever is down over 10% in the past six months reflecting the weak consumer backdrop as shoppers trade down to unlabelled, cheaper substitute products.\u201d Here\u2019s Charlie Huggins, manager of the Quality Shares Portfolio at Wealth Club, on Unilever\u2019s results: This is another drab quarter from Unilever with underlying sales growth being entirely led by higher prices and volume declines accelerating in the quarter. Europe was particularly weak with volumes falling by over 10%, and the percentage of Unilever\u2019s business winning market share on a rolling 12 month-basis fell to a disappointing 38%. Unilever\u2019s new CEO, Hein Schumacher, recognises that the group could and should be doing better. His \u2018Action Plan\u2019, announced today, is designed to reinvigorate performance through more impactful innovation, productivity savings and an improved culture. Schumacher\u2019s mantra is \u201cfewer things, done better, with greater impact\u201d. This means prioritising the top 30 Power Brands, instilling greater accountability and simplifying the business. For too long, Unilever has been too slow-moving, too complex and too weighed down by too many mediocre brands. A strategy to simplify and refocus on core strengths, perhaps augmented by some non-core brand disposals, feels like the right way to go. Shares in Unilever have dropped 2.7% at the start of trading in London. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the 0.6% drop in sales volumes was a little larger than expected. Britzman says: It looks like consumers are struggling to justify forking out extra for a tub of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s as Ice Cream sales continue to struggle. The group\u2019s strengths in emerging markets continue to shine through, despite a slower recovery than expected in China. It\u2019s closer to home, in Europe, where price hikes are still in double-digit territory and Personal Care\u2019s the only business unit showing volume growth. It\u2019s hardly the end of the world, results were broadly in line with expectations and full-year guidance remains intact. Unilever\u2019s newish chief executive, Hein Schumacher, is outlining his action plan to drive growth at the company. Schumacher, who took over this summer, says: Unilever is a company of many strengths, including, its category positions, the strength of its brands, its unmatched geographic reach and talented and passionate people. However, there has been a disconnect between these intrinsic strengths and the quality of our performance. Remedying this underperformance is our top priority and with Unilever\u2019s strong fundamentals and the many opportunities across the five Business Groups, we are confident that we can achieve that. The plan includes focusing on Unilever\u2019s \u201c30 Power Brands\u201d. which make up 70% of its sales today, and building back its gross profit margins \u2013 which were hit by rising costs \u2013 through higher productivity. Unilever has also signed a deal to sell Dollar Shave Club, the men\u2019s grooming brand it acquired for $1bn in 2016 as part of a push into direct sales to consumers. Can it ever be too cold and wet for an ice cream? Apparently it can. Unilever\u2019s sales volumes of ice cream \u2013 such as Magnum and Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s \u2013 fell by 10.1% in the last quarter. Unilever blames \u201cconsumer downtrading and unfavourable weather, particularly in Europe.\u201d It raised its ice cream prices by 8.2%, meaning underlying sales fell by 2.8% (ie, it sold less, but at higher prices). Price rises continue to boost sales at Unilever, the conglomerate behind Dove soap, Marmite and Magnum ice-cream. Unilever has reported underlying sales growth of 5.2% for the third quarter of the year, after it hiked its prices again. Average prices rose by 5.8% year-on-year in the quarter, while sales volumes fell by 0.6% \u2013 suggeting some customers have shifted to cheaper brands instead. That\u2019s a slowdown in price rises \u2013 in the first half of 2023, Unilever lifted its prices by 9.4%. Unilever, which has been passing on its higher costs to consumers, reports that price continued to moderate as inflation eased. Underlying sales volumes were positive in Unilever\u2019s Beauty &amp; Wellbeing, Personal Care and Home Care while sales volumes fell again in Nutrition and Ice Cream. Unilever still expects to spend an extra \u20ac2bn buying raw materials this year, but hopes to widen its profit margins slightly, saying: We continue to expect underlying sales growth for the full year to be above 5%, ahead of our multi-year range, with underlying price growth continuing to moderate. Our expectation for net material inflation (NMI) for 2023 remains unchanged at around \u20ac2bn. We are confident in delivering a modest improvement in underlying operating margin for the full year, reflecting higher gross margin and increased investment behind our brands. Unilever has also named Fernando Fernandez, currently president of the beauty and wellbeing business, as its new chief financial officer, replacing the retiring Graeme Pitkethly. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The European Central Bank could press the pause button on its rate-rise programme today, after hiking interest rates to record levels. The ECB\u2019s governing council is meeting in Athens to set monetary policy across the eurozone. And many economists predict it will resist pushing interest rates higher, given the recent slowdown in price rises. Last month, the ECB lifted its deposit rate to 4% \u2013 the highest since the euro was launched in 1999. Since then, inflation across the eurozone has fallen to 4.3% in September, down from 5.2% in August. That\u2019s still over twice the ECB\u2019s target at 2%, but a move in the right direction. Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, predicts the ECB could keep rates at present levels into 2024, before it starts ease. Lafargue says: While progress on the inflation front has been modest, the macro-economic momentum in the eurozone remains challenged - as highlighted by the latest round of PMIs - as geopolitical tensions are posing a further risk. That said, we would expect the central bank to still convey the idea that cuts aren\u2019t on the table and that it stands ready to act should inflation flare up again. Looking ahead we think the ECB may keep rates at present levels going into 2024 before it starts easing to accommodate lower growth as well as lower inflation.\u201d Joost van Leenders, Senior Investment Strategist at Van Lanschot Kempen, says: After the rate hike in September, the European Central Bank (ECB) said that policy rates are now at sufficiently high levels to bring inflation down to its 2% target \u2013 a strong indication that it is done with its current rate hiking cycle. For inflation to reach the ECB\u2019s target, rates will have to stay at these levels for a while, meaning it is unlikely we will see rates cut in the near future. Also coming up today The latest growth data from the US is due today, and likely to confirm that America continues to fend off recession fears. US GDP is forecast to have grown at an annualised rate of around 4.3% in July-September, more than twice as fast as the 2.1% recorded in April-June. Such growth would show the strength of US consumer spending, in the face of higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve tries to slow US inflation.

            "content": "\u201cEnter Amazon and you have exited capitalism. Despite all the buying and the selling that goes on there, you have entered a realm that can\u2019t be thought of as a market, not even a digital one.\u201d When I say this to people, which I frequently do in lectures and debates, they look at me as they would a madman. But once I start explaining what I mean, their fear for my sanity soon turns into fear for us all. Imagine the following scene, straight out of the science-fiction storybook. You are beamed into a town full of people going about their business, trading in gadgets, clothes, shoes, books, songs, games and movies. At first, everything looks normal. Then you begin to notice something odd. It turns out that all the shops, indeed every building, belong to a chap called Jeff. He may not own the factories that produce the stuff sold in his shops, but he owns an algorithm that takes a cut for each sale and he gets to decide what can be sold and what cannot. If that were all, the scene would evoke an old western in which a lonesome cowboy rides into town to discover that a podgy strongman is in charge of the saloon bar, the grocery store, the post office, the railway, the bank and, naturally, the sheriff. Except that isn\u2019t all. Jeff owns more than the shops and the public buildings. He also owns the dirt you walk on, the bench you sit on, even the air you breathe. In fact, in this weird town everything you see (and don\u2019t see) is regulated by Jeff\u2019s algorithm: you and I may be walking next to each other, our eyes trained in the same direction, but the view provided to us by the algorithm is entirely bespoke, carefully curated according to Jeff\u2019s priorities. Everyone navigating their way around Amazon \u2013 except Jeff \u2013 is wandering in algorithmically constructed isolation. This is no market town. It is not even some form of hypercapitalist digital market. Even the ugliest of markets are meeting places where people can interact and exchange information reasonably freely. In fact, it\u2019s even worse than a totally monopolised market \u2013 there, at least, the buyers can talk to each other, form associations, perhaps organise a consumer boycott to force the monopolist to reduce prices or improve quality. Not so in Jeff\u2019s realm, where everything and everyone is subject not to the disinterested invisible hand of the market but to an algorithm that works for Jeff\u2019s bottom line and dances exclusively to his tune. If this isn\u2019t scary enough, recall that it is the same algorithm that, via Alexa, has trained us to train it to manufacture our desires. The mind rebels at the extent of the hubris. The same algorithm that we help train in real time to know us inside out, both modifies our preferences and administers the selection and delivery of commodities that will satisfy these preferences. It is as if a subliminal advertising guru could not only implant in us desires for specific products, but had attained the superpower instantly to deliver said products to our doorstep, bypassing any potential competitor, all in the interest of bolstering the wealth and power of a chap called Jeff. Such concentrated power should scare the living daylights out of the liberally minded. Anyone committed to the idea of the market (not to mention the autonomous self) should recognise that what we\u2019re witnessing is its death knell. It should also shake market sceptics, socialists in particular, out of the complacent assumption that Amazon is bad because it is a capitalist market gone berserk. Actually, it\u2019s something worse than that. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t a capitalist market, what in the sweet Lord\u2019s name are we stepping into when we enter Amazon.com?\u201d a student at the University of Texas once asked me. \u201cA type of digital fief,\u201d I replied. \u201cA post\u2011capitalist one, whose historical roots remain in feudal Europe.\u201d Under feudalism, the overlord would grant so-called fiefs to subordinates called vassals. These fiefs gave the vassals the formal right to exploit economically a part of the overlord\u2019s realm \u2013 to plant crops on it, for example, or graze cattle \u2013 in exchange for a portion of the produce. The overlord would then unleash his sheriff to police the fief\u2019s operation and collect what he was owed. Jeff\u2019s relationship with the vendors on Amazon is not too dissimilar. He grants them digital fiefs, for a fee, and then leaves his algo-sheriff to police and collect. Amazon was just the start. Alibaba has applied the same techniques to create a similar digital fief in China. Copycat e-commerce platforms, offering variations on the Amazon theme, are springing up everywhere, in the global south as well as the global north. More significantly, other industrial sectors are turning into digital fiefs too. Take for example Tesla, Elon Musk\u2019s electric car company. One reason financiers value it so much more highly than Ford or Toyota is that its cars\u2019 every circuit is wired into the cloud. Besides giving Tesla the power to switch off one of its cars remotely, if for instance the driver fails to service it as the company wishes, merely by driving around Tesla owners are uploading real-time information (including what music they are listening to) that enriches the company\u2019s cloud-based capital. They may not think of themselves as serfs but, alas, that\u2019s precisely what the proud owners of new, wonderfully aerodynamically gleaming Teslas are. It took mind-bending scientific breakthroughs, fantastical-sounding neural networks and imagination-defying AI programs to accomplish what? To turn workers toiling in warehouses, driving cabs and delivering food into digital proles. To create a world where markets are increasingly replaced by digital fiefs. To force businesses into the role of vassals. And to turn all of us into digital serfs, glued to our smartphones and tablets, eagerly producing the capital that keeps our new overlords on cloud nine. Technofeudalism erects great barriers to mobilisation against it. But it also bestows new power on those who dare dream of a way to topple it \u2013 a capacity to build coalitions, organise and take action via the cloud: what I call cloud mobilisation. None of this is either easy or inevitable, but is it harder or less likely than what the miners, the seamstresses and the dockworkers envisioned and sacrificed their lives to achieve in the 19th century? The cloud takes \u2013 but the cloud also gives to those who want to reclaim freedom and democracy. It is up to us to prove which is greater. \u2022 Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism by Yanis Varoufakis is published by Bodley Head (\u00a322).

            "date": "2023-10-03T11:00:12Z",
            "content": "As a Swedish correspondent in the US, I have sometimes braced myself on trips back home for some drastic societal change I\u2019d heard about, only to return home and find that things were in fact exactly as they\u2019d always been. Drivers still followed the little white arrows on the road \u2013 government recommendations for maintaining safe distances between cars and a symbol of Swedish society\u2019s strong adherence to rules and compliance. On the evening news, bureaucrats would have heated debates about such things as infrastructure and highway tolls. Politics was reliably boring; a sure sign of a healthy democracy. But over the past few years, something has genuinely changed. The political discourse is aggressive, focused on the culture wars, and seems stuck in a constant mode of outrage. The shrill vocabulary often seems to be lifted straight from American cable news. Gun violence and gang crime is at record levels \u2013 September was the most violent month for shooting deaths on record \u2013 and has helped stoke a culture of fear and an ever-escalating political blame game over immigration and asylum policies. Dehumanising immigrants is nothing new for Sweden\u2019s nationalists and far-right groups. Now they and rightwing pundits\u2019 attacks have broadened to encompass LGBTQ+ people, journalists, scientists, environmentalists, civil society, gun laws and an alleged cultural elite of educated urbanites failing to protect Swedish values. Bj\u00f6rn S\u00f6der, a member of parliament for the far-right Sweden Democrats who is notorious for insulting Jewish and Sami Swedish people, this year turned his fire on the Stockholm Pride festival, an event that has been uncontroversial for two decades. He accused the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, of \u201clegitimising paedophilia\u201d by participating in the event. As the recently appointed chair of the Swedish delegation of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), S\u00f6der is not a marginal figure. His party is not formally part of the conservative governing coalition, but with 20.5% of the vote in the 2022 general election, the government needs its support to survive \u2013 it in fact directs much of the coalition\u2019s actual policy. The Sweden Democrats\u2019 leader, Jimmie \u00c5kesson, meanwhile, spent most of a debate on national TV recently talking about \u201cinsane\u201d drag queen story hours for children. Another conservative group has launched a campaign against the \u201cbussing\u201d of schoolchildren, framing a debate on education policy in terms that seemed Google-translated from American de-segregation politics of the 1970s. Swedish politics has always looked towards the US. For half a century, rightwing thinktanks and political organisations have sent their smartest strategists across the Atlantic to learn from the US conservative movement. But if I ever ran into a Swedish conservative visiting Washington DC, they were more likely to be on their way to a meeting with libertarian economists at the Cato Institute or an old cold war diplomat at the American Enterprise Institute rather than visiting anti-abortion activists at the Heritage Foundation or fire-breathing nationalists at CPAC. The emphasis was firmly on learning about rightwing economic policies, deregulation and free-market ideas. This changed after Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cStrategists from the Sweden Democrats and the Christian Democrats embarked on countless trips to the US to learn from the Maga conservatives, and many even worked within the Trump campaign,\u201d says Billy McCormac. McCormac is a veteran of the centre-right thinktank Timbro and, like myself, both Swedish and American. He used to call himself a Republican, but now belongs to a generation of Swedish conservatives who are revolted by Trump. They may be a minority. Nationalism and xenophobic populism were certainly not invented in the US. Geert Wilders and France\u2019s Le Pen family were stirring things up against European migrants a decade before Trump. But Trump\u2019s presidency popularised these narratives globally, and emboldened Swedish nationalists to copy-paste the worst aspects of his style. Andreas Johansson Hein\u00f6, a political scientist who also works for Timbro, describes a generational shift. \u201cIntellectuals and ideologues used to join conservative institutions here because of their views on economic policy, tax and the welfare state. Now, there\u2019s a new generation who came into politics precisely because of the culture war, not despite it. Cultural issues are the reasons they became conservatives.\u201d The escalation of political attacks on drag queens, young climate activists, feminists and Muslims is partly a reawakening of older, dormant forms of prejudice and bigotry. But Trump gave angry, resentful reactionaries a playbook to copy. \u201cThe Sweden Democrats looked at the Trump movement to figure out how to harness those emotions politically,\u201d Lisa Pelling, the director of the centre-left thinktank Arena, explains. * * * Recent shifts in public opinion also explain why conservative tacticians see an opportunity in whipping up fears about so-called \u201cSwedish values\u201d under threat. The first is a rightward shift in attitudes towards migration. For several decades, Sweden took pride in its welcoming immigration policy. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Moderate party prime minister, famously left office in 2014 advocating for Swedish citizens to \u201copen your hearts\u201d to refugees. Hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers came to Sweden in the mid-2010s, most of them from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. The country took in the highest per capita number of refugees in the EU in 2015. But amid a proliferation of what Johansson Hein\u00f6 calls \u201cconservative narratives\u201d in the media, and the rise of the Sweden Democrats, the public mood hardened away from multiculturalism. \u201cThis is one of the most significant polling shifts in Swedish history. After the surge of migrants in 2014 and 2015, conservative narratives dominated the discourse, and we saw a very distinct opinion shift,\u201d says Johansson Hein\u00f6. It led to a radical tightening of immigration policies. Gun violence \u2013 which escalated this summer \u2013 has provoked both soul-searching about social exclusion and conservative crime narratives that scapegoat immigrant communities. It is worth noting that unlike elsewhere in Europe, Swedish voters distinguish between the positive economic benefits of immigration and a perceived connection to rising crime and insecurity. The second shift is that Swedes have become significantly more likely to say they want an end to privatisation in healthcare, schools and social services. Seven out of 10 Swedes now want the government to run healthcare, a clear revolt against the austerity and deregulation programmes of the past three decades. As an electoral strategy, the combined parties of the rightwing coalition now believe that they can win by moving the debate away from the economy and the Swedish welfare model, and on to the supposed threat migration poses to Swedish identity and traditional values. The centre-left opposition, meanwhile, is seeking to shift the conversation back to the economy, the welfare state and the number of nurses and teachers. And while this has helped it to its strongest position in polling for years, its silence on migration means the far right\u2019s fearmongering narratives are also given a free pass. Magdalena Andersson, a former Social Democrat prime minister, tells me she thinks the best way to protect marginalised groups is to win elections. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t win elections if the conversation is solely about drag-queen story hours.\u201d As prime minister, Andersson said the country had failed to integrate many of its immigrants, allowing a nation of segregated and \u201cparallel societies\u201d to emerge. The Social Democrats may have believed they could \u201cneutralise\u201d the far right by supporting stricter border controls and decreased immigration. Instead, this shifted the immigration debate irrevocably to the right, says Lisa Pelling. It has allowed the nationalists to advance a more radical agenda on other issues, including advocating for American-style gun laws, attacking LGBTQ+ people and reshaping culture policies around nationalist ideas. There are at least some indications that the combined right may have overreached. A grassroots protest movement recently emerged, with civil society organisations and thousands of citizens rallying against a new law that requires doctors, teachers and a wide range of public sector employees to report the presence of undocumented people even in hospitals or libraries. When this policy was first suggested by the far right, mainstream conservatives dismissed it as the Stasi-style tactics of tyrants and old communist regimes. Now they support it. People refusing to act as informants in a system they see as becoming inherently xenophobic are perhaps the voice of Sweden\u2019s new silent majority, belatedly organising to sustain a tolerant society. In any case, the outcry should be a reminder that culture wars can backfire on those who stoke them. Some Swedish conservatives are asking if it has all gone too far: Magnus Jacobsson, a centre-right member of the Riksdag, recently accused his own side of stoking the fires of xenophobia, blaming immigrants for problems with much more complex roots. But once unleashed, the culture wars rarely retreat from public life. \u201cIt is too easy to dismiss these debates as something that revolves around symbols. They are actually about what kind of society we want to live in,\u201d says Johansson Hein\u00f6. Swedish politics is not as grimly polarised as the US\u2019s yet, but the vitriol that has risen to the surface in recent years is probably here to stay.

            "date": "2023-10-24T21:42:33Z",
            "content": "House Republicans\u2019 long search for a leader is far from over. Tom Emmer, the latest member vying for the speakership, announced he was dropping out of the race just four hours after his peers designated him as a nominee. Like Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan before him, Emmer couldn\u2019t unite House GOP members to back him. His detractors on the far-right cited his stance on same-sex marriage and government spending bills, and his willingness to certify the 2020 election in Congress. In other news: Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer to Donald Trump who was indicted in the Georgia election subversion case, accepted a plea deal from prosecutors. Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, testified that the former president was told repeatedly that his allegations of voting fraud were baseless, according to report from ABC. This is the latest, and perhaps most damning evidence yet in the federal government\u2019s case against Trump . Donald Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, spoke with the special counsel investigating the former president several times, testifying that Trump was told repeatedly that his allegations of voting fraud were baseless, according to ABC. Per ABC, which sites unnamed sources familiar with the matter: The sources said Meadows informed [special counsel Jack] Smith\u2019s team that he repeatedly told Trump in the weeks after the 2020 presidential election that the allegations of significant voting fraud coming to them were baseless, a striking break from Trump\u2019s prolific rhetoric regarding the election. Meadows also told the federal investigators Trump was being \u201cdishonest\u201d with the public when he first claimed to have won the election only hours after polls closed on Nov. 3, 2020, before final results were in. Such testimony would be among the most damning evidence yet in special counsel\u2019s case alleging that Trump tried to unlawfully retain power after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. On Fox Business, far-right representative Marjorie Taylor Greene said she couldn\u2019t support Tom Emmer because he hadn\u2019t supported a ban on trans people serving in the military, and because he supported the \u201cvoting rights \u2026 national voting movement that was completely against what we stand for\u201d. It looks like Tom Emmer is out of the speakership scramble\u2026 Emmer has dropped out of the race, per multiple reports, including the Washington Post, CNN and NBC. The Minnesota congressman is the third Republican speaker nominee since Kevin McCarthy was ousted. Emmer goes the way of representatives Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan, neither of whom was able to unite their party\u2019s far-right and moderate factions to back them. Emmer\u2019s bid lasted just a few hours \u2013 he was nominated by the House GOP at lunchtime. Punchbowl News reports that Republicans are returning to a Capitol complex meeting room for behind-closed-door discussions that could decide whether they move forward with Tom Emmer\u2019s candidacy as speaker: The Minnesota congressman, who, as the party\u2019s whip is the third-highest-ranking Republican in the House, won the GOP nomination for speaker this afternoon, but now faces opposition from perhaps 26 of his counterparts \u2013 which means defeat in a floor vote. We\u2019ll be looking out for details on what Republicans decide at this meeting. Earlier in the day, House Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar weighed in on congressman Dean Phillips\u2019s attempt to make a deal with Republicans. The Minnesota Democrat had suggested he would be willing to vote \u201cpresent\u201d and lower the threshold for Republican Tom Emmer to win election as speaker on the House floor in exchange for policy concessions around aid to Ukraine and Israel, among other things. That would represent a break from Democrats\u2019 tactics ever since Kevin McCarthy was ousted, which have generally involved sitting back and doing nothing while the GOP fights among themselves. But with perhaps 26 Republicans willing to oppose his candidacy as speaker, it would not be enough to save Emmer, and Aguilar made clear the rest of the party is not on board. Here are his comments: The ranks of Tom Emmer\u2019s detractors appear to be growing. Rightwing Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna is not among those reported to have voted against Emmer behind closed doors, but now says she would oppose him on the House floor: That could mean his opponents number 27, which would guarantee his defeat. Wondering who exactly is this Tom Emmer fellow, emerged from the (figurative) wilds of Minnesota to be the latest Republican congressman (all men, so far) to attempt to grasp and keep hold of the gavel of the speaker of the US House? Let the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine enlighten you: The Minnesota congressman Tom Emmer will now be the third party leader to try to galvanize enough support among Republicans after Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio failed in their bids to be House speaker. It remains unclear if Emmer will be able to get the 217 votes he needs to be speaker, but \u2013 for the moment at least \u2013 he is in the center of the ongoing crisis gripping the party and causing chaos in the heart of US government. Emmer was elected to Congress in 2014, replacing Michele Bachmann, a far-right figutr who was one of the earliest Tea Party stars. When he initially ran to replace her, he was described as \u201cBachmann 2.0\u201d, by the left-leaning Mother Jones magazine, but after he was elected he said he would be more low key. Emmer represents Minnesota\u2019s sixth congressional district, which includes a partial ring of Minneapolis suburbs and extends north-west from the city. The district is solidly conservative: Donald Trump carried it in 2020 by more than 17 points. Emmer broke with many of his Republican colleagues and voted to certify the 2020 election. \u201cSimply put, Congress does not have the authority to discard an individual slate of electors certified by a state\u2019s legislature in accordance with their constitution,\u201d he said. He did, however, sign on to a brief at the supreme court urging the justices to throw out the electoral votes from key swing states and suggested there may have been fraud as he supported Trump\u2019s legal challenges to the election results, CNN reported. Read on here: Courtesy of Politico, here is a full list of all of Tom Emmer\u2019s opponents among the House GOP, and who they voted for. As you can see, many cast ballots for Jim Jordan, a prominent rightwing lawmaker and 2020 election denier who last week abandoned his bid for speaker after concluding he could not win a floor vote: CNN, meanwhile, heard from Indiana\u2019s Jim Banks, who had no problems pillorying Emmer: Tom Emmer\u2019s issues with Donald Trump and his allies are well known, and it appeared the Minnesota congressman had moved to address them. While campaigning in New Hampshire yesterday, the former president batted away a question about whether he was opposed to Emmer becoming speaker \u2013 video of which was posted by the congressman, as a sign he had Trump\u2019s support: It was apparently all for naught, since Trump has now put out a strongly worded statement against Emmer. Politico had a good rundown over the weekend of why Trump is opposed to Emmer, who is notable for not supporting attempts to certify election results in swing states that voted for Joe Biden in 2020, as some of the other speaker candidates had. Here\u2019s more from Politico: The former president\u2019s top allies are already working to thwart Emmer\u2019s candidacy. Trump supporters have begun passing around opposition research on the congressmember, and the pro-Trump \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast on Friday afternoon turned into an Emmer bash-fest. During an appearance on the program, top Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn noted that Emmer had yet to endorse Trump in the Republican presidential primary. \u201cIf somebody is so out of step with where the Republican electorate is, where the MAGA movement is, how can they even be in the conversation?\u201d Epshteyn said. \u201cWe need a MAGA speaker. That\u2019s what it comes down to. Because if you look at the numbers, if you look at the energy, if you look at the heat, this is the Trump party, this is the MAGA party. It is no longer the old-school khaki establishment Republican Party.\u201d Steve Bannon, a former Trump White House adviser and the \u201cWar Room\u201d host, chimed in to call Emmer a \u201cTrump hater.\u201d Others close to Trump said Emmer as speaker would open a breach between House Republicans and their likely presidential nominee. Emmer \u201chas no relationship with Trump,\u201d one adviser said. And \u2026 Donald Trump hath spoken. And \u2026 he isn\u2019t a fan of Tom Emmer, the current choice of the Republican party to be speaker of the US House. I have many wonderful friends wanting to be Speaker of the House, and some are truly great Warriors. RINO Tom Emmer, who I do not know well, is not one of them. He never respected the Power of a Trump Endorsement, or the breadth and scope of MAGA \u2013 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! He fought me all the way, and actually spent more time defending Ilhan Omar, than he did me\u2014He is totally out-of-touch with Republican Voters. I believe he has now learned his lesson, because he is saying that he is Pro-Trump all the way, but who can ever be sure? Has he only changed because that\u2019s what it takes to win? The Republican Party cannot take that chance, because that\u2019s not where the America First Voters are. Voting for a Globalist RINO like Tom Emmer would be a tragic mistake! That word salad brought to you by Truth Social, of course. Whether Emmer has \u201cfought Trump all the way\u201d or not is, to put it mildly, doubtful. He didn\u2019t vote to overturn the 2020 election but he did sign on to a lawsuit seeking to throw out results, and so forth. Ilhan Omar, meanwhile, is a Democratic representative from Minnesota \u2013 Emmer\u2019s state \u2013 a migrant from Somalia, both one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress and a leading progressive, part of a so-called \u201cSquad\u201d of left-leaning Democratic women. In July 2019, a crowd at a Trump rally in North Carolina targeted Omar with chants of \u201csend her back\u201d. Amid condemnation (Omar said: \u201cI believe [Trump] is fascist\u201d), Emmer said: \u201cI didn\u2019t watch the rally last night, sorry, but there\u2019s no place for that kind of talk. I don\u2019t agree with it.\u201d Trump \u2013 who at the time said himself he was \u201cnot happy\u201d with the crowd and claimed to have tried to stop the chants \u2013 may now wish to consider that in the same session with reporters, Emmer both said he didn\u2019t think Trump had a \u201cracist bone\u201d in his body, and tried to explain Trump\u2019s attacks on Omar. \u201cWhat he was trying to say he said wrong,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cWhat he was trying to say is that if you don\u2019t appreciate this country you don\u2019t have to be here. It has nothing to do with your race or gender, or your family history. It has to do with respecting and loving the country that is giving you the opportunities that you have. \u201cI had somebody say to me recently: \u2018You know when Ilhan talks, Ilhan makes it look like she lets people believe she hates America.\u2019 Now I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but as somebody said to me back at home, they said to me: \u2018How about a little gratitude with that attitude?\u2019\u201d Sidney Blumenthal\u2019s Guardian column today \u2013 on the short-lived candidacy for speaker of Jim Jordan, the end of which precipitated today\u2019s votes and the rise of Tom Emmer \u2013 is worth your time, starting from the opening lines about the necessity of counting votes and proceeding through Jordan\u2019s unique political career: Jim Jordan\u2019s march to seize the Capitol began as a beer hall putsch but veered into Sesame Street. Vote after vote, he has missed the sagacity of the Count, the puppet Dracula who teaches children the number of the day. Former speaker Nancy Pelosi wryly remarked that the Republicans should \u201ctake a lesson in mathematics and learning how to count\u201d. After the second round, Jordan threw in the towel from his stool in the corner: no m\u00e1s! He endorsed instead extending the tenure and power of Patrick McHenry, the speaker pro tempore, until someone could figure something else out. But Jim Jordan the consensus builder was a short-lived phenomenon. The spirit of violence swirled around him. Read on: Steve Scalise, the majority leader, emerges to talk about the talks (and discuss the discussions) going on behind closed doors. Speaking to reporters at the Capitol, Scalise, of Louisiana and a previous candidate for speaker, says of the 20 or more holdouts against Emmer: \u201cThere\u2019s some conversations, some are moving.\u201d From the top: \u201cFirst of all, I want to congratulate Tom Emmer on being selected our speaker designate with strong support. We are working right now through some questions still and we just continue our conversations. \u201cObviously we want to work to make sure when we get to the floor we have 217 [votes, to make Emmer speaker] and that\u2019s something that Tom has said he wants to do before we go to the floor. So we\u2019re gonna have some more conversations, but this is an ongoing process. We like to wrap this up today, but we\u2019re still talking to some individual members.\u201d Asked about the likelihood of Emmer (from Minnesota) making it to the floor today, Scalise says: \u201cThere\u2019s some conversations, some are moving. You got to continue having these conversations. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d Emmer, Scalise says, is \u201chearing everybody in those conversations going on as we speak. So that\u2019s the first thing that Tom\u2019s doing, is hearing people out, and that\u2019s what, frankly, this whole process has been about. And so he\u2019s got to hear people out. Ultimately, work to to move them over. And we\u2019ve got to keep working until we get to 217. And I\u2019m gonna do what I can to help Tom.\u201d Matt Gaetz of Florida, who started this whole mess by prompting the ejection of Kevin McCarthy, then appears and stalks off, followed by the media scrum. Some reading to pass the time while we wait for Tom Emmer to speak \u2013 or not \u2013 concerning the last person to actually be speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and his relationships with Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the two anti-Trump Republicans who sat on the House January 6 committee and subsequently left Congress, Cheney defeated in Wyoming and Kinzinger retired in Illinois. Kinzinger will next week publish a book: Renegade: Defending Democracy and Liberty in Our Divided Country. Inside, he says McCarthy dismissed Cheney\u2019s warning about January 6 on a party conference call five days before. Kinzinger also details two occasions on which, he says, McCarthy shoulder-checked him, physically, in the House chamber. Those moments, Kinzinger says, made him think: \u201cWhat a child.\u2019\u201d In a passage written before McCarthy\u2019s historic ejection by Matt Gaetz of Florida, the catalyst for the current mess, Kinzinger adds: \u201cI just chalked it up to the immature behaviour that [McCarthy] favoured and that had become more and more common inside the chamber.\u201d Full story: House Republicans have nominated Tom Emmer to become the next speaker of Congress\u2019s lower chamber, but their long search for leadership is far from over. As many as 26 members of the party signaled they will not vote for him on the floor, more than enough to sink his candidacy. This is the exact same position Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan found themselves in, and highlights just how disunited the GOP has become and what an absolute mess that ouster of Kevin McCarthy created. Emmer has reportedly vowed to continue polling Republicans behind closed doors until he gets the support he needs to win. We\u2019ll see what becomes of that. Here\u2019s a rundown of today\u2019s news so far: Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer to Donald Trump who was indicted in the Georgia election subversion case, accepted a plea deal from prosecutors. Emmer\u2019s detractors cite his stance on same-sex marriage and on government spending bills. Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman who is mulling challenging Joe Biden in the primary, said he would be willing to vote \u201cpresent\u201d when Emmer\u2019s nomination is considered in exchange for policy concessions. Tom Emmer is pressing on in the face of the significant GOP opposition to his candidacy for speaker. CNN reports that he wants to continue holding roll call votes behind closed doors until he has the numbers he needs to win. But if he is not successful, congressman David Joyce says he will offer a resolution to give acting speaker Patrick McHenry the full powers of the job. Joyce made the same proposal last week, when Jim Jordan\u2019s candidacy was flailing: Up to 26 Republicans may oppose Tom Emmer becoming speaker of the House, enough to stop him from getting the gavel, Punchbowl News reports: Assuming all Democrats vote against him, Emmer can only afford to lose four of the 221 Republicans in the House \u2013 a goal he appears to be well short of. The nominees who came before him, Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan, faced the same problem, and ultimately had to drop out. House Republicans have not yet announced when they will convene the chamber to hold a floor vote on making Emmer speaker. CNN reports that Tom Emmer may have as many as 10 objectors to his candidacy for speaker \u2013 enough to torpedo his bid: Scott Perry, a prominent rightwing lawmaker, seemed to take issue with Emmer\u2019s votes on government spending bills, and he may not be alone: The House GOP\u2019s behind-closed-doors nominating meeting is not over yet. CNN reports that Tom Emmer has asked for a vote to determine how many members would actually support him on the floor: Recall that the party\u2019s first nominee to replace Kevin McCarthy, GOP majority leader Steve Scalise, dropped out after concluding he would not win a floor vote. Their second nominee, Jim Jordan, withdrew after losing three floor votes. Emmer seems to be trying to avoid their fates. Tom Emmer may have won the majority vote necessary to get the GOP nomination, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll be elected speaker. Ever since Kevin McCarthy was booted from the office three weeks ago, Republicans have been mired in deep disarray, and two other earlier speaker nominees, Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan, gave up in the face of opposition they determined was insurmountable. To become speaker, Emmer will need 217 votes in the House. Democrats are not expected to vote for him, so all his support must come from Republicans, and he can only lose four votes. Below, you can see Politico\u2019s rundown of his final vote tally. As you can see, the choice was far from unanimous, and it\u2019s an open question whether the lawmakers who did not support Emmer will get behind him when his nomination goes to the House floor: House Republicans have nominated Minnesota lawmaker and party whip Tom Emmer as their next speaker, GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik just announced: It\u2019s unclear if Emmer can win the 217 votes needed to claim the speaker\u2019s gavel. The fifth round of voting in the House GOP\u2019s nomination process for speaker has begun, pitting whip Tom Emmer against Mike Johnson, the conference vice-chair: Per CNN, Oklahoma\u2019s Kevin Hern and Florida\u2019s Byron Donalds both dropped out after the fourth ballot: Last year, Tom Emmer was among 47 House Republicans to vote for the Respect for Marriage Act, which protects same-sex marriage nationwide. It appears that choice may be coming around to hurt his chances of becoming House speaker. Georgia congressman Rick Allen told CNN that Emmer\u2019s vote was a reason he could not support his candidacy: House GOP whip Tom Emmer once again led the third ballot, picking up 10 votes from the previous round, Punchbowl News reports: He still lacks the majority needed to clinch the party\u2019s nomination. The field of GOP aspirants is now down to four, conference chair Elise Stefanik announces: Georgia lawmaker Austin Scott was dropped after the third round of balloting. We will tell you what the vote totals were in that round once we know. Per Politico, here is a breakdown of the voting in the second round of balloting for the Republican speaker nomination. As you can see, the GOP whip Tom Emmer won the most votes, but has plenty of opposition: In second place is Louisiana\u2019s Mike Johnson, the vice-chair of the Republican conference, and coming in third is Byron Donalds, a prominent Donald Trump ally. Now we are on to the third ballot, per conference chair Elise Stefanik, and it appears Michigan\u2019s Jack Bergman has been dropped after receiving the fewest votes: Per the Hill, here\u2019s a breakdown of the full vote totals from the first ballot: As you can see, Tom Emmer received the most votes, but other candidates received more votes overall. It\u2019s a secret ballot, so members don\u2019t necessarily know each other\u2019s choice, but we\u2019ll see if Emmer picked up more support from other candidates in the second round of balloting. Minnesota\u2019s Tom Emmer, the third-highest-ranking Republican in the House, has received the most votes in the first round of balloting for the party\u2019s candidate for speaker, a Republican source confirms. Republicans are moving on to the second round of voting, per conference chair Elise Stefanik. Texas\u2019s Pete Sessions is no longer on the ballot, indicating he received the fewest votes in the previous election: Democratic Whip Katherine Clark\u2019s has just notified lawmakers \u201cthat votes related to the election of the Speaker are possible today.\u201d \u201cAdditional information about the vote schedule will be announced as soon as it becomes available,\u201d she added. Democrats aren\u2019t involved in the internal Republican election for the party\u2019s speaker candidate, and thus just have to ensure their members are ready to report to the House floor in case the GOP picks a candidate and decides to hold the floor vote necessary for their confirmation. The House is scheduled to gavel into sessions at 11am today, and then immediately go into recess, Clark\u2019s office added. Back in the House, Republicans are now voting in the first ballot to choose their nominee for speaker, according to conference chair Elise Stefanik: As we wait to learn who Republicans will nominate next to be speaker of the House, there\u2019s been some news in the many legal entanglements of Donald Trump. Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Trump who was indicted along with him and 17 others for trying to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia, has accepted a plea deal to resolve her charges. Here\u2019s what we know about that: Republicans have convened a behind-closed-doors meeting to select their latest nominee for speaker of the House. Just as the meeting kicked off, Alabama\u2019s Gary Palmer announced he was dropping out of the contest, bringing the field to seven candidates: House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik also revealed who would be giving the nominating speeches for the eight speaker candidates: The House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik has laid out a schedule for the party\u2019s upcoming vote to determine its nominee for speaker: A Republican source told the Guardian\u2019s US politics live blog the eight candidates will each get three minutes to make a nominating speech before voting begins. As Republicans in the House have grappled with a historic bout of disarray, Democrats have sat back and watched, saying they wouldn\u2019t help the GOP elect a speaker without concessions. And, for a while, the GOP appeared in no mood to collaborate. The conference last week nominated Jim Jordan to be their speaker candidate, an Ohio lawmaker who made a name for himself defending Donald Trump, promoting his lies about the 2020 election and carrying out relentless investigations of Joe Biden. Democrats condemned him as an insurrectionist during his three unsuccessful floor votes, which led Jordan to drop out of the race. As the GOP gears up to nominate its third candidate for speaker, one Democrat has broken ranks to say they would be open to collaborating with the GOP to elect a leader for Congress\u2019s lower chamber, but only with conditions. That\u2019s Minnesota\u2019s Dean Phillips, who is already on thin ice with some in his party for reportedly mulling a run against Biden: Any Republican speaker candidate who accepts aid from the Democrats does so at their peril, as many in the GOP have made clear that\u2019s a red line for them. It\u2019s now been three weeks to the day since rightwing Republicans and Democrats forced out Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, and the chamber\u2019s GOP majority still hasn\u2019t been able to find a replacement. The party is riven with factionalism and grievance, and two of their nominees for the post, Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan, have dropped out in the face of opposition they realized was unyielding. This morning at 9am eastern time, the House Republican Conference is expected to begin voting on who should be their latest nominee for speaker. There are now eight candidates running after Pennsylvania lawmaker Dan Meuser quit the race yesterday, but there\u2019s no telling if any of them can get the 217 votes necessary to win a floor vote. Tom Emmer, the third-highest-ranking Republican in the House, appears to be a frontrunner, but he\u2019s unpopular with Donald Trump\u2019s acolytes, and that may be enough to sink him. Other candidates to watch are Florida\u2019s Byron Donalds, who is Trump-aligned, relatively inexperienced, and would be the first Black speaker, and Oklahoma\u2019s Kevin Hern, who leads the large and influential Republican Study Committee. The vote is being held behind closed doors, but the House GOP is a leaky bunch, and we\u2019ll let you know what we hear. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: Joe Biden will this evening at 6pm ET welcome Australia\u2019s prime minister Anthony Albanese to the White House. Republican presidential aspirants are campaigning with vigor, with Tim Scott shaking hands at a variety of places in Iowa, Vivek Ramaswamy addressing the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington DC and Ron DeSantis holding a town hall with New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu. Israel says it is \u201cready and determined\u201d to continue its war against Hamas, as the death toll in the enclave hit 5,700. Follow our live blog for the latest on the conflict."

And, yes, I reach for my cafetiere first thing in the morning. Chakrabortty argues that Starmer does not really know where he stands. I\u2019d argue that Labour\u2019s language, rooted in aspiration and the notion of the \u201cclass ceiling\u201d, suggests otherwise; that being working class is not something that you celebrate, but that you leave behind. It celebrates those, like Starmer and me, who have moved out. In a society in which full-time work fails to pay the bills for a growing number of people, and with social mobility increasingly dependent on inheritance, it\u2019s not an approach that can begin to address our huge inequalities. Neil Schofield-Hughes Cardiff \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty suggests that the Labour party is offering workers \u201clittle more than spare change\u201d. This is patent nonsense. It makes the assumption that the working class are sheep to be herded by any passing leftwing shepherd. In fact \u2013 clearly shown by the so-called red wall constituency debacle of 2019 \u2013 the reality is that they can discern what policies and personalities they trust and will vote accordingly. The Labour party is committed to assembling a broad coalition of interests to secure a mandate for radical change at the next election.

            "date": "2023-10-25T09:00:01Z",
            "content": "Nearly one in four Americans believe that political violence may be justified to \u201csave\u201d the country, a national opinion poll has found. The 14th annual American Values Survey, carried out by the non-profit Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) in partnership with the Brookings Institution thinktank, offers a snapshot of America\u2019s deepening polarisation and willingness to contemplate taking up arms. Even as Joe Biden has sought to lower the temperature, support for political violence has increased over the past two years, the survey shows. Today about 23% of Americans agree that \u201cbecause things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country\u201d \u2013 up from 15% in 2021. The PRRI has asked this question in eight separate surveys since March 2021 but this is the first time that support for political violence has risen above 20% in the general population. One in three Republicans believe that \u201ctrue American patriots\u201d may have to resort to violence to save the country, compared with 22% of independents and 13% of Democrats \u2013 all representing increases since 2021. Almost one in three white evangelical Protestants believe that patriots may have to resort to political violence to save the country, markedly higher than any other religious group. Support for political violence jumps to even higher levels among Americans who believe that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump (46%); Americans who hold a favourable view of Trump (41%); Americans who believe in the so-called \u201creplacement theory\u201d (41%); Americans who affirm the core tenet of white Christian nationalism, that God intended America to be a new promised land for European Christians (39%). \u201cThe political temperature in America is rising, and this year\u2019s American Values Survey results reflect that reality,\u201d said PRRI\u2019s president and founder, Robert P Jones. \u201cOur last presidential election was the first in our history without a peaceful transfer of power. With flashes of political violence continuing among us, and the 2024 election on the horizon, we should be deeply concerned about the growing number of Americans who express openness to political violence.\u201d Trump, facing 91 criminal charges in four jurisdictions, has used ever more violent rhetoric in recent months, prompting warnings that such discourse is becoming normalised. The former president falsely claimed the former joint chiefs of staff chairman Gen Mark Milley committed \u201ctreason\u201d and suggested he be executed, called for police to shoot shoplifters on sight and claimed that migrants illegally crossing the southern border are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d. Trump, who denies without evidence that he lost the 2020 election, is the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. The PRRI study found three in four Americans say the future of democracy is at risk in next year\u2019s election. Democrats (84%) are most likely to hold this view but 77% of Republicans and 73% of independents also agree. PRRI has also been tracking the QAnon conspiracy movement since 2021. Across party lines there has been a significant increase in QAnon believers (from 14% to 23%) and a decrease in QAnon rejecters (from 40% to 29%). Republicans remain twice as likely as Democrats to be QAnon believers (29% v 14%) and are three times less likely to be QAnon rejecters (14% v 43%). The survey was conducted among a representative sample of 2,525 adults living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Interviews were conducted online between 25 and 30 August."

            "date": "2023-10-06T09:48:21Z",
            "content": "Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, had used the word \u201cearthquake\u201d last week to foreshadow Labour\u2019s remarkable victory in Rutherglen and Hamilton West, where its winning margin of 30 percentage points exceeded even its predictions. He did it cheekily, stealing one of the favourite lines often used by the former Scottish National party leader Alex Salmond when the nationalists were crushing Labour at repeated elections in the past. That theft of Salmond\u2019s phrase has additional resonance. It points to a change in Scottish political alignments that spells danger for the SNP and its current leader, Humza Yousaf. Labour won with a crushing 58.6% vote share by shifting itself rightwards, moving much closer to the political centre in Scotland. That positioning was key to Salmond\u2019s victories in the run-up to 2014, when he won and held power by freezing council taxes and small business rates, and introducing free university tuition. This time, Labour attacked the SNP for allowing councils to raise council tax rates, for a congestion charge mooted by SNP councillors to enter neighbouring Glasgow (ignoring the implicit rejection of Labour\u2019s support for London\u2019s congestion charge), and for suggestions income tax might go up again. It attacked Yousaf\u2019s government, shackled with 16 years of incumbency and mounting crises in public services. It campaigned very much in the mould set by Keir Starmer\u2019s middle-ground strategy, repudiating the party\u2019s own recent support for targeted tax rises, pulling in Tory and Liberal Democrat voters, too, and those who in previous years backed the SNP. Those are the \u201csuburban strivers\u201d who often live in Scotland\u2019s urban new towns and 16 years ago switched to the SNP under Salmond. They became a target demographic for Labour. The Conservative share of the vote fell by 11.1 percentage points and the Lib Dems by 2.3. Both lost their deposits. This was evidence of tactical voting to reject the incumbent government, typical in byelections. It was also perhaps revenge against Margaret Ferrier, the former SNP MP whose decision in 2020 to travel by train to London and to visit shops in the seat while suspecting she was ill with Covid triggered this contest. However, this result reinforces analysis by the Scottish Election Study that Labour\u2019s reputation in Scotland has changed. It is now, in essence, the least disliked party; it attracts voters from the other major parties in a way it failed to do a decade ago. Key, too, was Labour\u2019s desire to win. Its byelection campaign in effect began on 30 March when MPs recommended Ferrier serve a 30-day suspension. When her appeal was eventually dismissed, that suspension triggered the first recall petition in a Scottish Westminster seat. Since then, UK Labour had invested heavily in resources and expertise for this contest. It turbo-charged the recall petition, delivering leaflets and door-knocking, while pump-priming its byelection campaign. It visited 80,000 homes and spoke to 30,000 voters; Michael Shanks, its winning candidate, claims to have spoken to 20,000 voters. That exposed the SNP\u2019s greatest problem: it is in dire financial straits, scrabbling for money and with the least experienced party leadership in Scotland. Some weeks ago, unable to muster enough activists, it had to hire a courier firm to deliver campaign leaflets. A result of this magnitude has greatly boosted Labour\u2019s hopes it can retake dozens of other Scottish seats \u2013 but even so, it is unlikely to assume it can repeat a 20-point swing across Scotland in the general election. Rutherglen and Hamilton West has long been a Labour-SNP marginal and in a seat traditionally known for high turnouts, only 37.2% of voters came out. There was bad weather on Thursday, certainly, but there was also voter apathy and antagonism towards mainstream politics, driven by Conservative turmoil at a UK level, the cost of living crisis and the open divisions within the SNP. Many SNP sympathisers stayed at home \u2013 a point that poses further challenges for Yousaf. This result will be used by increasingly vocal internal critics to confirm their claims he is insubstantial and too centre-left to protect their seats and the SNP\u2019s dominance. He does not have the authority or the power of Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, and has been unable to enforce discipline among SNP backbenchers. Rebellions over the Holyrood alliance with the Scottish Greens brokered by Sturgeon are gathering strength. Many are rallying around Yousaf\u2019s leadership rival Kate Forbes, his most likely successor. The scale and manner of Labour\u2019s victory in Rutherglen and Hamilton West could well increase the fears of SNP MPs in other vulnerable central belt seats that they face defeat while Yousaf remains in charge. That suggests his first SNP national conference as party leader, due to start in nine days\u2019 time in Aberdeen, will be tense and rebellious. In contrast, Starmer will be delighted as he goes into Labour\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool on Sunday. Shanks, the party\u2019s newest MP, will be paraded on the main stage to rapturous applause from delegates."

The photograph of Daniel Duggan with his kids outside their country New South Wales school captured one of his last moments of freedom. \u201cThat (cake photo) is the last photo of Dan with us,\u201d his wife, Saffrine, said, ahead of Saturday, the day which marks a year since her husband was arrested. \u201cEvery photo that I take or have since, there is one massive hole in our family \u2013 their father and my husband.\u201d In the year since the naturalised Australian citizen was arrested in a supermarket car park in Orange at the request of US authorities, his family has found themselves battling two governments in court, complex federal law, and arcane secrecy provisions in their bid to bring the father-of-six home. \u201cPeople ask me how I\u2019m going and I burst into tears,\u201d Saffrine Duggan said. \u201cI can\u2019t even put words to my real extent of emotions to how deep the hurt and horror really is.\u201d Duggan, a former US military pilot who became an Australian citizen in 2012, is accused of breaching US arms trafficking laws by training Chinese military pilots while working at a flight school more than a decade ago. Duggan has consistently denied the allegation. But if convicted, he faces up to 60 years in prison. The 55-year-old has been held in maximum-security prisons since his arrest: in March he was moved to Lithgow prison, detained in a two-by-four-metre cell. He is permitted out into an exercise yard daily but has little-to-no human contact besides phone calls home that drop out every 10 minutes, Saffrine Duggan said. The family also visits each Sunday for one hour, driving 90 minutes from the family farm. \u201cWe feel that it\u2019s been an act of violence and cruelty on our family to take away a beautiful man, my husband, under allegations that are clearly political, that we flatly deny, are unproven and are 12 years old,\u201d Saffrine Duggan said. \u201cWe can\u2019t believe our government has allowed this to happen.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup She holds hope his case could be raised when the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, meets with US president Joe Biden and other officials during a state visit next week. Any agreement for extradition to the US must be approved by the federal government, specifically the attorney general. \u201cI ask the prime minister to deliver a message \u2026 that he will not support the extradition of my husband,\u201d Saffrine Duggan said. \u201cHe belongs with us, in Australia.\u201d US-born Duggan served more than a decade flying in the US Marine Corps, rising to the rank of major and working as a military tactical flight instructor. He left the marines in 2002 and moved to Australia, becoming an Australian citizen in 2012 and renouncing his US citizenship in 2017. He has lived in Australia and China since leaving the marines. A 2017 US grand jury indictment, unsealed last December, alleges Duggan trained Chinese fighter pilots to land fighter jets on aircraft carriers, in defiance of arms trafficking laws, and engaged in a conspiracy to launder money. The indictment details payments Duggan allegedly received in 2011 and 2012 for his work training Chinese fighter pilots at a test flight academy \u201cbased in South Africa, with a presence in the People\u2019s Republic of China\u201d. He rejects the charges against him as being politically motivated and says the indictment against him is filled with \u201chalf-truths, falsehoods and gross embellishments\u201d. Duggan\u2019s legal team has maintained the US extradition request is politically motivated, catalysed by the US\u2019s deepening geopolitical contest with China. Australia\u2019s extradition treaty with the US states that extradition requests should be refused if they are for an alleged \u201cpolitical offence\u201d. They have written to the Australian parliament\u2019s treaties committee arguing Australia\u2019s extradition treaty with the US exposes Australians to being unlawfully lured back to the country so they can be arrested. They argue he was effectively lured back to Australia from China. Prior to his return, Duggan was granted a security clearance by Asio, a requirement for him to obtain an aviation licence. But a few days after his arrival in Australia the clearance was removed, and he was subsequently arrested. Lures or other subterfuges are legal in the US, but not in Australia. \u201cWhilst these \u2018tactics\u2019 are plainly unlawful under Australia\u2019s domestic legal order, the treaty in its present form self-evidently fails to protect Australian citizens from the US using these techniques against them,\u201d a submission to the treaties committee states. The extradition battle returns to court Monday morning, when Duggan\u2019s legal team is expected to ask to postpone a full hearing."

Passengers on the Japanese flight were charged \u00a530,000 each (US$200), sparking anger on X, formerly known as Twitter, with some users accusing the government of being \u201cstingy\u201d. The South Korean government, by contrast, did not charge 51 Japanese nationals who boarded its flight \u2013 along with 163 South Koreans and six Singaporeans \u2013 from Israel to Seoul on Saturday. Kenta Izumi, head of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party, was similarly critical: \u201cA Japanese government-chartered plane arrived in Dubai with eight Japanese on board for a fee,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThe South Korean government transport plane carried not only South Koreans but also 51 Japanese, and arrived in South Korea, and for free.\u201d The Mainichi Shimbun said the tiny number of people aboard the Japanese flight had taken foreign ministry officials by surprise. \u201cWe hurried to avoid Japan being accused of responding too slowly, but with only eight people on board, it backfired on us,\u201d the newspaper quoted a source close to the ministry as saying. But another official defended the evacuation, saying the quickly changing situation in the Middle East meant the government wanted to fly its citizens out of Israel as soon as possible. \u201cThe purpose of evacuating Japanese nationals was to get them out of the country, not to get them back to Japan,\u201d the official told the Mainichi. \u201cWe are glad we did it, even with eight people.\u201d About 1,200 Japanese nationals were in Israel and Palestinian territories before the conflict broke out, and 1,000 were still there as of Saturday, the Kyodo news agency reported. AFP: Several hundred people protested in Tripoli and other Libyan cities late Tuesday over the deadly blast at a Gaza hospital, according to AFP journalists. In Tripoli, hundreds of demonstrators of all ages, brandishing Palestinian flags and some covering their faces with Palestinian keffiyehs, crisscrossed the streets of the city centre before converging on Martyrs\u2019 Square. They chanted slogans of support for the residents of Gaza and denounced the strike by the \u201cZionist enemy\u201d. \u201cWe give our blood and our souls for Gaza,\u201d they chanted in Tripoli and similarly in Misrata, a city 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of the capital. The Israeli army said the explosion was a rocket misfired by the Gaza-based militant group Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas. Earlier, Abdulhamid Dbeibah, the prime minister of Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based internationally recognised government, condemned the hospital blast, calling it a \u201cdespicable crime\u201d. \u201cWe denounce this crime which exceeded all limits, and I call on all countries of the world and the great powers in particular, to put an end to these crimes and to open corridors to bring humanitarian aid into the besieged sector,\u201d he said on X, formerly Twitter, late Tuesday. \u201cTargeting medical and civilian facilities is a war crime. This aggression must stop,\u201d he said. Wednesday\u2019s Today in Focus episode is about the growing expectations that Israel will soon launch a ground assault on Gaza and the growing fears about what a ground invasion could mean for the trapped civilians: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will arrive in Cairo on Thursday, focused on reopening the Gaza border to allow in desperately needed aid for millions of Palestinians. UN spokespersonStephane Dujarric, who made the announcement Tuesday, said the secretary-general will engage with Egyptian leaders including President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and speak at an international conference on Saturday hosted by the president. \u201cThis situation is becoming more than critical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at a time of extreme tension, where we\u2019re calling to move away from further escalation and any possible miscalculation.\u201d The US State Department has raised its travel alert for Lebanon to \u201cdo not travel,\u201d citing the security situation related to rocket, missile, and artillery exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah, Reuters reports. The State Department authorised the voluntary, temporary departure of family members of US government personnel and some non-emergency personnel from the US Embassy in Beirut because of the unpredictable security situation in Lebanon. Protests took place outside the US embassy near Beirut on Tuesday night and into the early hours of Wednesday following the blast at al-Ahli al-Arabi hopsital in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians. Reuters: Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said there were patients, healthcare workers and internally displaced people in the al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital when it was struck. \u201cThe hospital was one of 20 in the north of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from the Israeli military,\u201d he said. \u201cThe order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, and lack of ambulances, staff, health system bed capacity, and alternative shelter for those displaced,\u201d he added. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme, said it was \u201cinhumane\u201d to leave Gaza\u2019s health workers with the dilemma of caring for their patients or fleeing to save their own lives. He said doctors and nurses were choosing their patients over themselves. \u201cIt is absolutely clear to all sides of this conflict where the health facilities are,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt is absolutely clear healthcare is not a target... That is enshrined in international humanitarian law. And we\u2019re seeing this breached again and again and again over the last week. And it has to stop. It must stop.\u201d \u201cThis attack is unprecedented in scale,\u201d Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the West Bank and Gaza, told Reuters. \u201cWe have seen consistent attacks on healthcare in the occupied Palestinian territory,\u201d he said. Peeperkorn said there so far have been 51 attacks against healthcare facilities in Gaza, with 15 health workers killed and 27 injured. The Israeli military blamed the al-Ahli al-Arabi blast on a failed rocket launch by a Palestinian militant group. The deadly blast has upended US diplomatic efforts aimed at fending off the humanitarian disaster in Gaza and thrown a dark shadow over president Joe Biden\u2019s imminent visit to the region. It was hoped that Biden\u2019s trip to Israel would help to rein in reprisal attacks on Hamas in Gaza, which has been under constant bombardment while running out of water, food and medical supplies. The UN says more than 3,000 Palestinians have died in the days since the Hamas attack. Protests broke out across the West Bank after the hospital blast, and in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, demonstrators threw rocks at the Palestinian security forces who fired on the crowds with stun grenades. The outpouring of anger against Israel also fuelled a large rally on Tuesday near the Israeli embassy in Amman, Jordan, where police used teargas to disperse several thousand protesters who chanted slogans in support of Hamas and demanded the government close the embassy and scrap a peace treaty with Israel. Jordan\u2019s peace treaty with Israel is widely unpopular among many citizens. Entire neighbourhoods have been razed in Gaza and survivors are left with dwindling supplies of food, water and fuel. The health ministry in Gaza said hospitals are at breaking point, with more than 30,000 people taking shelter at the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City alone. It said it was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about disease outbreaks due to poor water supply and sanitation. \u201cThere are corpses in the streets. Buildings are crashing down on their inhabitants,\u201d Jamil Abdullah, a Palestinian-Swede, who was hoping to flee the blockaded enclave, told AFP. \u201cThe smell of the dead is everywhere.\u201d AFP has spoken to a doctor working for Doctors Without Borders. In chaotic scenes after the blast, those injured were taken from the al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital in ambulances to other medical centres nearby, while medics and civilians covered rows of the dead in white plastic sheets or blankets, the agency reports. \u201cWe were operating in the hospital. There was a strong explosion and the ceiling fell on the operating room.\u201d said Ghassan Abu Sittah, a doctor with medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF). He added: \u201cHospitals are not a target. This bloodshed must stop. Enough is enough.\u201d A reminder that there are differing figures in the death toll after the blast at al-Ahli Arabi hospital. The Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, claimed that more than 500 people had been killed in an Israeli airstrike on the hospital which, if confirmed, would make it the deadliest single bombing of all the five wars Israel and Hamas have fought over Gaza. But an official from the Gaza civil defence said more than 300 people had been killed in the blast. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \u201chorrified\u201d by what he called the \u201cstrike\u201d on a hospital in Gaza, he said in post on X on Tuesday. \u201cMy heart is with the families of the victims. Hospitals and medical personnel are protected under international humanitarian law,\u201d Guterres said. In a statement released shortly after by his spokesman, Guterres also condemned an attack on a school run by the UN in a Gaza refugee camp that killed six people. The Palestinian militant group Hamas has blamed Israel for the hospital strike. Israel has said it was caused by a rocket misfired by Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza. Russia has proposed adding condemnation of the blast at the hospital to the Brazilian-drafted resolution on which the United Nations Security Council is to vote on Wednesday. The proposed wording refers to it as a strike. \u201cToday we supplemented the amendment, which concerns the condemnation of the strikes on Gaza with the condemnation of the strike on the Al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital in Gaza,\u201d Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia\u2019s deputy envoy to the United Nations, said on the Telegram messaging app. Iran\u2019s Embassy in Damascus has posted a tweet with the words, in Hebrew, \u201ctime is up\u201d: This post was amended on 23 October to reflect that the words tweeted were in Hebrew, not Arabic. Here is what leaders have said about the blast at a hospital in Gaza city that has killed 500 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry. US President Joe Biden: \u201cI am outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted. Immediately upon hearing this news, I spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and have directed my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened. The United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients, medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy.\u201d World Health Organizaation: \u201cWHO strongly condemns the attack on al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip. The hospital was operational, with patients, health and care givers, and internally displaced people sheltering there. Early reports indicate hundreds of fatalities and injuries. \u201cThe hospital was one of 20 in the north of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from the Israeli military. The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, and lack of ambulances, staff, health system bed capacity, and alternative shelter for those displaced. \u201cWHO calls for the immediate active protection of civilians and health care. Evacuation orders must be reversed. International humanitarian law must be abided by, which means health care must be actively protected and never targeted. Palestinian Hamas leader Ismail Haniyehi: \u201cThe hospital massacre confirms the enemy\u2019s brutality and the extent of his feeling of defeat,\u201d he said, adding that the attack will be \u201ca new turning point.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \u201cThe entire world should know: It was barbaric terrorists in Gaza that attacked the hospital in Gaza, and not the IDF. Those who brutally murdered our children also murder their own children.\u201d IDF Spokesperson \u201cAn analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the al-Ahli al-Arabihospital in Gaza at the time it was hit. \u201cIntelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza.\u201d Syrian Presidency \u201cSyria holds Western countries responsible especially the United States of America, for this massacre and others, since they are a partner of the Zionist entity across all organized operations designed to kill Palestinians.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan: \u201cI call on all humanity to take action to stop this unprecedented brutality in Gaza.\u201d US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has just posted a statement responding to what happened at al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital, sayng, \u201cAll civilians, Israeli and Palestinian, must be protected. Deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza. As @POTUS said, \u201cThe United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life.\u201d AFP: Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad on Wednesday described as \u201clies\u201d the Israel army\u2019s accusations that it was responsible for a strike on a Gaza hospital that left hundreds dead. Between 300 and 500 people were killed in an air strike on a hospital compound that sheltered the wounded and displaced from Israeli bombing, local health officials said Tuesday, prompting global condemnation and fury. The Hamas-run health ministry claimed that Israel was behind the attack on the al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital in central Gaza but Israel\u2019s military blamed a malfunctioning rocket fired by Islamic Jihad. \u201cThe Zionist enemy is trying hard to evade its responsibility for the brutal massacre he committed by bombing the Baptist Arab National Hospital in Gaza through his usual fabrication of lies, and through pointing the finger of blame at the Islamic Jihad movement in Palestine,\u201d it said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe therefore affirm that the accusations put forward by the enemy are false and baseless,\u201d it added. According to the statement, the hospital had been ordered to evacuate by Israel under threat of bombardment, and it was a bomb dropped by an Israeli army plane that caused the tragedy. It said the hospital had \u201creceived public notice made global of evacuation under threat of bombing\u201d. The Israeli army, for its part, said the hospital was hit by a rocket misfired by Islamic Jihad Palestinian militants. Spokesman Daniel Hagari told a press briefing that at the time of the strike, the Israeli army was not conducting air operations near the hospital and the rockets that hit the building did not match theirs. He added that the army would also provide conversations in Arabic that indicate the strike was done by Islamic Jihad. The number of Americans killed from the Hamas attack on Israel now stands at 31, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. Kirby said the United States would continue to speak to Israel about the need to protect innocent civilian life. President Joe Biden is on his way to Israel to show US support in the aftermath of the Hamas attack. White House spokesperson John Kirby has told reporters on Air Force One that the \u201cdecision not to go to Jordan was mutual\u201d, Reuters reports. Following a blast at a Gaza hospital where hundreds of people were sheltering from Israeli air strikes, and patients were being treated, Jordan\u2019s foreign minister canceled a regional summit scheduled for Wednesday in Amman, where Biden was to meet with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. Israeli and Palestinian authorities have each blamed each other for the hospital attack. A short while after Jordan\u2019s announcement, the White House announced that Biden would not visit Amman. Biden is currently en route to Tel Aviv. Kirby has told reporters that the US is \u2018getting close to a framework for Aid to get into Gaza from Egypt\u201d. Meanwhile US president Joe Biden is on Air Force one en route to Tel Aviv. He will ask \u201ctough questions\u201d during his visit with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli leaders, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters travelling on the plane. Kirby said Biden wanted to get a sense from the Israelis about their objectives in the days ahead. Kirby said the United States was optimistic that humanitarian aid would make it into Gaza. Following the blast at a Gaza hospital where hundreds of people were sheltering and patients were being treated, protests have ignited in cities across the Middle East, including in Lebanon, Iran and Turkey. Hundreds of Palestinians have flooded the streets of major West Bank cities including Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, where protesters hurled stones at Palestinian security forces who fired back with stun grenades. Hundreds of demonstrators scuffled with Lebanese security forces outside the US embassy in the village of Awkar on Thursday night, where protesters hurled stones, according to AFP correspondents. Police fired several rounds of teargas to disperse protesters, with medics rushing in to treat people affected. The US embassy is a heavily fortified and sprawling compound 20 minutes north of Beirut, in the village of Awkar. Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement on Tuesday called for a \u201cday of rage\u201d to condemn what it said was an Israeli strike on a hospital in Gaza city. Israel\u2019s army blamed a rocket misfired by Islamic Jihad, another Gaza-based militant group. Hundreds also gathered at the French embassy in Beirut, raising Hezbollah flags and also hurling stones which piled up at the embassy\u2019s main entrance. Protests were also staged at Israel\u2019s embassies in Turkey and Jordan. Television footage showed protests in Yemen\u2019s southwestern city of Taz, as well as in the Moroccan and Iraqi capitals. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the British and French embassies in Tehran in the early hours of Wednesday. The US Treasury Department is preparing to announce new sanctions against several leaders of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas this week after their attack on Israel earlier this month, Axios is reporting, citing US officials. The Guardian has not confirmed this independently. The US State Department will continue to offer government-sponsored charter flights to Europe from Tel Aviv to help Americans leave Israel through at least Sunday, a spokesperson said on Tuesday. The department said about 1,500 US citizens and family members have departed Israel on the charter flights to Athens and other transport options since Friday after offering more than 5,000 seats. The State Department has said flights have generally departed at half capacity or less. The department had previously only committed to offering charter flights through Thursday. US President Joe Biden says that he spoke to Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201cimmediately upon hearing this news\u201d of the hospital blasts. \u201cThe United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilian life during conflict and we mourn the patients, medical staff and other innocents killed or wounded in this tragedy,\u201d Biden said. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the British and French embassies in Tehran in the early hours of Wednesday, an AFP correspondent said, as regional anger grew over a deadly strike on a Gaza hospital. \u201cDeath to France and England,\u201d protesters shouted, throwing eggs at the walls of the French embassy compound in the Iranian capital. Several thousand people also gathered in Palestine Square in central Tehran to voice their anger, according to an AFP photographer. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi declared a day of \u201cpublic mourning\u201d on Wednesday and said the strike on the hospital would turn against Israel and its US ally. \u201cThe flames of the US-Israeli bombs, dropped this evening on the Palestinian victims injured at the... hospital in Gaza, will soon consume the Zionists,\u201d Raisi said, according to the IRNA agency. \u201cIran is in mourning,\u201d he added. US President Joe Biden said Tuesday he was \u201coutraged and deeply saddened\u201d by a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital. Biden had \u201cdirected my national security team to continue gathering information about what exactly happened,\u201d he added in a statement. Hamas has blamed Israel for the strike, while Israel says a rocket misfired by Islamic Jihad Palestinian militants was responsible. AP: Clashes erupted Tuesday along the Lebanon-Israel border that left five Hezbollah fighters dead, marking the largest number of casualties for the militant group in a single day as tensions with Israel escalate. Israeli forces and armed groups in Lebanon have engaged in a series of low-level skirmishes since the outbreak of the latest conflict in Gaza between the Israeli military and the Hamas militant group. Hezbollah has announced the death of 10 militants since skirmishes began. Israeli military Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi threatened that Israel would retaliate aggressively should Hezbollah escalate. \u201cThis is a war on the home,\u201d Halevi said after meeting with Israeli troops near the northern border with Lebanon. \u201cIf Hezbollah makes a mistake, it will be annihilated.\u201d The escalation comes amid fears that the war could spread into Lebanon, where Hezbollah has expressed strong support to the militant Palestinian group Hamas. Israel considers the heavily-armed group in Lebanon an even bigger threat than Hamas. So far, artillery exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel have been limited to several towns along the border. Israel has threatened that if Hezbollah opens a new front, all of Lebanon will suffer the consequences. The United Arab Emirates, which has full diplomatic ties with Israel, has condemned the blasts at al-Ahli al-Arabi, which it said was a strike by the Israeli military. The UAE \u201ccalled on the international community to intensify efforts to reach an immediate ceasefire to prevent further loss of life, to avoid further fuelling the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory [\u2026] preventing the region from being pulled into new levels of violence, tension and instability.\u201d In a statement posted to X, Afra Al Hameli, the communications director at the UAU\u2019s foreign affairs ministry, said: #UAE strongly condemns the Israeli attack that targeted Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in the #Gaza Strip resulting in the death and injury of hundreds of people. [The Ministry of Foreign Affairs] expresses its deep regret for the loss of life and conveys its condolences to the families of the victims, wishing a swift recovery for all those injured. The Ministry also stressed the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and to ensure that civilians and civilian institutions are not targeted. The Ministry further underlined the importance of the protection of civilians, according to international humanitarian law, international treaties for the protection of civilians and human rights, and the need to ensure that they are not targeted in conflict. The United Arab Emirates called on the international community to intensify efforts to reach an immediate ceasefire to prevent further loss of life, to avoid further fuelling the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory, and to advance all efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just peace, while preventing the region from being pulled into new levels of violence, tension and instability. In the wake of the hospital blast, hundreds of Palestinians have flooded the streets of major West Bank cities including Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, where protesters hurled stones at Palestinian security forces who fired back with stun grenades. Others threw stones at Israeli checkpoints, where soldiers killed one Palestinian, West Bank authorities said. Hundreds of people joined protests that erupted in Beirut and Amman, where an angry crowd gathered outside the Israeli Embassy. It is 2am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here is where things stand: Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed in a massive explosion at a crowded hospital in Gaza City, in the biggest single loss of life in the blockaded territory in all the five wars between Hamas and Israel since the militants took over the strip in 2007. The Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said at least 500 people were killed on Tuesday night in what it said was an Israeli airstrike on al-Ahli al-Arabi, also known as the Baptist hospital. A spokesperson for the Gaza civil defence put the number of killed at about 300. The Israeli military reportedly said an initial investigation suggested the explosion was caused by a failed Hamas rocket launch, before saying it was the result of a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket barrage. Islamic Jihad denied the Israeli allegation, and the scale of the blast appeared to be outside the militant groups\u2019 capabilities. Reports said violence had erupted between protesters and Palestinian security forces in several cities in the West Bank. In central Ramallah, teargas and stun grenades were fired to disperse protesters throwing rocks and chanting against the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas. Reuters reported anger was boiling over after the deadly attack on a Gaza hospital on Tuesday that the authority said was a \u201ccold-blooded massacre\u201d by Israel. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said the UK will work with allies to \u201cfind out what has happened\u201d at the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital in Gaza. Cleverly, posting to social media, described the destruction of the hospital as \u201ca devastating loss of human life\u201d and that the UK has been \u201cclear\u201d that the \u201cprotection of civilian life must come first\u201d. The White House announced that Joe Biden would no longer travel to Jordan. The decision came after Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said that Jordan was no longer holding a planned summit with the US president and the Egyptian and Palestinian leaders that was scheduled to take place in Amman on Wednesday. Safadi, speaking to Al Jazeera, said the summit was cancelled because \u201cthere is no use in talking now about anything except stopping the war\u201d. Earlier on Tuesday, the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said an Israeli air strike had killed at least six people after striking one of its schools that has been functioning as a shelter for displaced people. Several hospitals in Gaza have become refuges for hundreds of people hoping to be spared bombardment. Health authorities in Gaza say at least 3,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s bombardment since 7 October. At least 940 children and 1,032 women have been killed, the Hamas government media office said. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, has declared three days of mourning following the deadly air strike on Gaza\u2019s Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital. Fears are growing that people in Gaza are beginning to dehydrate to death as clean water runs out, with Israeli airstrikes continuing to pound the Palestinian territory of 2.3 million residents amid a total blockade on food, electricity, medicine and fuel. Germany\u2019s duty is to \u201cstand up for the existence of the state of Israel\u201d, chancellor Olaf Scholz said during a joint press conference with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Berlin is \u201cdoing all it can to ensure that this conflict does not escalate\u201d across the region, he added. US president Joe Biden is expected to visit the Middle East on Wednesday, on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy that will take in meetings with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other officials in Tel Aviv. Biden will then move on to meet Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Amman, Jordan. The UN\u2019s culture body, Unesco, warned that the Hamas attack on Israel has led to intense fighting that has resulted in the \u201cdeadliest week for journalists in any recent conflict\u201d. Nine journalists have been confirmed killed in the line of duty since 7 October and \u201cthe death toll could rise further still\u201d, the agency said. The head of Israeli military intelligence said he bears responsibility for the intelligence failures that led to Hamas carrying out its surprise onslaught on 7 October. Maj Gen Aharon Haliva is the latest Israeli defence official to publicly state that they take responsibility for the Hamas attack, after the head of the Shin Bet security agency and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff made similar remarks in recent days. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is set to visit Israel, possibly as soon as Thursday, according to a Sky News report. Meanwhile, the UK foreign office said it has successfully brought back more than 900 people from Israel. A British teenager is missing and feared kidnapped after Hamas targeted Israeli kibbutzim was murdered during the attack, relatives have confirmed. Yahel Sharabi, 13, was originally believed missing and possibly taken hostage after the raid on the Be\u2019eri kibbutz two miles from the Gazan border in which her Bristol-born mother, Lianne, was killed. Her sister Noiya, 16, who is a British citizen like Yahel, and their Israeli father, Eli, are still missing. The UN\u2019s human rights office said Israel\u2019s siege of Gaza and its evacuation order there could amount to the international crime of the forcible transfer of civilians. Hamas said a senior commander and member of its higher military council, Ayman Nofal, has been killed by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli air force also said he had been killed, stating: \u201cHe directed many terrorist attacks against Israel and the security forces, and he directed the targets of Hamas\u2019s rocket fire, specifically targeting areas populated by uninvolved civilians.\u201d This is Helen Sullivan taking over our rolling coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. I\u2019ll be with you throughout the night. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, confirmed he would not be meeting Joe Biden in Amman, adding that any talks about anything else rather than stopping the war is unacceptable. Abbas said targeting the Al-Ahli Arabi hospital in Gaza was a \u201chideous war massacre\u201d that cannot be tolerated, Reuters reported. He added: Israel has crossed all red lines ... We will not leave nor allow anyone to expel us from there. The Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, has claimed that an Israeli airstrike on the hospital killed hundreds of people. The Israeli military has denied responsibility, suggesting the hospital was hit by a rocket barrage launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group. Islamic Jihad also denied responsibility. EU prime ministers have vowed to step up their efforts to mitigate a looming humanitarian crisis in Gaza in a bid to present a united diplomatic front after a week of dysfunction and mixed messages from leaders in Brussels. After an emergency video conference to address the conflagration in the Middle East, the European Council leader, Charles Michel, stressed the need to present \u201ca clear unified course of action that reflects the complexity of the unfolding situation\u201d. Tuesday\u2019s talks were preceded by a statement by EU leaders on Sunday strongly condemning Hamas\u2019s \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d while mentioning \u201cthe importance to ensure the protection of all civilians at all times\u201d and the need for Israel to comply with international law. Michel spoke of the need to use all the leverage the EU could muster to help the hostages held by Hamas and to persuade Egypt to approve a humanitarian corridor for aid and refugees. After terrorist attacks in Belgium and France, a heightened concern about the return of hate crime and speech was also a priority, said Michel. Michel made his remarks after a joint press conference with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who has been the subject of criticism over her failure to emphasize Israel\u2019s obligation to comply with international law while defending itself. Read the full story here. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip to be opened without delay. Macron, in a statement posted to social media, wrote: Nothing can justify striking a hospital. Nothing can justify targeting civilians. France condemns the attack on the Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, which made so many Palestinian victims. Our thoughts are with them. All the light must be shed on the circumstances. A White House statement confirming Joe Biden\u2019s decision to cancel a planned stop in Jordan said: After consulting with King Abdullah II of Jordan and in light of the days of mourning announced by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, President Biden will postpone his travel to Jordan and the planned meeting with these two leaders and President Sisi of Egypt. He looks forward to consulting in person with these leaders soon, and agreed to remain regularly and directly engaged with each of them over the coming days. Joe Biden\u2019s decision to cancel a planned stop in Jordan after a visit to Israel comes after Jordan called off a four-way summit scheduled for Wednesday with the US president and Egyptian and Palestinian leaders. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, earlier dropped out of the planned meeting in Jordan. A senior Palestinian official said Abbas would instead return to Ramallah, the seat of his government in the occupied West Bank, following the blast on a Gaza hospital reported to have killed hundreds. Joe Biden has boarded Air Force One for his flight to Israel, where he is scheduled to meet prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said the UK will work with allies to \u201cfind out what has happened\u201d at the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital in Gaza. Cleverly, posting to social media, described the destruction of the hospital as \u201ca devastating loss of human life\u201d and that the UK has been \u201cclear\u201d that the \u201cprotection of civilian life must come first\u201d. The White House said Joe Biden will no longer travel to Jordan as part of his trip. Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said earlier that Jordan was no longer holding a planned summit with the US president and the Egyptian and Palestinian leaders that was scheduled to take place in Amman tomorrow. Safadi, speaking to Al Jazeera, said the summit was cancelled because \u201cthere is no use in talking now about anything except stopping the war\u201d. A Palestinian protester has been shot dead by Israeli forces during confrontations in the Nabi Saleh village, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, Reuters reported that the Palestinian health ministry said. Joe Biden has departed the White House en route to Joint Base Andrews for his trip to Israel and Jordan, the New York Times reported. The US president is due to travel to Israel tomorrow, where he is scheduled to hold talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden was also scheduled to go to Amman for talks with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas. As we reported just now, that summit has now been cancelled, according Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi. Jordan has cancelled a summit between the US president, Joe Biden, and Egyptian and Palestinian leaders in Amman tomorrow, Reuters reported that Jordan\u2019s foreign minister said. The summit was due to take place on Wednesday between Biden, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, and Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah. The US has discussed the possibility of using military force if the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah joins the war by attacking Israeli forces, according to an Axios report. The report, citing three US officials and an Israeli official, came as Iran warned Israel on Monday that Hezbollah was close to entering the Hamas war. The report writes: Two US officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Arab leaders in the region, with whom he\u2019d met in recent days, that the US \u201cis not fooling around\u201d by sending so many military assets to the region in support of Israel. The scenario of using US military force if Hezbollah were to join the war \u201chas come up in several White House meetings in recent days,\u201d it says. The two US officials stressed the administration is doing all it can to keep Hezbollah out of the war \u2013 but also is preparing for the opposite scenario. In the UK, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the scenes of hundreds killed at Gaza\u2019s Al-Ahli Arabi hospital are \u201cabsolutely devastating and cannot be justified\u201d. \u201cInternational law must be upheld,\u201d Starmer posted to X. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Humza Yousaf, who has several family members trapped in Gaza, said the attack should be \u201cunequivocally condemned in the strongest possible manner\u201d. \u201cThere can be no justification for this. None whatsoever,\u201d Yousaf wrote in a statement. The mother of Mia Schem, a 21-year-old French-Israeli woman being held by Hamas, appealed for her release on Tuesday, calling her detention and that of an estimated 200 hostages \u201ca crime against humanity\u201d. Keren Schem told journalists in Jerusalem: I didn\u2019t know if she\u2019s dead or alive until yesterday. All I knew is that she might be kidnapped. I\u2019m begging the world to bring my baby back home. She only went to a party, to a festival party to have some fun. Now she\u2019s in Gaza. Hamas had released a video of Schem, who was taken hostage during the devastating attack on Israel. In the footage, Schem, whose injured arm is shown being treated by an unidentified medical worker, asks to be returned to her family as quickly as possible. On Tuesday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the video as \u201can odious act\u201d. The Elys\u00e9e said Macron, who is on an official visit to Albania, demanded her unconditional release. Ismail Haniyeh, who is widely considered to be the overall leader of Hamas, has blamed the US for the attack on Al-Ahli Arabi hospital, which he described as \u201ca new turning point\u201d. \u201cThe hospital massacre confirms the enemy\u2019s brutality and the extent of his feeling of defeat,\u201d Haniyeh said in a televised speech late on Tuesday, Reuters reported. Here are some of the latest images we have received over the news wires from Ramallah, where protesters have taken to the streets after the deadly strike on Gaza\u2019s Al-Ahli Arabi hospital. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said it was \u201chorrified\u201d by the bombing of the Al-Ahli Arabi hospital, which it described as \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d. Dr Ghassan Abu Sittah, an MSF doctor in Gaza, was quoted as saying: We were operating in the hospital, there was a strong explosion, and the ceiling fell on the operating room. This is a massacre. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) has denied it is responsible for the strike on the Al-Ahli Arabi hospital in Gaza, Reuters reported. The Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said at least 500 people had been killed in the explosion at Al-Ahli Arabi hospital, and the death toll was likely to rise. A spokesperson for the Gaza civil defence put the number of killed at about 300. Footage broadcast from the ground by Al Jazeera showed a huge fire engulfing the multi-storey building, with bodies, streaks of blood and widespread debris scattered around. The hospital, which is owned by the Anglican church, was reportedly struck without any prior warning. It was previously hit by a rocket on Saturday. The hospital was hit at about 8.30pm local time on Tuesday. It was packed with people injured in Israeli strikes, as well as civilians seeking shelter, believing the hospital grounds to be safer than their homes after relentless Israeli attacks that have already killed more than 3,000 people. The Israeli military reportedly said an initial investigation suggested the explosion was caused by a failed Hamas rocket launch, but the scale of the blast appears to be outside the militant group\u2019s capabilities. The incident is already the biggest single loss of life in Gaza in the five wars between Hamas and Israel since the militants took over the strip in 2007. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the attack on the al-Ahli Arabi hospital where hundreds have reportedly been killed is \u201can appalling and devastating loss of innocent lives\u201d. The hospital is run by the Anglican church, he posted to social media. Events are moving quickly following the earlier Gaza hospital attack. Israel now says intelligence shows a \u201cfailed rocket launch\u201d by Islamic Jihad was responsible, according to Reuters. \u201cAn analysis of IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,\u201d an IDF spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cIntelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza.\u201d \u201cWe did not strike that hospital,\u201d Jonathan Conricus, an international spokesperson for IDF, just told CNN. \u201cWe do not intentionally strike any sensitive facilities, and definitely not hospitals. We are very much aware of the presence of civilians.\u201d Meanwhile, Russia and the United Arab Emirates have demanded a meeting of the United Nations security council on Wednesday to discuss the incident. Reports say violence has erupted between protesters and Palestinian security forces in several cities in the West Bank, Reuters is reporting. In central Ramallah, teargas and stun grenades were fired to disperse protesters throwing rocks and chanting against the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas. The news agency reported anger was boiling over after the deadly attack on a Gaza hospital on Tuesday that the authority said was a \u201ccold-blooded massacre\u201d by Israel. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), meanwhile, are suggesting the strike was a failed rocket launch by Hamas. In Jordan\u2019s capital Amman, protesters have reportedly overrun the Israeli embassy, according to video posted to X, formerly Twitter. Jordan is denying that protesters breached the embassy, saying it was a \u201cgroup of protesting people who gathered near the embassy trying to reach it\u201d who were \u201cdealt with and removed from its surroundings\u201d by authorities, the Petra news agency said. There\u2019s been a wave of international condemnation of Tuesday\u2019s deadly strike on a Gaza hospital, for which Israel is denying responsibility. The foreign ministry of Turkey said in a statement that it was a \u201cbarbaric attack\u201d. \u201cWe are deeply indignant that hundreds of Palestinians lost their lives and many more were injured as a result of the targeting of a hospital in Gaza today, and we condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest terms,\u201d the statement said. Iran issued a similarly worded statement condemning deaths and injuries to hundreds of \u201cunarmed and defenseless people\u201d, Iranian state media reported. It was, Iran\u2019s foreign ministry said, \u201ca savage war crime\u201d. A statement from the foreign ministry of Qatar said: \u201cThe expansion of Israeli attacks over the Gaza Strip to include hospitals, schools and other population centers is a dangerous escalation.\u201d Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, told reporters: \u201cThe news coming out of Gaza is horrific and absolutely unacceptable\u2026 international law needs to be respected in this and in all cases. There are rules around wars and it\u2019s not acceptable to hit a hospital\u201d. Egypt and Jordan both issued statements saying they condemned the attack in \u201cthe strongest possible terms\u201d. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, has canceled a planned meeting with Joe Biden following the strike on a Gaza hospital reported to have killed hundreds, a senior Palestinian official said. The meeting was due to take place in Jordan during the US president\u2019s visit to the Middle East beginning on Wednesday. The Palestinian official said Abbas was returning to Ramallah, the seat of his government in the occupied West Bank, Reuters reports. It\u2019s just past 10pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here\u2019s where things stand: Hundreds are feared dead or injured after a strike on a hospital in Gaza City, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Hundreds are still under the rubble, it said. If confirmed, the attack would be by far the deadliest Israeli airstrike in five wars fought since 2008. Israel\u2019s military said it did not have any details on the reported bombing. Earlier on Tuesday, the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said an Israeli air strike had killed at least six people after striking one of its schools that has been functioning as a shelter for displaced people. Several hospitals in Gaza have become refuges for hundreds of people hoping to be spared bombardment. Health authorities in Gaza say at least 3,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s bombardment since 7 October. At least 940 children and 1,032 women have been killed, the Hamas government media office said. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, has declared three days of mourning following the deadly air strike on Gaza\u2019s Al-Ahli Arabi hospital. Fears are growing that people in Gaza are beginning to dehydrate to death as clean water runs out, with Israeli airstrikes continuing to pound the Palestinian territory of 2.3 million residents amid a total blockade on food, electricity, medicine and fuel. Germany\u2019s duty is to \u201cstand up for the existence of the state of Israel\u201d, chancellor Olaf Scholz said during a joint press conference with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Berlin is \u201cdoing all it can to ensure that this conflict does not escalate\u201d across the region, he added. US president Joe Biden is expected to visit the Middle East on Wednesday, on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy that will take in meetings with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other officials in Tel Aviv. Biden will then move on to meet Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Amman, Jordan. The UN\u2019s culture body, Unesco, warned that the Hamas attack on Israel has led to intense fighting that has resulted in the \u201cdeadliest week for journalists in any recent conflict\u201d. Nine journalists have been confirmed killed in the line of duty since 7 October and \u201cthe death toll could rise further still\u201d, the agency said. The head of Israeli military intelligence said he bears responsibility for the intelligence failures that led to Hamas carrying out its surprise onslaught on 7 October. Maj Gen Aharon Haliva is the latest Israeli defence official to publicly state that they take responsibility for the Hamas attack, after the head of the Shin Bet security agency and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff made similar remarks in recent days. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is set to visit Israel, possibly as soon as Thursday, according to a Sky News report. Meanwhile, the UK foreign office said it has successfully brought back more than 900 people from Israel. A British teenager missing and feared kidnapped after Hamas targeted Israeli kibbutzim was murdered during the attack, relatives have confirmed. Yahel Sharabi, 13, was originally believed missing and possibly taken hostage after the raid on the Be\u2019eri kibbutz two miles from the Gazan border in which her Bristol-born mother, Lianne, was killed. Her sister Noiya, 16, who is a British citizen like Yahel, and their Israeli father, Eli, are still missing. The UN\u2019s human rights office said Israel\u2019s siege of Gaza and its evacuation order there could amount to the international crime of the forcible transfer of civilians. Hamas said a senior commander and member of its higher military council, Ayman Nofal, has been killed by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli air force also said he had been killed, stating: \u201cHe directed many terrorist attacks against Israel and the security forces, and he directed the targets of Hamas\u2019s rocket fire, specifically targeting areas populated by uninvolved civilians.\u201d The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said an initial investigation shows the explosion in Gaza\u2019s hospital was caused by a failed Hamas rocket launch, i24NEWS reported. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has strongly condemned the attack on Gaza\u2019s Al Ahli Arab Hospital. In a statement posted to social media, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote: We call for the immediate protection of civilians and health care, and for the evacuation orders to be reversed. Fears are growing that people in Gaza are beginning to dehydrate to death as clean water runs out, with Israeli airstrikes continuing to pound the Palestinian territory of 2.3 million residents amid a total blockade on food, electricity, medicine and fuel. Unrwa, the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, said on Tuesday that Gaza\u2019s last seawater desalination plant had shut down, bringing the risk of further deaths and waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Six water wells, three water pumping stations, and one water reservoir \u2013 which collectively served more than 1.1million people \u2013 are also out of action, it said. After 16 years of a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade, imposed after the Palestinian militant group Hamas seized control of the exclave in 2007, clean water was already one of the most pressing concerns in the 41km by 12km strip. Almost 97% of the water in Gaza\u2019s sole aquifer is not potable; without proper maintenance and with Israeli restrictions on imports and electricity, sewage treatment plants were overwhelmed years ago. Untreated waste has flowed directly into the Mediterranean for more than a decade. But now, desperate civilians find themselves consuming the contaminated tap water, or digging new wells too close to the sea to drink and use dirty, salty water. Jamil al-Meqdad, a writer and researcher in Gaza City, said: People are trying to fetch water out of dangerous places, like the wells at mosques. In fact, children were killed [by airstrikes] while trying to drink water at a mosque a week ago. Access to at least 50 litres of water per person is the minimum level set by the World Health Organization. Most people in Gaza are now believed to be surviving on three, the UN says. Read the full report by The Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent, Bethan McKernan. A senior Hamas official has told NBC News that Hamas is willing to release all civilian hostages in one hour if Israel stops its bombing of Gaza. The UK foreign office has successfully brought back more than 900 people from Israel, it said on Tuesday. It said it was closing the booking portal for UK government flights tomorrow Wednesday at 10am UK time / noon Israel time. It encouraged any British nationals who want to leave Israel to register their presence and book a flight before the portal closes. Any remaining British nationals who wish to fly must be prepared to travel within the next 24 hours. The foreign office said: The safety of British nationals is our priority and we will keep the ongoing security situation under review. Land routes and some commercial flight options remain available. The casualty figures from the blast at Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital are very fluid as reports come out of Gaza. Between 200 and 300 people were killed in the explosion on the hospital compound, according to a statement from the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. \u201cHundreds of victims are still under the rubble,\u201d it added. A Gaza civil defence chief told Al-Jazeera that more than 300 people were killed. At least 500 people were killed and injured, a Gaza health ministry official said. Both departments are under the Hamas-run government. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari would not immediately confirm its forces bombed the hospital. Earlier today, the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency said at least six people were killed after a strike on a school in Gaza\u2019s al-Maghazi refugee camp. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, has declared three days of mourning following the deadly air strike on Gaza\u2019s Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital, state media reported. The strike on Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital, which Gaza authorities said killed at least 500 people, comes as the US president, Joe Biden, prepares to travel to Israel on Wednesday. The US president will also go to Amman for talks with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, in an attempt to fend off an even greater humanitarian disaster and a regional war that could draw in Iran and the US. Biden\u2019s trip was announced by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, after more than seven hours of talks with Netanyahu and his national security cabinet on Monday. It comes after the US said it had reached agreement with Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government on the provision of humanitarian relief and safe areas to the more than 2 million people in Gaza who are under fire and in urgent need of water, food and medical help. The Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital in Gaza City is \u201cstill burning\u201d after the reported airstrike, Al Jazeera reported. An Al Jazeera journalist reporting on the ground writes: The situation here is really catastrophic. There are still people under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Medical teams are trying to evacuate the victims, but there is an increasing number of victims across different areas in the Gaza Strip. Hundreds and thousands. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it does not have details yet on the reported attack on Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital in Gaza City. From the BBC\u2019s Michael Shuval: There are \u201chundreds of victims\u201d under the rubble of the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital in Gaza after it was struck by an airstrike, the Gaza health ministry said. The health ministry said at least 500 people have been killed. If confirmed, the attack on the Gaza hospital would be by far the deadliest Israeli airstrike in five wars fought since 2008, AP reported. Gaza\u2019s health ministry said the strike on Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital in the centre of Gaza City has resulted in at least 500 casualties. The Hamas-run ministry said at least 500 people have been killed in an explosion that it says was caused by an Israeli airstrike. The hospital was struck without any prior warning, Al Jazeera reported. An airstrike has struck the Al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital in the centre of Gaza City, according to Palestinian authorities. Initial estimates indicate that between 200 and 300 people were killed in the bombing that targeted the hospital, a Gaza health ministry spokesperson said. Many of the wounded appeared to be women and children, Al Jazeera reported. The hospital was sheltering families amid Israel\u2019s continued bombardment of Gaza. \u2022 This post and the two above were amended shortly after publication on 17 October 2023 to more clearly reflect throughout that the claim about the cause of the explosion at the hospital comes from the Gaza health ministry. Subsequently, as later posts report, the IDF has denied responsibility for the strike. An Italian-Israeli citizen who has been missing since the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel has been confirmed dead. Eviatar Moshe Kipnis, 65, went missing following the attack on Kibbutz Be\u2019eri about 3 miles (5km) from Gaza, which was one of the first hit by Hamas, according to an Italian foreign ministry statement. Two Italian-Israeli citizens are still unaccounted for, Reuters reported that the Italian ministry said. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is set to visit Israel, possibly as soon as Thursday, according to Sky News. The visit could be part of a wider trip to the region to include Jordan and Egypt, the report says. A British teenager missing and feared kidnapped after Hamas targeted Israeli kibbutzim was murdered during the attack, relatives have confirmed. Yahel Sharabi, 13, was originally believed missing and possibly taken hostage after the raid on Be\u2019eri kibbutz two miles from the Gazan border in which her Bristol-born mother, Lianne, was killed. Her sister Noiya, 16, who is a British citizen like Yahel, and their Israeli father, Eli, are still missing. Yahel was described as \u201cfull of adventure and mischief\u201d. In a statement to BBC News on Tuesday, relatives said: Beautiful Yahel. A bundle of unbridled energy and joy, with a cheekiness that you could not help but smile at and a brain which was sharp as a tack. Full of adventure and mischief, we will forever miss her, but are grateful for the light she brought into our lives in the too short time she was with us. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called on the world to stand united behind his country to defeat Hamas during a joint press conference with visiting German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. Netanyahu accused Hamas of wanting to \u201chold the citizens of Gaza as human shields\u201d. He said: The savagery that we witnessed perpetrated by the Hamas murderers coming out of Gaza were the worst crimes committed against Jews since the Holocaust. At least six people have been killed in an Israeli air strike that hit a school run by the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) in Gaza\u2019s al-Maghazi refugee camp, the agency said. Dozens were injured, including UNRWA staff, in the airstrike, as well as \u201csevere\u201d structural damage to the school, it said in a statement. The numbers are likely to be higher, it added. This is outrageous, and it again shows a flagrant disregard for the lives of civilians. No place is safe in Gaza anymore, not even UNRWA facilities. It said at least 4,000 people had taken refuge in the school turned shelter in al-Maghazi refugee camp, in Gaza\u2019s middle area. \u201cThey had and still have nowhere else to go,\u201d it said. The UN\u2019s culture body, Unesco, has warned that the Hamas attack on Israel has led to intense fighting that has resulted in the \u201cdeadliest week for journalists in any recent conflict\u201d. Nine journalists have been confirmed killed in the line of duty since 7 October and \u201cthe death toll could rise further still\u201d, the agency warned. The deaths took place during the Hamas attack and the Israeli military response in Gaza, but also on the Israeli-Lebanese border, it said. Unesco\u2019s director general, Audrey Azoulay, said in a statement: This is a dramatic toll. Never in a recent conflict has the profession had to pay such a heavy price in such a short space of time. I call on regional and international actors to take immediate action to ensure that international law is respected. Journalists should never, under any circumstances, be targeted. And it is the responsibility of all actors to ensure that they can continue to exercise their profession safely and independently. At least 940 children and 1,032 women have been killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October, Reuters reported that the Hamas government media office said. The latest Palestinian death toll in Gaza stands at 3,000 people and a further 12,500 injured. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he had spoken to Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about how to get humanitarian aid \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d to civilians in the Gaza Strip. \u201cWe want to protect civilians and prevent civilian deaths,\u201d he said during his press conference in Tel Aviv. Berlin is \u201cdoing all it can to ensure that this conflict does not escalate\u201d across the region, he added. I explicitly warn any actor to refrain from external intervention in this conflict. It would be a serious, unforgivable mistake. In recent days, we have addressed this message via various channels to those to whom it concerns. Olaf Scholz said Germany\u2019s duty is to \u201cstand up for the existence of the state of Israel\u201d during a joint press conference with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The German chancellor, who is visiting Tel Aviv to show solidarity with Israel, said he was on \u201ca visit to friends in difficult times\u201d, Deutsche Welle reported. As I said in parliament last week, there can only be one place for Germany in difficult times: by Israel\u2019s side. The security of Israel and its citizens is Germany\u2019s reason of state. And the German parliament supports this stance unanimously. Scholz noted that the history of Germany and its role \u201cin the wake of the Holocaust, means it is our duty to stand up for the existence of the state of Israel\u201d. He added: We condemn the bloodthirsty attacks by Hamas terrorists in the strongest terms. The brutal terror against innocent civilians, the execution of defenseless citizens, the murder of babies, the abduction of women, men and children, the humiliation and presentation of Holocaust survivors \u2013 it makes our blood run cold. The head of Israeli military intelligence said he bears responsibility for the intelligence failures that led to Hamas carrying out its surprise onslaught on 7 October. \u201cThe Military Intelligence Directorate, under my command, failed to warn of the terror attack carried out by Hamas,\u201d Maj Gen Aharon Haliva wrote in a letter shared by Israeli media. We failed in our most important mission, and as the head of the Military Intelligence Directorate, I bear full responsibility for the failure. What needs to be investigated, we will investigate in the deepest and most poignant way and draw conclusions. Haliva is the latest Israeli defence official to publicly state that they take responsibility for the Hamas attack, after the head of the Shin Bet security agency and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff made similar remarks in recent days. Here are some of the latest images we have received over the newswires from Gaza and Israel. About 3,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October, according to the latest update from the Palestinian health ministry. A further 12,500 people had been injured, it said. In the West Bank, 61 people had been killed and more than 1,250 wounded. Health officials in Gaza said the only oncology hospital in the Palestinian territory will shut down in 48 hours at the latest. A statement from Dr Sobhi Skik, the director general of the Turkish Friendship Hospital, said fuel shortages were impacting the facility\u2019s ability to provide care to cancer patients. The hospital will stop \u201clarge parts of its services\u201d, and the remaining part will shut down \u201cwithin 48 hours at the latest\u201d, leaving all cancer patients in Gaza without critical health care, the statement said. Hospitals in Gaza have \u201centered a stage of virtual collapse\u201d, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s health ministry said on Tuesday. Hello. This is L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong in Washington taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. You can contact me at leonie.chao-fong@theguardian.com. Joe Biden\u2019s high-stakes visit to the Middle East to avert an all-out war raises serious questions about the level and nature of the president\u2019s previous engagement in the region. Just as Israel suffered a total intelligence breakdown over the horrific Hamas attacks, diplomats stand charged with their own collective system failure, at the heart of which was treating the Palestinian issue as best managed, not solved. While the EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said \u201cthe world has failed miserably\u201d in the Middle East, the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, was forced to deny the Biden team took its eye off the ball when asked about his claim three weeks ago that the region was \u201cquieter\u201d than it had been in two decades. The case for the diplomats\u2019 defence will be that their hands were tied once the dominance of the Hamas military wing in Gaza came to be mirrored by the election of Israel\u2019s most right-wing government in history. Coupled with that was Donald Trump\u2019s focus on bribing Arab states to make peace with Israel while ignoring the political crisis, which only further sidelined Palestinians while emboldening their occupiers. Read the full story by the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, here. It is 6pm in Gaza City and in Tel Aviv. Here is a round-up of the latest headlines \u2026 US president Joe Biden is expected to visit the Middle East Wednesday, on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy that will take in meetings with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other officials in Tel Aviv. Biden will then move on to meet Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in Amman, Jordan. The UN human rights office said on Tuesday that Israel\u2019s siege of Gaza and its evacuation order there could amount to the international crime of the forcible transfer of civilians. \u201cWe are concerned that this order, combined with the imposition of a complete siege of Gaza, may not be considered as lawful temporary evacuation and would therefore amount to a forcible transfer of civilians in breach of international law,\u201d Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said. Ministry of health officials in Gaza said the overnight death toll was \u201cat least 80 people\u201d, and people were trapped in rubble after a night of Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip. The heaviest bombardments occurred in three areas in the south of Gaza: Khan Younis, Rafah and Deir el-Balah, and many of those killed were reported to be families who had evacuated from Gaza City in the north, as the Israeli military had instructed. A spokesperson for the UN\u2019s relief and works agency (UNRWA) has said \u201csupplies are dwindling\u201d in Gaza, amid fears \u201cwaterborne diseases are going to start spreading\u201d. Juliette Touma, the UNRWA director of communications, said: \u201cOur staff are also very, very tired. They have been impacted themselves by the war. Many of them lost loved ones, we have sadly at UNRWA lost 14 staff members and these numbers continue to increase. No place is safe in the Gaza Strip at the moment as the bombardments continue.\u201d Hamas has said a senior commander and member of its higher military council, Ayman Nofal, has been killed by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli air force also said he had been killed, stating: \u201cHe directed many terrorist attacks against Israel and the security forces, and he directed the targets of Hamas\u2019s rocket fire, specifically targeting areas populated by uninvolved civilians.\u201d More than a week on from Hamas\u2019s massacres in Israel, more than 350 bodies of suspected civilian victims still have not been identified, according to Dr Chen Kugel, the director of Israel\u2019s National Center of Forensic Medicine. Some bodies were burned beyond recognition and others had decayed badly before they were found. The IDF has said 199 families have now been notified that their loved ones are being held hostage. It is an increase of 40 families, from 155 notified at the time of the last update. Hamas has demanded the release of \u201c6,000 male and female prisoners in Israeli prisons\u201d in exchange for the hostages. A Hamas spokesperson said there were \u201cabout 200-250\u201d Israeli captives in Gaza, a number higher than that recognised by Israeli authorities. Hamas has released a video of Mia Schem, a 21-year-old French-Israeli woman taken hostage on 7 October. In the footage, Schem, whose injured arm is shown being treated by an unidentified medical worker, asks to be returned to her family as quickly as possible. The Israeli military issued a statement saying it was in constant touch with Schem\u2019s family and condemning Hamas as a \u201cmurderous terrorist organisation\u201d. It said it was using \u201call intelligence and operational measures\u201d for the return of the captives. France\u2019s foreign ministry described the video as \u201cvile\u201d. Turkey has said it is in talks with Hamas on the release of foreigners, civilians, and children held hostage by the group. A World Health Organization (WHO) official has said it believes there have been 2,800 deaths in Gaza, with 11,000 wounded. It says half are women and children. The WHO said there had been 115 attacks on health facilities in Gaza. Israel\u2019s health ministry has stated that 4,229 Israelis have been wounded since Hamas launched its attack on 7 October. An Israeli military spokesman said on Tuesday that the status of the Gaza Strip after Israel\u2019s planned ground assault would be a \u201cglobal issue\u201d for discussion by Israel\u2019s politicians and with other countries. The spokesperson said the military had \u201cpresented an operational plan\u201d to the Israeli cabinet but did not elaborate, adding: \u201cGaza borders other countries \u2026 so when we say things on the final status, they will combine the orders of the political level and the military.\u201d Spain has dismissed Israel\u2019s claims that some members of the acting coalition government have aligned themselves \u201cwith Isis-style terrorism\u201d by criticising Netanyahu\u2019s response to Hamas\u2019s atrocities and suggesting Israeli forces are committing genocide and war crimes in the Gaza Strip. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for today. I will be back with you tomorrow. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong to continue our coverage. The Israeli air force has posted to social media about the death of Ayman Nofal, which Hamas appears to have confirmed. The air force wrote: Air Force fighter jets, under joint intelligence guidance with the Shin Bet, killed one of the senior members of the Hamas terrorist organization, Ayman Nofal, who served as the commander of the Hamas central camps brigade in the Gaza Strip, and as the former head of Hamas\u2019s military intelligence. By virtue of his duties, he directed many terrorist attacks against Israel and the security forces, and he directed the targets of Hamas\u2019s rocket fire, specifically targeting areas populated by uninvolved civilians. In the past, he was involved in the production and development of weapons, promoted and was a partner in many terrorist attacks, and was even a partner in planning the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit. Reuters reports that Hamas has said a senior commander and member of its higher military council, Ayman Nofal, has been killed by an Israeli airstrike. The spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces has posted to social media to say that \u201can alert was activated in the north of the country\u201d and it is under review. UK lawmaker Layla Moran has told of her fears for relatives in the Gaza Strip, who she said were unable to move to safety inside what she described as an \u201copen-air prison\u201d. Moran is a member of parliament for the Liberal Democrat party, the fourth largest in the House of Commons, and the party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson. She became the UK\u2019s first MP of Palestinian heritage when she was elected in 2017, and said extended family had been forced to seek sanctuary in a church after their house was hit by an Israeli bomb following the Hamas attacks. Making a plea for the opening of humanitarian corridors, Moran said it was impossible for her elderly relatives to move to a place of safety where they would not be caught up in Israeli strikes on Hamas targets. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with the geography of Gaza as a whole. It\u2019s essentially an open prison, so you wouldn\u2019t be able to move easily from one place to another,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have heard that there are convoys of people trying to move that have also been hit and they just don\u2019t feel it\u2019s safe to move.\u201d Moran, whose immediate family are Palestinian Christians in the West Bank, and who has extended family in Gaza, said she and her sister were attempting to get news of their relatives every day. Her family were running out of food and had already been reduced to drinking dirty water. Read more of Ben Quinn\u2019s report here: UK lawmaker Layla Moran fears for relatives in Gaza Strip A British man has spoken of the agony of waiting for news of relatives still missing after the Hamas attack in Israel 10 days ago, after they came under attack during a morning walk. Arad Haggai, a surveyor based in Epping Forest, Essex, does not know if his uncle and aunt are alive, kidnapped or dead after Hamas attacked the Nir Oz kibbutz where they lived. Gad Haggai, 73, a retired chef and talented musician, and his wife, Judih Weinstein Haggai, 72, an English teacher and puppeteer originally from Toronto, Canada, were on their regular early morning walk when they messaged relatives to say they were under attack. The couple, US citizens who have four adult children, had left the kibbutz at about 6.30am on Saturday 7 October, their nephew said. \u201cAt about 6.50am Israel time, they sent a text to the kids, my cousins, that they were under rocket fire and they have to try to hide somewhere in the fields. There is a possibility that on Saturday morning, at 11am or 11.30am, there was a signal from Gaza, the phone was in Gaza. But we are not sure. We can\u2019t verify it 100%.\u201d Haggai said the family had not heard from the Israeli authorities whether the couple were among the 199 identified hostages taken by Hamas. They had not been located at any hospital, and the family could not be certain whether they were moved to Gaza as they could not discount the possibility Hamas had taken the couple\u2019s phones. Read more of Caroline Davies\u2019s report here: \u2018Nobody knows where they are\u2019: British man tells of helpless wait for news of Israeli aunt and uncle The charity ActionAid has criticised the lack of access to water in Gaza, emphasising that it poses a particular risk for mothers with young children. In a statement, Soraida Hussein-Sabbah, who is based in Ramallah in the West Bank, said: With water nearly running out throughout Gaza, the situation is critical, particularly for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Unable to access water \u2013 and amidst the continuous bombardments and displacement \u2013 dehydrated women will struggle to produce the milk they need to feed their babies and keep them alive. Access to water is universally recognised as a basic human right, meaning that the continued blockade of Gaza is a denial of the rights of women and children across Gaza. We\u2019re urgently calling for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza and the full and uninterrupted restoration of the water supplies from Israel into Gaza. Reuters has a quick snap that security sources in Lebanon say four people have been killed in southern Lebanon by Israeli shelling. The mother of 21-year-old Mia Schem spoke to journalists in Tel Aviv after Hamas\u2019s military wing released a video showing her kidnapped daughter having her arm wrapped with bandages and asking to be returned to her family as soon as possible. The family confirmed it was Schem who was taken from the Reim kibbutz, where she was attending the Supernova festival. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if she\u2019s dead or alive until yesterday,\u201d said her mother, Keren Schem. The release of the video of the hostage has been condemned as \u201cvile\u201d by the French foreign ministry. Reuters reports the ministry said in a statement that 11 French nationals were still missing and that \u201cseveral are very likely hostages of Hamas. [Mia Schem] is the case of a national whose vile staging by Hamas in a video France condemns.\u201d This map shows the direction that Gaza\u2019s citizens have been told to evacuate in by the Israeli authorities ahead of what is widely expected to be a ground operation from Israel into the Gaza Strip. Earlier Al Jazeera reported that the brunt of the overnight barrage from Israel into Gaza had been directed at Khan Younis, Rafah and Deir al-Balah in the south, and that many of those killed were reported to be families who had evacuated from Gaza City in the north, as the Israeli military had instructed them to do. Reuters reports the Hamas-run government media office said on Tuesday that the overnight death toll from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza had risen to 80. Earlier the World Heath Organization stated that there have been 2,800 deaths in Gaza, with 11,000 wounded, since 7 October, when Israel began retaliatory strikes for the attack Hamas launched on southern Israel. The actors Tilda Swinton, Steve Coogan, Miriam Margolyes, Maxine Peake and the director Mike Leigh are among more than 2,000 artists who have signed an open letter calling for a ceasefire in Israel and Gaza, and accusing western governments of \u201cnot only tolerating war crimes but aiding and abetting them\u201d. The letter says in part: Gaza is already a society of refugees and the children of refugees. Now, in their hundreds of thousands, bombarded from air, sea and land, Palestinians whose grandparents were forced out of their homes at the barrel of a gun are again being told to flee \u2013 or face collective punishment on an unimaginable scale. Dispossessed of rights, described by Israel\u2019s minister of defence as \u2018human animals\u2019, they have become people to whom almost anything can be done. Our governments are not only tolerating war crimes but aiding and abetting them. There will come a time when they are held to account for their complicity. But for now, while condemning every act of violence against civilians and every infringement of international law whoever perpetrates them, our obligation is to do all we can to bring an end to the unprecedented cruelty being inflicted on Gaza. We call for an immediate ceasefire and the opening of Gaza\u2019s crossings to allow humanitarian aid to enter unhindered. Artists for Palestine UK, which has organised the letter, was launched in 2015. It can be read in full here. Reuters has more detail of what is expected to happen on the US president, Joe Biden\u2019s, diplomatic mission to the Middle East. He is expected to leave Washington this evening. Biden is expected to spend part of Wednesday in Tel Aviv for talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other officials. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has already made two trips to Israel since the Hamas attack on 7 October. Biden is then expected to fly to Amman in Jordan for talks about accelerating humanitarian assistance to Gaza, where he will meet Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Reuters reports that the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said: \u201cHe\u2019ll make it clear that we want to continue working with all our partners in the region, including Israel, to get humanitarian assistance in and provide some kind of safe passage for civilians to get out.\u201d Earlier today Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah said it was a red line for his kingdom that there should be no displacement of Palestine\u2019s population into Egypt and Jordan as refugees. The UK prime minister\u2019s office has urged Israel to allow water into Gaza, while still refusing to clarify whether it believes the tactic to shut off the supply was in line with international law. PA Media reports the prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson told journalists: \u201cWe continue to urge Israel as a democracy we work closely with to act within international law in their actions, I think they are taking steps to do that. \u201cWe are in discussions and are keen to see water restored to the area. \u201cWe want to do everything possible to relieve the unfolding humanitarian issues in Gaza. Water is an important part of that.\u201d Earlier a spokesperson for the UN human rights office said it was concerned that the Israeli military\u2019s evacuation order combined with a complete siege of Gaza may amount to the crime against humanity of \u201ca forcible transfer of civilians\u201d. In another development in the UK, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is said to have told his cabinet that Hamas was responsible for the \u201cmurder and suspected abduction of British nationals\u201d. Asked if it is believed that some of the 10 missing British citizens may have been kidnapped, the PM\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic situation. I think, sadly, the full details of this attack are still becoming clear.\u201d Citing Jordan\u2019s state media, Reuters reports that Jordan on Wednesday will host a four-party summit in Amman with the US president, Joe Biden and Egyptian and Palestinian leaders to discuss the \u201cdangerous\u201d repercussions of the war in Gaza in the region and finding a political resolution. More details soon \u2026 Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Israel and Gaza. Reuters reports that a deputy commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, Ali Fadavi, has said on Iranian state media that: \u201cThe resistance front\u2019s shocks against the Zionist regime will continue until this \u2018cancerous tumour\u2019 is eradicated from the world map. Another shockwave is on the way, if Israel does not end atrocities in Gaza.\u201d Madrid has dismissed Israel\u2019s claims that some members of Spain\u2019s acting coalition government have aligned themselves \u201cwith Isis-style terrorism\u201d by criticising Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s response to Hamas\u2019s atrocities and suggesting Israeli forces are committing genocide and war crimes in the Gaza Strip. On Saturday, Ione Belarra, who serves as Spain\u2019s social rights minister and is the leader of Podemos, the junior partners in the socialist-led coalition, suggested the Spanish government should bring Netanyahu before the international criminal court to face war crimes charges. Belarra\u2019s views were echoed by her Podemos colleague Irene Montero, who is acting equality minister, and by Alberto Garz\u00f3n, Spain\u2019s acting consumer affairs minister. Although Israel\u2019s embassy in Madrid did not refer to any of the ministers by name, it put out an angry statement on Monday evening, accusing \u201ccertain elements\u201d in the Spanish government of aligning with Hamas and of putting Spain\u2019s Jewish communities in danger. It called on the socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to intervene and condemn his colleagues\u2019 \u201cshameful\u201d comments. \u201cThese remarks are not only absolutely immoral, they also endanger the safety of Jewish communities in Spain, exposing them to the risk of a greater number of antisemitic attacks and incidents.\u201d Spain, which holds the presidency of the EU council, responded with a strongly worded statement that accused the Israeli embassy of \u201cspreading falsehoods\u201d about some cabinet members.

It has just gone 1pm in Gaza City and in Tel Aviv. Here is the latest round-up of headlines from the Israel-Hamas war \u2026 The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday that Israel\u2019s siege of Gaza and its evacuation order there could amount to the international crime of the forcible transfer of civilians. \u201cWe are concerned that this order, combined with the imposition of a complete siege of Gaza, may not be considered as lawful temporary evacuation and would therefore amount to a forcible transfer of civilians in breach of international law,\u201d Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said. Ministry of health officials in Gaza have told Al Jazeera that the overnight death toll stands at \u201cat least 71 people\u201d, and that people are trapped in rubble after a night of Israeli bombardments on the Gaza Strip. The heaviest bombardments occurred in three areas in the south of Gaza: Khan Younis, Rafah and Deir el-Balah, and many of those killed were reported to be families who had evacuated from Gaza City in north, as the Israeli military had instructed. A spokesperson for the UN\u2019s relief and works agency (UNRWA) has said that \u201csupplies are dwindling\u201d in Gaza, amid fears \u201cwaterborne diseases are going to start spreading\u201d. Juliette Touma, the UNRWA director of communications, said \u201cOur staff are also very, very tired. They have been impacted themselves by the war. Many of them lost loved ones, we have sadly at UNRWA lost 14 staff members and these numbers continue to increase. No place is safe in the Gaza Strip, at the moment as the bombardments continue.\u201d US president Joe Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday, in a significant show of US support. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, concluded hours of talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Tel Aviv early on Tuesday by saying that Biden would visit Israel. \u201cThe president will hear from Israel what it needs to defend its people as we continue to work with Congress to meet those needs,\u201d Blinken told reporters. Blinken said the US and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to get humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza without benefiting Hamas. More than a week on from Hamas\u2019s massacres in Israel, more than 350 bodies of suspected civilian victims still have not been identified, according to Dr Chen Kugel, the director of Israel\u2019s National Center of Forensic Medicine.

Now we fight,\u201d the Shin Bet director, Ronen Bar, said in a statement. Egypt will host a summit of state leaders to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Saturday. Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah warned against trying to push Palestinian refugees into Egypt or Jordan, adding that the humanitarian situation must be dealt with inside Gaza and the West Bank. \u201cThat is a red line, because I think that is the plan by certain of the usual suspects to try and create de facto issues on the ground. No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\u201d the king said at a news conference after a meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin. Scholz called for preventing an escalation in the Middle East, and said: \u201cI expressly warn Hezbollah and Iran not to intervene in the conflict.\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said bombardments in Gaza must stop immediately. He said Israeli officials should be tried for their crimes committed against Palestinians in Gaza, and claimed no one would be able to stop Muslims around the world and resistance forces if Israel\u2019s crimes in Gaza continue.

Israel\u2019s military is still looking into the killing of a Reuters journalist in Lebanon near the blue line marking the boundary with Israel, a spokesperson said on Tuesday. \u201cThe Reuters event, we\u2019re still looking into it. I\u2019m looking at the footage and we\u2019ll come out with an answer when we\u2019re ready. A tragic event,\u201d Reuters reports Lt Col Richard Hecht told a regular press briefing. Issam Abdallah, a Reuters visual journalist, was killed on Friday when rocket fire hit a group of reporters who had been covering cross-border clashes between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters. Several other journalists were wounded. A few hours after the killing of two Swedish football fans in Brussels on Monday by a suspected terrorist, Italian authorities carried out a counter-terrorism operation that led to the arrest of an Egyptian citizen and an Italian citizen of Egyptian origin accused of being members of the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group. According to the police, the two suspects were active in propaganda activities, were trying to recruit potential affiliates online and were financing support initiatives for IS, the Milan prosecutor\u2019s office said. \u201cThis morning two people were arrested on charges of terrorism,\u201d the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told RAI-Radio Anch\u2019io, citing that the alert level had already been raised and authorities were working to prevent potential threats. Following the war between Israel and Hamas, Italy has warned of potential terrorist attacks in Europe. \u201cItaly is doing everything that needs to be done to guarantee the safety of our citizens, starting with those who are Jewish,\u201d Tajani told RTL radio. \u201cThere is no imminent risk but nothing should be underestimated,\u201d the defence minister, Guido Crosetto, said on Saturday, adding that Italy must prepare for the security consequences of the war between Israel and Hamas and that he was considering cancelling the celebrations for Italian Armed Forces Day on 4 November this year due to heightened security risks. The interior minister, Matteo Piantedosi, said that \u201cdifficult, complicated months are certainly ahead of us, which make it right to maintain a high level of attention\u201d. Early on Tuesday, a 30-year-old of north African origins armed with a knife was arrested in Turin near a synagogue, causing panic among those present. The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday that Israel\u2019s siege of Gaza and its evacuation order there could amount to the international crime of the forcible transfer of civilians. \u201cWe are concerned that this order, combined with the imposition of a complete siege of Gaza, may not be considered as lawful temporary evacuation and would therefore amount to a forcible transfer of civilians in breach of international law,\u201d Reuters reports Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said. The term \u201cforcible transfer\u201d describes the forced relocation of civilian populations and is a crime against humanity punishable by the international criminal court. Jewish parents in Britain should continue to send their children to school, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UK has said, after security fears have led to a number closing their doors. Tzipi Hotovely said there had \u201cobviously\u201d been a rise in antisemitism in the wake of the Hamas attacks on Israel, but she added: \u201cThis is my message: send your children to school and support Israel.\u201d The ambassador also told the LBC news radio station in the UK that most of those killed in the Hamas attacks had been tortured before they died, making the recognition process more difficult. \u201cThose atrocities we\u2019ve seen just in the dark times in the Jewish history, like under the Nazi regime in the Holocaust. And this is why everyone is so shocked from this barbarism,\u201d she added. Pressed on whether the Israeli government owed people an apology over the lack of awareness and security arrangements that allowed the attacks to take place on such a scale, Hotovely replied: \u201cWell, no doubt that everyone should take a serious investigation about those events. I mean, there is no doubt that there will be a serious investigation.\u201d Here is our latest report on the hostage video released by Hamas, with the identity of the kidnapping victim now known: Hamas has released a video of Mia Schem, a 21-year-old French-Israeli woman taken hostage during the devastating attack on Israel on 7 October. In the footage, Schem, whose injured arm is shown being treated by an unidentified medical worker, asks to be returned to her family as quickly as possible. A representative of the family, who were among a group of French families that appealed last week to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to help free their missing relatives, confirmed her identity to Reuters. The Israeli military issued a statement, saying it was in constant touch with Schem\u2019s family and condemning Hamas as a \u201cmurderous terrorist organisation\u201d. It said it was using \u201call intelligence and operational measures\u201d for the return of the captives. \u201cIn the video, Hamas is trying to portray itself as a humane organisation, while it is responsible for the murder and abduction of babies, women, children and elderly,\u201d it said. In the 78-second video, which was broadcast on Hamas\u2019s Telegram channel, Schem says she is in Gaza, is being given medicine and wants to go home. It is unclear when it was filmed.

The town is adjacent to the UN-drawn blue line which has divided Israel and Lebanon since 2000. An Israeli military spokesman said on Tuesday that the status of the Gaza Strip after Israel\u2019s planned ground assault would be a \u201cglobal issue\u201d for discussion by Israel\u2019s politicians and with other countries. \u201cWe\u2019ve had all kinds of end games,\u201d Daniel Hagari told media during a news briefing, in response to a question about whether Israel\u2019s military planned to stay and govern Gaza after its ground invasion. \u201cThe cabinet is also discussing what that could look like \u2026 this is also a global issue, what the situation will look like in this region,\u201d he said. Hagari said the military had \u201cpresented an operational plan\u201d to the Israeli cabinet but did not elaborate. \u201cGaza borders other countries \u2026 so when we say things on the final status, they will combine the orders of the political level and the military,\u201d Reuters reports Hagari said. Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah on Tuesday warned against trying to push Palestinian refugees into Egypt or Jordan, adding that the humanitarian situation must be dealt with inside Gaza and the West Bank. \u201cThat is a red line, because I think that is the plan by certain of the usual suspects to try and create de facto issues on the ground. No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt,\u201d Reuters reports the king said at a news conference after a meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin. During a joint press conference, Scholz called for preventing an escalation in the Middle East, and said: \u201cI expressly warn Hezbollah and Iran not to intervene in the conflict.\u201d On its social media feed the Israel Defence Forces have reported further shooting into Israel from Lebanon. More details soon \u2026 Israel has a \u201cmoral and practical responsibility\u201d to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, the UK\u2019s development minister has said. Andrew Mitchell also described the situation in the territory as a \u201clooming humanitarian crisis\u201d as he said \u201call of us must hope\u201d that the US and the Israelis are able to reach an agreement that paves the way for the opening of the Rafah crossing into Egypt from Gaza. \u201cIf there is a plan, I\u2019m sure that it will be possible for the Egyptians to agree to it opening,\u201d the minister told Times Radio. He also said that some form of \u201csafe zone\u201d in southern Gaza would be required to deliver the aid that was needed, though he warned that such initiatives had a \u201cchequered past\u201d, recalling Rwanda and Srebrenica. His comments come 24 hours after the Israeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, told Sky News in the UK that there is \u201cno humanitarian crisis\u201d. Asked by the Sky News presenter Kay Burley on whether Israel had a right to \u201ccross any border\u201d and go so far as targeting Hamas leaders who are in Qatar, Mitchell said: \u201cThe Hamas leaders are guilty of the most heinous crime and the Israeli government will either hunt them down and bring them to justice or they will be killed during the course of the military action that takes place.\u201d King Abdullah II of Jordan and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, are giving a joint press conference at the moment. I\u2019ll bring you any key lines that emerge. Ministry of health officials in Gaza have told Al Jazeera that the overnight death toll now stands at \u201cat least 71 people\u201d, and that people are trapped in rubble after a night of Israeli bombardments on the Gaza Strip. Al Jazeera reports that the heaviest bombardments occurred in three areas in the south of Gaza: Khan Younis, Rafah and Deir el-Balah, and that many of those killed are families who had evacuated from Gaza City. The government media office in Gaza told the news outlet: The losses of the current Israeli aggression exceed all the wars that Gaza has been exposed to in recent years. The catastrophic humanitarian reality in Gaza is unprecedented. The international community must take serious and immediate steps to stop the crime of ethnic cleansing. We demand a quick response to distress calls by bringing relief aid to citizens and humanitarian aid to the service sectors. A spokesperson for the UN\u2019s relief and works agency (UNRWA) told the BBC that \u201csupplies are dwindling\u201d in Gaza, amid fears \u201cwaterborne diseases are going to start spreading\u201d. Asked what her colleagues in southern Gaza are currently able to provide, Juliette Touma, the UNRWA director of communications, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThey continue to provide assistance wherever possible. UNWRA is overwhelmed. We are overwhelmed. Our supplies are dwindling and running out fast. \u201cOur staff are also very, very tired. They have been impacted themselves by the war. Many of them lost loved ones, we have sadly at UNRWA lost 14 staff members and these numbers continue to increase.\u201d Asked if they are operating out of facilities that are reasonably safe from Israeli bombardment, she said: \u201cSo no place is safe in the Gaza Strip, at the moment as the bombardments continue.\u201d She said UNRWA teams were operating from an \u201covercrowded\u201d warehouse in southern Gaza with \u201chundreds of people sharing one toilet\u201d, adding: \u201cOur own staff have had to ration drinking water to one litre.\u201d She said: \u201cIn some parts of southern Gaza there was running water as of last night but the water situation is a huge concern. Most of Gaza in fact, the vast majority of Gaza, does not have running water. We are fearful that, waterborne diseases are going to start spreading and are going to start spreading soon.\u201d She said that \u201cUNRWA has not been able to bring in any supplies, including fuel into the Gaza Strip\u201d. The Israeli airforce has posted on social media to claim that it has killed four people who were approaching the country\u2019s perimieter fence from the direction of Lebanon. It wrote: The airforce a short time ago thwarted an attempted infiltration by a terrorist squad, which was identified by IDF surveillance approaching the perimeter fence from Lebanese territory and planting a bomb. Four terrorists were eliminated. It attached a video to the message which it claimed showed the incident. The claims have not been independently verified. At least 49 Palestinians were killed in an overnight Israeli strike that hit homes in Khan Younis and Rafah, Reuters reports Gaza\u2019s interior ministry said on Tuesday. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. I will be with you for the next few hours. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. It is almost 9am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here is where things stand: US president Joe Biden will visit Israel on Wednesday, in a significant show of US support. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, concluded hours of talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Tel Aviv early on Tuesday by saying that Biden would visit Israel. \u201cThe president will hear from Israel what it needs to defend its people as we continue to work with Congress to meet those needs,\u201d Blinken told reporters. Blinken said the US and Israel had agreed to develop a plan to get humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza without benefiting Hamas. Blinken made the announcement after hours of negotiations with Netanyahu that stretched into the early hours of Tuesday. 600,000 Gazans have been evacuated from the Gaza City area, following warnings from Israel\u2019s military on Friday, according to Israel Defence Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus. In a daily update, Conricus said more than 600,000 people had been evacuated from the Gaza City area, but that 100,000 people still had not left. Israel has warned people to leave the Gaza City area ahead of what it says will be \u201cenhanced military operations\u201d in the coming days. Conricus said the operations would start \u201cwhen the timing suits the goal\u201d. More than a week on from Hamas\u2019s massacres in Israel, more than 350 bodies of suspected civilian victims still have not been identified, according to Dr Chen Kugel, the director of Israel\u2019s National Center of Forensic Medicine. Some bodies were burned beyond recognition and others had decayed badly before they were found. An emergency meeting of the heads of EU member states has been called on Tuesday in an effort to \u201charmonise\u201d the bloc\u2019s response to the conflict in Israel and Gaza after a week of dysfunction and division. The IDF said 199 families have now been notified that their loved ones are being held hostage. It is an increase of 40 families, from 155 notified at the time of the last update, he said. He did not say how many hostages this translates to. The increase is not because more hostages have been taken but because new information came to light allowing people to be taken off the list of missing and confirmed as hostages. Asked whether Biden\u2019s visit will delay ground operations, Conricus said that he does not know, but that he does not think it will. The aim of Biden\u2019s visit is not to \u201chinder\u201d Israeli operations, he said. \u201cIt is to minimise the chances of a regional escalation.\u201d Conricus also said he does not believe there is any plan for Israel to ultimately \u201chold on to the Gaza Strip\u201d. The IDF spokesperson was asked during that briefing what there is to stop Hamas fighters going south, too. He said this is \u201cvery difficult\u201d and is \u201cone of the downsides\u201d of Israel advertising that it is going to commence enhanced military operations and telling civilians where to go. Hamas demanded the release of \u201c6,000 male and female prisoners in Israeli prisons\u201d in exchange for hostages it took during its attacks on 7 October. The group\u2019s captives include \u201chigh-ranking officers\u201d of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), Khaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas\u2019s diaspora office, said. A Hamas spokesperson said there were \u201cabout 200-250\u201d Israeli captives in Gaza, a number higher than the earlier statement from the Israeli military that said it had confirmed 199 hostages. Hamas released a video on Monday showing a statement from one of the captives seized in last week\u2019s attack. In the footage, the woman, whose injured arm is shown being treated by an unidentified medical worker, asks to be returned to her family as quickly as possible. Iran warned on Monday of a possible \u201cpre-emptive action\u201d against Israel \u201cin the coming hours\u201d, as Israel readies for a ground offensive on the Gaza Strip. Tehran has repeatedly warned that a ground invasion of the long-blockaded Gaza would be met with a response from other fronts \u2013 prompting fears of a wider conflict that could draw in other countries. \u201cThe possibility of pre-emptive action by the resistance axis is expected in the coming hours,\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in a live broadcast to state TV, as he referred to his meeting with the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on Saturday. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, on Monday spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, and reiterated the US\u2019s commitment to avoiding an escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and emphasised civilian safety, the Pentagon said in a readout. The head of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency took responsibility for the Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,400 people on 7 October. \u201cThere will be time for investigations. Now we fight,\u201d the Shin Bet director, Ronen Bar, said in a statement. More now from Gaza\u2019s main hospital: For over a decade, the grounds of the hospital have largely been spared from bombardments, apart from a strike that hit Shifa\u2019s outpatient clinic in 2014. Instead, a wide area outside the doors to the emergency room welcomes the television crews, local politicians, healthcare workers and civilians who gather there, amid the sound of ambulance sirens and the constant sight of patients arriving on stretchers. But this time, despite recent efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross to renovate Shifa\u2019s emergency room, the current crisis has tested the hospital to its limits. Last week, Israeli officials ordered a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d of the Gaza Strip, cutting off supplies of water, food, and fuel, meaning Shifa risks losing not just losing mains power to the hospital but also the diesel supplies needed for its backup generators. Days later, the Israeli military issued an evacuation order for all 1.1 million people north of the Gaza River including Gaza City, demanding that they flee south. Shifa hospital, along with several other medical facilities, said evacuating would be impossible. The World Health Organization called the order to evacuate hospitals a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for the thousands of sick and injured. White House officials bristled about whether Biden would ask Netanyahu and Israel officials to show restraint or set any conditions on any new US military aid that could be in the pipeline. \u201cWe are not putting conditions on the military assistance that we are providing to Israel,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cThey have a right to defend themselves. They have a right to go after this terrorist threat.\u201d Israel is also preparing for the potential of a new front opening on its northern border with Lebanon, where it has exchanged fire repeatedly with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group. The military ordered residents of 28 Israeli communities near the border to evacuate. European Union leaders will hold an emergency summit on Tuesday as concern mounts that the war between Israel and Hamas could fuel tensions in Europe and bring more refugees in search of sanctuary. AFP: The Israel-Hamas war is set to overshadow the Frankfurt book fair this week after the postponement of a Palestinian author\u2019s award ceremony sparked condemnation from top writers and the withdrawal of several Arab groups. The world\u2019s biggest publishing trade event begins on Wednesday, just over a week since Hamas launched the deadliest attack in Israel\u2019s history, prompting Israel to respond with a relentless bombing campaign of the Gaza Strip. Organisers swiftly denounced the Palestinian militants\u2019 \u201cbarbaric\u201d assault and rushed to reorganise the schedule, pledging Israeli voices would feature prominently. The fair \u201cstands with complete solidarity on the side of Israel\u201d, its director, Juergen Boos, said in a statement. But the run-up to the five-day event has been overshadowed by a backlash after an award ceremony for the Palestinian author Adania Shibli was postponed. She was due to receive the LiBeraturpreis, a German award, for her book A Minor Detail, based on the real events of a 1949 rape and murder by Israeli soldiers. It is organised by Litprom, which gives out the honour each year at the fair, but the group said they had decided not to go ahead with the ceremony \u201cdue to the war started by Hamas\u201d. It said in a statement that it was looking for a \u201csuitable format and setting for the event at a later point\u201d, while insisting that \u201cawarding the prize to Adania Shibli was never in question\u201d. However, in an open letter released on Monday, more than 600 signatories including high-profile authors, publishers and literary agents, condemned the move. With the stakes so high, member states are increasing their efforts to keep foreign policy coordinated and on track and will meet by video on Friday afternoon to progress plans for humanitarian support and other issues. Insiders say there would have been no emergency summit were it not for a series of missteps in the last week in Brussels. There have been criticism of the European Commission president Von der Leyen\u2019s forthright statements on Israel. She repeatedly defended the country\u2019s right to defend itself in the fact of a terrorist attack but it was days before she also called on Israel to respect international law in its defence. Such an omission caused anger in some countries, while others complained in phone calls to Michel\u2019s team about overreach and the commission\u2019s failure to consult it on such an important foreign policy topic as Israel. An emergency meeting of the heads of EU member states has been called on Tuesday in an effort to \u201charmonise\u201d the bloc\u2019s response to the conflict in Israel and Gaza after a week of dysfunction and division. As fears grow over the risk of a wider war and a humanitarian catastrophe in the region, EU member states admit they have struggled to put on a united front as they did in February 2023 when Russia invaded Ukraine. The European Council president, Charles Michel, issued a joint statement on Sunday after a weekend of frantic calls to all 27 member states, but after a week of rows over funding for Palestine and Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s visit to Israel, insiders say the lack of coordination in the past week cannot continue. There are concerns that the conflict in Israel and Gaza will weaken the coalition of support that the EU had built in the global south involving countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. It could also impede efforts to advance the Ukrainian peace process. Japan will provide $10 million in emergency aid for civilians in Gaza, foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa said on Tuesday. Japan is the current president of the Group of 7 developed nations and Kamikawa said it was monitoring the situation in Gaza \u201cwith concern\u201d, adding that Japan expects the situation to be calmed down as soon as possible. Kamikawa said she was also making final preparations for talks with her Iranian counterpart. More from that AP analysis now: In Cairo this weekend, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi was one of a succession of Arab leaders to warn Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is scrambling through Middle East capitals to try to contain the conflict, that the Israel-Gaza war threatens the stability of the entire Middle East. Biden is likely to hear the same as he meets with leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority in Jordan on Wednesday, after he travels to Israel. Sissi, who fears the Israeli military offensive will push Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people across the border into Egypt, cast blame on the near-disappearance of any international pressure on Netanyahu\u2019s government and Palestinians to return to negotiations. Sissi cited \u201ca buildup of outrage and hatred for more than 40 years\u201d and the lack of any \u201chorizon to solve the Palestinian cause; one that gives hope to the Palestinians\u201d for a state with a capital in East Jerusalem. Arab leaders \u201care very aware this is going to keep blowing up. And they might ride it out this time, they might ride it out next time, as they have in the past,\u201d said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, Lebanon. \u201cBut it\u2019s not actually a comfortable position for them to be endlessly living in,\u201d with endless cycles of Israeli and Palestinian wars that threaten the region\u2019s peace and economies, said Sayigh, who accused the US of encouraging Netanyahu to think there was no need to address Palestinian concerns. The Associated Press has spoken to experts and academics about what the conflict says about Biden\u2019s diplomacy in the Middle East: From its first months in office, the Biden administration made a distinctive decision on its Middle East policy: It would deprioritise a half-century of high-profile efforts by past US presidents, particularly Democratic ones, to broker a broad and lasting peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Since Richard Nixon, successive US administrations have tried their hands at Camp David summits, shuttle diplomacy and other big-picture tries at coaxing Israeli and Palestinian leaders into talks to settle the disputes that underlie 75 years of Middle East tensions. More than other recent presidents, Joe Biden notably has not. Instead, administration officials early on sketched out what they called Biden\u2019s policy of quiet diplomacy. They advocated for more modest improvements in Palestinian freedoms and living conditions under Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s hardline government, which has encouraged settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and which includes coalition partners that oppose the US-backed two-state solution. The less-ambitious approach fit with Biden\u2019s determination to pivot his foreign-policy focus from Middle East hotspots to China. But the long-term risks of sidelining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have exploded back into view. More now on Biden\u2019s upcoming visit to Israel: Biden will travel to Israel for talks with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday as concerns grow that the Israel-Hamas war could spiral into a regional conflict. The US president\u2019s plans to travel to Tel Aviv were announced by US secretary of state Antony Blinken as the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip grows more dire and as Israel prepares for a ground attack on the enclave to root out Hamas militants behind what US and Israeli officials have called the most lethal assault against Jews since the Holocaust. \u201cHe is coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region and for the world,\u201d Blinken said early on Tuesday, after more than seven hours of talks with Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials. During those talks, he was forced to shelter in a bunker for five minutes when sirens went off. Hamas releases first hostage video as senior figure says it has \u2018what it needs\u2019 to free all Palestinian prisoners Read more Israel would brief Biden on its war aims and strategy, said Blinken, and on how it will conduct operations \u201cin a way that minimises civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hamas.\u201d At Gaza City\u2019s Dar Al Shifa hospital, the living sleep between beds filled with patients, in corridors, and even in the grounds, while the dead overflow the morgue. The name Dar Al Shifa translates as \u201chouse of healing\u201d, and tens of thousands have sought not just healing but shelter from the bombardments that rained down on Gaza City every hour, praying the hospital might provide some protection. Printed blankets have been hung from the entrance courtyard\u2019s iron handrails to provide shade, while some people have gathered around the stairwells with their children and all that remains of their belongings. Shifa is not just Gaza\u2019s largest medical facility, but the nerve centre of its entire healthcare system, and the Israeli assault on the territory has brought it to breaking point. Local authorities and aid groups in Gaza estimate that between 35,000 and 40,000 people are sheltering there. \u201cThe doctors have brought their families into the hospital for safety. I slept on an operating room table last night,\u201d said Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, one of the surgeons, speaking to the Guardian by phone. More than a week on from Hamas\u2019s massacres in Israel, over 350 bodies of suspected civilian victims still have not been identified, according to Dr Chen Kugel, the director of Israel\u2019s national institute of forensic medicine. Some bodies were burned beyond recognition and others had decayed badly before they were found. Thousands of people are desperately waiting for news of loved ones and for remains they can bury, a particularly urgent concern as Jewish tradition requires a rapid burial, and formal mourning can begin only after the funeral. Kugel, speaking nine days after the attacks, fears that the rate at which they can give families answers may slow as they reach the most damaged bodies, and some victims may never be identified. \u201cWe did a lot of work in the past nine days \u2026 Now we are at a peak, the rate of identification will decline as we are reaching the hard cases,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there will be some [victims] that we will never find, and we will never be able to identify \u2026 People have to be prepared for this.\u201d The scale of the work is overwhelming, with dozens of bodies \u2013 or in some cases collections of human remains so damaged they are barely recognisable \u2013 arriving at the forensic institute on Monday in a refrigerated truck. Meanwhile Japan\u2019s Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa is in the final process of arranging a telephone discussion with her Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian on Tuesday, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said. Japan maintains a friendly relationship with Iran. In September, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi in New York and told that Japan will continue its diplomatic efforts toward easing tensions and stabilising the situation in the middle east. 600,000 Gazans have evacuated the Gaza City area, following warnings from Israel\u2019s military on Friday, according to Israel Defence Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus. In a daily update, Conricus said that more than 600,000 people have evacuated the Gaza City area, but that 100,000 people still had not left. Israel has warned people to leave the Gaza City area ahead of what it says will be \u201cenhanced military operations\u201d in the coming days. Conricus said the operations will start \u201cwhen the timing suits the goal\u201d. UNRWA said 170,000 people were sheltering at its schools in the north when the order to leave came early on Friday. But it couldn\u2019t evacuate them and doesn\u2019t know if they remained. More than 40,000 have crowded in the grounds of Gaza City\u2019s al-Shifa Hospital and surrounding streets, hoping it will be safe from bombardment. UNRWA said Monday it received reports that the Hamas-run Ministry of Health removed fuel and medical equipment from its evacuated compound in Gaza City. Hamas urged people to ignore the evacuation order. The Israeli military on Sunday released photos it said showed a Hamas roadblock preventing traffic from moving south. US President Joe Biden will visit to Israel on Wednesday, in a significant show of US support. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken concluded hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv early on Tuesday by saying that Biden would visit Israel. \u201cThe president will hear from Israel what it needs to defend its people as we continue to work with Congress to meet those needs,\u201d Blinken told reporters. Biden would meet with Netanyahu, reaffirm Washington\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s security, and receive a comprehensive brief on its war aims and strategy, Blinken said. \u201c(The) president will hear from Israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimizes civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hamas,\u201d Blinken added. Blinken also said he and Netanyahu had agreed to develop a plan to get humanitarian aid to Gaza civilians. He did not provide details. US officials said that a new US coordinator on humanitarian aid, David Satterfield, would work with Israel to develop more concrete plans. This is the Guardian\u2019s rolling coverage of the Israel-Hamas war with me, Helen Sullivan. The top developments: US President Joe Biden will travel to Israel and on to Jordan Wednesday to meet with both Israeli and Arab leadership, as concerns increase that the raging Israel-Hamas war could expand into a larger regional conflict. Biden said on X, \u201cOn Wednesday, I\u2019ll travel to Israel to stand in solidarity in the face of Hamas\u2019s brutal terrorist attack.\u201d Biden is looking to send the strongest message yet that the US is behind Israel. Blinken made the announcement early Tuesday after more than seven hours of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials. Blinken said that the United States also secured assurances from Israel on working to bring foreign assistance into the impoverished and blockaded Gaza Strip as Israel prepares a ground offensive against the Hamas-ruled territory. US officials said that a new US coordinator on humanitarian aid, David Satterfield, would work with Israel to develop more concrete plans.

Tehran has repeatedly warned that a ground invasion of the long-blockaded Gaza would be met with a response from other fronts \u2013 prompting fears of a wider conflict that could draw in other countries. \u201cThe possibility of pre-emptive action by the resistance axis is expected in the coming hours,\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in a live broadcast to state TV, as he referred to his meeting with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Saturday. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, and reiterated the United States\u2019 commitment to avoiding an escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and emphasised civilian safety, the Pentagon said in a readout. The head of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency took responsibility for the Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,400 people on 7 October. \u201cThere will be time for investigations. Now we fight,\u201d Shin Bet director Ronen Bar said in a statement."

            "content": "A former Bolivian president and his defence minister have agreed to pay damages to the families of people killed by the military during their government, in a landmark settlement that sets a precedent by which other foreign leaders could face accountability for human rights abuse in US courts. The settlement concerns events in 2003, when massive protests broke out over then president Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada\u2019s plan to export Bolivia\u2019s natural gas. The army was sent to clear blockades in the largely Indigenous and working-class city of El Alto, killing more than 60 protesters and injuring hundreds. Both S\u00e1nchez de Lozada and his defence minister, Jos\u00e9 Carlos S\u00e1nchez Berzain, resigned and fled to the US, where they have lived ever since. In 2007, a civil lawsuit was brought against them in the US by eight Bolivian families whose relations were killed in 2003. Eleven years later, a federal jury found them responsible for the killings and awarded the plaintiffs $10m in compensatory damages. Both defendants appealed, but as a result of the agreement on Thursday, they have withdrawn their appeal and agreed to pay an undisclosed sum in compensatory damages to the families. \u201cWith this agreement, the jury verdict remains intact,\u201d said Thomas Becker, the human rights lawyer who led the legal action. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the most important part: to send this message that no leader can kill their people and then use the US as a refuge.\u201d S\u00e1nchez de Lozada had close connections to the US: the son of an exiled diplomat, he was raised and educated in the Washington DC area. He later made his fortune through various oil and mining ventures and twice became president of Bolivia. Under subsequent administrations, Bolivia\u2019s supreme court indicted the former president and requested his extradition to Bolivia, but the requests were not accepted by the US. Asl\u0131 B\u00e2li, a law professor at Yale Law School who was not involved in the case, agreed that it set an important precedent. \u201cWhen someone this high-profile is held accountable, it sends a message,\u201d said B\u00e2li. \u201cFirst, to human rights violators, that the US will not be a safe haven, and no one is above the law. But also to victims and survivors, in Bolivia and around the world, that there are more avenues for accountability than they might realise.\u201d The case was brought under the Torture Victim Protection Act, a law that expanded US jurisdiction to cases of torture or extrajudicial killings committed outside its territory. It is, according to B\u00e2li, the most promising away to bring human rights accountability cases like this to court in the US. Such cases are few and far between because of their complexity, and the time and resources required to see them through. \u201cWith a high-profile victory like this one, we might now have more funding and resources become available to support the kinds of public interest organisations that bring these cases,\u201d said B\u00e2li. \u201cI think there is a good chance we will see more cases like this,\u201d she added."

            "content": "Timothy Garton Ash\u2019s plea for Joe Biden to step aside reveals the hollowness at the core of much of centrist ideology (Unless Joe Biden stands aside, the world must prepare for President Trump 2.0, 29 September). Garton Ash is wholly correct in pointing out that concerns about Biden\u2019s age and fitness have played a meaningful role in his dismal approval ratings heading into next year\u2019s presidential election. However, his emphasis on youth, absent anything of actual substance, betrays the centrist obsession with narratives and optics that artificially inflated the failed presidential primary campaigns of figures such as Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg. The three contenders that Garton Ash puts forward as potential replacements for Biden \u2013 governors Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom \u2013 are united only by their youth relative to Biden. While age certainly appears to be an issue to US voters, it is hard to see how simply having a younger Democratic candidate for president would have the impact that Garton Ash imagines. How would Shapiro, Whitmer or Newsom \u201crejuvenate the image of the US in the world\u201d? Garton Ash doesn\u2019t say. Public opinion of the US, especially in the global south, is based largely on what the country does, not the identity of the person occupying the Oval Office. Biden stepping down would probably be in the best interests of the Democratic party and the country. As a Canadian, I know all too well the global implications of who the US president is, but a candidate with little to offer beyond being younger than Biden is not the answer that the US or the world needs. David Beamish Bonn, Germany \u2022 Like Timothy Garton Ash, I spent two months this summer in the US, and sadly can echo most of what he writes about President Biden. I would add two points, however. First, Donald Trump\u2019s support in the states I visited \u2013 Iowa, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas \u2013 is visceral and implacably opposed to liberal outreach. They will not be persuaded by better arguments. They cannot be swayed by a buoyant economy. They will vote for Trump and they must therefore be defeated. This reality has to be recognised if the Democratic candidate is to win in November 2024. Second, the possible Democratic candidates that Garton Ash mentions \u2013 Shapiro, Whitmer and Newsom \u2013 cannot defeat the Trump campaign: they have no national profile, they have no political base outside their states, and they show no stomach for the vicious fight that awaits them. No liberal does. There is a Democrat who can win, if she can be persuaded to run again: Hillary Clinton. She commands nationwide support, retains international recognition and won\u2019t be cowed by Trump. But, most of all, Clinton will fight relentlessly. Consensus building can wait for 2028. Only political conflict will save us from Trump 2.0 in 2024. Dr Gareth Jones Hong Kong \u2022 Unusually, Timothy Garton Ash has gotten this completely wrong. Joe Biden stepping aside would start a frenzied fight within the party for the nomination for an election only a year away, generating hard feelings and attack lines for Republicans to use in the election. Taking Mr Garton Ash\u2019s advice is the surest way for Donald Trump to win. Lee Hartmann Ann Arbor, Michigan, US \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "title": "Almost 40% think Australia should dump US alliance if Donald Trump returns as president, poll finds",
            "date": "2023-10-31T14:00:19Z",
            "content": "A significant minority of Australians think the country should withdraw from the overall Anzus security alliance with the US if Donald Trump returns to the White House, while just under half of the respondents in a new poll believe the Aukus pact locks Australia in to supporting the US in any armed conflict. The findings, to be released on Wednesday, are part of an opinion survey undertaken annually by the United States Studies Centre. YouGov surveyed 1,019 adults in Australia, 1,055 in the US and 1,015 in Japan about a range of foreign policy and security questions related to the Indo-Pacific. The new survey finds 37% of Australian respondents feel Australia should dump the US alliance if Trump returns to the presidency next year (43% disagree with that idea), and 47% believe Aukus locks Australia in to supporting the US in an armed conflict. Last year, 63% of Australian respondents to the US Studies Centre annual poll said they believed Canberra\u2019s security alliance with Washington made the nation more secure. That\u2019s dropped by nine points in 12 months. In 2023, 54% of respondents articulate that view. While 46% of Australian respondents think Aukus will be good for creating jobs in Australia, and 49% agree with the statement \u201cit is a good idea for Australia to have nuclear powered submarines\u201d \u2013 42% feel the program is not worth the $368bn cost. Coalition voters are more likely than Labor voters to think the Aukus pact will make Asia safer (60% of Coalition voters say this compared with 44% of Labor voters). Across all Australian respondents, 43% say the submarines will make Asia safer, while a significant chunk (42%) either don\u2019t know or aren\u2019t sure whether or not that will be the case. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup While a majority (51%) of Australian respondents believe China is mostly harmful in Asia, Australians are less worried than they were a year ago about the risks of being drawn into an armed conflict with Beijing sometime over the coming decade. In 2022, 58% of Australian respondents to the survey thought that proposition was either very or somewhat likely. But after the steady thaw in diplomatic relations between Canberra and Beijing over the past 12 months, and the release of Australia\u2019s defence strategic review in April, 49% say that now. A majority of Australian respondents (63%) believe China will become the most economically and militarily influential country in Asia over the coming couple of decades (32% say the US will be the pre-eminent power). More than half Australian respondents (57%) believe that eventuality would be bad. The new poll findings follow Anthony Albanese\u2019s return from an official visit to Washington and ahead of the prime minister\u2019s trip to Shanghai and Beijing at the end of this week. Australia\u2019s pursuit of the Aukus pact is a response to rising strategic competition in the region. During Albanese\u2019s recent trip to the US, the president, Joe Biden, sought to play down congressional jitters over the nuclear-powered submarine deal, and he revealed he assured the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that the countries involved are not aiming to \u201csurround China\u201d. Seven months after Albanese joined Biden and the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in San Diego to announce the Aukus plans, there remains uncertainty over congressional approvals needed for them to succeed. While Biden told reporters during the visit he was confident the required legislation would pass, he declined to provide a personal guarantee of success. Albanese said he remained \u201cvery confident of a very positive outcome\u201d. As well as the complication of congressional dysfunction, doubts about Australia\u2019s willingness to join forces with the US in a war against China are also being cited by congressional researchers as a potential obstacle to the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine deal. Albanese\u2019s looming visit to China will coincide with the 50th anniversary of the first visit to the country by Gough Whitlam in 1973. Asked on Tuesday whether or not he was walking a diplomatic tightrope between the strategic competitors \u2013 Washington and Beijing \u2013 the prime minister said Australians wanted him \u201cto be direct about our interests\u201d. \u201cChina knows that we\u2019re in an alliance with the United States,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThey know that we\u2019re a nation that stands up for human rights and for the rule of law, and they expect us to do that. I\u2019ve been direct about that.\u201d He said Australia wanted to stabilise the diplomatic relationship with China and to get trade going again between the two countries. Australia and China would \u201ccooperate wherever we can \u2026 disagree where we have differences and [be] open and honest about them and can talk those issues through\u201d. \u201cWe have different political systems, of course, and different values, but it always makes sense to have dialogue and to be talking.\u201d"
