            "content": "In late December 2014, a team from Cambridge Analytica flew to Madrid for meetings with a handful of old and new contacts. A member of the former Libyan royal family referred to as \u201cHis Royal Highness\u201d was there. So, too, was the son of a US billionaire, a Nigerian businessman and a private Israeli intelligence operative. For Alexander Nix, the Etonian chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and his new employee Brittany Kaiser, who networked like most other people breathed, there may have been nothing unusual about such a gathering. But, by any other measure, it was an unlikely ensemble, not least because last week the identity of the intelligence operative was revealed to be Tal Hanan: an Israeli \u201cblack ops\u201d mercenary who, it is now known, claims to have manipulated elections around the world. Hanan, who operates using the alias \u201cJorge\u201d, has boasted of meddling in more than 30 elections. His connection to the now defunct Cambridge Analytica offers a revealing insight into what appears to have been a decades-long global election subversion industry. Hanan\u2019s group, \u201cTeam Jorge\u201d, was unmasked by an international consortium of media, including the Guardian and Observer, which revealed the hacking and disinformation tactics it uses to try to sway elections. Three reporters in Israel went undercover, pretending to be consultants trying to delay an election in a politically unstable African country. They secretly filmed more than six hours of Team Jorge\u2019s pitches, including a live demonstration by Hanan showing how he could use hacking techniques to access the Telegram and Gmail accounts of senior political figures in Kenya. Hanan did not respond to detailed requests for comment but said: \u201cTo be clear, I deny any wrongdoing.\u201d Previously unpublished emails leaked to the Observer and Guardian proved that Hanan had interfered in the 2015 Nigerian presidential election, in an attempt to bolster the electoral prospects of then incumbent president Goodluck Jonathan \u2013 and discredit Muhammadu Buhari, his main rival. And he did it in coordination with Cambridge Analytica. There is no suggestion that Jonathan knew of either Cambridge Analytica or Team Jorge\u2019s ultimately failed attempts to get him re-elected. And the campaign had nothing to do with the hack of Facebook data that propelled the company into the headlines in 2018. Instead, its most salient feature was a classic dirty tricks campaign. Team Jorge obtained documents from inside the opposition campaign of Buhari that could later be leaked to the media. Cambridge Analytica did the leaking. That episode has been drawn sharply into focus in recent days. But one name so far not mentioned has been that of Sam Patten, the consultant who managed Cambridge Analytica\u2019s campaign on the ground in Nigeria. Three years later, Patten would come to be known as a cooperating witness in Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election. A former state department official, Patten was ultimately charged and pleaded guilty to acting as an unregistered foreign agent to a Ukrainian oligarch. And among a memorable cast of characters who wound up as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation, Patten\u2019s business partner, Konstantin Kilimnik, stood out: he was a Russian spy. A spy who allegedly passed polling data \u2013 processed by Cambridge Analytica \u2013 from the Trump campaign to Russian intelligence in 2016 and planted false narratives about Ukraine in the 2020 election. Kilimnik was later subjected to sanctions by the US Treasury, which described him as a \u201cknown Russian intelligence services agent implementing influence operations on their behalf\u201d. He has denied that he worked for Russian intelligence. A campaign so dirty it panicked staff Close readers of the Observer may fuzzily recall some elements of this story from our coverage of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. In the news frenzy that followed the Observer and New York Times revelations about the illicit (and now known to be illegal) heist of millions of people\u2019s Facebook data, one story got lost in the mix. Four days after the original report in the Observer, we published a series of follow-up stories in the Guardian about a campaign so dirty that, even at the time, employees worried that they were implicated in illegal activity. This was the Nigeria campaign that resurfaced this week, with the unmasking of Hanan finally solving the mystery of the identity of the \u201cIsraeli consultants\u201d referenced in the story. In 2018, some employees knew Hanan as \u201cJorge\u201d but his true identity was unknown. Kaiser, grilled by MPs in parliament, said she could not \u201crecall\u201d his name, and she did not know about his activities until after the event. Emails leaked to the Guardian and Observer reveal when Nix asked her the real name of \u201cJorge\u201d from \u201cthe Israel black ops co\u201d in May 2015, she replied: \u201cTal Hanan is CEO of Demoman International.\u201d Kaiser told the Observer that her parliamentary testimony had been a \u201cdaunting experience\u201d, adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t remember the name of the Demoman company when asked.\u201d She said she had no prior knowledge of the methods Team Jorge would end up using in Nigeria, and downplayed her role in the campaign. Cambridge Analytica and Team Jorge were, she said, working \u201cseparately but in parallel\u201d for the same client \u2013 the Nigerian businessman both sides had met during the gathering in Madrid. \u201cAlexander flew in for this one to pitch the Nigerians and separately so did Jorge,\u201d Kaiser recalled. After the Madrid meeting, Kaiser said, she was not involved in any \u201coperational matters with Jorge\u201d in relation to the Nigeria campaign, which was led by a team on the ground. \u201cI sent some emails to put everyone in contact with each other and sort out who was doing what as time was short,\u201d she added. The emails suggest that Patten would, as part of his role at Cambridge Analytica, take responsibility for exploiting the material that Hanan obtained from the Nigerian opposition. Despite anxiety over the material, which panicked staff had assumed had been \u201chacked\u201d, someone at Cambridge Analytica combed through the documents, looking for dirt on the opposition candidates. And it was Patten who appears to have leaked select documents to BuzzFeed and the Washington Free Beacon. \u2018Ghost\u2019 campaign in Nigeria In January 2015, Patten found himself parachuted into Abuja, Nigeria, to lead a last-minute $1.8m \u201cghost\u201d campaign for SCL (Cambridge Analytica) in support of President Jonathan and against Buhari. Kaiser had helped land the contract in her first weeks with the company. In her memoir, Targeted, she writes that it was her friend, a former Libyan prince, who introduced her to \u201cwealthy Nigerian oil industry billionaires\u201d who wanted a last-minute anonymous campaign to help get Jonathan re-elected. Emails obtained by the Observer show that Kaiser\u2019s travel schedule in December 2014, when she was helping seal the contract, was a whirlwind of meetings across three continents with highly placed contacts and a complicated web of different, though often overlapping, projects. One was the last-minute attempt to affect the outcome of the west African election. While the wealthy Nigerian client hired Cambridge Analytica and Team Jorge on separate contracts, the expectation was that both sides would coordinate. Within a fortnight of the Madrid meeting, Patten flew into Abuja. He is understood to have coordinated with others in the country against Buhari \u2013 among them Hanan, who sources say he met in a hotel in Abuja. Another Team Jorge operative working in Nigeria did so under the alias \u201cJoel\u201d. Hanan claimed in emails that they had entered the country on a \u201cspecial visa\u201d. A highly placed source told the Observer in 2017 that the Israeli contractors travelled on Ukrainian passports and that their fee for work in Nigeria \u2013 $500,000 \u2013 was transmitted via Switzerland into a Ukrainian bank account. A busy time for Sam Patten In press reports, Patten has said he was not involved in Cambridge Analytica\u2019s controversial data-targeting practices. The work he performed for the now defunct firm, he told New York magazine in 2019, was more \u201cstandard\u201d, described as analysis, speechwriting, ads and \u201cattempts to sway the media\u201d. But the consortium\u2019s investigation and previous reporting by the Observer suggest a different story. It was a busy time for Patten, whose work in Nigeria took place days before he founded a new company \u2013 Begemot Ventures \u2013 with Konstantin Kilimnik, the Ukrainian-born political consultant alleged to be a Russian intelligence agent by the US government. According to the emails, Patten flew to London at the end of January. That was where, according to the subject line of one email, a \u201cfinal sweep\u201d of the material that Team Jorge had obtained using deceptive measures was undertaken. There is no evidence that Patten knew about the nefarious methods through which that material had been obtained by the Israelis But others at the firm were alarmed. Cambridge Analytica employees who worked in the company\u2019s office in Mayfair, central London, told the Observer in 2018 how they had been given a thumb drive by two Israeli operatives, one of whom is now known to be Hanan. Employees described their panic when they realised they were looking at private emails that they assumed had been illegally hacked, with one said to have \u201cfreaked out\u201d. Kaiser told parliament that episode was \u201cconcerning\u201d. But she said she did not believe the emails had been \u201chacked\u201d in the classic sense, via computer, but by a person hired by the Israeli team to physically infiltrate the Buhari campaign and illicitly download them there. Whatever the case, it was Cambridge Analytica\u2019s job to search for dirt. We \u201ccontinue to analyse the information that we received from Jorge to see if there is anything that would ignite the international press\u201d, an employee told a representative of the client. \u201cIf we find something, then we will push it.\u201d Patten, it would appear, was focused on exactly that. The problem was that the data dump was disappointing. Referring to \u201cthe matter that brought us back to London\u201d, Patten asked colleagues: \u201cDid anyone come up with anything that could be of interest? My overall read is that, while a good insight into campaign thinking, there are few silver bullets or smoking guns.\u201d He added that he would \u201cuse the AKPD bits\u201d. That was a reference to emails revealing that AKPD Message and Media, the political consultancy founded by David Axelrod, a former chief strategist to Barack Obama, had briefly been hired by the Buhari campaign. \u201cWhat are our media pitch angles?\u201d Patten asked the next day, in an email enumerating three points, including that \u201cB\u2019s [Buhari\u2019s] actual positions are obscured by a slick \u2018change\u2019 campaign steered by well-heeled American consultants\u201d. Hours later, he sent another email: \u201cBoom. Story 1 in progress, background sources needed, off the record, who other than me can do?\u201d He then sent another email to clarify that he needed someone on the team to speak to a journalist to tell them Buhari, the leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was \u201crunning a tight, American-style campaign with discipline and a scripted message\u201d. Five days later, an article appeared in BuzzFeed headlined \u201cFirm founded by David Axelrod worked in Nigerian election as recently as December\u201d. It referenced \u201cemails between top APC officials obtained by BuzzFeed News\u201d, which echoed Patten\u2019s talking points. On the same day, another article appeared in the Washington Free Beacon that also referenced the leaked emails. It cited \u201ca series of emails\u201d obtained by the conservative news website \u201cbetween senior APC party members and advisers\u201d. BuzzFeed declined to comment. The Washington Free Beacon did not respond to a request for comment. When reached by phone, Patten said he had no recollection of a man named Tal Hanan or Jorge, and was \u201cnot involved\u201d in anything having to do with the \u201cIsraeli hackers\u201d who were previously the subject of media attention. When asked whether he had ever contacted reporters to discuss AKPD working for Buhari, he paused. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into that,\u201d he said, before ending the conversation. He did not respond to further requests for comment. Nix did not respond to questions, other than to say this newspaper\u2019s \u201cpurported understanding is disputed\u201d."

            "date": "2023-02-23T11:00:00Z",
            "content": "Chief election officials in several states want to make it illegal for someone to knowingly spread false information about an election, a move that raises questions around first amendment protected speech. The Democratic secretaries of state for Michigan and Minnesota told the Guardian they\u2019re supporting legislation that would criminalize people who spread misinformation about an election. Michigan\u2019s secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, said the law would prevent people from tweeting that Election Day is on a Wednesday or saying that voting machines are insecure, when they know that information to be false. Benson said that since she took office in 2019, she has seen an increase in people lying to voters about their rights, which she considers an election security threat. \u201cWe have to hold those folks accountable, otherwise it\u2019s going to continue and it will harm our democracy,\u201d she said. Most states already prohibit interference with the election process in some manner, but the specificity in the laws when it comes to the spread of misinformation or the use of deceptive practices before an election varies from state to state. Minnesota secretary of state Steve Simon, also a Democrat, is supporting a bill proposed in his state that would prohibit anyone within 60 days of an election from causing \u201cinformation to be transmitted by any means that the person intends to impede or prevent another person from exercising the right to vote; and knows to be materially false\u201d. The legislation clarifies that \u201cincludes but is not limited to information regarding the time, place, or manner of holding an election; the qualifications for or restrictions on voter eligibility at an election; and threats to physical safety associated with casting a ballot\u201d. Any person who violates the law is guilty of a gross misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail and up to a $3,000 fine. \u201cIt isn\u2019t criminalizing speech,\u201d Simon said. \u201cNo one wants to do that. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s right, within limits of course of the first amendment, to think something and say what they think. This is different. This is a bill aimed at interference with the election process.\u201d Colorado secretary of state Jena Griswold, who leads the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, said the focus must be on protecting people\u2019s first amendment rights. \u201cWe have to safeguard the freedom of speech while also safeguarding Americans having the right facts about elections,\u201d she said. The proposed laws come in the absence of federal protection against election misinformation. Democrats in Congress have proposed the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act, most recently in 2021, which would prohibit deceptive practices, false statements, and voter interference regarding federal elections. But the legislation, which was first proposed by then Senator Barack Obama in 2007, has stalled. The type of misinformation being criminalized is critical to whether or not the laws would violate the first amendment. Paul Smith, an election lawyer and senior vice-president of the Campaign Legal Center, said that spreading false information with the intention of interfering with an election would be the campaign equivalent of fraud, which is not protected by the constitution. \u201cThose kind of lies, that get people to lose their right to vote or vote differently than they otherwise would because you deceived them, would be pretty unprotected,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinction between criminalizing the lies that George Santos told about his educational background and criminalizing things that are actually trying to induce people to mess up in their vote in a way that causes them to not have the right to vote,\u201d he added. But lies about the security of voting machines \u2013 an example Benson from Michigan gave as one of the types of speech she would want included in a new law \u2013 would be murkier and may not be protected by the first amendment. \u201cYou could make an argument that if people don\u2019t trust the machines, they won\u2019t show up to vote,\u201d Smith said. But he pointed out that this talking point has become popularised by conspiracy theorists and former president Donald Trump. \u201cPeople like Trump say it all the time, so it\u2019s in the grey area.\u201d Voting rights groups including the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and Common Cause have in the past advocated for laws against deceptive practices that would protect voters from misleading information about voting in the lead up to an election. They note that deceptive practices, like distributing flyers or sharing social media posts with false information about voter eligibility, often target non-white voters in minority neighbourhoods. \u201cIt is an insidious form of vote suppression that often goes unaddressed by authorities and the perpetrators are virtually never caught,\u201d the groups wrote in a 2018 report. Ahead of the 2022 election, voters in at least five states reported getting text messages directing them to the incorrect polling location. The company that sent them said they were done in error, but previous attempts at misleading voters before an election have been found to be deliberate. In 2004, flyers were posted around minority neighbourhoods in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, purportedly from the \u201cMilwaukee Black Voters League\u201d saying that: \u201cIf you\u2019ve already voted in any election this year, you can\u2019t vote in the presidential election.\u201d The flyers also claimed that \u201cif anybody in your family has ever been found guilty of anything, you can\u2019t vote in the presidential election\u201d, and if you violate these laws, \u201cyou can get 10 years in prison and your children will get taken away from you\u201d."

            "date": "2023-02-28T14:00:09Z",
            "content": "Lawyers for Crikey, which is being sued for defamation by Lachlan Murdoch, are considering the implications for its defence of the admission by Rupert Murdoch that Fox News hosts endorsed Donald Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 US election was stolen. Crikey\u2019s publisher Private Media has confirmed the deposition in the US defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News is being examined by its legal team ahead of Crikey\u2019s amended defence being filed on 7 March but declined to comment further. The federal court trial has been set down for October and will run for three weeks, with Lachlan Murdoch, the chief executive of Fox Corporation, expected to attend at least some of the proceedings. Murdoch was granted leave last month to expand the case to add Private Media\u2019s chairman Eric Beecher and its chief executive Will Hayward as respondents. Murdoch launched defamation proceedings against the independent Australian news site last year over an article published in June that referred to the Murdoch family as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator\u201d in the US Capitol attack. The article Murdoch claims is defamatory argued the former US president Richard Nixon was infamously the \u201cunindicted co-conspirator\u201d in the Watergate scandal and drew an analogy that \u201cthe Murdochs and their slew of poisonous Fox News commentators were the unindicted co-conspirators\u201d in the events of 6 January 2021. In the separate US case, the voting machine company Dominion has accused Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corporation, of maligning its reputation. Both cases revolve around the influence of Fox News commentators on the US Capitol attack. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Court documents revealed on Tuesday show Rupert Murdoch acknowledged that the Fox News hosts Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro \u201cendorsed\u201d the false narrative promoted by Trump. Murdoch acknowledged in his deposition that he could have ordered the network not to platform Trump lawyers such as Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani on its programs: \u201cI could have. But I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. Prof David Rolph, a defamation expert at the University of Sydney\u2019s law school, said the Dominion revelations could affect the public interest defence which Crikey is running. \u201cThose revelations just further emphasise that the subject matter of the Crikey article that\u2019s being sued on was a legitimate matter of public interest,\u201d Rolph told Guardian Australia. \u201cPublic interest defence in Australia, though, will turn on the reasonableness of the publisher\u2019s belief in the publication of the article. Obviously, the subject matter of the article is a matter of public interest, but the defence in this matter is a bit more than that.\u201d Private Media has pleaded three defences: public interest, implied freedom of political communication and failure to accept reasonable offer of amends. Rolph said in the US the plaintiff bore the onus of proof and had to show that the material was published with actual malice, which is a much higher standard than Australia and other common law jurisdictions. \u201cWhat is very interesting about those revelations is that makes it clear Dominion is going to have a fairly good chance at establishing liability,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I think it would seem odd if on the one hand in the United States Dominion succeeds, and here in Australia Crikey doesn\u2019t with its public interest defence. \u201cThe laws in the two places are different, but I think people will draw conclusions about the relative protection of reputation and freedom of speech if that\u2019s the outcome in the United States and Australia. It was earlier revealed in court filings that hosts at Fox News privately ridiculed Trump\u2019s claims that the 2020 election was stolen while simultaneously peddling the same lies on air. Dominion sued Fox News in March 2021 and November 2021 in Delaware superior court, alleging the cable TV network amplified false claims that its voting machines were used to rig the 2020 election against Trump."

            "title": "Northern Ireland assembly election to be delayed again",
            "date": "2023-02-09T16:37:20Z",
            "content": "Elections for the Northern Ireland assembly are to be delayed again, with a new deadline of 18 January next year for the Democratic Unionist party to return to power-sharing, the government has announced. The decision to delay the formation of an executive means Stormont could legally be in abeyance until 11 April 2024, 12 weeks after the government will be obliged to call an election under the proposed law. The Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, announced special legislation in parliament enabling the delay \u201cto allow time and space for the NI parties to work together to return to government\u201d. He said in a statement: \u201cHaving spoken to political representatives, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, I have concluded that another election at this time is not the best course of action to facilitate the restoration of the executive.\u201d He said it was disappointing for voters that Stormont had been in abeyance since last February, but that the resumption of power-sharing remained his focus. One Northern Ireland MP said it was the right move because it \u201cdecoupled\u201d the Stormont process from the dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol, which triggered the DUP\u2019s boycott of the devolved government. It would also mean a different narrative if the DUP rejected any potential UK-EU deal. Another, Stephen Farry, the MP for North Down, said: \u201cAny snap assembly election in the current context didn\u2019t make any sense, especially with UK-EU talks progressing. But he said the government could not allow drift. \u201cNorthern Ireland can\u2019t afford a political vacuum and the government seriously need to look at reform of the political institutions to stop any party vetoing their operation and denying Northern Ireland a government.\u201d Power-sharing has been suspended for almost a year, but the latest delay will not mean the return of direct rule. Instead the civil service will run the administration with budgets set in Westminster. But it will also raise questions about the much-anticipated visit by the US president, Joe Biden, and his special envoy, Joe Kennedy III, who has yet to set foot in Northern Ireland since his appointment on 19 December. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the proposed legislation but urged the government not to \u201ctake their foot off the pedal or back down on the pressure needed to reform and restore the assembly\u201d given the need to address hospital waiting lists, workers pay and energy costs. Many believe the DUP will oppose a new deal on the protocol widely expected in the coming weeks because it is unlikely to meet the seven conditions the party has set to end its boycott of the Stormont assembly. Under existing legislation Heaton-Harris was obliged to call an election by the end of the first week of March if he were to meet the legal deadline of mid April to form an executive. \u201cMy guess is the DUP are not going to come back to Stormont whatever the protocol deal because they will find something to oppose, but that they will return long-term because there is no other show in town,\u201d said one Northern Ireland MP. The Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill was introduced to parliament on Thursday and will be debated later in February. Heaton-Harris held round table talks with with the political parties in Belfast \u201cto urge them to restore the executive as soon as possible\u201d and update them on protocol talks. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 February 2023. An earlier version mistakenly said that the latest date for an election to be called would have been mid-December 2023 in order for the executive to be formed by 18 January 2024. However, 18 January is the last date an executive could be formed before the clock starts ticking on a 12-week period in which an election has to be called."

            "title": "Nigerians face tense wait in presidential election vote count",
            "date": "2023-02-26T18:51:45Z",
            "content": "Nigeria is in the midst of a tense wait as election authorities count tens of millions of votes that will determine who will become president in Africa\u2019s most populous country and control its national assembly. Voting on Saturday was marred by widespread delays and some scattered violence but fears of widespread chaos proved unfounded. Early hopes that official nationwide results could be expected from late on Sunday appear optimistic as a new system deployed by Nigeria\u2019s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has developed significant technical problems. The final election tally is expected by the middle of next week. Analysts speak of a \u201cbellwether\u201d election that could be a crucial turning point for Nigeria after several years of worsening insecurity and acute economic troubles. Many believe a credible poll and progress in tackling the country\u2019s multiple problems are key to stability across a swath of Africa. On Victoria Island in Lagos, Dennis Olatunji, a 42-year-old vendor, said he was worried a long delay to results could cause tensions to rise further. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a problem for everybody, whoever they voted for.\u201d Others shared his concern. \u201cLet Nigeria decide O! @inecigeria,\u201d the Nigerian Afrobeats musician winner Burna Boy wrote on Twitter. \u201cNo try any result magic.\u201d Eighteen candidates are vying to replace the outgoing two-term president, Muhammadu Buhari, but only three are considered to have a credible chance of winning power: Bola Tinubu, from the ruling All Progressives Congress; Atiku Abubakar, of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic party; and the Labour party\u2019s Peter Obi, who is leading in some polls. Tinubu, 70, and Atiku, 76, are seen as traditional politicians representing Nigeria\u2019s established political elite. Obi, 62, is considered a reformist who has reached across the country\u2019s faultlines to woo voters from all ethnic and religious communities. His challenge threatens the dominance of the two parties in power since the end of military rule in 1999, making Saturday\u2019s election the most competitive for decades. On Saturday, Obi said he was confident of victory. \u201cI have the mental capacity, energy and drive to lead this country. We need to get things right in Nigeria,\u201d the tycoon told reporters. Observers differed over the turnout, with no reliable counts yet available. Some early estimates suggest a high turnout, which would be expected to deliver a boost to Obi, who is popular among young people who make up about a third of the 87 million eligible voters. Tinubu, whose campaign slogan was \u201cit\u2019s my turn\u201d, said he was \u201ccertain of victory\u201d. Though the contest looks close, Nigerian electoral law makes a runoff unlikely as the winning candidate needs only a plurality of votes, provided they get 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the 36 states. The multiple delays, incidents of disruption and technological problems with the new voting systems have come in for fierce criticism. Yiaga Africa, a coalition of civil society groups, said it had concerns about \u201cvoter suppression and irregularities\u201d. \u201cIt gets to the point where we can no longer accept the excuses [of INEC],\u201d a spokesperson for the coalition said at a press conference on Sunday. \u201cIf the official results are manipulated at any point in the process we will be able to expose it.\u201d Senior electoral officials moved to allay concern.

            "content": "Nigeria is in the midst of a tense wait as election authorities count tens of millions of votes that will determine who will become president in Africa\u2019s most populous country and control its national assembly. Voting on Saturday was marred by widespread delays and some scattered violence but fears of widespread chaos proved unfounded. Early hopes that official nationwide results could be expected from late on Sunday appear optimistic as a new system deployed by Nigeria\u2019s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has developed significant technical problems. The final election tally is expected by the middle of next week. Analysts speak of a \u201cbellwether\u201d election that could be a crucial turning point for Nigeria after several years of worsening insecurity and acute economic troubles. Many believe a credible poll and progress in tackling the country\u2019s multiple problems are key to stability across a swath of Africa. On Victoria Island in Lagos, Dennis Olatunji, a 42-year-old vendor, said he was worried a long delay to results could cause tensions to rise further. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a problem for everybody, whoever they voted for.\u201d Others shared his concern. \u201cLet Nigeria decide O! @inecigeria,\u201d the Nigerian Afrobeats musician winner Burna Boy wrote on Twitter. \u201cNo try any result magic.\u201d Eighteen candidates are vying to replace the outgoing two-term president, Muhammadu Buhari, but only three are considered to have a credible chance of winning power: Bola Tinubu, from the ruling All Progressives Congress; Atiku Abubakar, of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic party; and the Labour party\u2019s Peter Obi, who is leading in some polls. Tinubu, 70, and Atiku, 76, are seen as traditional politicians representing Nigeria\u2019s established political elite. Obi, 62, is considered a reformist who has reached across the country\u2019s faultlines to woo voters from all ethnic and religious communities. His challenge threatens the dominance of the two parties in power since the end of military rule in 1999, making Saturday\u2019s election the most competitive for decades. On Saturday, Obi said he was confident of victory. \u201cI have the mental capacity, energy and drive to lead this country. We need to get things right in Nigeria,\u201d the tycoon told reporters. Observers differed over the turnout, with no reliable counts yet available. Some early estimates suggest a high turnout, which would be expected to deliver a boost to Obi, who is popular among young people who make up about a third of the 87 million eligible voters. Tinubu, whose campaign slogan was \u201cit\u2019s my turn\u201d, said he was \u201ccertain of victory\u201d. Though the contest looks close, Nigerian electoral law makes a runoff unlikely as the winning candidate needs only a plurality of votes, provided they get 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the 36 states. The multiple delays, incidents of disruption and technological problems with the new voting systems have come in for fierce criticism. Yiaga Africa, a coalition of civil society groups, said it had concerns about \u201cvoter suppression and irregularities\u201d. \u201cIt gets to the point where we can no longer accept the excuses [of INEC],\u201d a spokesperson for the coalition said at a press conference on Sunday. \u201cIf the official results are manipulated at any point in the process we will be able to expose it.\u201d Senior electoral officials moved to allay concern. Festus Okoye, INEC\u2019s national commissioner for information and voter education, told reporters that Nigerians could be confident results from the polling stations were \u201csafe\u201d. \u201cThe commission is aware of challenges \u2026 and regrets this setback,\u201d Okoye said on Sunday. \u201cThese results cannot be tampered with and any discrepancy between them and the physical results used in collation will be thoroughly investigated and remediated.\u201d Nigeria is contending with multiple intersecting crises including economic turmoil, extremism and criminality affecting much of the country.

            "date": "2023-02-14T14:06:00Z",
            "content": "The former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley is challenging her one-time boss for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. \u201cI\u2019m Nikki Haley, and I\u2019m running for president,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s former United Nations ambassador said in a video released on Tuesday. The 51-year-old\u2019s run \u2013 which was widely expected \u2013 breaks a promise she made two years ago to not challenge the ex-Republican president for the Oval Office. But she had indicated recently that she would go back on her word, saying the country\u2019s economy was too distressed for her to stand by, and that it needed a new generation of leaders \u2013 President Joe Biden is 80, and Trump is 76. As of Tuesday morning, no other major Republican candidate beside Trump and Haley had announced bids aiming to unseat Biden, who has said he intends to seek a second four-year term. Other Republicans expected to eventually join the fray include Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor; Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s former vice-president; Mike Pompeo, ex-secretary of state; and South Carolina senator Tim Scott. Haley is vying to become the first female president after a poll published last week found that her entry into a 2024 Republican primary would be enough to keep Trump ahead of his only current close rival: DeSantis. The Yahoo News/YouGov poll found DeSantis had a 45-41 percentage-point lead over Trump one-on-one. But with Haley entering the field, the poll cast her in the role of spoiler, finding that she drew 11%, DeSantis\u2019s support sagged to 35%, and Trump would come out on top with 38%. Perhaps to that end, Trump has met news of Haley\u2019s plans to run for the White House relatively cordially by his usual combative standards. Trump recently said he welcomed the competition from Haley, who called him about launching her presidential campaign. He claimed he told her: \u201cLook, you know, go by your heart if you want to run \u2026 You should do it.\u201d That represents a marked contrast from how Trump has attacked DeSantis since he emerged as a political threat. Trump recently said he would consider it \u201cvery disloyal\u201d for DeSantis to run against him, according to Politico. The Trump-allied super political action committee Make America Great Again \u2013 or Maga \u2013 Inc was much more pugnacious about Haley\u2019s announcement on Tuesday, calling her \u201cjust another career politician\u201d in a statement. The statement, attributed to former Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich, noted how Haley initially opposed the ex-president before serving in his administration. \u201cShe\u2019s telling us she represents a \u2018new generation\u2019,\u201d Budowich\u2019s statement said. \u201cSure just looks like more of the same \u2013 a career politician whose only fulfilled commitment is to herself.\u201d Haley also hopes to become the first US president of Indian descent. Her parents were Indian immigrants \u2013 and throughout her career, she has described suffering racist remarks about her upbringing while explaining how they have shaped her personal and political outlooks. She worked as an accountant before she successfully ran against the longest-serving member of South Carolina\u2019s state house of representatives in 2004. Haley spent three years in that role before running for governor of South Carolina. Endorsements from the outgoing incumbent at the time, Mark Sanford, and the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin \u2013 then a darling of the right \u2013 helped her become the first woman and minority to win the office of South Carolina governor. Then 38, she was also the youngest person in the US to become governor. Haley\u2019s ascent at the time landed her opportunities to speak at the 2012 Republican convention, and she was the party\u2019s pick to respond to Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 State of the Union speech. She was the US ambassador to the UN after Trump won the presidency in 2016, but she resigned in 2018. The Democratic party\u2019s national chairperson, Jaime Harrison, issued a statement after Haley\u2019s announcement saying that she has embraced \u201cthe most extreme elements\u201d of Trump\u2019s Maga agenda. \u201cShe \u2026 couldn\u2019t even identify a policy difference between herself and Trump,\u201d Harrison added. The statement also noted that the abortion ban which Haley signed as governor of South Carolina contained no exceptions for rape or incest. That ban took effect, along with other similar ones in many states across the US, after the supreme court last year eliminated the right to abortion that had been established by the landmark Roe v Wade decision. Additionally, Harrison said Haley endorsed a plan to end the federal Medicare program \u201cas we know it\u201d and refused to expand Medicaid to provide affordable healthcare for residents of her state. She did all that while also supporting tax cuts that benefit \u201cthe ultra wealthy and corporations\u201d, according to Harrison\u2019s statement. The Latino voters organization Voto Latino issued a similar statement, adding that Haley as South Carolina\u2019s governor signed \u201ca discriminatory and regressive \u2026 measure that allowed police officers to require the immigration papers of anyone [who] is stopped and suspected of being in the country without documentation\u201d. That measure was similar to a separate one in Arizona, Voto Latino\u2019s statement pointed out. Unlike Haley, Trump faces an array of legal perils. Among other problems, those perils include a sprawling federal investigation into his attempted subversion of his defeat to Biden in 2020, his alleged incitement of the deadly January 6 Capitol attack, and his retention of classified information. Before Tuesday\u2019s video announcement, Haley was expected to declare her 2024 presidential candidacy on Wednesday in Charleston. She is scheduled to soon head to New Hampshire, which has an early slot on the primary calendar. The Yahoo/YouGov poll which predicted Haley would be a spoiler in a Trump v DeSantis match-up, to the latter\u2019s detriment, did find that she attracted much more support than other potential Republican presidential candidates for 2024 \u2013 including Pence, Pompeo and the former Maryland governor Larry Hogan.

            "title": "Cyprus presidential election goes to runoff with ex-foreign minister in lead",
            "date": "2023-02-05T19:55:28Z",
            "content": "The race to become the eighth president of Cyprus will extend into a second week after the Mediterranean island\u2019s former foreign minister Nikos Christodoulides emerged as the frontrunner but failed to gain enough support to win outright. The 49-year-old independent will face Andreas Mavroyiannis, a veteran career diplomat backed by the leftist Akel party, in a runoff on 12 February. Results released by the interior ministry showed Christodoulides winning 32.04% of the vote in Sunday\u2019s election and an unexpectedly strong showing of 29.6% for his opponent. With all votes counted, Averof Neofytou, fielded by the centre-right Disy party of the twice-elected outgoing president, Nicos Anastasiades, trailed with 26.11%. The outcome will be seen as a surprise as Mavroyiannis was regarded as an outsider. A first-round win required a candidate to garner more than 50% of the vote. Christodoulides, who broke away from Disy to run his own campaign with the aid of parties traditionally tough on talks to solve the country\u2019s decades-old division, had been tipped to emerge as the victor although it had been predicted the first-round poll would not produce a clear winner. \u201cThe day after elections should find us all united,\u201d he told reporters after casting his ballot in his hometown of Paphos in the island\u2019s south-west, alongside his wife and four daughters. \u201cThe elections will end, but the challenges and problems lie ahead of us.\u201d A record 14 candidates ran for president. Others included the leading human rights lawyer Achilleas Demetriades, who had campaigned on a ticket of expediting peace talks with the island\u2019s internationally isolated Turkish Cypriot community living on the other side of a UN-patrolled ceasefire line. Demetriades gained 2.1% of the vote. Cyprus has been split since Ankara sent in troops in 1974, seizing its northern third in response to a coup orchestrated by the junta then in power in Athens aimed at uniting the country with Greece. A week of frantic horse-trading is expected to follow before next Sunday\u2019s runoff as the first-round winners try to bolster support by forming alliances with opponents who failed to get through. In a debate on the eve of the election, Christodoulides seemingly refused to rule out joining forces with any party including the ultranationalist Elam. \u201cA lot of people in Cyprus find the prospect of such an alliance, which would be a legitimisation of the far right, extremely worrying,\u201d said Christoforos Christoforou, a political analyst specialised in elections. \u201cAt 6.1%, Elam won more votes than opinion polls had forecast,\u201d he added. For seasoned Cyprus-watchers this is the most significant presidential poll since the country won independence from Britain 63 years ago. With peace talks deadlocked since 2017, commentators say it is the island\u2019s ethnic division that is ultimately at stake as concerns grow of its partition being formalised with each passing year. In an election campaign dominated by other issues \u2013 not least the cost of living crisis, migration and corruption \u2013 ever more Greek Cypriots, comfortable in the knowledge of their recognised state already being in the EU, appear to have given up on a settlement. Reunification efforts will require herculean efforts by the incoming president to persuade the international community that Cyprus\u2019s majority population not only wants to resume talks but is willing to make the concessions necessary to make a permanent peace possible. Since the collapse of the last UN-supported process aimed at creating a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation, Turkish Cypriots in the breakaway north have also hardened their stance with the election of a nationalist leader, Ersin Tatar, who has sought to reset the agenda by demanding a two-state solution. Chasms that have remained unbridgeable since the invasion have only widened. \u201cWhoever wins will face the challenge of having to convince the UN that resuming negotiations will produce results,\u201d said Christoforou. \u201cThis is the first time since 1974 that there has been such a long period without talks and since then both the atmosphere and situation on the ground has deteriorated dramatically.\u201d Christodoulides has proposed appointing a special EU envoy to facilitate negotiations, while Mavroyiannis, who led peace talks under Anastasiades, has suggested exploiting Cyprus\u2019s offshore natural gas deposits with Turkish Cypriots as a way of easing the process. About 560,000 Greek Cypriots were eligible to cast ballots although officials said only about 400,000 turned up at polling stations."

            "date": "2023-02-13T22:10:47Z",
            "content": "South Carolina senator Tim Scott is reportedly taking steps to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. Reporting the news, the Wall Street Journal cited anonymous sources \u201cfamiliar with his plans\u201d. Jennifer DeCasper, a senior adviser, said the senator was \u201cexcited to share his vision of hope and opportunity and hear the American people\u2019s response\u201d. A stringent conservative but also the only Black Republican in the US Senate, Scott, 57, has worked publicly if unsuccessfully with Democrats on attempts to agree to policing reform. Last August, he appeared to confirm his ambition for a presidential run. His book, America: a Redemption Story, contained small print including a description of \u201ca rising star who sees and understands the importance of bipartisanship to move America forward\u201d and saying \u201cthis book is a political memoir that includes his core messages as he prepares to make a presidential bid in 2022\u201d. Scott\u2019s publisher, Thomas Nelson, apologised for what it called an \u201cerror \u2026 not done at the direction or approval of the senator or his team\u201d. Concrete steps made by Scott have included appointing co-chairs of a fundraising Super Pac and plans to speak in South Carolina and Iowa, two early voting states. The report about Scott\u2019s plans came two days ahead of an expected campaign launch by another South Carolina Republican, Nikki Haley, a former governor who was US ambassador to the United Nations under Donald Trump. Still the only declared candidate for the 2024 nomination, Trump spoke in New Hampshire and South Carolina last month. He has already secured support from the other South Carolina senator, Lindsey Graham, the governor, Henry McMaster, and US House members. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, is Trump\u2019s only serious challenger in polling concerning the notional field, in which Scott generally scores 1% or less. Last week, a Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Haley performing better but splitting the anti-Trump vote, thereby handing victory to the former president in a putative three-way race. Trump has begun to attack DeSantis but has not turned his fire on Haley, despite her preparing to renege on a vow not to run if he did. Both Scott and Haley are often mentioned as potential vice-presidential picks, Haley representing youth and diversity (Haley is 51 and Indian American). On Monday, John Barrasso of Wyoming, chair of the Republican Senate conference, told the Journal that Scott \u201ctruly believes that God is great and America is great and we are provided with incredible opportunities. So I think a Ronald Reagan \u2018Morning in America\u2019 hopeful America vision is one that Tim has, lives and breathes and is really needed in our country.\u201d On the flip side, Ed Kilgore, a Democratic operative turned columnist, suggested Scott might actually have his eye on 2028. Scott, Kilgore wrote for New York Magazine, might really be \u201cengaging in a sort of starter presidential campaign in order to build contacts and positive name ID for a future run \u2026 a respectable start, a signature moment or two, and a graceful exit from the 2024 contest may be the real goal\u201d."

            "date": "2023-02-25T17:42:15Z",
            "content": "Polls have shut in Nigeria, after tens of millions cast their votes to decide a tight and unpredictable contest for the presidency and parliament of Africa\u2019s most populous nation and its biggest economy. The opening of more than half of all polling stations was delayed by at least an hour with many others suffering problems with new voting technology, civil society groups said. There was some sporadic violence across the country, including a suspected attack by Islamic extremists and some disruption by hired thugs. Fears of widespread chaos appeared unfounded as night fell, however. An official announcement of results could take between three and five days, but it is probable that the winner of the presidency will be obvious much sooner as the count of individual polling stations becomes known. In the commercial capital, Lagos, large numbers of voters waited cheerfully for much of the morning for election officials to arrive, often two or even three hours late. \u201cI am very excited. I have been looking forward to exercising my civil rights. I am looking for a better Nigeria,\u201d said Victoria Adeyemo, a 65-year-old lawyer, as she sat waiting for a voting station in the upmarket area of Ikoyi to open. In the poor and crowded neighbourhood of Mushin, electoral officials and party agents said polls had opened on time to welcome a rush of voters. Amaka Gloria, 27, said it was a \u201cbig relief\u201d that \u201ceveryone had been able to vote\u201d. Analysts have spoken of a \u201cbellwether\u201d election that could be a crucial turning point for Nigeria after several years of worsening insecurity and acute economic troubles. Many see a credible poll and progress in tackling the country\u2019s multiple problems as key to stability across a swath of Africa. About 300,000 police officers were deployed to protect 176,000 polling stations and a ban on all movement by road, water or air was imposed during the poll. Land borders have also been closed. Eighteen candidates are vying to replace the outgoing two-term president, Muhammadu Buhari, but the main contest is between 70-year-old Bola Tinubu, from the ruling All Progressives Congress; Atiku Abubakar, of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic party; and the Labour party\u2019s Peter Obi, who is leading in some polls. Tinubu and Abubakar, 76, have significant power bases across Nigeria. Both are seen as traditional politicians who have sought to mobilise voters with massive organisation and spending. \u201cTinubu is my father, Tinubu is my country. He has done good things for us,\u201d said Adeleke Adejoke Bililis, an unemployed 43-year-old, after voting at Eroko Street polling station on Lagos Island. \u201cHe is Yoruba like me so of course I vote for him,\u201d she said, naming the ethnic community that she and the candidate belong to. Obi is seen as a reformist willing to overhaul Nigeria\u2019s political system who has reached across the country\u2019s many ethnic and religious fault lines. The 61-year-old former businessman ran an insurgent campaign that relied on social media, word of mouth and the energy of his largely young following. But though recent surveys suggested Obi has between a 10% and 40% lead over his rivals, many experts warned a low turnout could mean victory for the ruling party\u2019s candidate. Nkechi Richards, a 35-year-old fashion designer in Lagos, said that though some of her friends shared her enthusiasm for Obi, many others \u201cwanted to stick to the familiar and fear the new\u201d. According to charts drawn up by Yiaga, a coalition of civil society groups which has deployed monitors, the delays to opening of polling stations were most severe in the south-east, where Obi is most popular. One significant factor is the new voting technology that identifies voters through fingerprints and facial recognition. Officials hope this will make the rigging that has historically marred polls in Nigeria much harder. Though the contest looks close, Nigerian electoral law makes a runoff unlikely as the winning candidate needs only a plurality of votes, provided they get 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the 36 states. Nigeria is suffering from multiple intersecting crises including economic turmoil, extremism and criminality affecting much of the country. In recent weeks, an effort to replace almost all Nigeria\u2019s bank notes \u2013 in part to reduce the widespread practice of vote buying \u2013 has caused massive economic disruption and much popular anger. More than 90 million Nigerians registered to vote, but only 87 million picked up the necessary documents to cast their ballots. However, analysts point out that this is the seventh poll held since the end of military rule in 1999 and that some Nigerian democratic institutions are growing stronger. That none of the main candidates are former military officers \u2013 a first for a Nigerian poll \u2013 is also seen as an achievement. It could also send a message to other leaders and ruling parties clinging to power on the continent. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 February 2023 to clarify that the winning presidential candidate needs only a plurality of votes, not \u201ca simple majority\u201d as an earlier version said."

            "content": "Early results in Nigeria\u2019s presidential and parliamentary elections have put the ruling party\u2019s candidate well ahead, but also revealed a surprise victory for the outsider Peter Obi in Lagos, the country\u2019s biggest city and commercial powerhouse. Analysts speak of a \u201cbellwether\u201d election that could be a crucial turning point for Nigeria after several years of worsening insecurity and acute economic troubles. Many believe a credible poll and progress in tackling the country\u2019s multiple problems are key to stability across a swath of Africa. Eighteen candidates hoped to replace the outgoing two-term president, Muhammadu Buhari, but only three are considered to have a credible chance of winning power: Bola Tinubu, from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); Atiku Abubakar, of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic party (PDP); and the Labour party\u2019s Obi. \u201cWhat Obi has done is pretty mind-boggling. He has disrupted the duopoly of two behemoths, two very rich and very powerful parties,\u201d said Prof Abiodun Adeniyi at Baze University, Abuja. Tinubu, 70, and Atiku, 76, are seen as traditional politicians representing Nigeria\u2019s established political elite. Obi, 62, is considered a reformist who has reached across the country\u2019s faultlines to woo voters from all communities and run a slick social media campaign to attract young voters. Provisional results from the Lagos state collation centre released on Monday gave Obi, who switched to the tiny Labour party from the PDP last year, a narrow win over Tinubu, with 582,454 votes to 572,606. \u201cThe results in Lagos are pretty extraordinary,\u201d said Adeniyi. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the fatigue Lagosians have with Tinubu, who has held the state for the last 20 years. Obi is coming from a distant place and \u2026 has shown his message of change resonates with Nigerians.\u201d Tinubu did appear to have won at least two other states with some ease, though Obi has done well in his power base in the south-east and made inroads elsewhere. The PDP is expected to hold on to most of its bastions, early reports suggested. Officials from the APC said on Sunday night that their own information showed that \u201cObi-dients\u201d, as supporters of Obi called themselves, were likely to be disappointed. \u201cOur candidate is coasting to victory. There is no pathway to Aso Rock Villa [the official residence and office of the Nigerian president] for Obi at the moment,\u201d one senior ministerial aide told the Guardian. This may not concern Obi too much, however, some observers say. He has made massive gains and the four years before the next election would allow him to build the political organisation necessary for victory. After news of the defeat in Lagos, Tinubu issued a brief statement calling for calm. \u201cAs a democrat, you win some, you lose some. We must allow the process to continue unhindered across the country while we maintain peace and decorum,\u201d he said. Nigeria\u2019s electoral commission is not expected to name an outright victor in the race to succeed Buhari for several days. Technical problems with a new electronic voting system meant only a fraction of votes cast on Saturday had been collated. The multiple delays, incidents of disruption and technological problems with the new voting system have prompted fierce criticism. Yiaga Africa, a coalition of civil society groups, said it had concerns about \u201cvoter suppression and irregularities\u201d. Independent observers on Monday issued a statement saying the election \u201cfell well short of Nigerian citizens\u2019 reasonable expectations\u201d but praising voters\u2019 \u201cextraordinary resilience and resolve to have their voices heard through the ballot\u201d. Though no reliable counts are yet available, some early estimates suggest there was high turnout, which would be expected to deliver a boost to Obi, who is popular among young people, who make up about a third of the 87 million eligible voters. However, in Lagos only a relatively small proportion of eligible voters cast their ballots. Though the contest looks close, Nigerian electoral law makes a runoff unlikely as the winning candidate needs only a plurality of votes, provided they get 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the 36 states. Nigeria is contending with multiple intersecting crises including economic turmoil, extremism and criminality affecting much of the country. In recent weeks, an effort to replace almost all Nigeria\u2019s banknotes \u2013 in part to reduce the widespread practice of vote-buying \u2013 has caused massive economic disruption and much popular anger. However, analysts point out this is the seventh poll held since the end of military rule in 1999 and that some Nigerian democratic institutions are growing stronger. That none of the main candidates are former military officers \u2013 a first for a Nigerian poll \u2013 is also viewed as an achievement. The decision of Buhari, 80, to respect the constitutional two-term limit has also been cited as a positive sign."

            "title": "Nigeria\u2019s opposition calls for election to be scrapped as results show Tinubu leading",
            "date": "2023-02-28T15:12:28Z",
            "content": "Nigeria\u2019s main opposition parties have called for the country\u2019s presidential election to be scrapped, alleging that results showing the ruling party\u2019s candidate in the lead had been manipulated. A slew of results during the day have put Bola Tinubu from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) well ahead of the main opposition Peoples Democratic party (PDP) candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and the outsider third challenger, the Labour party\u2019s Peter Obi. A Reuters news agency tally published late on Tuesday showed Tinubu had \u201can unassailable lead\u201d, citing provisional results from all 36 states and the federal capital Abuja. But the count has been hit by multiple technical and logistical problems that the Independent Nigerian Election Commission (Inec) appeared unable to resolve. A series of scheduled results announcements were delayed, with new updates released almost six hours late. \u201cThe election is irretrievably compromised and we have totally lost faith in the entire process,\u201d the Labour party chair, Julius Abure, told reporters at a press conference alongside PDP representatives. \u201cWe demand that this sham of an election should be immediately cancelled \u2026 We also call for a fresh election to be carried out. Electoral officials rejected the criticism. \u201cContrary to the insinuation by both parties, results emanating from the states point to a free, fair and credible process,\u201d Inec said in response. \u201cIt is only fair for aggrieved parties to allow the conclusion of the process and approach the courts with their evidences to pursue their cases.\u201d The election is the most competitive in Nigeria since the end of military rule in 1999. Tinubu, 70, and Abubakar, 76, are seen as traditional politicians representing Nigeria\u2019s established political elite. Obi, 62, is considered a reformist who has reached across the country\u2019s faultlines to woo voters from all communities and ran a slick social media campaign to attract the young. A running total of officially declared presidential votes, compiled by a local consultancy, Stears, showed Tinubu on 40%, with Abubakar on about 30% and Obi on 17% on Tuesday at about 4pm local time. Senior officials close to Tinubu have told the Guardian they are confident of victory and see \u201cno pathway\u201d for Obi to take power. Some results continue to surprise, however, such as Obi\u2019s victory in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest city and commercial powerhouse. Officials announced on Tuesday that Obi had also won in Abuja. Under Nigerian electoral law the winning candidate needs only a majority of votes, provided they get 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the 36 states. Experts warn that the problems with the count could lead to protracted action and even violence. \u201cPolitics is very much like a business in the minds of many actors. It\u2019s not about serving the people, it is about serving the self. So you see a very vociferous campaign and a great difficulty to accept defeat,\u201d said Prof Abiodun Adeniyi, an expert in politics and communication at Baze University, Abuja. On Monday night, Olusegun Obasanjo, the former president, warned of a \u201clooming danger ahead\u201d caused by the failure of systems that would electronically send results to a central computer. The results were \u201cnot a true reflection of the will of Nigerians who have made their individual choice\u201d, he said. Peter Sogbetun, a driver in Lagos, said: \u201cThey are rigging it. This is what the delay is about. I can get online and upload or download or whatever in one minute so what is taking them so long?\u201d. Election officials said the results had been fully authenticated and government loyalists accused the opposition of fomenting \u201clawlessness and anarchy\u201d. However, international observers have also criticised Saturday\u2019s vote, which was largely peaceful despite expectations of widespread chaos and violence. A team of observers led by Joyce Banda, the former president of Malawi, said delays on voting day, which led to many polling stations opening hours late, meant the election \u201cfell well short of Nigerian citizens\u2019 reasonable expectations\u201d. An EU mission said the failures \u201creduced trust in the process and challenged the right to vote\u201d. Nigeria is contending with multiple intersecting crises, including economic turmoil, extremism and criminality affecting much of the country. In recent weeks, an effort to replace almost all Nigeria\u2019s banknotes \u2013 in part to reduce the widespread practice of vote-buying \u2013 has caused massive economic disruption and much anger. However, analysts point out that seven elections have been held in succession and some Nigerian democratic institutions are growing stronger. That none of the main candidates are former military officers \u2013 a first for a Nigerian poll \u2013 is also viewed as an achievement. There have been concerns raised, however, about the limited number of women contesting the poll. Evin Incir, the head of delegation of the European parliament, said: \u201cI wish to express my concern that less than 10% of candidates were women. The next government and parliament should heed to the manifestos of the main political parties of Nigeria, which call for affirmative action, such as quotas.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-02T22:50:07Z",
            "content": "The A-Team of big tech \u2013 Apple, Amazon and Alphabet \u2013 all delivered disappointing results on Thursday a day after Facebook owner Meta bucked the gloomy trend in technology, delivering better-than-expected results. Apple shares slid more than 4% on Thursday after the company posted a disappointing first-quarter earnings report, including rare misses on revenue, profit and sales. The iPhone maker missed analyst expectations on profit for the first time in seven years, after strict Covid-19 lockdowns and related protests in China upended iPhone production at its biggest supplier. The company also marked its largest quarterly revenue drop in nearly seven years, posting $117.2bn \u2013 down 5.49% from last year when it reported record holiday sales. The number was lower than analysts\u2019 average estimate of $121.10bn. Apple alluded to ongoing headwinds in a press release accompanying the report, which observers are calling shocking. Strict lockdowns in China, which produces 90% of its devices sold globally, cost it approximately $4bn in lost sales in 2022. In a call with investors on Thursday, Cook said iPhone revenue would have grown in the quarter if not for these supply issues, but said production is back to pre-shutdown goals. For years, Apple has been seen as a safe haven for investment in the increasingly volatile tech space, but analysts say this report shows the tide may be changing. The company had warned in its October earnings call that it was anticipating a slowdown, with chief financial officer Luca Maestri citing \u201ccontinued uncertainty around the world\u201d. \u201cApple\u2019s poor quarter proves that even the most valuable US-traded company isn\u2019t immune to the challenges facing the tech industry at large,\u201d said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, adding that the report was \u201cshockingly weak\u201d. Amazon reported worse than anticipated earnings on Thursday while at Google parent Alphabet, a pull-back by advertisers hit the search giant\u2019s revenue. Amazon is facing a difficult reset after its pandemic boom and recently announced 18,000 job cuts. The tech and retailing giant reported a net loss of $2.7bn for 2022, compared to net income of $33.4bn a year before. The loss included a pre-tax loss of $12.7bn on its investment in electric vehicle maker Rivian. Net sales increased 9% to $514bn, compared to $469.8bn in 2021. The company\u2019s most reliable division, Amazon Web Services, reported sales of $21.4bn, an increase of 20% from a year earlier but below analysts\u2019 estimates. Alphabet narrowly missed analysts\u2019 expectations, signaling lower demand for its search advertising during a slowing economy. Sales at the company reached $63.1bn for the quarter, marginally below $63.2bn projected. Last month, Alphabet cut 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce, and vowed to create a leaner, more efficient company. It was then hit with a US Department of Justice lawsuit accusing the company of abusing its dominance of the digital advertising business. Both earnings results will be set against a turnaround at Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company. Shares in Meta\u2019s stock surged as much as 26% on Thursday \u2013 its biggest one-day jump in nearly a decade. Meta\u2019s share price surge came after CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed to make the social media company leaner. Analysts welcomed the move, with many upgrading their recommendations on the stock. Apple has thus far avoided the mass layoffs seen by its peers in the tech space. In Thursday\u2019s call with investors, Cook did not mention layoffs but said the company would be closely monitoring its labor expenses. \u201cWe\u2019re cutting costs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re cutting hiring, we\u2019re being very prudent and deliberate on people that we hire.\u201d"

            "title": "Crochet enthusiasts asked ChatGPT for patterns. The results are \u2018cursed\u2019",
            "date": "2023-02-26T11:00:20Z",
            "content": "The meteoric rise of ChatGPT has sparked an artificial intelligence frenzy, stoking fears that the technology could upend jobs, search engines and schools. But online creators have identified one realm yet safe from the computer takeover: fiber arts. A number of TikTok users have deployed ChatGPT to write patterns for crochet creations, yielding \u201ccursed\u201d results that are testing the boundaries of nascent artificial intelligence capabilities. In January TikTok user Alexandra Woolner, who has been knitting for years and crocheting since 2019, hatched the idea to use ChatGPT to make a stuffed animal \u2013 initially asking it to write a pattern for a narwhal. A typical crochet pattern resembles coding in its own way, with abbreviations and punctuation marks denoting the creation process. \u201cCh\u201d is used to denote \u201cchain\u201d, and \u201csc\u201d is \u201csingle crochet\u201d, for example. Meanwhile, an asterisk (*) implies an instruction should be repeated and brackets [] are used to separate repeatable steps in the instructions. Woolner was impressed to find that ChatGPT returned comprehensive instructions that resembled a typical pattern. Following the pattern exactly, they created what was described as an \u201cAI-generated narhwal crochet monstrosity\u201d. Woolner said although the product was anatomically disturbing, it was impressive the language-learning tool created a pattern that actually yielded a sea creature. \u201cThe consensus among people who have seen it is that it looks wrong and ugly, but also very cute,\u201d they said. \u201cIt came out shockingly very accurate while still being very, very wrong. It\u2019s a weird mix, kind of an uncanny valley.\u201d The response online has been overwhelming, Woolner said, with the original video hitting nearly 900,000 views and subsequent attempts racking up thousands more. \u201cI fully back the concept of doing this as proof that AI shouldn\u2019t be used to generate art, but also I wuv himb,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cThere are some things AI cannot steal\u201d Woolner is not the only creator to explore the potential crochet-based applications for ChatGPT. Lily Lanario, a London-based crocheter, said she was inspired to explore ChatGPT applications for crocheting because the centuries-old practice has thus far evaded mechanical replication due to its unpredictable and free-flowing stitching. \u201cI thought it would be interesting to explore a collaboration between human and machine in a space that computers cannot yet take from us,\u201d she said. Lanario had ChatGPT make a number of patterns including a cat, a duck, and a Pikachu with varying levels of success and accuracy. She said she found that the tool had some capacity to troubleshoot patterns that were not well-made, reworking instructions when she asked for changes like different colors or adding a forgotten body part. Crochet patterns are particularly tricky for artificial intelligence to parse because they rely heavily on numbers, said Jessica Newman, director of the artificial intelligence security initiative at UC Berkeley\u2019s Center for Long Term Cybersecurity, a type of dataset that AI struggles with more than words. ChatGPT is a large language model of artificial intelligence, meaning that it is trained on large databases of text to replicate human communication, anticipating which words are likely to come after each other. These skills do not translate easily to numbers. The result? ChatGPT is bad at math. \u201cIt may strike us as ironic that a computer system would be bad at math and good at creativity, but it does speak to an important fact about generative AI systems in general: they don\u2019t understand context,\u201d Newman said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what words or numbers actually mean, they are simply predicting what should come next.\u201d \u2018It looked like an alien\u2019 To delve into our own ChatGPT crochet adventure, we asked Diana Ramirez-Simon \u2013 Guardian copy editor and crocheter extraordinaire \u2013 to attempt a narwhal and investigate whether the tool\u2019s abilities have improved since Woolner\u2019s first attempt in January. The result did not spark confidence that ChatGPT is becoming any better at creating crochet patterns. \u201cIt was hilarious,\u201d said Ramirez-Simon of the AI-created narwhal. \u201cAfter I finished the head, it was pretty apparent that this was not going to be anything resembling an animal in nature. It almost looked like an alien.\u201d Like other crocheters, Ramirez-Simon, who has been crocheting for 23 years, said the pattern did resemble a real, human-created crochet pattern. But it seemed ChatGPT struggled with ratios and numbers. The animal\u2019s eyes are at least half the size of its body, and there were no clear instructions as to how they should be attached. \u201cMy daughter named him Blinky, because he can\u2019t blink \u2013 his eyes are too big,\u201d she said. \u201cStill, he\u2019s adorable.\u201d Much has been said about ChatGPT\u2019s math struggles, and while it has made some recent updates to its numerical capabilities it seems accurate crochet patterns are still out of reach. Newman said these shortcomings of AI are to be expected as the technology progresses. \u201cAt times it seems miraculous, and at other times it is completely nonsensical,\u201d she said. \u201cIts creativity is compelling because it has learned that from people \u2013 it is ultimately stitching together human intelligence and giving it back to us.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-09T16:37:20Z",
            "content": "Elections for the Northern Ireland assembly are to be delayed again, with a new deadline of 18 January next year for the Democratic Unionist party to return to power-sharing, the government has announced. The decision to delay the formation of an executive means Stormont could legally be in abeyance until 11 April 2024, 12 weeks after the government will be obliged to call an election under the proposed law. The Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, announced special legislation in parliament enabling the delay \u201cto allow time and space for the NI parties to work together to return to government\u201d. He said in a statement: \u201cHaving spoken to political representatives, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, I have concluded that another election at this time is not the best course of action to facilitate the restoration of the executive.\u201d He said it was disappointing for voters that Stormont had been in abeyance since last February, but that the resumption of power-sharing remained his focus. One Northern Ireland MP said it was the right move because it \u201cdecoupled\u201d the Stormont process from the dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol, which triggered the DUP\u2019s boycott of the devolved government. It would also mean a different narrative if the DUP rejected any potential UK-EU deal. Another, Stephen Farry, the MP for North Down, said: \u201cAny snap assembly election in the current context didn\u2019t make any sense, especially with UK-EU talks progressing. But he said the government could not allow drift. \u201cNorthern Ireland can\u2019t afford a political vacuum and the government seriously need to look at reform of the political institutions to stop any party vetoing their operation and denying Northern Ireland a government.\u201d Power-sharing has been suspended for almost a year, but the latest delay will not mean the return of direct rule. Instead the civil service will run the administration with budgets set in Westminster. But it will also raise questions about the much-anticipated visit by the US president, Joe Biden, and his special envoy, Joe Kennedy III, who has yet to set foot in Northern Ireland since his appointment on 19 December. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood welcomed the proposed legislation but urged the government not to \u201ctake their foot off the pedal or back down on the pressure needed to reform and restore the assembly\u201d given the need to address hospital waiting lists, workers pay and energy costs. Many believe the DUP will oppose a new deal on the protocol widely expected in the coming weeks because it is unlikely to meet the seven conditions the party has set to end its boycott of the Stormont assembly. Under existing legislation Heaton-Harris was obliged to call an election by the end of the first week of March if he were to meet the legal deadline of mid April to form an executive. \u201cMy guess is the DUP are not going to come back to Stormont whatever the protocol deal because they will find something to oppose, but that they will return long-term because there is no other show in town,\u201d said one Northern Ireland MP. The Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill was introduced to parliament on Thursday and will be debated later in February. Heaton-Harris held round table talks with with the political parties in Belfast \u201cto urge them to restore the executive as soon as possible\u201d and update them on protocol talks. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 February 2023. An earlier version mistakenly said that the latest date for an election to be called would have been mid-December 2023 in order for the executive to be formed by 18 January 2024. However, 18 January is the last date an executive could be formed before the clock starts ticking on a 12-week period in which an election has to be called."

            "content": "Polls have closed in the West Lancashire byelection, with Labour confident of retaining the seat it has held since 1992. The bookies have the party at 1/25 to keep hold of the seat where it had a majority of 8,336 in the last election. A result is expected between 2am and 4am. The byelection was triggered by the resignation of the Labour MP Rosie Cooper, who had represented the constituency since 2005. The decision came in autumn, a few years after she was targeted in a far-right plot, an event she says \u201cundoubtedly took its toll\u201d, and she has since taken up the job of chair of Mersey Care NHS foundation trust. Labour\u2019s candidate in West Lancashire is Ashley Dalton, a charity worker and trade unionist from Leyland, South Ribble, on the north border of the constituency. Dalton said: \u201cAs much as I love working at a grassroots level, I realise that after the last 13 years of a Conservative government, however many community projects I help to get set up, and however many community meetings I hold, they are hindered by the fact there aren\u2019t the resources to actually give those communities the support they need to thrive. \u201cThe only way I\u2019m really going to be able to influence that is if I can get into the House of Commons and work towards a Labour government, so that we can make the changes that we need to see for communities like this one.\u201d Despite the targeting of Cooper, Dalton said the potential threats to her own safety had not deterred her from running for MP. \u201cObviously we take it seriously and you have to be sensible about mitigating some of those risks, but it doesn\u2019t put me off or scare me in any way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a gay woman that\u2019s been involved in politics for about 20 years so I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of some pretty unsavoury comments and abuse. But that abuse is aimed almost entirely at shutting me up and I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d In the run-up to the poll, shadow frontbenchers, including Lucy Powell and Lisa Nandy, joined Dalton on the campaign trail. The Conservative candidate is Mike Prendergast, a solicitor who is also a local councillor in Southport. Jo Barton, an activist and environmental campaigner, is standing for the Liberal Democrats."

            "date": "2023-02-09T10:51:11Z",
            "content": "Nigeria\u2019s election on 25 February has been described as pivotal to the progress of democracy in Africa, where military coups and attempts by longstanding rulers to cling to power have raised fears of a \u201cdemocratic retreat\u201d from advances made since the end of the cold war. More than a dozen African countries go the polls in the coming 12 months, but experts agree that the presidential and parliamentary vote in the continent\u2019s most populous country is the one that matters the most. Nigeria \u201cis a bellwether country\u201d, said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham and an expert on African politics. \u201cIf the election is successful and seen to be democratic, that is going to be a big shot in the arm for democracy more generally across Africa \u2026 but the opposite is also true.\u201d Idayat Hassan, the director of the Centre for Democracy and Development in Abuja, described the election as a cause for optimism and also a test. \u201cOn the one hand, this is a sign of progress,\u201d she said. \u201cNigeria has now had almost 24 years of uninterrupted democracy and the two-term limit [for presidents] is being followed \u2026 But Nigeria has to get it right.\u201d Foreign Policy, the US global affairs magazine, recently called the election the most important anywhere in the world in 2023, describing it as \u201ca global event \u2013 even if the world scarcely knows it\u201d. The vote comes at a critical time. As well as coups across west Africa, wars have flared and extremism has spread. Economies everywhere on the continent are struggling to overcome the damage done by the Covid-19 pandemic, inflation caused in part by Russia\u2019s invasion of the Ukraine, and multiple other challenges. Investment has stalled. Nigeria is suffering from multiple intersecting crises including economic turmoil, violence, extremism and criminality affecting much of the country, from kidnappings for ransom in the north-west to a 13-year Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east and decades-old ethnic tensions mostly between herders and farmers in the north-central region. The outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s two terms in power are widely viewed as a deep disappointment, and even his wife has apologised to Nigerians for failing to meet expectations. Last week, Nigeria\u2019s currency slipped further after a \u201csurprise\u201d downgrade of the country\u2019s credit rating by Moody\u2019s, the rating agency. The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its projection for Nigeria\u2019s 2023 economic growth rate, but only to 3.2%. Observers point out that Nigerians are still looking to an elected government to solve the country\u2019s challenges, and interest in a vibrant campaign has been intense. \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive, close election,\u201d Cheeseman said. Eighteen candidates are vying to replace Buhari, and analysts say their diversity is evidence of the strength of democracy in Nigeria. The main contest is between Bola Tinubu, from the ruling All Progressives Congress; Atiku Abubakar, of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic party; and the Labour party\u2019s Peter Obi, who is leading in some polls. Tinubu, 70, and Atiku, 76, have significant power bases across Nigeria. Both are seen as traditional politicians who will seek to mobilise voters with massive organisation and spending. Obi is seen as a reformist willing to overhaul Nigeria\u2019s political system. The 61-year-old former businessman is running an insurgent campaign that relies on social media, word of mouth and the energy of his largely young following. More than 80% of the 10 million new voters who have registered for the coming poll are under 34. \u201cObi has emerged as a third force that has shaken the political scene dominated by two established parties \u2026 although realistically his chances are slim,\u201d said Mucahid Durmaz, a senior analyst focusing on west Africa at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk intelligence company. \u201cThe democratic progress made since the end of three decades of military rule [in 1999] shows that despite all the problems the direction of travel is still positive.\u201d Observers point out that none of the main candidates are former military officers \u2013 a first for a Nigerian poll. One significant factor is new technology that identifies voters through fingerprints and facial recognition. Officials hope this will make the rigging that has historically marred polls in Nigeria much harder. \u201cThis is an election in which all major fault lines are reflected but there is a renewed trust in the electoral process,\u201d Hassan said. A peaceful transition of power could help roll back a tide of instability in west Africa, where Mali and Burkina Faso have both seen elected governments replaced by military regimes in the last three years. It could also send a message to other leaders and ruling parties clinging to power on the continent. Teodoro Obiang has been in power in Equatorial Guinea since 1979, Paul Biya has ruled Cameroon since 1982, and Yoweri Museveni has held Uganda in an iron grip since 1986. Elsewhere, it is parties that once defeated colonialism that are still in charge. The MPLA has ruled for decades in Angola, while Zanu-PF has controlled Zimbabwe since 1981. \u201cThis is an important barometer for Africa [which] could mark the cards of other leaders and say to the dinosaurs \u2018your time is up\u2019,\u201d Cheeseman said."

            "date": "2023-02-08T04:36:55Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden gave a forceful defense of his presidency in his second State of the Union address, delivered at the midpoint of his first term and just weeks after the Republicans retook control of the House. The speech was lively and rancorous, with Biden occasionally being heckled and at one point getting into an unusual back-and-forth with Republicans after accusing them of wanting to do away with popular government healthcare and retirement programs. But the drama didn\u2019t stop at the House dais. Congressman and fabulist George Santos had words with Senator Mitt Romeny on the House floor before the speech began, in an incident that we\u2019ll probably hear more about in the days to come. Here\u2019s a rundown of the night\u2019s events: From Donald Trump to Sarah Huckabee Sanders to Ronna McDaniel, Republicans were no fans of Biden\u2019s speech. Progressives thought the address was a pleasant surprise. Who was the designated survivor? Labor secretary Marty Walsh sat the speech out to ensure the government survived if the worst happened. A farmworker who survived a recent mass shooting in Half Moon Bay, California, was among the guests invited by lawmakers. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders has delivered the Republican rebuttal to Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech, and struck a much more confrontational tone compared to the president. \u201cBeing a mom to three young children taught me not to believe every story I hear, so forgive me for not believing much of anything I heard tonight from President Biden,\u201d began Sanders, who was press secretary in Donald Trump\u2019s White House from 2017 to 2019. \u201cFrom out-of-control inflation and violent crime to the dangerous border crisis and threat from China, Biden and the Democrats have failed you. They know it, and you know it, and it\u2019s time for a change.\u201d She continued by remarking on Biden\u2019s age. \u201cI\u2019ll be the first to admit President Biden and I don\u2019t have a lot in common. I\u2019m for freedom, he is for government control. At 40, I\u2019m the youngest governor in the country, and at 80 he is the oldest president in American history. I\u2019m the first woman to lead my state, and he\u2019s the first man to surrender his presidency to a woke mob that can\u2019t even tell you what a woman is,\u201d Sanders said. The last remark was a reference to awkward attempts by rightwing lawmakers to trip up Biden\u2019s supreme court pick Ketanji Brown Jackson. She concluded her remarks with a note of warning, saying, \u201cThe America we love is in danger. President Biden and the Democrats have failed you. And it\u2019s time for a change. A new generation of Republican leaders are stepping up not to be caretakers of the status quo, but to be changemakers for the American people.\u201d Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, applauded Joe Biden for calling out some Republicans\u2019 calls to overhaul Medicare and social security in his State of the Union speech. \u201cAs the president made clear, this year Democrats will also need to hold the line against Republican extremism, including guarding against any attempts to force a default on the debt limit, gut social security, Medicare and other critical programs,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cWe will be a strong opposition party against these extreme Maga Republican ideas that would hurt Americans everywhere. But the president today made clear that Democrats are always a party of not just opposition, but also of proposition.\u201d Jayapal celebrated the wins that progressives scored over the course of the first two years of Biden\u2019s presidency, including the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. She simultaneously emphasized that her caucus will continue advancing proposals to build a more equitable economy, such as ensuring wealthy Americans pay their fair share of taxes and providing more affordable healthcare and childcare to working Americans. \u201cTonight, the country heard the President lay out his vision for a better America backed by the powerful results of a progressive agenda put into action over the last two years,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cIf we continue on this path \u2013 taking on corporate power, investing in working families, and embracing equitable policymaking \u2013 we will continue to deliver.\u201d Whatever was said between George Santos and Mitt Romney on the floor of the House this evening, the freshman representative isn\u2019t letting it go: According to Semafor, Santos says Romney called him \u201can ass\u201d. Romney has yet to comment. Progressives voiced a note of cautious optimism in response to Joe Biden\u2019s second State of the Union speech. While emphasizing that more action is needed to address gun violence, the climate crisis and immigration policy, progressive groups expressed a commitment to work with Biden to realize the goals he outlined tonight. Here are a few comments from progressive leaders: Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez, president of the youth voting group NextGen America: Earlier this month, NextGen America and 20 coalition partners sent President Biden the Youth Agenda, a list of legislative priorities outlining young peoples\u2019 hopes and vision for the future. After watching his address tonight, it is clear he is listening to us and willing to continue fighting for our movement. Peter Ambler, executive director of the gun safety group Giffords: President Biden has been a stalwart leader on gun safety, from pushing ATF to regulate ghost guns to signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law, but more must be done. Tonight, President Biden called on Congress to act and save lives. Bipartisan success is possible, and it is urgent that Congress comes together. Varshini Prakash, executive director of the climate group Sunrise Movement: President Biden\u2019s right \u2013 we\u2019ve come a long way, but the job\u2019s not done. Truthfully, we\u2019ve heard a lot of good things tonight, but if the President wants to keep his promises and energize young voters ahead of 2024, he must act on his words, use his full executive authority to stop the climate crisis and deliver for our generation. \u201cHere\u2019s the real State of the Union.\u201d Thus begins Donald Trump in a video rebuttal to Biden\u2019s State of the Union address. He then airs a number of familiar grievances concerning his White House successor, including plenty of misinformation. For instance, Trump says, \u201cUnder Biden the murder rate has reached the highest in the history of our country.\u201d It hasn\u2019t. This right here is the meat of Trump\u2019s message: But the good news is we are going to reverse every single crisis, calamity and disaster that Joe Biden has created. I am running for President to end the destruction of our country and to complete the unfinished business of Making America Great Again. We will make our country better than ever before, and we will always put America First. You can watch the rest of the video here. Republicans didn\u2019t find a lot to like in that speech. While House speaker Kevin McCarthy and some GOP lawmakers joined in the applause occasionally, they are by and large no fans of Biden\u2019s policies. Here are a few of their objections, as articulated by Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee: Biden doubled down on his disastrous and polarizing agenda which has left working families behind. Instead of taking responsibility for the multiple crises he and Democrats created, Biden blamed everyone but himself for historic inflation, skyrocketing crime, and a porous southern border. Biden once again proved he is the divider-in-chief. Biden has wrapped up his speech by declaring, \u201cThe soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong. The state of the union is strong.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not new to this place. I stand here tonight, having served as long as about any one of you have ever served here,\u201d he continued, drawing laughter, considering he\u2019s been an elected official in Washington since 1973. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more optimistic about our future, about the future America. Just remember who we are. We\u2019re the United States of America. And there\u2019s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. If we do it together.\u201d It appears that the \u201cliar\u201d remark directed at Joe Biden moments ago came from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, an extremist Republican from Georgia. Greene stood and shouted at Biden as he accused Republicans of targeting the Medicare and social security programs as the party looks to cut federal spending. Although a number of Republicans have rejected proposals to overhaul Medicare and social security, some members of the party, including Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, have suggested that the programs should instead be subjected to annual approval. Such a policy could result in the programs being eliminated. Greene\u2019s heckling of Biden may remind viewers of Barack Obama\u2018s 2009 address to Congress, when Republican congressman Joe Wilson shouted \u201cYou lie!\u201d at the then-president. The congresswoman\u2019s outburst comes after the House Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, promised that members would abide by the chamber\u2019s code of ethics during Biden\u2019s State of the Union address. More rancor in the House chamber. Biden was talking about the toll fentanyl has taken on drug users, noting, \u201cFentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.\u201d Shouts of \u201cpoint of order\u201d rang out, with someone yelling, \u201cit\u2019s your fault.\u201d It\u2019s not clear who was doing the shouting, but Republicans have sought to blame the Biden administration for poor border security that they say has allowed illicit fentanyl into the United States. When they crossed paths on the House floor before Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, senator Mitt Romney told George Santos \u201cyou don\u2019t belong here,\u201d CNN reports: The Republican senator from Utah, Romney was the GOP\u2019s nominee for president in 2012. Santos is a freshman GOP House representative from New York, who lied repeatedly about his resume and is the subject of several investigations. Biden drew fury from Republicans when he accused some GOP lawmakers of wanting \u201cto take the economy hostage\u201d and planning to cut social security and Medicare. \u201cSome of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage \u2026 unless I agree to their economic plans,\u201d Biden said. That was a reference to the GOP\u2019s insistence that they won\u2019t agree to raise the debt limit unless Democrats back lowering government spending. Then came the remark that drew fury: \u201cInstead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans \u2026 want Medicare and social security sunset.\u201d Aimed at seniors and people with disabilities, the healthcare and retirement programs are both expensive and popular. Democrats have vowed to protect them, and accused Republicans of wanting to abolish them, an allegations the party denies. Thus, the president\u2019s comment prompted GOP lawmakers to protest, with at least one shouting \u201cliar!\u201d at the president. Biden appeared to respond to their heckling, saying he wasn\u2019t going to name the individual lawmakers who have proposed cutting the programs, but insisting some have. Then, sensing an opportunity, he asked, \u201cSo, folks, as we all apparently agree, social security, Medicare is off the books now?\u201d Lawmakers applauded, leading the president to remark, \u201call right!\u201d Now Biden\u2019s getting into controversial territory, at least when it comes to the priorities of the House Republicans. He\u2019s blaming Donald Trump for America\u2019s sizable budget deficit, saying \u201cUnder the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row \u2026 nearly 25% of the entire national debt that took over 200 years to accumulate was added by just one administration alone, and the last one. They\u2019re the facts, check it out.\u201d Then he leaned on Congress to increase America\u2019s borrowing limit, which it will have to do by around June in order to prevent the country from defaulting. Biden said that under Trump, Congress \u201cdid the right thing that led to the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis \u2026 let\u2019s commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.\u201d Biden just made his first veto threat, warning Republicans not to attempt to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, particularly its provisions aimed at lowering prescription drug costs for people on Medicare. \u201cSome members here are threatening, and I know it\u2019s not an official party position, so I\u2019m not going to exaggerate but \u2026 to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s OK, that\u2019s fair. As my football coach used to say lot\u2019s of luck in your senior year. \u201cMake no mistake, if you try anything to raise the costs of prescription drugs, I will veto it.\u201d Biden just recapped his economic policies, including the 2021 infrastructure overhaul that will pour $1tn into fixing roads, bridges, airports, pipes and other capital works across the country. The president said he wanted to \u201cthank my Republican friends who voted for the law, and my Republican friends who voted against it as well \u2026 I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well. But don\u2019t worry. I promised I\u2019d be a president for all Americans. We\u2019ll fund these projects, and I\u2019ll see you at the groundbreaking.\u201d Here\u2019s a dynamic to watch in the speech: who claps and who doesn\u2019t, and when. For instance, Biden just said that, \u201cTwo years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to the January 6 attack on the Capitol by Donald Trump\u2019s supporters. Democrats stood and applauded that line, but few, if any, Republicans moved their hands at all. Biden is congratulating congressional leaders as he starts his remarks, including Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican House speaker who is one of the president\u2019s chief rivals. \u201cSpeaker, I don\u2019t want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you,\u201d Biden said, to laughter. Joe Biden has taken the podium before a joint session of Congress to give his second State of the Union address, and the first since his Democratic allies lost control of the House of Representatives. Follow this blog for live updates. Joe Biden has entered the House chamber, to applause. He\u2019s shaking the hands of lawmakers as he walks down the aisle. Mystery solved. The White House has announced that labor secretary Marty Walsh is the designated survivor, meaning he\u2019s currently watching the speech from a secure location. More guests have arrived, including Jill Biden, who is sitting with Doug Emhoff, Kamala Harris\u2019s husband. Joe Biden\u2019s cabinet secretaries are filing in, as have several supreme court justices, including chief justice John Roberts and associated justices Brett Kavanaugh, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Amy Coney Barrett. Hersey Kyota, who is the ambassador from Palau and dean of the diplomatic corps, has also arrived. Before the event kicked off, senators and House representatives were milling about, and the cameras caught a few interesting exchanges. Here\u2019s one between Mitt Romney and George Santos, the congressman who is in deep trouble for lying about all sorts of things in his campaign for office: Kamala Harris and Kevin McCarthy are reading the names of senators and representatives who will escort Joe Biden into the House chamber, where he is to deliver the State of the Union address. If this is anything like years past, Biden will come in and more or less wade through a crowd of lawmakers, shaking hands and exchanging remarks until he eventually reaches the podium, where he\u2019ll make his speech. A farm worker advocate in Half Moon Bay, California \u2013 where a gunman last month killed seven \u2013 will be attending the State of the Union as a guest of congresswoman Anna Eshoo. Dr Belinda Hernandez-Arriaga, founder and executive director of Ayudando Latinos a So\u00f1ar (ALAS), a social services nonprofit based in Half Moon Bay, has been working with victims\u2019 families as well as workers who have had to return to the farms where the shootings occurred. A farm worker is charged with killing seven people at two Half Moon Bay mushroom farms, after investigators said he was enraged by a supervisor\u2019s demand that he pay $100 to repair a forklift damaged at work. The shooting has brought new attention to the working conditions of migrant farmworkers in the region. Workers at Terra Garden, where four were killed, were living in shipping containers and earning $9 an hour. \u201cThis tragedy brings to light the silence with which many have lived in \u2026 in these deplorable conditions with these inequitable wages and lack of health care. We are hoping that this response really turns the tide,\u201d Hernandez-Arriaga told KQED. Many workers returned to both farms just days after their co-workers were killed \u2013 largely because they were in economically precarious situations and had few other options, local advocates have said. Those affected \u201cneed the reassurance from our community leaders and our politicians that farm worker conditions will change,\u201d Hernandez-Arriaga, said. \u201cThey need to know that there\u2019s going to be a national response to improve the lives of farm workers, their living conditions, their economic wages, their mental health, medical and so much more.\u201d Prefer watching to reading? A live feed of the State of the Union address will be embedded at the top of this page momentarily. The speech is set to begin at 9pm eastern time. Kamala Harris is already at the Capitol, where she\u2019ll be sitting behind the president in her role as vice-president. She ascended the dais and stood next to Kevin McCarthy. A microphone picked up the two chatting, with Harris saying it was \u201ca packed house\u201d, and remarking on the lack of masks. Joe Biden has left the White House and is driving down Washington\u2019s Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol to give the State of the Union address. As he walked to his armored limousine known as The Beast, Biden told reporters he was \u201cfeeling good.\u201d Asked what the state of the union was, he replied, \u201cgreat shape. Getting better.\u201d The State of the Union address is a big deal for many reasons, one of them being the fact that it\u2019s a rare moment when the president will be in the same room as all members of Congress and most cabinet secretaries, along with several supreme court justices. But what if something were to happen to the leaders of the American government while they\u2019re all in the Capitol? The government has a plan for that, which involves designating a survivor from within the presidential line of succession and taking them to a secure location while the president is making their address, just in case. We don\u2019t know who the designated survivor is this year; it\u2019ll only be known after the speech wraps. Last year, it was commerce secretary Gina Raimondo. On Twitter, Chris Lu, who worked in the Barack Obama White House and is now with the American mission to the United Nations, elaborated on some of the considerations that go into designating a survivor from among the executive branch: A coalition of youth-led organizations have outlined a number of policy changes that Joe Biden should announce in his State of the Union address, warning that failing to deliver could depress young voter turnout in 2024. In a statement co-signed by March for Our Lives, Sunrise Movement, Gen Z for Change and United We Dream Action, the groups suggested Biden should use the power of the executive pen to address the climate crisis, gun violence and immigration policy. \u201cWe need to see more from President Biden,\u201d the groups said. \u201cWithout a Democratic majority in Congress, President Biden must step up and use the full extent of his power to invest in the top issues facing our generation.\u201d Among other demands, the organizations called on Biden to establish a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented people, declare gun violence to be a national emergency and invoke the Defense Production Act to support the renewable energy industry. The groups reminded Biden that young Americans were crucial to his 2020 victory and they later helped stave off widespread Democratic defeats in the 2022 midterm elections. If Biden does not take more decisive steps to address young voters\u2019 concerns, the groups said, his inaction could jeopardize Democrats\u2019 electoral prospects. \u201cWe are fired up and are fighting for change,\u201d they said. \u201cIf President Biden wants to hold Democratic power long term, he must listen to us and deliver.\u201d Lawmakers have the ability to invite guests to the State of the Union address, and the Guardian\u2019s Edwin Rios reports relatives of Black people killed by police will be in the chamber when Joe Biden gives his speech tonight: Families of Black people killed by police in recent years, including George Floyd\u2019s brother and Michael Brown\u2019s father, will attend the State of the Union address on Tuesday night alongside lawmakers advocating for urgent police reform. The push in Congress comes after the recent beating death of Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis police. The release of video footage, along with the charging of several Memphis police officers involved in Nichols\u2019s death and the firing of several employees from the Memphis police and fire departments, reignited national outcry over police brutality and calls for reforms. This includes renewed efforts to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which was introduced after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. It was passed twice by the US House before failing to clear the Senate in 2021. Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee plans to reintroduce the legislation after the State of the Union address and include provisions named after Tyre Nichols that would require police officers to intervene when excessive force is used. A divided Congress will make satisfying current demands even more difficult. As is customary, a prominent Republican will deliver a speech in response to Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, and this year, current Arkansas governor and former Donald Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will do the honors. Unsurprisingly, it will touch on economic issues, with Sanders to say, \u201cRepublicans believe in an America where strong families thrive in safe communities. Where jobs are abundant, and paychecks are rising,\u201d according to excerpts released by the office of Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate. \u201cIn the radical left\u2019s America, Washington taxes you and lights your hard-earned money on fire, but you get crushed with high gas prices, empty grocery shelves, and our children are taught to hate one another on account of their race, but not to love one another or our great country.\u201d Sander\u2019s speech appears to be considerably more heated than what the president plans to say, although Biden\u2019s full speech hasn\u2019t been made public yet. Here\u2019s what she has to say about what could best be described as the \u201cculture wars\u201d: And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day. Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn\u2019t start and never wanted to fight. Every day, we are told that we must partake in their rituals, salute their flags, and worship their false idols \u2026 all while big government colludes with Big Tech to strip away the most American thing there is\u2014 your freedom of speech. That\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s crazy, and it\u2019s wrong. Kevin McCarthy had another message for reporters on Monday: no drama. \u201cI won\u2019t tear up the speech, I won\u2019t play games,\u201d he said, according to the Associated Press. Tonight\u2019s State of the Union will be the first since 2020 where the speaker of the House is not of the same party as the president. Just after his address concluded three years ago, Democrat Nancy Pelosi shredded Republican Donald Trump\u2019s speech while standing behind him, in full view of the cameras. McCarthy did have one ask of Biden, the AP reports: don\u2019t say \u201cextreme Maga Republicans\u201d, the term the president has used to condemn Republicans who adhere to the former president\u2019s ideology. \u201cThe state of the union is not great.\u201d That\u2019s the line from Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House speaker who will be sitting behind Biden as he gives his address tonight. He then goes onto call for Joe Biden to sit down with the GOP to fix the country\u2019s issues, all while insisting the Democrats can\u2019t be trusted to run the government. Here\u2019s more from his interview with CNBC ahead of the speech: In his State of the Union address tonight, Joe Biden will appeal to Republicans and argue that Americans will benefit only if the two parties work together. \u201cTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can\u2019t work together in this new Congress,\u201d the president will say, according to excerpts released by the White House. \u201cThe people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere. And that\u2019s always been my vision for the country: to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the backbone of America: the middle class, to unite the country. We\u2019ve been sent here to finish the job!\u201d His speech appears set to focus heavily on the economy, with Biden noting how America has recovered more quickly from the Covid-19 pandemic than other major markets. \u201cThe story of America is a story of progress and resilience \u2026 We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it. That is what we are doing again,\u201d Biden will say. \u201cTwo years ago, Covid had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much. Today, Covid no longer controls our lives.\u201d He\u2019ll also try to empathize with Americans as he argues that his policies have improved their lot, despite high inflation and many workers\u2019 generally gloomy views of the economy. \u201cAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they\u2019re invisible. Maybe that\u2019s you watching at home. You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away,\u201d the president will say. \u201cI get it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s delivered his last State of the Union address on 1 March, 2022. Here\u2019s a non-exhaustive list of how America has changed since then: Conservatives on the supreme court accomplished a goal they\u2019d been working towards for decades by overturning Roe v Wade and allowing states to ban abortion entirely. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 12 states have now banned procedure outright or with very limited exceptions, while abortion is unavailable in two others. The Republican-appointed justices responsible for the Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision may be in the room when Biden speaks tonight. Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, but only by four seats, defying predictions of a \u201cred wave\u201d of Republican victories that would sweep decisively them out of power. Biden\u2019s allies meanwhile gained a seat in the Senate, allowing them to exercise complete control over the chamber and ending the narrow 50-50 majority they navigated for the past two years. The president will be speaking to this new configuration tonight. Biden gave last year\u2019s speech at a time when his legislative agenda appeared deadlocked by his inability to win the votes of Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, two Democratic senators who had refused to go along with many of his demands. Months later, the lawmakers signed on to the Inflation Reduction Action, a more limited piece of legislation than the White House wanted but which nonetheless represents Washington\u2019s first major legislation against climate change. This blog will eat its hat if Biden doesn\u2019t mention the bill in his speech. Seated behind Biden tonight will be Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House elected after a history-making 15 rounds of balloting by his fractious Republican majority. He replaced Nancy Pelosi, who as Democratic speaker made all kinds of news during her two stints as the second-in-line to the presidency. Here\u2019s one relevant to today: that time in 2020 when she tore up Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address shortly after he finished giving it. Good evening, US politics blog readers, and thanks for joining us for our coverage of Joe Biden\u2019s annual State of the Union address. At 9 pm eastern time, the president will take the stage before Congress, supreme court justices, cabinet secretaries and guests from across the country to make the case that things are looking up for the United States. But as the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino and Joan E Greve reported earlier today, many Americans hold gloomy impressions about the state of the nation \u2013 just look at the mere 21% who have a positive view of economic conditions. Looming over Biden\u2019s speech is the big question the president has yet to answer: will he run for a second term in 2024? Don\u2019t expect an answer tonight, but it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll give hints of which way he\u2019s leaning. But first, a rundown of what happened today so far: Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell said the central bank may have to keep raising interest rates to fight inflation, a decision with effects that will ripple across the country and into Americans\u2019 bank accounts. Dozens of George Santos\u2019 constituents traveled to the Capitol from suburban New York City to demand he resign for lying his way into Congress. Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy has reiterated his demand that Biden agree to cut spending in exchange for increasing the debt ceiling, a vital piece of business Congress must agree to do in the coming months."

            "title": "Can poker machine reform save Dominic Perrottet from polls suggesting he\u2019ll lose power in NSW? ",
            "date": "2023-02-10T14:00:01Z",
            "content": "As a university student in the 1970s, Michael Yabsley\u2019s first job was in the pokies room of the Lismore Workers Club, where he brought drinks to the \u201clittle old ladies\u201d putting cash into the machines. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the briefing when I started,\u201d he told the Guardian this week. \u201cIt lasted for about two minutes, and he said \u2018the aim is to make sure no patron\u2019s glass is ever empty, because if they leave the machine to get a drink it\u2019s likely to break their concentration, and they may not go back to the machine\u2019.\u201d Yabsley, who later became a minister in Nick Greiner\u2019s New South Wales Liberal government in the 1980s and 90s, has been thinking about that first job as premier Dominic Perrottet has mounted his push for gambling reform in the state. In particular, Yabsley has wondered what it says about how voters might respond. \u201cI think it\u2019s a roll of the dice, so to speak, because it does tread on the toes of those for whom gambling \u2013 and poker machines \u2013 specifically are a form of entertainment. But that being said, I think there is a more broad acceptance in the public now about gambling doing real harm to the community,\u201d he said. As NSW prepares to head to the polls on 25 March, Perrottet\u2019s commitment to cashless gaming has dominated headlines and the oxygen of the nascent campaign. It has put pressure on the opposition Labor party \u2013 which has only committed to trialing the technology \u2013 and helped the premier craft an image as a leader with the conviction to take on powerful vested interests such as the clubs lobby. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cPolitics,\u201d he said, when asked this week why no other government in NSW had previously been willing to pursue gambling reform. While Perrottet\u2019s convictions seem sincere, there is also a sense that, as the leader of a party trailing in the polls, dogged by integrity scandals, and asking for a rarely granted fourth term in government, it is also smart politics. As one Labor MP told the Guardian this week: \u201cPerrottet all of a sudden looks like the big, brave integrity politician while we\u2019re the same old shady Labor, yet he\u2019s the one who \u2026 [knew about the New York appointment of John] Barilaro \u2026 who helped allow a second casino in Sydney. It\u2019s spin. Good spin, but spin.\u201d But will it change any votes? The Coalition is in tricky territory heading into the vote. While some recent polls show Perrottet remains preferred premier, the government has trailed Labor by as much as 56% to 44% on a two-party preferred basis. If such a vote was replicated on election day, Labor would win a majority. Election analysts, though, caution that Labor\u2019s path to victory is not simple. In order to govern in a majority, it would need to win nine seats from the Coalition in the 93-seat chamber. It\u2019s not an impossible task, but would require a uniform swing of about 6%. As election analyst Kevin Bonham told the Guardian: \u201cOn paper it\u2019s just a lot of seats for Labor to get a majority. And they\u2019re polling well enough to do it at the moment but not with a lot of room to move.\u201d As always in state elections, western Sydney will be key. Coalition seats on margins of less than 1% include East Hills and Penrith, but Labor is also hopeful in Winston Hills, Riverstone, Parramatta and even Camden (5.4%, 6.2%, 6.2% and 7.4% respectively). \u201cThat\u2019s interesting because at recent elections the Liberals have generally held up OK in outer suburbia and are getting crunched in inner suburbia,\u201d Bonham says. \u201cThat may not be the case in this campaign because the pokies issue cuts across that. [Perrottet\u2019s cashless gaming card] is appealing more to the socially conscious inner-city voter and maybe it arouses a bit of opposition in more working-class areas.\u201d Ben Raue, an election analyst who runs the Tally Room, said while he thought Labor\u2019s prospects were \u201cquite good\u201d, there was also a large possibility that the vote could end in a hung parliament and a \u201crickety\u201d government of either persuasion. \u201cThere\u2019s a few tranches of seats and if Labor can only pick up that first tranche of about four seats including say East Hills, Penrith, Upper Hunter [0.6%] and Goulburn [3.1%], it\u2019s sort of maximum chaos because both sides are a fair way from a majority and have to haggle with what looks like it will be a very large crossbench,\u201d he said. But with the Coalition already effectively governing in minority, the question is can it do enough to keep hold of those ultra-marginal seats even after 12 years in power. As Bonham says, history certainly isn\u2019t on its side. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a state government to get a fourth term, and this government has almost no room to move,\u201d he said. Kerry Chikarovski, who led the NSW Liberal party while in opposition between 1998 and 2002, said to buck that trend, the government would have to remind voters of its record. \u201cWhat they will be saying to the community is, yes we may have been here a long time but we\u2019ve been incredibly busy in that time. The massive infrastructure build in those 12 years, the roads, rail, light rail, the schools and hospitals,\u201d she said. Chikarovki also believed Perrottet\u2019s leadership on the pokies issue could prove to be a potent play for the government, and said comments by the now-former ClubsNSW boss Josh Landis about the premier\u2019s faith had helped bring it to the fore. \u201cThat made a whole lot of people who might not have been taking much notice, pay attention,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have thoughts on what sort of leader they want and if the premier is being criticised as a man of values, a lot of people would say, \u2018hold on that\u2019s something I support\u2019.\u201d While the government has been busy redefining itself, Labor under Chris Minns has played a much safer game: seeking to focus on cost-of-living issues with policies such as expanded stamp duty exemptions, and promises to boost funding for health and education. While Labor has been criticised for not offering a more inspiring platform, Raue said that may not matter. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re really giving people much reason to vote for them but I\u2019m also not sure they need to in a situation where maybe you have just enough to limp over the line,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to give people a reason ultimately if the other side annoys enough people. Minns is presenting as competent and serious, he gives an air of being up to the job.\u201d Chikarovki too thought he\u2019d been impressive as Labor leader, saying his \u201ccautious\u201d strategy had played well during an era that included the pandemic. \u201cWhether being a small target will get him over the line I\u2019m not sure,\u201d she said. Yabsley drew a parallel with the 1988 election which saw the Coalition sweep to power after 12 years of Labor rule. \u201cThere are two really clear-cut analogies: one is that we had a leader emerge who was capable of breaking the drought,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a conga line of Liberal leaders before Nick Greiner who had just failed to cut through and I think it\u2019s possibly similar with Chris Minns. He has had a degree of traction [and] been fairly impressive, I think, as a performer.\u201d The other, he said, was the length of time the Coalition has been in power. \u201cIt\u2019s just awfully hard, when you\u2019ve been in power that long \u2013 had the scandals and the baggage and all of that \u2013 to convince people that it isn\u2019t time for a change.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-25T17:42:15Z",
            "content": "Polls have shut in Nigeria, after tens of millions cast their votes to decide a tight and unpredictable contest for the presidency and parliament of Africa\u2019s most populous nation and its biggest economy. The opening of more than half of all polling stations was delayed by at least an hour with many others suffering problems with new voting technology, civil society groups said. There was some sporadic violence across the country, including a suspected attack by Islamic extremists and some disruption by hired thugs. Fears of widespread chaos appeared unfounded as night fell, however. An official announcement of results could take between three and five days, but it is probable that the winner of the presidency will be obvious much sooner as the count of individual polling stations becomes known. In the commercial capital, Lagos, large numbers of voters waited cheerfully for much of the morning for election officials to arrive, often two or even three hours late. \u201cI am very excited. I have been looking forward to exercising my civil rights. I am looking for a better Nigeria,\u201d said Victoria Adeyemo, a 65-year-old lawyer, as she sat waiting for a voting station in the upmarket area of Ikoyi to open. In the poor and crowded neighbourhood of Mushin, electoral officials and party agents said polls had opened on time to welcome a rush of voters. Amaka Gloria, 27, said it was a \u201cbig relief\u201d that \u201ceveryone had been able to vote\u201d. Analysts have spoken of a \u201cbellwether\u201d election that could be a crucial turning point for Nigeria after several years of worsening insecurity and acute economic troubles. Many see a credible poll and progress in tackling the country\u2019s multiple problems as key to stability across a swath of Africa. About 300,000 police officers were deployed to protect 176,000 polling stations and a ban on all movement by road, water or air was imposed during the poll. Land borders have also been closed. Eighteen candidates are vying to replace the outgoing two-term president, Muhammadu Buhari, but the main contest is between 70-year-old Bola Tinubu, from the ruling All Progressives Congress; Atiku Abubakar, of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic party; and the Labour party\u2019s Peter Obi, who is leading in some polls. Tinubu and Abubakar, 76, have significant power bases across Nigeria. Both are seen as traditional politicians who have sought to mobilise voters with massive organisation and spending. \u201cTinubu is my father, Tinubu is my country. He has done good things for us,\u201d said Adeleke Adejoke Bililis, an unemployed 43-year-old, after voting at Eroko Street polling station on Lagos Island. \u201cHe is Yoruba like me so of course I vote for him,\u201d she said, naming the ethnic community that she and the candidate belong to. Obi is seen as a reformist willing to overhaul Nigeria\u2019s political system who has reached across the country\u2019s many ethnic and religious fault lines. The 61-year-old former businessman ran an insurgent campaign that relied on social media, word of mouth and the energy of his largely young following. But though recent surveys suggested Obi has between a 10% and 40% lead over his rivals, many experts warned a low turnout could mean victory for the ruling party\u2019s candidate. Nkechi Richards, a 35-year-old fashion designer in Lagos, said that though some of her friends shared her enthusiasm for Obi, many others \u201cwanted to stick to the familiar and fear the new\u201d. According to charts drawn up by Yiaga, a coalition of civil society groups which has deployed monitors, the delays to opening of polling stations were most severe in the south-east, where Obi is most popular. One significant factor is the new voting technology that identifies voters through fingerprints and facial recognition. Officials hope this will make the rigging that has historically marred polls in Nigeria much harder. Though the contest looks close, Nigerian electoral law makes a runoff unlikely as the winning candidate needs only a plurality of votes, provided they get 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the 36 states. Nigeria is suffering from multiple intersecting crises including economic turmoil, extremism and criminality affecting much of the country. In recent weeks, an effort to replace almost all Nigeria\u2019s bank notes \u2013 in part to reduce the widespread practice of vote buying \u2013 has caused massive economic disruption and much popular anger. More than 90 million Nigerians registered to vote, but only 87 million picked up the necessary documents to cast their ballots. However, analysts point out that this is the seventh poll held since the end of military rule in 1999 and that some Nigerian democratic institutions are growing stronger. That none of the main candidates are former military officers \u2013 a first for a Nigerian poll \u2013 is also seen as an achievement. It could also send a message to other leaders and ruling parties clinging to power on the continent. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 February 2023 to clarify that the winning presidential candidate needs only a plurality of votes, not \u201ca simple majority\u201d as an earlier version said."

            "content": "It\u2019s 9pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand: Ukraine\u2019s military claimed on Tuesday that the last 24 hours were the deadliest of the war for Russian troops. It increased its tally of Russian military dead by 1,030 overnight to 133,190, the biggest increase in daily Russian military deaths since the war began last February. Russia has also said it killed large numbers of Ukrainian troops in recent weeks, claiming it had inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in the month of January. These figures could not be independently verified, but the assertion that the fighting was the deadliest so far fits descriptions from both sides of an escalating campaign of close-contact trench warfare. Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have announced they plan to provide Ukraine with at least 100 refurbished Leopard 1 battle tanks. In a joint statement, the defence ministers of the three countries said the shipment of older Leopard 1 tanks was part of an effort \u201cto support Ukraine in their endeavour to withstand Russian aggression\u201d. The delivery of Leopard 1 tanks will occur \u201cwithin the coming months\u201d and include logistical support and training, it added. Germany\u2019s defence ministry has said Leopard 2A6 battle tanks will be available in Ukraine by the end of March. Meanwhile, Berlin has reportedly approved the delivery of 178 Leopard 1 battle tanks to Ukraine. The head of the German arms maker Rheinmetall has also said it expects to send 20 to 25 Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine this year. The news comes as Germany\u2019s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Tuesday. Ukraine\u2019s top national security official, Oleksiy Danilov, has said he is confident his country will eventually receive US-made F-16 fighter jets. It was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before Kyiv gets the F-16s, Danilov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council, told CNN. He also suggested Ukraine may be capable of striking Russian on its own territory, beyond occupied Ukraine. Ukraine has released extraordinary video footage that appears to show Russian fighters dragging their badly wounded commander away from the battlefield, then beating him violently with what appear to be shovels. A Ukrainian drone captured the incident near the eastern city of Bakhmut, where intense fighting has been raging for months. Russia almost certainly now lacks the munitions and manoeuvre units required for successful offensives, the UK Ministry of Defence said. Its latest intelligence update stated that Moscow would continue to demand sweeping advances, but it remained unlikely that Russia could build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war in the coming weeks. Ukraine\u2019s parliament has approved the appointment of Ihor Klymenko as the country\u2019s new interior affairs minister and Vasily Malyuk as the new head of the country\u2019s security services, known as the SBU. Klymenko, formerly the national police chief, was serving as acting interior minister after the former minister, Denys Monastyrsky, was killed last month in a helicopter crash on the outskirts of Kyiv. Recriminations have broken out among EU officials after a possible visit to Brussels by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was leaked, raising concerns over his security. Zelenskiy was reported to be planning a trip to Brussels this Thursday to meet EU leaders in person at a summit and address the European parliament in an extraordinary session. Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has warned that western arms supplies to Ukraine are effectively \u201cdragging\u201d Nato into the conflict, which could lead to an \u201cunpredictable level of escalation\u201d. In remarks during a conference call with military officials, quoted by state-owned Tass news agency, Shoigu accused the US and its allies of \u201ctrying to prolong the conflict as much as possible\u201d by supplying Kyiv with what he described as \u201cheavy offensive weapons\u201d. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has tweeted a photo of him and his brother, Wladimir, meeting the German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, in Ukraine\u2019s capital today. Germany\u2019s defence ministry has said Leopard 2A6 battle tanks will be available in Ukraine by the end of March. Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have announced they plan to provide Ukraine with at least 100 refurbished Leopard 1 battle tanks. In a joint statement, the defence ministers of the three countries said the shipment of older Leopard 1 tanks was part of an effort \u201cto support Ukraine in their endeavour to withstand Russian aggression\u201d. The supplies will \u201csignificantly enhance Ukraine\u2019s military potential for the restoration of their violated territorial integrity\u201d, the statement continued. The delivery of Leopard 1 tanks will occur \u201cwithin the coming months\u201d and include logistical support and training, it added. The Kremlin has ordered inspections and repairs on bomb shelters across Russia in a national drive to upgrade the country\u2019s crumbling Soviet-era infrastructure, according to a report. The overhaul of the country\u2019s bomb shelter network comes amid Moscow\u2019s nuclear sabre-rattling and growing militarisation of daily life, the Moscow Times reports. Citing Russian officials, the paper writes that local authorities appear to be spending hundreds of millions of roubles to make Russia\u2019s thousands of bunkers, reinforced cellars and other safe hideouts fit for habitation. One official was quoted as saying: A decision to inspect the network of bomb shelters was made by the government in the spring. The command for a large-scale inspection and to put things right was given by the emergency situations ministry, the defence ministry and [other] civilian ministries. At least five people have died in a gas explosion that ripped through a five-floor building in the town of Yefremov south of Moscow, state-run Ria news agency reported, citing emergency services. Ria quoted emergency services as saying: So far, seven people have been rescued; unfortunately, five people died. On the subject of German-made tanks, it is being reported that Berlin has approved the delivery of 178 Leopard 1 battle tanks to Ukraine. The delivery from industry stocks, reported by Spiegel and Reuters, is considerably more than previously announced. A source told Reuters: The export of 178 Leopard 1s is approved. The news comes as Germany\u2019s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, made a surprise visit to Kyiv after Berlin confirmed that it would deliver more modern Leopard 2 battle tanks from army stocks. Earlier, the head of the German arms maker Rheinmetall said it expects to send 20 to 25 Leopard 1 tanks to Ukraine this year. CEO Armin Papperger told a conference organised by several newspapers: The rest of the 88 (Leopard 1 tanks) that we have will be delivered next year. Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has posted to Twitter that the \u201cfirst\u201d Leopard 2 battle tank has arrived in Kyiv, alongside a photo of him and his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, with a miniature model of the German-made battle tank. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s military has claimed that the last 24 hours were the deadliest of the war for Russian troops, increasing its tally of Russian military dead by 1,030 overnight to 133,190. The figure, which could not be independently verified, marks the biggest increase in daily Russian military deaths since the war began last February. Russia has also said it killed large numbers of Ukrainian troops in recent weeks, claiming it had inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in the month of January. Tallies of enemy casualties from either side have typically been seen as unreliable, Reuters reports, and Ukraine offered few details of the latest battles. But the assertion that the fighting was the deadliest so far fits descriptions from both sides of an escalating campaign of close-contact trench warfare, as Russia presses on with a winter assault in the east with tens of thousands of freshly mobilised troops. It\u2019s 6pm in Kyiv.

Those who can show themselves to be the most effective in defending against existing threats.\u201d Loud explosions have been reported in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the exiled city\u2019s mayor. \u201cFive loud explosions in a row in the Prymorskyi district of Mariupol.

The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has said Russian athletes should not be allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Olympics as long as the war in Ukraine is ongoing. \u201cIt is not conceivable (for Russian athletes) to march as if nothing had happened, to have a delegation come to Paris while the bombs are still raining down on Ukraine,\u201d she said. Her remarks represent a change in position after she said last month that she believed Russian athletes could take part \u201cunder a neutral flag\u201d to avoid \u201cdepriving athletes of competition\u201d. A plan for Volodymyr Zelenskiy to give a speech via video link during the last night of Italy\u2019s Sanremo song festival has been scrapped due to political controversy over his participation. Italian politicians from across the spectrum said the Ukrainian president\u2019s appearance was inappropriate for the popular annual music competition, which is televised by the state broadcaster Rai. Ukraine had withdrawn from its libraries 19m copies of books by last November that came either from the Soviet era or were in Russian, a senior lawmaker has said. After Russia moved to annex Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula in 2014, Kyiv has increasingly restricted the use of Russian books. Hello everyone. It\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine\u2019s parliament has approved the appointment of Ihor Klymenko as the country\u2019s new interior affairs minister. Klymenko, formerly Ukraine\u2019s national police chief, was serving as acting interior minister after the former minister, Denys Monastyrskiy, was killed last month in a helicopter crash on the outskirts of Kyiv. Monastyrskiy, his deputy and five other high-ranking officials were killed when their helicopter crashed into a nursery in Brovary, north-east of the capital. Another seven people were also killed, including a child. As we reported earlier, Ukraine\u2019s parliament also approved Vasily Malyuk as the new head of the country\u2019s security services, known as the SBU. Loud explosions have been reported in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, according to Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the exiled city\u2019s mayor. In a statement on Telegram, Andriushchenko said the explosions were heard in the Prymorskyi district. He wrote: Five loud explosions in a row in the Prymorskyi district of Mariupol. Our people report that they rang out in the sea port area. That\u2019s exactly where the occupiers recently deployed military hardware and anti-aircraft defence systems. Luke Harding reports that over the weekend sources inside Zelenskiy\u2019s own Servant of the People party suggested Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, would be moved out of his job. This followed a corruption scandal which saw the ministry pay two or three times the supermarket price of food to supply frontline troops. On Tuesday it appeared Reznikov was staying put. Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council, parliamentarians and some western allies argued it was the wrong time to remove him, ahead of an expected Russian counteroffensive. It is uncertain how long he might remain in post. According to Reuters, the confusion followed a crackdown on alleged official wrongdoing as Zelenskiy seeks to show that Kyiv can be a safe steward of billions of dollars of western aid. Reznikov had said earlier that he was \u201cholding the line\u201d, and showed no sign of stepping aside. \u201cThank you all for your support, as well as constructive criticism. We draw conclusions. We continue the reforms. Even during the war. We are strengthening the defense and working for victory,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Russia has accused the US embassy in Moscow of spreading \u201cfake news\u201d and threatened to expel US diplomats, state media is reporting. State-run Tass news agency cited a senior Russian foreign ministry source as saying that an official note had been delivered to the US embassy, warning that US diplomats engaged in what it called \u201csubversive activities\u201d would be expelled. Ukraine has released extraordinary video footage that appears to show Russian fighters dragging their badly wounded commander away from the battlefield, and then beating him violently with what appear to be shovels. A Ukrainian drone captured the incident near the eastern city of Bakhmut, where intense fighting has been raging for months. Four soldiers from Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group carry their colleague through a landscape of ruined houses, holding his arms and legs. They then dump him next to a barn. A second video appears to show three men then hitting him repeatedly with shovels. The fate of the injured commander is unclear. But the episode tallies with persistent reports of low morale among Russian mercenary units. Ukrainian soldiers fighting in and around Bakhmut have described how Wagner troops attack in waves. They are reportedly threatened with execution if they fail to advance and are mown down in large numbers, their corpses littering the frontlines. A drone unit from the Seneka special platoon shot the footage earlier this week. It was released on Ukrainian social media channels on Monday. Read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images we have received from the frontline in Ukraine. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has said Russian athletes should not be allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Olympics as long as the war in Ukraine is ongoing. Speaking to France Info radio, she said: As long as Russia continues to wage war on Ukraine, I don\u2019t want there to be a Russian delegation at the Paris 24 Games \u2013 I would find that indecent. It is not conceivable (for Russian athletes) to march as if nothing had happened, to have a delegation come to Paris while the bombs are still raining down on Ukraine. Her remarks represent a change in position after she said last month that she believed Russian athletes could take part \u201cunder a neutral flag\u201d to avoid \u201cdepriving athletes of competition\u201d. Ukraine hopes to secure widespread international support for banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Paris Olympics. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said their presence would normalise Russia\u2019s invasion of his country and make \u201cterror\u201d acceptable. A plan for Volodymyr Zelenskiy to give a speech via video link during the last night of Italy\u2019s Sanremo song festival has been scrapped due to political controversy over his participation. Italian politicians from across the spectrum said the Ukrainian president\u2019s appearance was inappropriate for the popular annual music competition, which is televised by the state broadcaster Rai. Zelenskiy had been due to give his speech on Saturday night but will instead provide a written message that will be read out by the festival\u2019s host, the Italian TV presenter Amadeus. Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, triggered the controversy, saying Zelenskiy\u2019s participation was \u201cout of place\u201d and that the entertainment event should be \u201creserved for music\u201d, while Giuseppe Conte, the former prime minister and leader of the Five Star Movement, said he didn\u2019t think it was necessary for Zelenskiy to appear \u201cin such a light-hearted context\u201d. The controversy and decision to scrap Zelenskiy\u2019s video appearance was mocked by Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia\u2019s foreign ministry, who said on Telegram: \u201cHe could have won the contest with a rap.\u201d The Sanremo film festival starts on Tuesday night. The event draws millions of TV viewers and is used to choose the Italian candidate for the Eurovision song contest. Ukraine\u2019s top national security official, Oleksiy Danilov, has said he is confident that his country will eventually receive American-made F-16 fighter jets. It was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before Kyiv gets the F-16s, Danilov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council, told CNN on Monday. He said: They will definitely come. Unfortunately, in the meantime we\u2019re losing our people while fighting for our independence. Joe Biden appeared to rule out supplying F-16 fighter jets last week, although he has emphasised he would remain in discussions with Ukraine about its weapons requests. The UK has also said supplying western jets was not practical. Danilov also suggested Ukraine may be capable of striking Russian on its own territory, beyond occupied Ukraine. He said: Regarding Russian territory, nobody prohibits us to destroy targets with weapons produced in Ukraine. Do we have such weapons? Yes, we do. Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has warned that western arms supplies to Ukraine are effectively \u201cdragging\u201d Nato into the conflict and that could lead to an \u201cunpredictable level of escalation\u201d. In remarks during a conference call with military officials, quoted by state-owned Tass news agency, Shoigu accused the US and its allies of \u201ctrying to prolong the conflict as much as possible\u201d by supplying Kyiv with what he described as \u201cheavy offensive weapons\u201d. He said: Such moves are actually drawing Nato countries into the conflict and can eventually lead to an unpredictable escalation. During the same call, the Russian defence minister said Moscow\u2019s forces had made progress in the fight for control of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, saying the offensive \u201cis advancing successfully\u201d. Hello everyone. It\u2019s L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tobi Thomas to bring you the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine\u2019s parliament has approved Vasily Malyuk as the new head of the country\u2019s security services, known as the SBU, having been the acting head of the service. Malyuk, 39, has worked in the territorial bodies of the SBU since 2001, most recently leading the fight against corruption. Last year, he was also briefly the deputy minister of the ministry of internal affairs. He became acting head of the service in July 2022 after the resignation of his predecessor, Ivan Bakanov. President Zelensky, who nominated Malyuk, noted his role \u201cin counteracting aggression, returning and liberating Ukrainian heroes.\u201d Recriminations have broken out among EU officials after a possible visit by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Brussels was leaked, raising concerns over his security. Zelenskiy was reported to be planning a trip to Brussels this Thursday to meet EU leaders in person at a summit and address the European parliament in an extraordinary session. He is thought to have only left Ukraine once since Russia\u2019s invasion last February: he made a surprise visit to Washington in December, where he addressed a joint session of the US Congress and urged more military support. That trip was planned in top secrecy because of concerns for his safety, although details leaked the day before. You can read more here: Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has issued a statement as uncertainty continues over his leadership. Writing on Twitter, he said: Holding the line. Thank you all for your support, as well as constructive criticism. We draw conclusions. We continue the reforms. Even during the war. We are strengthening the defense and working for victory. Glory to Ukraine! On Sunday night, David Arakhamia, chief of Zelenskiy\u2019s Servant of the People parliamentary bloc, said Reznivok would be reshuffled into another post following the news that he had paid twice or three times the supermarket price of food to supply troops on the frontline. The defence ministry would be led by Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence, Arakhamia said. Reznikov, he added, would become minister of strategic industries, tasked with strengthening military-industrial cooperation, after a day of speculation about the defence minister\u2019s future in Kyiv. On Monday, he appeared to row back on the announcement, saying no changes would be made this week. Reznikov has faced a string of questions about corruption in the ministry from Ukrainian journalists, at a time when Zelenskiy has instituted a fresh anti-corruption drive to show the country can be ready for EU membership. Efforts to tackle corruption in his ministry needed to be \u201cfully reloaded\u201d, he admitted. The defence minister said he believed that Ukraine would eventually obtain F-16s or other western fighter jets, but warned against slow decision-making. \u201cProcrastination with aircraft platforms,\u201d Reznikov said, \u201cwill cost us more lives and blood of Ukrainians\u201d and would cost the west more in postwar reconstruction. You can read more context surrounding Reznikov\u2019s departure here: Andrei Kostin, the chief executive of VTB, Russia\u2019s second largest bank, has blamed sanctions for its entire 2022 losses, acknowledging how western sanctions have crippled parts of Russia\u2019s financial sector. Reuters reports: \u201cWestern countries blocked several major Russian banks\u2019 access to the international Swift payments system soon after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 February last year, with dominant lenders Sberbank and VTB forced to shutter operations across much of Europe. The sanctions hammer fell for VTB sooner than most domestic rivals and, being heavily exposed to international markets and with more than 20% of its loan portfolio in foreign currency, the bank was one of more than 100 loss-making lenders as the sector\u2019s profits slumped around 90% in 2022. Kostin, in an interview with state television channel Rossiya 24, said the bank had managed to grow its retail and corporate loan portfolios, but that sanctions accounted for all the lender\u2019s losses. \u201cThe main thing on which we incurred losses is that from Feb. 24 to March 10, before decisions were made about restrictions on issuing funds in foreign currency to the population, $26 billion was withdrawn from our accounts,\u201d Kostin said. Capital controls introduced in February and March last year included a ban on buying cash dollars and euros as depositors hurriedly withdrew funds and Moscow sought to wrestle back some control on the FX market.\u201d Margus Laidre, the Estonian ambassador to Russia, left his residence early on Tuesday morning, Russian state agencies have reported, suggesting that diplomatic relations between countries have been reduced to the level of charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires. On 11 January, Estonia demanded that Moscow reduce the number of employees of the Russian embassy. The Estonian ministry of foreign affairs stated that in this way parity with the number of employees of the Estonian embassy in Moscow would be ensured. Since the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, Estonia has reduced bilateral relations with Moscow to a minimum, closing Russian consulates in both Narva and Tartu and expelling three Russian diplomats. Ukraine had withdrawn from its libraries 19m copies of books by last November that came either from the Soviet era or were in Russian, a senior lawmaker has said. Reuters reports: Yevheniya Kravchuk, deputy head of the Ukrainian parliament\u2019s committee on humanitarian and information policy, said that of the 19m books, 11mwere in Russian. \u201cSome Ukrainian-language books from the Soviet era are also written off,\u201d Kravchuk said according to a statement published on the website of the Verkhovna Rada, the country\u2019s parliament. \u201cThere are also recommendations to write off and remove books whose authors supported armed aggression against Ukraine.\u201d It was not immediately clear what happened to the withdrawn books. After Russia moved to annex Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula in 2014, Kyiv increasingly restricted the use of Russian books. The process of the so-called \u201cde-russification\u201d sped up when Russia invaded the country nearly a year ago. In mid-2022, Ukraine restricted the distribution of Russian books, seeking to further sever cultural ties between the two neighbours and undo policies that Kyiv authorities say have suppressed Ukrainian identity for centuries. \u201cIn general, the ratio of books in Russian and Ukrainian languages in our libraries is just very regretful,\u201d Kravchuk said. \u201cSo now we are talking about the fact that it is necessary to renew funds and purchase books in the Ukrainian language as soon as possible.\u201d She added that about 44% of books in Ukraine\u2019s libraries are in Russian, the rest in Ukrainian or languages of the European Union countries. Russia almost certainly now lacks the munitions and manoeuvre units required for successful offensives, UK Ministry of Defence says. Moscow will continue to demand sweeping advances, but it remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war in the coming weeks, according to the UK Ministry of Defence\u2019s latest intelligence update. The update comes as Russia pours reinforcements into eastern Ukraine ahead of a new offensive that could begin next week. The update said: Russian forces have only managed to gain several hundred metres of territory per week. This is almost certainly because Russia now lacks the munitions and manoeuvre units required for successful offensives. Senior commanders likely make plans requiring undermanned, inexperienced units to achieve unrealistic objectives due to political and profession pressure. The update said it\u2019s highly likely Russia has been attempting to re-start offensive operations in Ukraine since early January this year, and almost certainly with the goal of capturing the remaining Ukrainian-held parts of Donetsk oblast. Here are some of the latest images from the frontline in Ukraine. Labour to pledge rapid action on replenishing UK weapon stocks Labour will seek to shift defence procurement to an \u201curgent operational footing\u201d to help buy fresh arms for Ukraine and replenish stockpiles depleted by previous gifts of military aid if it wins the next election. The opposition party believes it has taken too long for the Ministry of Defence to buy fresh munitions, citing a near year-long wait to agree a contract to replace the 4,000-plus Nlaw anti-tank bazookas sent to Kyiv before and in the early stages of the war. In a speech on Tuesday, John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, will argue that Britain\u2019s defence purchasing is wasteful and in need of an urgent overhaul to support Ukraine in its war with Russia. More on this story here: Russia says protection structures at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant near completion The construction of protective structures for key facilities at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeast Ukraine is nearing completion, Reuters reports. The report first appeared in Russia\u2019s state TASS news agency reported on Tuesday, citing an adviser to the head of Russia\u2019s nuclear plants operator. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe\u2019s largest, was captured by Russian troops in March of last year, in the opening days of Moscow\u2019s invasion in Ukraine. It remains close to the frontlines, and has repeatedly come under fire, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. TASS cited Renat Karchaa of Russia\u2019s nuclear plants operator Rosenergoatom as saying: The erection of engineering and construction structures, which are designed to provide additional protection for important infrastructure facilities of the nuclear power plant, including those related to the storage of radioactive materials, is at the completion stage. Outnumbered and Worn Out, Ukrainians in East Brace for Russian Assault: New York Times As Russia pours reinforcements into eastern Ukraine ahead of a new offensive, the New York Times reports how it is being felt in the towns and villages along the hundreds of miles of undulating eastern front. Exhausted Ukrainian troops complain they are already outnumbered and outgunned, even before Russia has committed the bulk of its roughly 200,000 newly mobilized soldiers. And doctors at hospitals speak of mounting losses as they struggle to care for fighters with gruesome injuries. The civilians standing in the way of Russia\u2019s planned advance once again face the agonizing decision of whether to leave or to stay and wait out the coming calamity. When and where the new offensive will begin in earnest is still unclear, but Ukrainian officials are gravely concerned. Ukraine\u2019s military defied dire assessments before the war, thwarting Russia\u2019s early efforts to seize the capital, Kyiv, and eventually driving Russian forces back in the northeast and south. But the Russian military just keeps coming. Right now, the newly mobilized troops are finishing their training and entering the field; the forces include as many soldiers as took part in the initial invasion last year. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I\u2019m Jordyn Beazley and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next hour. Russia has been pouring reinforcements into eastern Ukraine ahead of a new offensive that could begin next week along a front where there have been relentless battles for months, Reuters reports, citing a Ukrainian governor. \u201cWe are seeing more and more [Russian] reserves being deployed in our direction, we are seeing more equipment being brought in \u2026 ,\u201d said Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine\u2019s governor of the mainly Russian-occupied province. \u201cThey bring ammunition that is used differently than before \u2013 it is not round-the-clock shelling anymore. They are slowly starting to save, getting ready for a full-scale offensive,\u201d Haidai told Ukrainian television. \u201cIt will most likely take them 10 days to gather reserves. After 15 February we can expect [this offensive] at any time.\u201d Here are some of the other latest developments: Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said personnel changes on the border and frontline would bolster Ukraine\u2019s military efforts amid uncertainty over the future of his defence minister. \u201cWe are bolstering our managerial positions,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his Monday evening address. \u201cIn a number of regions, particularly those on the border or on the frontline, we will appoint leaders with military experience. Those who can show themselves to be the most effective in defending against existing threats.\u201d The EU is preparing for a potential visit by Zelenskiy to Brussels on Thursday to meet the bloc\u2019s leaders and address parliament. The European Council chief, Charles Michel, invited Zelenskiy to take part in a \u201cfuture summit\u201d of the 27 EU nations, his spokesperson said Monday. Zelenskiy was invited \u201cto participate in person\u201d, the spokesperson said, adding that, for security reasons, \u201cno further information will be provided\u201d. Russia launched five missile and 12 air attacks as well as 36 shelling attacks over a 24-hour period, hitting southern targets such as Kherson, the Ukrainian armed forces said on Monday evening. Ukrainian aircraft also launched nine strikes on a concentration of Russian forces and two anti-aircraft positions. Battleground reports could not be immediately verified. Weeks of intense fighting continued to rage around the city of Bakhmut and the nearby towns of Soledar and Vuhledar, Ukraine\u2019s presidential office said. Ukraine said on Monday evening that Russian forces had used tank, mortar and artillery fire in Bakhmut in the past 24 hours. The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence said Russia was continuing to make small advances in its efforts to encircle Bakhmut. \u201cWhile multiple alternative cross-country supply routes remain available to Ukrainian forces, Bakhmut is increasingly isolated.\u201d Russian forces are attempting to tie down Ukrainian forces with fighting in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine has said. Moscow is reportedly assembling additional troops there for an expected offensive in the coming weeks, perhaps targeting the Luhansk region. \u201cThe battles for the region are heating up,\u201d said Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk. In Luhansk, fellow governor Serhiy Haidai said shelling there had subsided because \u201cthe Russians have been saving ammunition for a large-scale offensive\u201d. The western area of the Luhansk region is likely to be the focus of any new Russian offensive, Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, who has been tipped to take over the Ministry of Defence, has said. In an interview with the Financial Times, he said that offensive would most likely be launched by \u201cproper mechanised brigades\u201d rather than the ill-trained reservists and Wagner mercenaries who have been suffering heavy casualties in recent battles. Ukraine has faced temperatures as low as -20C this winter, at the same time as dealing with a humanitarian crisis as Russia hits key civilian infrastructure. Areas in Dnipro, Donetsk and Kharkiv are particularly vulnerable, according to research. Some areas are housing tens of thousands of displaced people through the winter, at the same time as crucial infrastructure \u2013 including energy and housing \u2013 is being targeted by Russian missiles and artillery. The UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has warned the world is walking into a \u201cwider war\u201d over Ukraine. Addressing the UN general assembly just weeks before the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s 24 February invasion of Ukraine, Guterres said: \u201cThe prospects for peace keep diminishing. The chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing.\u201d Germany\u2019s plan to quickly assemble two battalions of Leopard 2 tanks from European allies and send them to Ukraine is progressing more slowly than expected. Several states have yet to decide whether they can spare vehicles. In Europe, other than Berlin, only Poland and Portugal have so far made concrete promises to contribute. Ukrainian soldiers are supposed to start being trained on Leopard 2 tanks in Germany and Poland from this week. \u201cGermany\u2019s commitment stands,\u201d government spokesperson Wolfgang B\u00fcchner said on Monday. Canada\u2019s defence minister, Anita Anand, shared an image of the first Canadian-donated Leopard tank arriving in Poland. \u201cAlongside our allies, we\u2019ll soon be training the armed forces of Ukraine in the use of this equipment,\u201d she tweeted. Norway\u2019s prime minister, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, has proposed his country should provide 75bn Norwegian kroner (\u00a36.1 bn) in aid to Ukraine over five years. Half of the aid in 2023 would fund Kyiv\u2019s military requirements while the rest would go to humanitarian needs, although this split could change in coming years, he said. The announcement comes after St\u00f8re\u2019s government came under pressure to increase support for Ukraine, after earning billions in extra oil and gas revenue from Russia\u2019s war. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, will not be meeting Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow this week, the Kremlin has said. Grossi is expected to meet officials from the Russian state nuclear energy firm Rosatom and the foreign ministry, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, adding that Moscow expected a \u201csubstantive dialogue\u201d. Russia\u2019s oil and gas revenues plunged 46% in January, compared with the same month in 2022, under the impact of the price cap on oil exports imposed by western allies over Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Russia\u2019s finance ministry said budget revenue in January was 35% lower compared with the same month in 2022, the last month before Russia sent troops into Ukraine."

            "title": "China foreign minister warns against \u2018fuelling the fire\u2019 over Ukraine conflict",
            "date": "2023-02-21T05:33:47Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s new foreign minister has accused the US of shifting blame for the Ukraine war on to China, in an apparent pushback against warnings from Washington that China is considering supplying weapons to Russia. Speaking on Tuesday morning, at the launch of a Chinese government paper on its global security initiative, Qin Gang said China was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the war in Ukraine escalating and possibly \u201cspiralling out of control\u201d. Beijing signed a no-limits partnership with Moscow weeks before the invasion of Ukraine one year ago. Since then, it has refused to condemn the invasion and some senior Chinese officials have offered explicit support for Russia\u2019s aims. However, it has presented itself as a neutral party, accusing the US and Nato of fuelling the conflict. This week, China\u2019s top diplomat and former foreign minister, Wang Yi, called for a negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia, during a stopover in Hungary on his way to Moscow. Wang, who will give a speech in the Russian capital in the coming days, has also flagged a peace plan, expected to be announced this week. \u201cSince the outbreak of the crisis, China has taken an objective and impartial stance based on the merit of the issue,\u201d Qin said on Tuesday. \u201cWe urge certain countries to immediately stop fuelling the fire, stop shifting blame to China, and stop hyping up Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow.\u201d Qin\u2019s comments added to furious denunciations from Beijing after US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned on Saturday that Washington had intelligence that Beijing was considering providing \u201clethal assistance\u201d to Russia. \u201cThere are various kinds of lethal assistance that they are at least contemplating providing,\u201d Blinken said in an interview with NBC News, adding that Washington would soon release more details. On Monday afternoon, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the US was in \u201cno position\u201d to lecture China on the Ukraine conflict. Wang Wenbin said it was the US who had been \u201cpouring weapons on to the battlefield\u201d. \u201cWe would never stand for finger-pointing, or even coercion and pressurising from the United States on our relations with Russia,\u201d he told the regular press briefing in Beijing. Efforts to repair the China-US relationship have disintegrated after the US shot down a suspected spy balloon over US airspace earlier this month. Beijing denied it was spying and accused the US of overreacting. An informal meeting between Blinken and Wang in Munich over the weekend did not appear to break the impasse. Over the last week, there has been an apparent concerted campaign by Chinese officials and state media against Washington. State media has published multiple essays, infographics, op-eds and commentary pieces on \u201cthe perils of US hegemony\u201d, and accused it of \u201cplaying up the China threat\u201d. \u201cIt is the US that has been threatening China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity by continuously interfering in its internal affairs, be it in Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong or Tibet,\u201d said a China Daily editorial on Tuesday. \u201cThe US crying \u2018China threat\u2019 is no less than a thief crying \u2018stop thief\u2019.\u201d In the nationalistic Global Times tabloid, a commentary piece said Blinken\u2019s accusation could be a tactic, accusing the west of seeking to hinder China-Russia trade as part of its suite of economic sanctions against Moscow. Beijing has also accused the US of fuelling tensions in Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a province it intends to annex. Taiwan\u2019s government and people overwhelmingly reject the prospect of Chinese rule. On Tuesday, Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, told a forum her government was \u201cbolstering military ties\u201d with the US, and would cooperate with it and other governments on issues including \u201cauthoritarian expansionism\u201d, but gave no further details. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen coming out of China in recent years, particularly under the current leadership, has been a lot of contradictions,\u201d said Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, assistant professor at Taiwan\u2019s National Dong Hwa University. She cited Beijing\u2019s insistence on the international community respecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity, \u201cbut in the case of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine this is clearly not the case\u201d. \u201cAlso this constant urge to portray itself as a very self-confident and strong power, but at the same time being fearful of the slightest criticism and using a disproportionate response. They\u2019re also sort of paranoid about anything perceived as anti-China \u2013 that\u2019s a really important element of their international behaviour.\u201d On Tuesday, Qin launched a government concept paper on Beijing\u2019s plans for a global security initiative, first announced by Xi Jinping at the Boao forum in April 2022. The paper described the ideals and principles underpinning Beijing\u2019s plan, rather than specific details or logistics. The initiative would be UN-backed, and \u201cadvocate a concept of common security, respecting and safeguarding the security of every country\u201d, to resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation, the paper said. It also explicitly rejected the use of sanctions \u2013 a long-held position of Beijing\u2019s. It emphasised respect for \u201cthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries\u201d, which Beijing regularly cites in dismissing international criticism of its activities, including its plans to annex Taiwan. Wen-Ti Sung, a China expert at Australia National University\u2019s Australian Centre on China in the World, said the concept paper appeared to be largely a strategic messaging exercise rather than a fully thought out strategy, and continued Beijing\u2019s ambiguity over the Ukraine war. However, it had some notable specifics, such as the listing of multilateral institutions it saw as the best vehicles, including Asean, the Africa Union, and the Arab League. \u201cThe GSI paper doesn\u2019t name the European Union, or any regional organisation in Europe, for example Nato, as a rightful vehicle for regional security governance or dispute resolution,\u201d Sung told the Guardian. \u201cBecause China still wants to help Russia, and doesn\u2019t want to give legitimacy to the EU or Nato playing a leading role on negotiating an end to the Ukraine War. The omission is telling.\u201d"

            "title": "Macron pledges to reduce French military presence in Africa",
            "date": "2023-02-27T20:45:42Z",
            "content": "France is to reduce its military presence in Africa and transform its bases into partnerships with African soldiers, Emmanuel Macron has said ahead of a crucial trip to the continent this week. The French president\u2019s comments came as anti-French sentiment runs high in several former colonies in the Sahel, and Paris seeks to counter growing Chinese and Russian influence on the continent. \u201cThe [military] bases as they exist now are a heritage from the past,\u201d Macron said. He promised to \u201cAfricanise\u201d the bases in the coming months. Some would become \u201cacademies\u201d that would be co-run by French and African armies. The number of French soldiers would go down, but there would be increased efforts on training and equipment. This \u201creorganisation \u2026 does not intend to be a withdrawal\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cWe will remain, but with a reduced footprint.\u201d The promise to overhaul France\u2019s military bases comes in the wake of France\u2019s recent withdrawal from Mali and Burkina Faso after military coups led to fallouts with Paris. First, the ruling junta in Mali led to French troops leaving last year, then army officers running neighbouring Burkina Faso followed suit last month, asking Paris to empty its garrison of about 400 special forces. France, which for a decade was at the forefront of operations against Islamist insurgents in the Sahel, has about 3,000 troops in Africa, down from more than 5,000 two years ago. Macron said France must show \u201cdeep humility\u201d in Africa, amid what he called an \u201cunprecedented historic situation\u201d of security challenges and the climate crisis. But after some African countries criticised France for failing to curb Islamist militancy in the Sahel region, Macron said he would not allow France to become the \u201cideal scapegoat\u201d for local political problems on the ground. The French president has been under pressure to step up his Africa policy since a landmark speech he gave to students at a university in Burkina Faso six years ago, in which he pledged to break away from France\u2019s former post-colonial policies in Africa and criticised the \u201ccrimes of European colonisation\u201d promising a \u201ctruly new relationship\u201d between Africa and Europe. After the African independence movements in the 1950s and 60s, Paris had still intervened regularly in the domestic affairs of its former colonies and for decades retained sway through business and political ties under an unofficial policy known as \u201cFran\u00e7afrique\u201d. Macron said the era of Fran\u00e7afrique was firmly over but acknowledged there was more to be done to boost Paris\u2019s relationship with African countries. He added that a new law would go before the French parliament in the coming weeks to fix a \u201cmethod and criteria\u201d for returning artworks to African countries from French museums. The permanent French military presence in Africa, as well as the existence of common regional currencies underpinned by the French central bank, had become targets for criticism and fuel for populist politicians. As France faces rivalry from Russia in Africa, Macron said he refused to be drawn into an outdated competition between powers for control of Africa. But he hit out at the Russian mercenary Wagner group, which is present in Mali and Central African Republic, calling it the \u201clife insurance of failing regimes in Africa\u201d saying it was waging a \u201cpredatory\u201d drive for mines and natural resources and committing violence against civilians, including rape. When the United Nations on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to demand Russia immediately withdraw its troops from Ukraine, three of the four countries Macron will visit this week \u2013 Gabon, Angola and Congo-Brazzaville \u2013 abstained, alongside China and India."

            "title": "German politicians and military chiefs suggest return of conscription",
            "date": "2023-02-09T08:44:02Z",
            "content": "Political and military figures in Germany have suggested a return of compulsory military service after the new defence minister described the 2011 phase-out of general conscription as a \u201cmistake\u201d that had contributed to alienating the general public from civic institutions. The German parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces, Eva H\u00f6gl of the centre-left SPD, on Wednesday urged the government to ask itself whether some form of obligatory civic service was required to address staff shortages in the German army\u2019s ranks. \u201cWe definitely need more personnel in the Bundeswehr,\u201d H\u00f6gl told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. The chief of the German navy, Jan Christian Kaack, also recently proposed a return of mandatory military service along the Norwegian model, whereby men and women are called in for an examination upon turning 19, but only a small, motivated percentage of each year group is drafted into the army. \u201cI believe that a nation that needs to become more resilient in times like these will have a higher level of awareness if it is mixed through with soldiers,\u201d said Kaack. The government, for which the growing debate is above all a headache, has been quick to try to pour cold water over the debate. \u201cAll of our efforts have to be concentrated on strengthening the Bundeswehr as a highly professional army,\u201d the finance minister, Christian Lindner, told S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, describing it as a \u201cphantom dispute\u201d. Steffen Hebestreit, a government spokesperson, on Monday described the debate as \u201cnonsensical\u201d, adding that turning the Bundeswehr from a conscript to a professional army \u201ccould not be reversed from one moment to the next\u201d. The debate was kicked off by an interview in which Boris Pistorius, the new defence minister who took office last month, said it had been a mistake to phase out conscription more than a decade ago. From 1956 until 2011, German men were obliged to perform some form of civic service upon turning 18, with those who did not want to serve in the army having the option to instead carry out Zivildienst in civic institutions such as hospitals or homes for elderly people. With the staffing requirements of a downsized army shrinking after the fall of the Berlin Wall, both services were suspended under Angela Merkel\u2019s rule in 2011, though a clause allowing the state to draft men into the armed forces remains part of the German Basic Law. Recently army officials have complained of their struggles to fill the ranks of a Bundeswehr no more than 183,000 strong, while social institutions bemoan the lack of young care workers for whom a Zivildienst spell used to work as a door-opener into the sector. When Pistorius described the phase-out as a mistake, he was explicitly referring not to the threat faced by an aggressive Russian state, but the social acceptance of armed forces in German society. \u201cBack in the day there was a conscript at every second kitchen table\u201d, he said. \u201cWhich meant there was always a connection to civic society at large.\u201d Citing attacks on firefighters and police officers, Pistorius told S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung \u201cit appears that the people have lost the awareness that they themselves are part of the state and of society. [\u2026] Taking responsibility for a set period could open eyes and ears for that\u201d. A return of obligatory military service would require the state to spend millions of euros to rebuild and upgrade barracks and buy in weapons and equipment for training, not least because the number of eligible conscripts would be higher than in the past: as in Norway, a modern version of military conscription would probably have to apply to women as well as men. Since modern armies require staff trained in increasingly complex military hardware, conscripts serving for only a few months would be of little use. \u201cThe Russians would lead a different war against us,\u201d said Carlo Masala, a professor of international politics at the University of the Bundeswehr, Munich, and a noted conscription-sceptic. \u201cYou don\u2019t need mass armies, you need professionals with excellent training.\u201d"

            "content": "The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers as part of a blizzard of announcements aimed at showing that it will \u201cstand by Ukraine for the long-haul\u201d. Speaking at the start of a two-day trip to Kyiv, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, reiterated that the EU aimed to have a tenth package of sanctions against Russia in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the invasion ordered by Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe are making Putin pay for his atrocious war,\u201d she told reporters, on a visit accompanied by 15 EU commissioners, the first time so many EU officials have visited a war zone. \u201cToday Russia is paying a heavy price as our sanctions are eroding its economy, throwing it back by a generation.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said there was a joint task to curb the circumvention of sanctions, adding: \u201cThe more we do it, the closer we will be to defeat of Russian aggression.\u201d With a promise to \u201ckeep on turning up the pressure\u201d, Von der Leyen also reiterated that the EU would cap the price of Russian petroleum products, as part of a broader G7 plan to restrict oil revenues available to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine. The G7 and the EU have already agreed a price cap on crude oil that came into force last December and according to Von der Leyen, costs Russia \u20ac160m (\u00a3142m) a day. The EU\u2019s 27 member states are yet to agree on the latest oil price cap. Discussions continue on a proposal to set the cap at $100 a barrel for premium petroleum products and $45 a barrel for discount ones. One diplomatic source said they were confident of an agreement by 5 February, the agreed deadline. Working with Ukrainian prosecutors, the EU also intends to set up an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression in Ukraine to be located in The Hague, Von der Leyen said. The purpose of this centre is to collect and store evidence, for any future trial, whether that takes place via a special tribunal or some other way. Separately the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, announced the intention of EU member states to train an additional 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers in 2023, doubling an existing 15,000 troop-training programme launched last October. This \u20ac45m plan comes alongside a further \u20ac500m in EU-funded weapons for Ukraine announced on Thursday, taking the total assistance from the bloc under the European peace facility to \u20ac3.6bn. On the eve of the EU visit to Kyiv, Ukraine said Russia was planning a major military offensive to mark the first anniversary of the war. In an interview on French TV Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, warned that Russia could call on half a million troops. Referring to Russia\u2019s general mobilisation of 300,000 conscripted soldiers in September last year, he said that numbers at the border suggest the true size could be closer to 500,000. \u201cWe do not underestimate our enemy,\u201d Reznikov said. \u201cOfficially, they announced 300,000, but when we see the troops at the borders, according to our assessments, it is much more.\u201d On Thursday two Russian missiles hit the eastern city of Kramatorsk, causing as yet unknown civilian casualties, local officials said. Two people were killed by Russian shelling in the southern Kherson region. Those attacks came after a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Kramatorsk on Wednesday night killed at least three people and injured 20 others. Von der Leyen and Borrell arrived in Kyiv under tight security on Thursday to meet Ukraine\u2019s government, with 14 other EU commissioners. The heavily symbolic visit was intended not only as a show of support, but encouragement as Ukraine bids to join the EU at unprecedented speed. Ukraine\u2019s government has expressed hope of joining the EU within two years, but most member states think the process will take many years, if not decades. Von der Leyen will remain in Kyiv on Friday for an EU-Ukraine summit, the first since the Russian invasion. Among a blizzard of announcements, Von der Leyen said the EU would be supplying Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power the country\u2019s public buildings. According to Brussels officials, the EU institutions and its 27 member states have given Ukraine support worth \u20ac50bn, plus \u20ac10bn for 8 million refugees who have fled to Europe. The EU also wants to speed up Ukraine\u2019s integration into its single market and help the country make the transition to green energy. EU officials are working closely with Ukrainian counterparts on the bloc\u2019s 10th package of sanctions against Russia, which are expected to include weapons and technology found on the battlefield that have been missed in previous rounds. With the Russian economy already under heavy sanctions, diplomats do not expect a major expansion of economic restrictions; lucrative sectors such as Russian diamond exports and nuclear industry are likely to remain untouched. The EU is also studying the legally-fraught question of how it can use Russian assets to help pay for the rising cost of rebuilding Ukraine, estimated by the World Bank last September to be \u20ac349bn (\u00a3312bn). \u201cRussia will also have to pay for the destruction it caused and will have to contribute to the reconstruction of Ukraine,\u201d Von der Leyen said. Taking part in the European Commission-Ukraine government talks were two of Von der Leyen\u2019s three deputies, Margrethe Vestager, who leads on digital policy regulation, and Valdis Dombrovskis, who is in charge of trade policy, as well as officials leading on the rule of law, environment, justice, agriculture and financial regulation. EU officials have sought to avoid any emulation of Zelenskiy\u2019s military-style dress among the visiting delegation. Ahead of the meeting, commissioners were advised to wear \u201cusual business attire \u2026\u2026 avoiding green, khaki or too bright colours\u201d, according to an internal memo seen by the Guardian."

            "title": "\u2018Defense is a lost art\u2019: has the NBA\u2019s offensive explosion gone too far?",
            "date": "2023-02-03T09:00:04Z",
            "content": "The Golden State Warriors with Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are considered by many to be the greatest NBA team of all time. In 2016-17, they had four All-Stars and an offensive rating of 114.8, by far the best in NBA history. That same offense would rank 10th in the league this season. The NBA is witnessing an offensive explosion the likes of which we have never seen before. Teams are playing faster than ever, taking more threes than ever, and scoring more points than ever. Meanwhile, players are seeing their stats inflate to the point where it has become difficult to contextualize them, with seven players averaging at least 30 points a game this season. Donovan Mitchell\u2019s 71-point game in January was met with something approaching a collective shrug. But rarely do we talk about the other side of the equation: defense. As offense has risen across the NBA, defense has fallen to the wayside, as it has become nearly impossible to get stops without fouling. In fact, the Cleveland Cavaliers lead the league with a defensive rating of 109.6, which would be the worst defensive rating to lead the league in NBA history if the season ended today. Just a few years ago, in the 2015-16 season, the San Antonio Spurs led the league with a 98.2 defensive rating, meaning teams are scoring about 11 more points per 100 possessions against the league\u2019s best defense than they were seven years ago. The consensus is that more offense leads to a better product. And scoring is fun. Nobody wants to go back to the 1990s when the final scores were in the 70s and the play was slow, cramped and physical. But has the offensive explosion gone too far? And is defense becoming a lost art? According to some of the most influential players and coaches in the league, the answer is a resounding yes. And if nothing is done to help defenses, things are likely to continue trending in this direction. \u201cI think maybe there\u2019s been an overcorrection to what was happening 20 years ago,\u201d Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cI played in the NBA finals [with the Spurs] in \u201803, so 20 years ago this June, and the final scores were like 72-65, and it was ugly. And I think the league did an amazing job of loosening up the game, creating more freedom.\u201d Kerr added: \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve just gone a little too far. I think that the rules have really been geared towards giving the offensive player the advantage. It\u2019s become much more difficult to play defense in the NBA now.\u201d Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown went so far as to say that he thinks \u201cthe league has made an emphasis that they want to see more scoring, see more high performances\u201d. Adding that: \u201cIt\u2019s better for the branding and marketing of our league.\u201d The NBA has a long history of creating rule changes to alter the product in one way or another. But the biggest arguably came in 2004, when the league wanted to inject some offensive punch, and eliminated the use of hand-checking, which had allowed defensive players to keep opposing ball-handlers in front of them. In recent years the NBA has cracked down even further on physical contact, especially on the perimeter, with players consistently being called for touch-fouls, giving offensive players free rein to get to the rim and either shoot a layup or pass it out for a three-pointer \u2013 two of the most efficient shots in the game. The problem, at least according to the players and coaches the Guardian spoke with for this story, is that the rule changes have failed to keep up with the increase in players\u2019 skills. From superstars to the last man on the bench, the league is more talented than ever, and coaches are using that talent in increasingly advantageous ways. \u201cI think the league has definitely grown in skill each and every year. Each position continues to take leaps forward,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou see point guards getting more and more athletic, bigs shooting the ball, being able to handle the ball, wings being able to do everything. The game is definitely the more skilled man wins.\u201d \u201cEveryone\u2019s capable of making open threes, open shots,\u201d Brown\u2019s Celtics teammate Grant Williams added. \u201cYou look at our team \u2026 I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a single guy on the team you wouldn\u2019t tell to shoot a three.\u201d As a result, teams are shooting more three-pointers than ever before, averaging 34.2 three-point attempts a game, or 35.5% of all shots, which is up from 24.1 attempts per game and 26% of shots in 2015-16. But the rise of three-point shooting isn\u2019t the only factor helping offenses thrive. Role players are more talented and versatile than ever, able to put the ball on the floor and make quick, smart decisions to keep the defense in motion and create highly efficient shots for their teammates. \u201cI think a lot of the offensive explosion has to do with a lot more people putting it on the ground and going to the basket, and the difficulty with defending that multitude of things,\u201d Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse said. On top of individual skill developments, there are the stylistic changes. Teams are pushing the ball up the floor like never before, jacking up shots early in the shot clock and creating more possessions and therefore more opportunities to score, with teams averaging 100.1 possessions per game, up from 96.5 in 2015-16. \u201cI think the biggest thing is teams are putting up shots so quick or so fast to the point where you don\u2019t even get a chance to get back on defense,\u201d 16-year NBA veteran and current Raptor Thad Young said. \u201cBecause the ball is being kicked up the court or guys are pushing it up and teeing it off from the logo and stuff like that.\u201d Plus, the elimination of the take foul has helped transition offenses become more efficient than ever. Skill improvements and stylistic changes sound great, theoretically. But instead of the fast-paced, up-and-down game those changes would seem to promise, a 48-minute NBA game is still taking approximately two and a half hours to get through. That\u2019s due in large part to the increasing number of fouls and stoppages, which is a problem for the league given fans\u2019 shrinking attention spans. As offenses thrive, teams are having a difficult time getting stops. And the result is a whole lot of fouls and free-throws that disrupt the rhythm of the game and can become difficult to watch. This season, teams are taking 23.7 free-throw attempts per game, the highest rate since 2010-11, and committing 20.3 fouls per game, the most since 2019-20. And not only are fans unhappy, but many of the players and coaches who pride themselves on defense feel like they are not being given a fair chance to succeed. \u201c[Because of] the rules of the game, you can\u2019t play physically to get stops or it\u2019s a foul now. So we\u2019ve got to kind of give way a lot of times to a lot of situations, or you will be either in foul trouble or guys shooting a free throw,\u201d Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups said. \u201cIt\u2019s too tough [to defend] ... the game is made for the offensive player. Today\u2019s game was made for the offense.\u201d Basketball is not an easy game to officiate in large part because there is physical contact on almost every possession. But what we are witnessing now is a no-win situation: fans and coaches are unhappy with the number of calls being made, while players are unhappy with the inconsistency of referees. Perhaps a more lenient interpretation of the rules in favor of defenders would allow players to actually play defense without being penalized for it. It could even increase the entertainment value of the product because defense can be fun, too. \u201cUnfortunately, the defensive end becomes like a lost art,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt makes it hard to defend guys without fouling and really get into guys.\u201d It\u2019s easy to ask officials to allow for more contact, but it\u2019s much more difficult to actually execute in such a physical, fast-paced environment. The NBA may need to step in and alter the rules in order to give defenses an advantage just as it has in the past with offense. For example, the NBA could make it a point of emphasis to penalize flopping and unnatural, foul-baiting shooting motions, which it had brief success doing to start the 2020-21 season. Or, if it wants to get even more radical, the league could bring back a version of hand-checking or lengthen the three-in-the-key rule to five seconds, allowing bigs to stay stationed in the paint for longer to deter offensive players \u2013 as is the case in international basketball. The NBA is ultimately an entertainment product. And while the idea of scoring is fun, the reality is that the league is trending too far in one direction, giving defenses no choice but to foul and stop the game ad nauseam. Competition breeds entertainment, and if the NBA wants to create the best product possible, it would be wise to allow the players to decide their own fates instead of allowing that power to rest on the shoulders of the referees."

Launched before Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Saturday, the Nokia G22 has a removable back and internal design that allows components to be easily unscrewed and swapped out including the battery, screen and charging port. Nokia phones manufacturer HMD Global will make \u201cquick fix\u201d repair guides and genuine parts available for five years via specialists iFixit, in addition to affordable professional repair options. \u201cPeople value long-lasting, quality devices and they shouldn\u2019t have to compromise on price to get them. The new Nokia G22 is purposefully built with a repairable design so you can keep it even longer,\u201d said Adam Ferguson, head of product marketing for HMD Global. The G22 is partially made of recycled plastic and has a 6.53in screen, large-capacity battery, 50-megapixel camera and a fingerprint scanner. It runs Android 12 and will be supported for three years of monthly security updates and two major Android version upgrades. HMD Global hopes to ride the wave of increasing consumer desire for longer-lasting and more repairable devices. It follows in the footsteps of pioneers such as the Dutch manufacturer Fairphone, but at more affordable prices and with far simpler processes than Apple\u2019s recent DIY repair programmes. The Nokia G22 will cost from \u00a3149.99 shipping on 8 March with replacement parts costing \u00a318.99 for a charging port, \u00a322.99 for a battery and \u00a344.99 for a screen. Alongside several other low-end smartphones, HMD also announced it would begin the first steps of manufacturing 5G devices in Europe in 2023. Though light on detail, it aims to reduce the carbon footprint of locally sold devices and to enhance security, starting with a device for security-conscious industry before progressing to consumer devices. \u201cThe Nokia brand has a proud history within the European market, and with this move we are continuing to strengthen our position as the only major European smartphone provider,\u201d said Jean-Francois Baril, co-founder and chief executive of HMD Global."

            "date": "2023-02-25T07:00:47Z",
            "content": "Fairtrade tea, coffee and chocolate was once the mainstay of church hall fetes and upmarket delis but is now popping up in supermarket value ranges as the demand for affordable and sustainable groceries goes mainstream. Marks &amp; Spencer, the Co-op and Waitrose are among the high street names whose budget ranges include the ethical label, making it possible for shoppers to make a \u201csmall switch\u201d when shopping during Fairtrade Fortnight, which starts on Monday. Kerrina Thorogood, the Fairtrade Foundation\u2019s commercial partnerships director, said \u201csustainability doesn\u2019t have to be unaffordable for consumers\u201d. The organisation is encouraged that so many of its retail partners are offering Fairtrade products at a \u201crange of accessible price points\u201d this year. \u201cEthical consumerism in the UK has gone from a niche, fragile market to a robust, mainstream one, suggesting it is embedded in shopper habits and here to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite the challenging economic context, UK consumers still largely expect businesses to do the right thing in terms of sourcing ethics.\u201d After wobbling in previous years, retailers are supporting Fairtrade with renewed vigour as, even amid the cost of living crisis, shoppers look for sustainable products. Gaps on shelves, as with the current salad shortage, have also reinforced the need to support growers. Indeed, the message of this year\u2019s Fairtrade Fortnight campaign is that the supply of favourite foods such as bananas, coffee and chocolate is at risk as producers are pushed to the brink by climate and economic crisis. The UK imports 40% of its food, and about 15% is from low-income countries. The ethical label guarantees that the producers get a set minimum price, as well as a financial bonus. There are now more than 6,000 Fairtrade products including coffee, tea, wine, sugar and chocolate but also clothing and beauty products. The Co-op has expanded its Fairtrade range by a fifth over the past year and in its Honest Value range you can pick up a pack of 80 teabags for \u00a31.05 or instant coffee for \u00a31.50. Waitrose and M&amp;S also have tea and coffee in their budget ranges, and Sainsbury\u2019s is selling a bunch of five Fairtrade bananas for 71p at the time of writing. Asda and Amazon have added a tag on their websites for Fairtrade products so shoppers can search specifically for them. Emily Pearce, the Co-op\u2019s senior sustainable sourcing and international development manager, said Fairtrade was part of what the retailer stood for and it sought to offer \u201cvalue with values in many of our everyday lines\u201d. In the Co-op, all its own-label wine, bagged sugar and bananas are Fairtrade. Thorogood said that for future food security, business must invest in Fairtrade supply chains or there\u2019s no guarantee farmers overseas will stay in farming. \u201cThe rising cost of living isn\u2019t just affecting us here,\u201d she said. \u201cThis unprecedented global crisis is also hitting farmers and workers in poorer countries, too, who are already struggling with fewer resources, rising costs, low prices and damage associated with climate change.\u201d In recent years, consumers have spent more on ethical products, with demand for plant-based foods as well as Fairtrade and organic ranges. Rising food prices in the UK had fuelled concerns that shoppers would turn their back on sustainability in order to save money. However, three-quarters of UK shoppers buy the ethical brand, according to a Fairtrade Foundation poll in the run-up to its annual campaign drive."

            "title": "Super Bowl LVII is a tale of two terrifying defenses",
            "date": "2023-02-09T17:10:08Z",
            "content": "The hype and intrigue swirling around quarterbacks Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes in Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl is deserved. But the game may well be decided by which quarterback copes with the heat coming at him from the opposition. Both defenses have been great this season. Here\u2019s how Hurts and Mahomes may fare against them. Eagles defensive front v Chiefs offensive line Roster construction is vital for all Super Bowl teams. Eagles GM Howie Roseman was nothing short of a wizard this past offseason. And despite Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones recently comparing Philadelphia to the Los Angeles Rams of 2022 \u2013 a team that \u201cbet it all\u201d for one Super Bowl \u2013 the Eagles are built for long-term success. Yes, Roseman gave up valuable draft picks to acquire AJ Brown. But Brown, with 1,496 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns during the regular season, has proven a steal. As much as Brown has inspired the offense, linebacker Haason Reddick, signed on day one of free agency, has ignited the defensive front. Reddick, a Temple alum who grew up just outside Philadelphia and always dreamed of playing for the Eagles, has terrorized opposing quarterbacks this season. His 16 sacks in the regular season make this the third consecutive season Reddick has reached double digits in the category. He\u2019s peaked at the right time too, collecting 9.5 sacks since December. Reddick tore through San Francisco\u2019s offensive line in the NFC title game, getting two sacks and forcing a fumble on the hit that effectively knocked Brock Purdy out of the game. Reddick alone is a force, but he is just one cog in a collective of elite pass rushers. Reddick, defensive ends Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham, along with tackle Javon Hargrave form the first quartet in NFL history to each amass double-digit sacks on the same team. This group pounces with coordinated attacks, wins one-on-one battles and is scarily explosive. Roseman fortified the interior as well, signing free-agent linebackers Kyzir White and TJ Edwards, who have been off-the-ball rocks. He also signed veteran tackles Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh during the season, adding to the team\u2019s already impressive depth. All told, Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon has a litany of talent with which to throw multiple looks while rotating between four- and five-man fronts. But if there\u2019s any quarterback in the NFL that would stand on a mountaintop and scream: \u201cBring me your five-man blitzes!\u201d, it\u2019s the mercurial Mahomes, who can find receivers even when under severe pressure. There is no magical formula for stopping Mahomes, who can release the ball with precision from any angle in a nanosecond. But the Eagles have as strong an arsenal as Mahomes will face this season. Roseman\u2019s best work has been shoring up his secondary, which has thrived in Gannon\u2019s system. In 2020 the Eagles were somehow able to give away just a third- and fifth-round pick for five-time Pro Bowl cornerback Darius Slay, who is still fueled by the disrespect he was shown by Matt Patricia at the Detroit Lions. Roseman also traded for productive safety CJ Gardner-Johnson. Perhaps the greatest steal of all was Roseman\u2019s patience in waiting for the New York Giants to cut James Bradberry before snatching him up. Bradberry is having a career year and was named a second-team All Pro. There is enough talent throughout the Eagles defense to scare the bejesus out of Chiefs fans. But the Kansas City offensive line is much stronger than the one that was harried by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the Chiefs\u2019 loss in Super Bowl LV. Four-time Pro Bowl left tackle Orlando Brown Jr will be a challenge for Sweat, and the Chiefs have a strong interior line with guards Joe Thuney and Trey Smith, plus center Creed Humphrey. The one glaring concern is Reddick lining up opposite one-time undrafted free agent Andrew Wylie. Despite all the talent up and down the Eagles defense, one recent opponent was left unimpressed. \u201cI don\u2019t know fully about [Philly\u2019s] defense,\u201d said 49ers wideout Brandon Aiyuk. \u201cThey talk about them being a good defense. I\u2019m not sure. I think \u2026 this Kansas City pass game will expose what we thought we would be able to expose before some unfortunate circumstances happened, so we\u2019ll see. But like I said, you got to get lucky to win the Super Bowl, and they got extremely lucky,\u201d Aiyuk\u2019s comment reeks of bitterness and \u201clucky\u201d isn\u2019t quite the right word. But it is undeniable that the Eagles have had one of the softest schedules in the league this season. The toughest recent matchup was the Eagles\u2019 Christmas Eve loss to the Cowboys, when Dak Prescott became the only quarterback to put up 300 passing yards on the Eagles this season. Kansas City and Mahomes will be a much tougher test. Chiefs defensive front v Eagles offensive line The Chiefs have nowhere near the depth of the Eagles defense, but they have the best overall defensive player in Chris Jones. Jones was the MVP of the AFC championship game, a one-man wrecking ball who dominated every matchup thrown his way. Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo loves moving the versatile tackle around: Jones can handle double teams inside (no interior lineman was double-teamed more this season) or do his thing on the edge. Jones left Joe Burrow and the Bengals line in shambles with his two sacks, four quarterback hits and three tackles for loss in the AFC title game. Frank Clark, who pairs with Jones to form a terrifying pass rush duo, is overjoyed for Jones\u2019s success. \u201cHats off to him,\u201d said Clark. \u201cHe\u2019s having fun and injury free. You watch a lot of times in the past and he wasn\u2019t having fun. My boy\u2019s out there being dominant.\u201d Vital to Jones\u2019 success this season, unlike previous years, is having a strong supporting cast. And it allows Spagnuolo to experiment. Jones mostly lines up on the defensive right which would pit him against Landon Dickerson, who hyperextended his elbow in the NFC Championship. But it\u2019s possible Jones will play some on the left side and test out the excellent Lane Johnson, who has injury concerns of his own. Jones will need plenty of assistance against the best offensive line he\u2019s probably ever faced. Perhaps defensive end Carlos Dunlap can keep up his pass-batting ways \u2013 he tied for most passed defended this season with eight (his teammate, lineman George Karlaftis, had the second most with seven). Down the field, leader of the secondary L\u2019Jarius Sneed has cleared concussion protocol and will be key to stopping big plays to DeVonta Smith and Brown. The Chiefs\u2019 rookie defensive backs Trent McDuffie, Joshua Williams, Bryan Cook and Jaylen Watson have added depth. While they were up and down at times over the season, they stepped up in the AFC Championship in Sneed\u2019s absence. But this Super Bowl will be decided up front. In the AFC title game, the Chiefs shone \u2013 but that was against the Bengals\u2019 patchwork offensive line. This Eagles group is on another level, inside and out, even when gimpy. In two games \u2013 against Dallas and the NFC Championship against San Francisco \u2013 the Eagles\u2019 offensive line largely contained Micah Parsons and Nick Bosa, two of the few defenders in the NFL who may be better than Jones. Neither had a sack in those games. The trenches are the heart of NFL football and given the various matchups in this Super Bowl, our hearts should be dancing on Sunday."

            "date": "2023-02-27T18:18:00Z",
            "content": "Tens of thousands of public sector workers will strike on 15 March and work to rule indefinitely after voting overwhelmingly for industrial action. At least 80% of Prospect union members \u2013 who work for organisations such as the Met Office, Health and Safety Executive and Natural England \u2013 voted for strike action and 92% were in favour of action short of a strike, on a turnout of 72%, well over the legal threshold of 50%. Their action on 15 March, which is budget day, is likely to coincide with a strike by PCS union members in the civil service and other public sector workers, taking the number of civil servants participating in industrial action that day to more than 100,000. Teachers represented by the National Education Union (NEU), junior doctors in England represented by the British Medical Association (BMA) and London Underground drivers represented by Aslef are also set to strike that day. It comes after a wave of strikes over the winter in the public and private sector with many workers protesting against real-terms pay cuts at a time when inflation has been running in double digits. Prospect members are taking action in relation to pay, the threat of job losses and proposed cuts to redundancy terms, and the strike constitutes the union\u2019s largest industrial action in more than a decade. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of Prospect, said his union\u2019s members in the public sector had seen their incomes decline by up to 26% over the past 13 years and that their work had been \u201ctaken for granted\u201d and they had \u201chad enough\u201d. \u201cPoor pay and declining morale represent an existential threat to the civil service\u2019s ability to function, and to our ability to regulate and deliver on the government\u2019s priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cBills are rocketing and pay is falling ever further behind the private sector, leaving our members with no option but to take industrial action. \u201cWe will continue our campaign until the government comes up with a meaningful offer. If it doesn\u2019t do so soon, we may be left with no civil service to protect.\u201d In January, the PCS, Prospect and FDA unions were invited to talks by Jeremy Quin, the paymaster general and Cabinet Office minister, after the government appeared to take a more conciliatory approach towards entering talks to avert strikes within the civil service. However, the unions warned that the government needed to come up with a meaningful offer on pay and conditions if it wanted to avoid industrial action, and no more cash has been forthcoming. The government has urged public sector unions to suspend planned industrial action in return for talks about \u201cfair and affordable\u201d settlements for the next financial year, but this has been rejected as a \u201chollow\u201d request. After that, the PCS union proceeded with a rolling timetable of strikes, with 100,000 members in 214 government departments taking action on specific days in February and March. FDA members on the government fast-stream for graduates have also voted for industrial action."

            "content": "The US military has recovered \u201csignificant debris\u201d from a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon shot down this month, the Pentagon has said, after the White House claimed China had been operating a high-altitude balloon program spying on the US and its allies for many years. The US Northern Command said in a statement: \u201cCrews have been able to recover significant debris from the site, including all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified as well as large sections of the structure.\u201d The balloon, shot down off the coast of South Carolina on 4 February, was the first of a series of mysterious objects shot down by the US military over an eight-day period in North American airspace. However, China\u2019s surveillance program, according to John Kirby, the US national security council spokesperson, dated back to at least the administration of Donald Trump, which he said was oblivious to it. \u201cIt was operating during the previous administration, but they did not detect it,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cWe detected it, we tracked it. And we have been carefully studying to learn as much as we can. We know that these PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] surveillance balloons have crossed over dozens of countries on multiple continents around the world, including some of our closest allies and partners.\u201d There will be an all-senators classified briefing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning, the office of the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said, and the White House\u2019s office of national intelligence will brief John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, on Wednesday, CNN reported. Separately in Japan, the Fuji News Network reported on Tuesday that Tokyo had concluded that the object that flew over Japanese waters near the south-western region of Kyushu in January last year was mostly likely a Chinese spy balloon. Monday\u2019s briefing took place amid growing criticism of the Biden administration for not revealing everything it knew about the unprecedented and extraordinary sequence of events beginning with the downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the South Carolina coast on 4 February. Biden, Kirby said, directed a broad assessment of China\u2019s intelligence capabilities when he took office. In response to recent events, Kirby said Biden had also now directed an interagency team \u201cto study the broader policy implications for detection, analysis and disposition of unidentified aerial objects that pose either safety or security risks\u201d. Kirby was unable to offer new details about the three most recent objects, including the missile strike on Sunday on an unidentified \u201coctagonal\u201d flying object above Lake Huron, Michigan, and other high-altitude objects shot down over Yukon, Canada, on Saturday and Deadhorse, Alaska, the day before. But he said that authorities would know more once debris had been recovered from remote locations and analyzed. He said all three were much smaller and at a lower altitude than the Chinese spy balloon, but their origin, composition and purpose remained unknown. \u201cWe assessed whether they posed any kinetic threat to people on the ground. They did not. We assessed whether they were sending communication signals. We detected none. We looked to see whether they were maneuvering or had any propulsion capabilities. We saw no signs of that,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] while we have no specific reason to suspect that they were conducting surveillance of any kind, we couldn\u2019t rule that out.\u201d He said all three were shot down in \u201can abundance of caution to protect the security, our security, our interest and flight safety\u201d. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, suggested on Monday the objects were part of a \u201cpattern\u201d of surveillance of the US and its allies by China and Russia, and an American air force commander said the US military had spotted Chinese spy balloons in the Middle East in \u201cthe recent past\u201d. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, echoed those comments, saying: \u201cI think obviously there is some sort of pattern in there. The fact that we are seeing this in a significant degree over the past week is a cause for interest and close attention. Trudeau said that Canadian authorities had deployed \u201csignificant resources\u201d to attempt to recover the object shot down over Lake Huron. The Florida Republican Marco Rubio, vice-chairperson of the US Senate intelligence committee, claimed that unidentified aircraft had operated \u201croutinely\u201d over restricted American airspace for years. \u201cThis is why I pushed to take this seriously &amp; created a permanent [unidentified aerial phenomenon] taskforce two years ago,\u201d he said in a tweet. In a press briefing on Sunday, a senior air force officer said he could not eliminate the possibility of extraterrestrial activity. \u201cI\u2019ll let the intel community and the counterintelligence community figure that out. I haven\u2019t ruled out anything at this point,\u201d Gen Glen VanHerck, head of North American airspace defense command (Norad), said. But at the briefing on Monday the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said that the objects did not come from outside Earth. \u201cThere is no indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent takedowns. I wanted to make sure that the American people knew that,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. Melissa Dalton, assistant secretary of defense, echoed VanHerck, saying: \u201cWe have been more closely scrutinizing our airspace at these altitudes, including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase in objects that we\u2019ve detected over the past week.\u201d Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday in Brussels that he suspected the incidents were part of an ongoing strategy of spying by Nato\u2019s rivals. \u201cWhat we saw over the US is part of a pattern where China and also Russia are increasing surveillance activities on Nato allies,\u201d he said, urging member nations to maintain vigilance. Lt Gen Alexus Grynkewich, commander of US air forces central, appeared to back up Stoltenberg\u2019s assessment, telling reporters on Monday that Chinese spy balloons were spotted transiting the Middle East in the recent past, according to foreignpolicy.com. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is reportedly weighing a meeting with his counterpart in China\u2019s government, Wang Yi, at a three-day security conference in Munich scheduled to begin 17 February, according to Bloomberg. Blinken had postponed what would be the first visit to Beijing by a senior US diplomat since 2018 in response to the Chinese balloon\u2019s intrusion."

Three people killed in shooting on Michigan State University campus At least three people were killed and several more injured in a shooting at Michigan State University, according to campus police. The suspected attacker died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. University police tweeted yesterday that shots were fired in two locations: near an academic building called Berkey Hall and an athletic facility known as IM East. Michigan State University (MSU) police initially ordered students and staff to shelter in place after a report of shots fired around the school\u2019s East Lansing campus. An alert was sent shortly after 8.30pm by the university\u2019s police department, advising students to \u201crun, hide, fight\u201d. After searches that went on for more than four hours, MSU police announced at 12.30am on Tuesday that the suspected shooter had been found dead off campus. What have the police said? While appealing for information from the public, the police said it was unclear what the motive for the attack may have been and work to identify the suspect was ongoing. Earlier in the evening, police released images of the suspect, describing him as a short male wearing a mask. Cyclone Gabrielle worst storm to hit New Zealand this century, says PM New Zealand is in a national state of emergency, as Cyclone Gabrielle batters the country, with floods trapping people on roofs, thousands displaced and landslides destroying homes in what officials have described as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d natural disaster. \u201cCyclone Gabrielle is the most significant weather event New Zealand has seen in this century. The severity and the damage that we are seeing has not been experienced in a generation,\u201d the prime minister, Chris Hipkins, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe are still building a picture of the effects of the cyclone as it continues to unfold. But what we do know is the impact is significant and it is widespread.\u201d About 2,500 people have been displaced so far, officials said on Tuesday afternoon \u2013 but that number may shift, as there are still large areas that are unreachable and cut off from telecommunications. The country announced a national state of emergency on Tuesday as the scale of damage inflicted by the storm emerged. How much damage is there? With a number of regions completely cut off on Tuesday, assessing the extent of the damage was proving extremely difficult, and there were no formal numbers so far on numbers of people evacuated, injured, or homes destroyed.

            "date": "2023-02-13T07:36:30Z",
            "content": "The US military has shot down a third flying object over North American airspace in three days, as the air force general overseeing the airspace said he would not rule out any explanation for the objects yet. The high-altitude unidentified object, described as an \u201coctagonal structure\u201d with strings attached to it, was shot down over Lake Huron in Michigan on Sunday. It is understood to have been the same item that was picked up by radar over Montana on Saturday. At the point it was struck by an air-to-air missile launched by F-16 fighter jets, it had been flying across the Great Lakes region at 20,000ft, a height that could have posed a risk to civilian aircraft. \u201cI\u2019m glad to report it has been swiftly, safely and securely taken down,\u201d the state\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, said. The Pentagon said the object appeared to have travelled near US military sites and posed a threat to civilian aviation, as well as being a potential tool for surveillance. Three unidentified flying objects have been downed in as many days, after a large balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on 4 February. That object was claimed by China, although Beijing has insisted it was involved in innocent weather research. Gen Glen VanHerck, who is tasked with safeguarding US airspace, said the military had not been able to identify what the three most recent objects were, how they stayed aloft, or where they were coming from. VanHerck said the US had adjusted its radar so it could track slower objects, and that the three most recent objects were being called, \u201cobjects, not balloons, for a reason\u201d. Asked whether he had ruled out extraterrestrials, VanHerck said: \u201cI\u2019ll let the intel community and the counterintelligence community figure that out. I haven\u2019t ruled out anything.\u201d A defence official subsequently told Reuters that the military had not seen any evidence that the objects were extraterrestrial. Military personnel equipped with specialist diving gear designed for the extremely cold water of Lake Huron were expected to be deployed quickly to search for pieces of the destroyed object. On Friday, an object about the size of a small car was downed off the coast of Alaska, followed by a similar flying object over Yukon, in Canada, on Saturday. The US and Canadian military are attempting to recover the other objects that were shot down last week. Searches via sea and land are operating amid severe weather conditions. The Democratic majority leader of the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, told ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday he had been briefed by the White House and that officials were now convinced that all of the first three flying objects were balloons. He put the finger of blame firmly on China. \u201cThe Chinese were humiliated \u2013 I think the Chinese were caught lying,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real setback for them.\u201d Hours later a spokesperson for the White House national security council tried to tamp down some of Schumer\u2019s rhetoric, saying it was too early to characterise the two latest flying objects shot down over Alaska and Canada. Definitive answers would have to wait for the debris to be recovered, the official said. Schumer said US military and intelligence agencies were \u201cfocused like a laser\u201d on gathering information on the flying objects and then analysing what steps needed to be taken to protect American interests in future. He called it \u201cwild\u201d that the US government had no idea about the balloon spying program until just \u201ca few months ago\u201d. The Canadian military were attempting to reach pieces of the object that was taken down within Canadian airspace on Saturday. The vessel fell over a remote, rugged area of Yukon. The object, described as cylindrical, had been flying at 40,000ft over Canadian territory and was considered a risk to civilian air traffic. Searches by the US military were also continuing in difficult circumstances off the coasts of Alaska and South Carolina, with some debris from the first balloon to be destroyed - the largest of the four objects \u2013 having been retrieved and taken to military laboratories for analysis. Though the Chinese government has admitted owning the balloon, it has insisted it was used only for weather research. The Pentagon has disputed this, saying early indications suggest the balloon was carrying powerful equipment that could intercept communications. The balloon, flying at 60,000ft, was tracked by the US military for several days as it traversed the national airspace, having initially been spotted off the coast of Alaska on 28 January. The air force decided to wait until it was over the Atlantic before shooting it down out of concern for civilians on the ground, the Pentagon said. Schumer defended that decision on Sunday against mounting criticism from Republicans who have castigated Joe Biden for failing to act immediately. By following the balloon across the country, the US had gained \u201cenormous intelligence\u201d on what the Chinese were doing, he said. Schumer predicted the entire object would be pieced back together in the coming days. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge coup for the United States,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s This Week. The confluence of four downed flying objects in a week has raised tensions on both sides of the US and Canadian border. and It has also generated political stresses internationally. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, postponed the first visit to Beijing by a senior US diplomat since 2018 in response to the intrusion of the Chinese balloon. In China, local news outlets cited by Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that the government was preparing to bring down an unidentified flying object said to have been spotted over the port of Qingdao. Fishers in the area had been told to be alert, according to the reports. Reuters contributed to this report"

            "date": "2023-02-15T10:00:08Z",
            "content": "For decades, Ken Brock and Gary Enos largely toiled in the same hangars at New Hampshire\u2019s Pease national air base. The career US national guard members were responsible for giving fuel planes tail-to-nose inspections that prevented crashes. \u201cWe were like general practitioners for planes,\u201d Enos said. Like hundreds of others who served at Pease, both developed cancer, which they and their families believe was probably from exposure to staggering levels of toxic PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in the base\u2019s drinking water. Brock died in 2017, and Enos has survived two bouts of cancer. Yet despite the similar career paths and illness, the military paid for Enos\u2019s care and disability benefits \u2013 but not for Brock and his surviving wife. Since then, the military has been fighting efforts by Brock\u2019s widow, Doris Brock, to get benefits for her and service members who worked for decades at the base. It denies PFAS is behind Pease\u2019s high cancer rates, and helped kill legislation to fund a cancer study that could have proved it wrong. Doris Brock is now leading the charge in a two-pronged David-versus-Goliath battle: she and a group of veterans\u2019 advocates aim to prove Pease\u2019s toxic water is behind the base\u2019s cancer levels, and, on her own, she is pushing to change federal law so career national guard members who do not have sufficient active duty time can still get veterans\u2019 benefits. Though her husband died in 2017, Brock says she is \u201cstill angry\u201d. \u201cHe has been gone for five and a half years, but it\u2019s gone from a personal nature to a \u2018This isn\u2019t right for everyone else still out there,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cSo many people who worked on this base are hurting.\u201d Pease is home to the 157th Air Refueling Wing, and the base also holds 13 superfund sites, which is a designation for the nation\u2019s most contaminated land. Among the pollutants are PFAS, a class of chemicals typically used to make thousands of consumer products resist water, stains and heat. They are linked to serious health issues such as cancer, kidney disease, fetal complications, liver disease and autoimmune disorders. For decades beginning in the 1970s, Pease\u2019s service members drank contaminated water. The Environmental Protection Agency last year issued new advisory health guidelines that found virtually no level of exposure to two different kinds of PFAS is safe \u2013 Pease\u2019s levels were tens of thousands of times above those thresholds. The situation is nearly identical to that at Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, where the military has agreed to pay benefits for those who served at the base and drank contaminated water. But at Pease, the military is using what veterans advocates say are unfair rules or seemingly arbitrary application of rules to deny care and disability payments for many of them. When denying Brock\u2019s benefits, the military has said it cannot be proven that Brock\u2019s and others\u2019 cancers stem from PFAS exposure, Doris Brock said. And though Ken Brock worked full-time for 35 years and deployed around the world to serve during combat, the military initially claimed he did not have the 90 days of consecutive active duty time required for benefits. The New Hampshire air national guard did not answer specific questions about the situation. But Brig Gen John Pogorek noted the national guard was working on the issue as part of the Pease health working group, which was established to find answers about the cancers after pressure from Doris Brock. \u2018That\u2019s when I got mad\u2019 Ken Brock retired from Pease in 2005 and in 2015 tests revealed a bladder cancer that had nearly advanced to stage four, and doctors gave him up to five years to live. In 2016, Brock applied for Veterans Affairs benefits that would have paid for his care, given him access to VA hospitals, and qualified him for disability payments, and Doris Brock for survivor payments after he died. But Brock was rejected, and after trying experimental chemotherapy treatments, he died in June 2017 aged 67. Enos had a different experience: he developed bladder cancer in 2007 and received health care and disability payments. When the cancer returned in his prostate in 2017, he used private insurance, but still continued to receive disability payments. Though he and Brock proved they had adequate active duty time, only Brock was denied benefits. And still others who served for decades next to them aren\u2019t receiving benefits because they do not have adequate active duty time. The situation is \u201cnot right\u201d, said Enos, who is part of the working group. \u201cI want my friends and comrades to live, to get the services they need to live and to be compensated for what they have done for their country,\u201d he added. Doris Brock said she was told by Veterans Affairs in 2016 \u201cit costs too much\u201d to pay for all veterans to receive benefits. \u201cThey said, \u2018That\u2019s why we have these rules,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s when I got mad enough to say, \u2018OK, fine, I\u2019m going to fight to change the rules.\u2019\u201d She set out on a \u201cresearch quest\u201d in 2016 to learn more about the link between Ken Brock\u2019s cancer and Pease\u2019s contamination and quickly found dozens of service members around his age also had cancer, and learned about the high PFAS levels in the drinking water. \u2018There\u2019s a problem\u2019 After Brock pulled together a coalition of veterans and advocates in 2018, the group seemed to score a major victory when the military agreed to do a cancer mortality study, which Congress funded in that year\u2019s defense bill. But the military probably only agreed to it because they know mortality studies are of limited use, said Mindi Messmer, a scientific adviser for the Pease health working group. It only looked at death rates, and fewer people are dying from cancer because of advancements in medicine and early detection. \u201cIf a bunch of people are getting sick from their service but not dying then there\u2019s less of a case for the military to have to pay benefits,\u201d Messmer said. Still, the death rates at Pease are so high that the 2021 results revealed statistically elevated levels of prostate, breast and lung cancers. \u201cSometimes, as much as they try not to show it, they can\u2019t bend things that much and they have to admit there\u2019s a problem,\u201d Messmer said. A mortality study also does not prove the water at the base is behind the elevated cancer levels. Proof requires a cancer incidence study. Funding for an incidence study was included in the version of last year\u2019s defense bill that passed the House, but it was stripped from the final Senate bill. Advocates said they were told by their congressional delegation that the military did not want the study, so it was left out. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you how angry I was when I heard that it was cut,\u201d Brock said. Gen Pogorek said the New Hampshire air guard supports a cancer incidence study and \u201ccan\u2019t speak for why it was dropped\u201d. Hope also came and went when Congress passed in August the Honoring our Pact Act, which significantly expanded benefits for veterans exposed to toxins, but still excluded most at Pease. The group is now exploring how to chart a new path forward. Separately, Doris Brock continues pushing for a bill to scrap the active duty requirements for career national guard members, and the issue is now being studied. Though both prongs of her David-and-Goliath battle face uncertain futures after years of twisting the military\u2019s arm, Brock remains steadfast. \u201cI\u2019m not going away,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2023-02-10T22:04:57Z",
            "content": "A US fighter jet has shot down an unidentified high-altitude object over Alaska that was the size of a small car but the nature, purpose or origin of the object remains unclear. US officials said the targeted aircraft brought down on Friday was considerably smaller than the Chinese balloon downed last Saturday over the Atlantic, and carefully avoided characterising it as a balloon, drone or plane, giving nothing away about the description of the object other than its rough size, its altitude and its direction of travel. John Kirby, the spokesman for the national security council, said the pilot of the F-22 Raptor fighter which fired the missile that brought down the object judged it to be unmanned. A salvage effort is under way off the Alaskan coast near the Canadian border to recover debris from the object, involving the navy, coast guard and FBI. \u201cThe president ordered the military to down the object,\u201d Kirby said. Unlike with the balloon which was shot down on Saturday following an eight-day trip across North America, the origins of this aircraft could not be estimated, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who owns this object,\u201d Kirby said. The Pentagon spokesman, Brig Gen Pat Ryder, told reporters that the object had been travelling at an altitude of 40,000ft (12,190 meters), which is about the same altitude as jet airliners, so \u2013 unlike the Chinese balloon \u2013 it was quickly seen as a threat to civilian air traffic. Alaskan airspace was temporarily closed. Ryder said the object was first spotted on Thursday, and US warplanes were launched to intercept and examine it. It was shot down at 1.45pm Washington time on Friday by an AIM-9X Sidewinder heat-seeking missile fired from an F-22 fighter which took off from Elmendorf airbase near Anchorage. \u201cThe object was about the size of a small car so not similar in size or shape to the high-altitude surveillance balloon that was taken down off the coast of South Carolina on February 4,\u201d Ryder told reporters. ABC News quoted a US official as describing the object as \u201ccylindrical and silver-ish gray\u201d and giving the appearance of floating. Asked if it was \u201cballoon-like\u201d, the official said: \u201cAll I say is that it wasn\u2019t \u2018flying\u2019 with any sort of propulsion, so if that is \u2018balloon-like\u2019 well \u2013 we just don\u2019t have enough at this point.\u201d Meanwhile, Ryder said the marine salvage effort off the South Carolina coast for the Chinese balloon had made progress. \u201cWhile I won\u2019t go into specifics due to classification reasons, I can say that we have located a significant amount of debris so far that will prove helpful to our further understanding of this balloon and its surveillance capabilities,\u201d he said. China has insisted that the downed balloon was for meteorological purposes and has denounced the US decision to shoot it down as an excessive use of force. The US insists that it was a surveillance balloon, and that an inspection of its payload by a U2 spy plane while it was still in the air, showed antennae and other equipment for intercepting and geolocating communications in the US. Late on Friday, the US Department of Commerce announced that it had blacklisted six Chinese companies for supporting Beijing\u2019s military modernization efforts, particularly relating to aerospace programs. Companies added to the entity list are restricted from accessing US items and technologies without government authorization. China\u2019s use of high-altitude balloons \u201cviolates our sovereignty and threatens US national security\u201d, said Alan Estevez, the undersecretary of commerce for industry and security. \u201cToday\u2019s action makes clear that entities that seek to harm US national security and sovereignty will be cut off from accessing US technologies.\u201d \u2022 The image on this article was amended on 11 February 2023. An earlier version showed an F-35 fighter jet, rather than an F-22."

            "date": "2023-02-22T23:52:52Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden on Wednesday night condemned as a \u201cbig mistake\u201d Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to suspend his country\u2019s participation in the last remaining US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty. The comment came as the US president closed out his wartime visit to Europe, working to shore up partnerships with allies on Nato\u2019s perilous eastern flank \u2013 even as Putin was drawing closer to China for help as his invasion of Ukraine neared the year mark. Biden\u2019s meeting with leaders of the Bucharest Nine nations in Warsaw came at the conclusion of a whirlwind, four-day visit to Ukraine and Poland meant to reassure allies that US support in fending off Russia is not at risk of waning. In dramatic counterpoint, Putin on Wednesday played host in Moscow to Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist party\u2019s most senior foreign policy official, as US intelligence warned that Beijing is considering supplying arms and ammunition to the worn-down Russian military. The flexing of alliances was a fresh indication that both sides are digging in for prolonged conflict in Ukraine with the fighting expected to intensify with the arrival of spring. Biden had delivered a ringing speech on western unity in Warsaw, a day after he swept into Kyiv unannounced for a visit with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. As Biden spoke in Poland, Putin announced that Russia was suspending its participation in the last remaining US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty. Biden has now called that departure \u201ca big mistake\u201d. The exit is expected to have an immediate impact on US awareness of Russian nuclear activities. However, the pact \u2013 known as New Start \u2013 was already on life support following Moscow\u2019s cancellation late last year of talks that had been intended to salvage an agreement that each side has accused the other of violating. \u201cYou\u2019re the frontlines of our collective defense,\u201d Biden told the Bucharest Nine, which comprises Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. \u201cAnd you know, better than anyone, what\u2019s at stake in this conflict. Not just for Ukraine, but for the freedom of democracies throughout Europe and around the world,\u201d he added. These countries have worried that Putin could move to take military action against them next if he\u2019s successful in Ukraine. Biden responded to that anxiety by pledging that Nato\u2019s mutual defense pact is \u201csacred\u201d and that \u201cwe will defend literally every inch of Nato\u201d. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the meeting, pointed to past Russian conduct in Georgia and Ukraine and said: \u201cWe cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security. We must break the cycle of Russian aggression.\u201d"

            "content": "The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has said he will need to go to Tehran very soon to restore his inspectorate\u2019s ability to monitor Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Rafael Grossi also said that Iran should not have carried out recent unilateral changes at the Fordow nuclear plant, which will require increased inspections. The modifications, discovered by the IAEA and reported to the board of governors last month, involved an undeclared change to the interconnection between two machines enriching advanced uranium. Speaking at Chatham House in London, he said: \u201cThere has been a modification that should have been reported. You cannot go back and right this wrong. The thing is that, of course, with this modification, the facility has new capabilities so we have to inspect more.\u201d His remarks suggest Grossi was not convinced by the Iranian explanation that the changes at the plant had been due to a human error and had been corrected. But he insisted he wanted a reset with Iran. He said recent denials of access for his inspectors by the Iranians meant \u201cit will be very difficult to restore a complete picture of what we have in the Islamic Republic in terms of nuclear infrastructure\u201d. Admitting he did not know if the 2015 nuclear deal with western powers could ever be revived, he said \u201c[Iranian authorities] gradually started to shut down the visibility of the agency on a number of things, which are very, very important. That is the gap that worries me at this point in time. Because we are losing this visibility, and the [nuclear] programme continues to work \u2013 this is why I need to go to Tehran. We need to talk and we need to do it soon.\u201d Grossi has previously visited Tehran in a bid to restore his inspection team\u2019s ever-diminishing access to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, but often returned with only slight modifications. There is also an ongoing standoff between the IAEA and Iran over the regime\u2019s inability to explain the presence of nuclear particles at three previously undeclared sites. Rossi rejected Iranian claims he was seeking to politicise the issue, arguing instead that he was \u201cconstantly opening doors and constantly looking for another solution\u201d. Without this indispensable dialogue, things will get worse, he warned. \u201cOur ability to do what we are supposed to do is so crucial, without that \u2013 without the IEA being able to tell the world that the nuclear programme in Iran is completely for peaceful use \u2013 then there will be this instability.\u201d There is a tension within western capitals, with some politicians wanting to abandon the talks and take a hard line with a regime they feel is slowly losing grip on power, while others believe that the risk of losing any nuclear non-proliferation agreement with Iran would be too destabilising."

            "date": "2023-02-27T23:36:54Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson is dangling the threat of a rebellion over Rishi Sunak after a new post-Brexit deal was announced that will rip up the former prime minister\u2019s protocol on Northern Ireland and ditch his legislation to override it. Although most Conservative MPs warmly welcomed the breakthrough after two years of negotiations, Johnson stayed away from the House of Commons chamber and is said not to have made up his mind about whether to endorse or oppose the \u201cWindsor framework\u201d. A source close to him said he was studying and reflecting on the government\u2019s proposals. They did not deny that Johnson had urged the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), who hardline Tory Brexiters on the European Research Group have said they are in \u201clockstep\u201d with, to think carefully before passing judgment on the deal. The source said they would not comment on private discussions, after PoliticsHome reported that he urged the DUP to be cautious amid suggestions it was prepared to endorse the agreement. While no Tory MPs have yet openly criticised the deal, the veteran Brexiter Bill Cash warned Sunak he would scrutinise the text closely before deciding what to do. \u201cThe devil, as ever, lies in the detail,\u201d he said. Mark Francois, chair of the ERG, also said he hoped \u201cwe won\u2019t find any nasty surprises which would materially undermine the position of Northern Ireland\u201d. The ERG is expected to hold a full meeting for members on Tuesday night to decide how to respond to the Windsor framework, with a \u201cstar chamber\u201d of lawyers assembled to scrutinise the plans for a veto for Stormont on new EU laws in Northern Ireland. Sunak vowed that MPs would get a vote on his deal \u201cat the appropriate time\u201d, and added the result \u201cwill be respected\u201d. Several members of the ERG privately said they were broadly supportive of Sunak\u2019s deal. \u201cProvided the details live up to the press conference, fundamentally, I think this sounds like something they should be able to live with,\u201d said one. Another said they believed only 10 or so \u201cheadbangers\u201d were \u201cprepared to let the perfect be the enemy of the good\u201d. Some of the old Brexit \u201cSpartans\u201d who helped bring down Theresa May over her deal in 2019 are now part of the government, including Steve Baker. He welcomed the deal and said other pragmatists should too. However, the former culture secretary Nadine Dorries hit out at Baker for \u201cgushing about the deal\u201d, claiming he was a \u201ckey agitator\u201d who helped to remove Johnson from Downing Street last July. She said: \u201cWhat shred of credibility he has left would be destroyed if he came out against Sunak. He has nowhere else to go other than to grin and support.\u201d Johnson has urged Sunak not to drop his protocol bill, which drew a legal challenge from the EU. But the prime minister is facing pressure to do so from senior European leaders, including from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, with whom he is expected to meet to discuss measures to tackle people being smuggled across the Channel in small boats. Any rebellion may end up being small, Tory strategists believe. Hardline Brexiters, including the UK\u2019s former negotiator David Frost and ex-business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, have so far refrained from making critical interventions about the state of the deal from reports over the past week. Rees-Mogg told ITV\u2019s Peston on Monday evening that the prime minister had achieved \u201cmore than I thought was possible\u201d with the deal. He insisted, however, that Johnson\u2019s original agreement was not at fault, as he said that the protocol always contained \u201cthe means for its own amendment\u201d. But even a dozen Conservative MPs opposing the deal could trigger bigger problems for Sunak further down the line. Anand Menon, the director of the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said: \u201cThe danger for the prime minister is that opposition might be cumulative. A few rebels on the protocol, a few more on the budget \u2013 this could all build into a real headache should the May local elections go badly.\u201d"

            "content": "Officers have been forced to step in and stop the \u201creal threat\u201d of teenagers plotting US-style attacks on schools, the head of counter-terrorism policing has revealed. Matt Jukes said there are growing numbers of reports of children fixated on coverage of mass shootings, with more young men \u2013 and boys as young as 13 \u2013 coming to police attention as potential terrorist threats of all kinds. He also said police had made several \u201cclose calls\u201d by foiling terror plots at the last minute in 2022. These \u201cgoal-line saves\u201d were made when would-be attackers had already picked targets and were gathering weapons. Speaking at a Scotland Yard briefing on Thursday, Jukes said: \u201cWe have absolutely seen cases in which we have intervened with young people to prevent them going on, potentially, to carry out attacks in their schools. \u201cHow confident are we at each point that those attacks will materialise? Well, how fine a judgment do you want to make on those points? But it is not a notional threat. It is a real threat which we have seen in individual cases and, absolutely, intervened and dealt with individual cases.\u201d He added police hadstopped \u201ceight late-stage terror plots\u201d in the last year. \u201cAnd the reality is that a number of those were close calls, I would describe several of them as goal-line saves,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are cases in which a subject had identified their target, had or was acquiring their weapon and where we have intervened to stop that attack taking place.\u201d Jukes said the number of reports from people with concerns about the potential of a young person to go on and commit an attack at school was numbered in the \u201chundreds, not thousands\u201d. But he said the upwards trend in reports was still a concern. \u201cI think that has been driven by the visibility of attacks in the US. We know that\u2019s the case. It is the glorification of those events which have taken place, which goes to some of the other points about other cultures \u2013 whether that\u2019s incel or otherwise. And it makes it really toxic mix.\u201d He told reporters a concerning online culture had grown online in recent years. \u201cThat is exhibited in a prevalence of misogyny, racism, antisemitism, homophobia. And, clearly, all of that gets mixed in with terrorist ideologies. We\u2019re seeing a relatively small number, but increasing number, of references to incel culture, and to school massacres.\u201d Incel, a portmanteau of the term involuntarily celibate, ideology is part of a misogynistic subculture \u2013 mainly among young men \u2013 that has become of increasing concern to counter-terrorism officers. It has been linked to violent attacks in the UK and elsewhere in recent years. The domestic threat comes amid a huge increase in Scotland Yard\u2019s work countering threats from hostile foreign powers, as well as in other areas, counter-terror officers said. Jukes said the number of investigations into hostile state threats had \u201cquadrupled\u201d in the last two years, describing it as \u201cunprecedented\u201d and saying it marked a \u201creally significant shift\u201d in focus for teams primarily working on terror investigations. \u201cMissions outside of terrorism\u201d now account for around 20% of casework after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, to tackle state threats, espionage and investigate war crimes, he said. He added: \u201cWe are shifting, in part, our focus from an exclusive attention to the terrorist threat to a really significant shift in focus on the threat from foreign states. For counter-terrorism policing, that means, at present, that around 20% of our casework is focused on missions outside terrorism. That means countering state threats, investigating war crimes and working with MI5 and other partners to address espionage.\u201d The number of investigations focused on state threats has \u201cquadrupled in recent years\u201d, he said, though he stressed that this referred to \u201cdozens\u201d of cases over the last two years, not \u201chundreds\u201d. But he stressed how \u201cscores\u201d of officers could be working on hostile state threats because of the \u201cintensity\u201d of the investigations, adding that the nature of the cases was \u201cpalpably different\u201d from terror investigations. Last year, the boss of MI5 laid bare the \u201cvery real threat\u201d posted by hostile states and set out in stark language the dangers from Russia, China and Iran. The security agency\u2019s director general, Ken McCallum, revealed in a speech in November that there had been at least 10 potential plots since January last year by Iranian intelligence services to kidnap or kill British or \u201cUK-based\u201d people considered \u201cenemies of the regime\u201d. Jukes said that number now stands at 15."

The faulty repairs on the cooling pipes aboard HMS Vanguard were found after one of the bolts fell off during an inspection, the Sun reported. The bolt heads originally came off due to over-tightening. But, rather than replacing the damaged shafts, staff at the defence contractor Babcock implemented a quick fix and glued them back on. Engineers at the contractor reported it as a procedural glitch after the problem was found, but did not mention the botched nature of the repair. A navy source told the newspaper: \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. You can\u2019t cut corners with nuclear. Standards are standards. Nuclear standards are never compromised.\u201d The glued bolts held insulation in place on the coolant pipes in the nuclear reactor and were found just as workers were set to fire it up to full power for the first time, the newspaper reported. Investigators will trawl records of repairs to find out when the bodged work occurred and who was ultimately responsible. The Ministry of Defence spokesperson said that a \u201cdefect\u201d was found on HMS Vanguard when in dry dock and that it was \u201cpromptly reported and fixed\u201d. The spokesperson said the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, met the chief executive of Babcock, David Lockwood, \u201cto seek assurances about future work\u201d. Babcock is the MoD\u2019s second-largest contractor and has multibillion pound contracts to maintain the navy\u2019s Astute and Vanguard sub fleets. A spokesperson for the company said: \u201cAny quality-related issue is a huge disappointment, but our own robust inspection processes discovered the issue. There was no safety or operational impact from the work.\u201d The Guardian reported in December last year of safety fears as the submarines had been deployed at sea for record-breaking periods of five months each. Rob Forsyth, who helped command Polaris nuclear submarines in the 1970s, said the lengthy patrol times could lead to \u201cboredom, complacency and an inevitable drop-off in standards\u201d. HMS Vanguard is one of four nuclear submarines that form part of the UK\u2019s continuous at sea deterrent. The vessels are always out on patrol and are poised to strike in the unlikely event that Britain is hit with a nuclear attack. An MoD spokesperson said: \u201cAs part of a planned inspection, a defect was found from work done in the past when HMS Vanguard was in dry dock. It was promptly reported and fixed.\u201d"

            "content": "Job vacancies in the UK have reached a near-record level, due largely to the shortage of nurses, carers and other healthcare staff. According to analysis by the Office for National Statistics, more than one in 10 job vacancies posted online in December were in healthcare \u2013 more than in any other sector. The statistics agency said healthcare was the job category with the highest share of adverts in almost 90% of local authorities in the UK. Rishi Sunak\u2019s government faces increased pressure over its refusal to offer a bigger pay rise to NHS workers. The prospect of continuing strike action in the increasingly bitter dispute over pay and staff shortages. According to the ONS, there were almost 1.5m estimated open job adverts as a daily average during December. Using data from the jobs search engine Textkernel, it said healthcare accounted for almost 190,000, or 12.7% of all vacancies. Healthcare also accounted for the two occupations with the largest number of job adverts nationwide, with 31,870 adverts for support workers and 21,170 for nurses. The second largest share of job vacancies in December was in information and communication technology professions, driven by recruitment adverts for software engineers, with almost 16,000. IT jobs contributed to the largest share of vacancies in about 8% of local authorities, and were concentrated in London. Meanwhile, production and warehouse management jobs held the biggest share in almost 2% of local authorities, with the greatest demand within the \u201cgolden logistics triangle\u201d in the Midlands including in Daventry, Harborough, north Warwickshire, north-west Leicestershire and Tamworth, and Thurrock in Essex. London dominated the share of adverts in arts, culture and media and communication, marketing and public relations, representing more than a third of all jobs advertised in these professions across the UK. The government has expressed concern about the near-record number of vacancies in the UK after a surge in workforce shortages since the end of Covid lockdowns. However, ministers have typically focused their attention on the private sector. The near-record figures on vacancies coincide with annual pay growth in the private sector climbing at twice the rate of that in the public sector, stoking concerns about widespread staff shortages across the NHS, social care, education and policing. Official data shows that job vacancies across the economy have fallen back in recent months to just under 1.2m. However, they remain much higher than before the pandemic. The ONS said the increased share of healthcare adverts was part of a longer-term trend in demand. The sector\u2019s share of online job adverts has been increasing consistently since 2017 even when factoring out the rise in relative demand for healthcare workers during the height of the pandemic. It comes as business groups warn that labour shortages are holding back economic growth, after an exodus from the UK workforce since the onset of the Covid pandemic and as tougher post-Brexit rules make recruiting EU workers harder."

She is still waiting for the DVA to approve a number of conditions for inclusion on her white card. It is a process she began in 2021. But earlier in February, her GP clinic wrote to her to say they no longer accept the card, so she will never get a chance to benefit from it. \u201cDVA is unable to compel any particular GP or allied health clinics to accept the white card if they don\u2019t wish to, as this is essentially a business decision that each practice must make based on their own circumstances,\u201d Blacker said. \u201cThis may lead to instances where veterans may indeed struggle to access convenient, local, DVA-funded care for their accepted conditions.\u201d Blacker said she does not want to change GPs because she and her family have been attending the same practice for many years, and she is happy with the care the clinic provides for her complex conditions. But she is paying out-of-pocket costs. She said between the long process of applying to the DVA to have conditions covered by the white card, and the difficulty in finding clinics that accept the card, many veterans are struggling. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly a year since discharge, and two years since I first started the application processes through an RSL advocate,\u201d Blacker said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for me to be inconvenienced but there are many who have and would find this hugely challenging. I know it\u2019s not the intent of this system to be cruel, but it\u2019s just so good at it. Surely there has got to be a better way.\u201d A former senior manager in the department of health and policy analyst Charles Maskell-Knight challenged claims from GPs that they are losing money from accepting the veteran white card. \u201cGiven the veterans benefit is 15% higher than the benefit for concessional cardholders, and 35% higher than an ordinary punter being bulk-billed, it is hard to see why GPs would stop charging vets under the DVA arrangements \u2013 other than to make a political point,\u201d he said. GPs have been arguing they can no longer afford to bulk-bill patients because the rebate they receive does not meet the costs of providing healthcare. However, this claim has been challenged by some, including thinktank the Grattan Institute, which found that even bulk-billing GPs have \u201csteady profit margins\u201d. The retired army major Stuart McCarthy, who served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa, and is now an advocate for veterans, said: \u201cIf you only have one GP clinic in your town because you live rurally or regionally, and they no longer accept the white card, what are you going to do?\u201d Not getting timely and affordable medical care is exacerbating the chronic health issues of veterans and is causing mental distress, he said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re under financial stress, you have family struggles, you\u2019re in pain, you can\u2019t get work, and you\u2019re unable to claim your health conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that creates suicide risk as well.\u201d Guardian Australia contacted the office of the minister for veterans affairs, Matt Keogh, for comment, and was referred to an interview with Radio 6PR on 17 February. Keogh said while he had heard GPs were no longer accepting the card, \u201cit\u2019s definitely not all GPs\u201d. \u201cAnd what I say to veterans is, if you\u2019re having trouble finding a GP or a specialist that will accept the white card, contact DVA. We will connect you to a GP or medical specialist that is able to help you under your white card. We\u2019ve seen a decline in doctors\u2019 bulk billing, and this is really the same problem manifest in the veterans\u2019 community now as well.\u201d Do you know more?

            "title": "Australia needs targeted mental healthcare to prevent further international student deaths by suicide, research finds",
            "date": "2023-02-05T23:00:33Z",
            "content": "International student deaths by suicide will continue if gaps in delivering targeted mental healthcare aren\u2019t addressed, research suggests. The research, published by the University of Melbourne and Orygen in January, followed a 2021 Victorian coroner\u2019s report that found 47 international student suicides had occurred in the state in the decade to 2019. The report was commissioned after the 21-year-old Vietnamese student Nguyen Pham Dinh Le killed himself in 2018, showing no sign of mental ill health or consulting a GP before his death. Samuel McKay, a lead author in the research, said evidence-based programs catering to international student suicide prevention still didn\u2019t exist despite record numbers of students returning this year. \u201cWe went to see what universities were doing and there was nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cNo evidence-based programs available. We were really surprised. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a huge push for students to get back and that\u2019ll put massive pressure on housing and finances. There\u2019s a real compounding perfect storm of factors right now that could increase the risks.\u201d McKay said international students already faced a number stressors that could impact mental health \u2013 \u201cliving in another country, losing support networks, financial pressure, housing and accommodation\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cInternational students are also much less likely to access support services despite facing significant educational, cultural, and daily life stress,\u201d he said. McKay said culturally adapted services, improved risk screening and collaborative mental health services providing culturally sensitive care were needed to address the gap. An Orygen report released in 2020 found despite experiencing an increased risk for poor mental health, international students underutilised available support services. \u201cServices aren\u2019t adapted to international students,\u201d McKay said. \u201cWhen they walk in they might not find it\u2019s a safe space or comfortable to them. Or they may not engage, because it doesn\u2019t feel appropriate for them. \u201cWe need to look at how we can make these spaces welcoming.\u201d McKay said while universities had counselling and mental health programs in place, access was also a barrier due to long waiting lists, while emergency departments lacked cultural training. \u201cA peer work program where we train international students in mental health would be a first step in a pathway to support,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the coroner looked at the data in Victoria, they found international students were less likely to engage with mental health services before they died by suicide and more likely to face financial stressors and academic pressure. \u201cThis is a real time of opportunity for developing programs that engage students in mental health supports, give them opportunity to understand what\u2019s available and that it\u2019s OK to reach out \u2026 to break down negative stereotypes and normalise it.\u201d Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia, said international students often feared reaching out due to concerns they would lose their visa or face judgment or prohibitive costs. \u201cIt\u2019s an important issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need them to know it\u2019s not regarded as a blight on your character or reported to authorities. \u201cOften services might be on campus but students think if they access an on-campus service it\u2019ll be reported back to academics and administrators \u2026 This has to be overcome.\u201d Honeywood said urgent attention needed to be given in the educational community to addressing targeted mental health care for international students \u2013 particularly after the burden of Covid lockdowns. \u201cMental health issues dramatically increased for the domestic student population and this would also impact access for international students when they\u2019re returning in increasing numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf an immediate response to this can be established through training peer group mentors then this would be welcome, however in the medium to long term we need to increase the number of fully qualified intercultural mental health councillors. \u201cCompared to other student destination countries, Australia is a relative latecomer to comprehensive mental health counselling service provision \u2026 We need more of our education providers to see counselling as core business.\u201d \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "title": "Veterans are being forced to pay for healthcare that should be free as GPs opt out ",
            "date": "2023-02-27T14:00:02Z",
            "content": "Roughly 90% of Dr Kerry Summerscales\u2019 patients are veterans, with some of them travelling to her clinic in Mackay, on Queensland\u2019s east coast, from as far away as Victoria in their desperation to find a GP who will provide quality, subsidised care. Summerscales is one of the diminishing number of GPs accepting veteran white cards, which entitles the holder to treatment for injuries and conditions the department of veterans affairs (DVA) accepts were incurred during service. As Guardian Australia revealed on Monday, veterans have been receiving letters from their GP saying they no longer accept the white card because the DVA rebates are not high enough to cover the cost of providing often complex health services. Some clinics are also no longer accepting the gold card, which entitles a veteran or their dependant, widow or widower to DVA rebates for all clinically necessary health care needs and conditions, whether they are related to war service or not. An army veteran of 30 years service, Summerscales feels compelled to accept the cards because she knows better than most the complexity of health needs veterans face. They often require long consults and experience physical and mental health conditions. She says she receives $30 more from non-veteran patients who pay a private fee than she does from the department for treating a veteran. \u201cEach gold or white card patient I see leads to my practice losing money, which is a big issue for the business,\u201d Summerscales says. \u201cAs a veteran myself, I suppose my chosen charity has become veterans\u2019 health. \u201cI understand the system, whereas many GPs are taught nothing about veterans and their culture. Even GPs that do accept the white card often don\u2019t understand the basics of what it was like to be in Timor or Afghanistan, and so then there is a risk red flags get missed or that veterans have to explain and repeat their trauma. \u201cOne veteran told me they were a RAAF airfield firefighter and told me where they served. I said: \u2018Where were you on the 12th of June, 1996?\u2019. And he just said: \u2018Yep\u2019.\u201d That was enough information for Summerscales to know he was involved in the 1996 Blackhawk accident, when two Australian Army Blackhawk helicopters collided in the Townsville Field training area, resulting in 18 deaths. \u201cI have patients who have come from Melbourne, from Townsville, and who have traveled up from Brisbane to see me,\u201d she says. \u201cI still essentially lose our practice money for every single veteran patient. \u201cI\u2019m not going to complain about my income. I\u2019m not reduced to eating 2-minute noodles each night, and I think it\u2019s really rude for a doctor to claim their income is too low. But when a high proportion of a clinic\u2019s patients are veterans, and those patients require longer, complex consults, you can see why some clinics are no longer accepting the cards.\u201d She is concerned that if veterans are privately billed, or bulk billed through Medicare if they can find a bulk-billing doctor, data on veteran health conditions normally collected by the DVA through white and gold card claims will be lost. \u201cThere are nearly 600,000 veterans in Australia, and at least one person in their families, whether a spouse or a child, would be impacted by their service. So that\u2019s 1.2 million people,\u201d Summerscales says. \u201cYet in our GP training, we never learn anything about veteran culture. They don\u2019t lose that culture once they take their uniform off. If you had a group of veterans and you yelled \u2018grenade\u2019, I bet you they would all drop to the floor.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Clive Buckingham, a gold card holder and a Vietnam veteran, recently went to his GP of three years in Bundaberg, Queensland, for numerous concerns including shingles, swelling of his ankles and numbness in his toes and leg. The GP told Buckingham that all of these symptoms were just a result of medication, and to come back in one year if the symptoms persisted. \u201cMy concern was that the symptoms were also possible diabetes or kidney issues,\u201d Buckingham says. \u201cI asked for a blood test to allay my concerns, this was refused. I then asked for a PSA [prostate-specific antigen] test as I had prostate cancer that was treated by radiation and my last test was three years ago. He said it was not needed.\u201d Buckingham then told his GP that he had a gold card, thinking this would cover all of his health costs and prompt the GP to provide the health care Buckingham was asking for. \u201cHis reply was \u2018I charge more than the gold card rebate\u2019. I was told they no longer accept a gold card and I was charged $80. \u201cI now have to try to find another doctor who will accept my card. I\u2019m only on a pension and cannot afford to have my further concerns addressed.\u201d Another veteran and gold card holder, who did not wish to be named, told Guardian Australia: \u201cWhile living in Tasmania for the last 16 years it was impossible to find a GP who accepted my gold card and now, having just moved to regional Victoria, I can\u2019t find a GP who will accept it here either.\u201d When Guardian Australia approached the office for the minister for veterans affairs, Matt Keogh, for comment, a spokesperson for the minister sent a link to an interview with the minister on radio 6PR. Keogh said during the interview that; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a decline in doctors\u2019 bulk billing, and this is really the same problem manifest in the veterans\u2019 community now as well\u201d. Keogh said veterans having trouble finding a GP or a specialist that will accept the white card should contact the department. When Buckingham contacted the department, he was told to find another doctor and seek a partial refund from Medicare. \u201cThe department will not refund me,\u201d he said. Lisa Cena*, a veteran who lives in Brisbane, was seeing a psychologist for PTSD \u2013 a DVA-accepted condition covered by her white card \u2013 arising from her army service. \u201cThe psychologist provided 10 Medicare sessions a year, as per the Medicare limit, but I paid about $130 out of pocket per session for those and would then need to wait about seven months after our 10 fortnightly sessions to access treatment again. \u201cShe was unable to provide DVA-funded treatment in the intervening months as she\u2019d have been operating at a loss. I\u2019d have been prepared to fund the out-of-pocket as I did with Medicare, but DVA won\u2019t permit this so we couldn\u2019t proceed.\u201d Cena gave up psychological treatment. \u201cI still see a psychiatrist funded by DVA at about triple the cost of a psychologist, but I\u2019m not getting the gains I had with my psychologist,\u201d she says. \u201cDVA will say that there\u2019s free counselling available to veterans through Open Arms, and I\u2019m one of the many ex-serving members who received an official apology from the Department of Defence for my experiences of institutional abuse. \u201cAfter several attempts on my part to access therapy through Open Arms, the Brisbane contact for Open Arms advised me that they do not have the necessary expertise to deal with this sort of complex trauma.\u201d Guardian Australia has contacted the RSL for comment. Summerscales says she fears the inability to receive adequate medical care will drive up suicide rates. \u201cEspecially if they were medically discharged from service, they often already feel unworthy,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce again, they\u2019re being told: \u2018You\u2019re not worthy.

            "date": "2023-02-25T19:48:03Z",
            "content": "The US Drug Enforcement Administration has proposed rules that would again require patients to visit doctors in-person to obtain prescriptions for certain medications that are frequently abused. The announcement seeks to reverse policy changes made during the Covid-19 pandemic which allowed doctors to prescribe controlled drugs such as Adderall and OxyContin through virtual tele-health appointments. On Friday, the DEA said that patients would be required to physically visit a doctor at least once in order to get a prescription on drugs that have been categorized as schedule II substances by the government. Those substances, which the government says have a \u201chigh potential for abuse\u201d, include Adderall, OxyContin, Vicodin and Ritalin. The proposed rules are on track to affect thousands of Americans who have relied on tele-health services throughout the pandemic in order to more easily access their medications. But they do not affect tele-health appointments which do not require doctors to prescribe controlled medications. They also do not affect consultations by doctors who have previously conducted an in-person medical examination of a patient. \u201cThe DEA is committed to ensuring that all Americans can access needed medications,\u201d agency administrator Anne Milgram said in a statement. She added: \u201cThe permanent expansion of telemedicine flexibilities would continue greater access to care for patients across the country, while ensuring the safety of patients. The DEA is committed to the expansion of telemedicine with guardrails that prevent the online overprescribing of controlled medications that can cause harm.\u201d The proposed rules would also allow doctors to prescribe a 30-day supply of buprenorphine through tele-health appointments to treat opioid use disorder. \u201cMedication for opioid use disorder helps those who are fighting to overcome substance use disorder by helping people achieve and sustain recovery, and also prevent drug poisonings,\u201d Milgram said. She added: \u201cThe telemedicine regulations would continue to expand access to buprenorphine for patients with opioid use disorder.\u201d The DEA plans to implement the proposed rules prior to the expiration of the federal Covid-19 public health emergency declaration on 11 May. Despite the convenience of tele-health services, some critics argue that their expansion has allowed for certain companies to take advantage of the flexibility and in turn prescribe unnecessary medications. \u201cBoth sides of this tension have really good points,\u201d a drug historian at the University of Buffalo, David Herzberg, told the Associated Press. \u201cYou don\u2019t want barriers in the way of getting people prescriptions they need. But anytime you remove those barriers it\u2019s also an opportunity for profit seekers to exploit the lax rules and sell the medicines to people who may not need them.\u201d Additionally, the DEA\u2019s announcement comes amid a still raging opioid overdose crisis across the country which has in recent years been fueled by illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. And it arrives as patients have reported problems filling nearly every type of ADHD medication prescription for reasons that haven\u2019t been clear."

            "date": "2023-02-26T17:46:46Z",
            "content": "The virus that drove the Covid-19 pandemic most likely emerged from a laboratory leak but not as part of a weapons program, according to an updated and classified 2021 US energy department study provided to the White House and senior American lawmakers, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The department\u2019s finding \u2013 a departure from previous studies on how the virus emerged \u2013 came in an update to a document from the office of national intelligence director, Avril Haines, the WSJ reported. It follows a finding reportedly issued with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d by the FBI that the virus spread after leaking out of a Chinese laboratory. The conclusion from the energy department \u2013 which oversees a network of 17 US laboratories, including areas of advanced biology \u2013 would be significant despite the fact that, as the report said, the agency made its updated judgment with \u201clow confidence\u201d. Conflicting hypotheses on the origins of Covid-19 have centered either on an unidentified animal transmitting the virus to humans or its accidental leak from a Chinese research laboratory in Wuhan. The spread of Covid-19, just one in a line of infectious coronoviruses to emerge, caught global health bodies unawares in early 2020. It has since caused close to 7m deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, and disrupted trade as well as travel. Former US president Donald Trump politicized the issue, calling it the \u201cChina virus\u201d, triggering a racialization of a pandemic that his Democratic successor Joe Biden has sought to avoid. But political polarization remains under the surface of efforts to establish its origins. The energy department\u2019s updated findings run counter to reports by four other US intelligence agencies that concluded the epidemic started as the result of natural transmission from an infected animal. Two agencies remain undecided. US officials, the Journal said, also declined to expand on new intelligence or analysis that led the energy department to change its position. They also noted that the energy department and FBI arrived at the same conclusion for different reasons. The CIA remains undecided between leak and natural transmission theories, according to the National Intelligence Council study. But while the initial 2021 report did not reach a conclusion, it did offer a consensus view that Covid-19 was not part of a Chinese biological weapons program. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, acknowledged on Sunday that there are a \u201cvariety of views\u201d within US intelligence agencies on the issue. \u201cSome elements of the intelligence community have reached conclusions on one side, some on the other, and a number have said they just don\u2019t have enough information to be sure,\u201d Sullivan told CNN. But he said that the Biden administration has \u201cdirected repeatedly every element of our intelligence community to put effort and resources on getting to the bottom of this question\u201d. Sullivan added that Biden had specifically requested that the National Laboratories under the energy department be brought into the assessment. \u201cHe wants to put every tool at use to figure out what happened,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cRight now there is not a definitive answer to emerge from the intelligence community on this question,\u201d he added, referring to eight of 18 agencies \u2013 along with the National Intelligence Council \u2013 that have looked in Covid-19s origins. A previous report by the energy department\u2019s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in May 2020 concluded that a lab-leak theory was plausible. The updated, five-page NIC assessment, the Journal reported, \u201cwas done in light of new intelligence, further study of academic literature and consultation with experts outside government\u201d and comes as Republicans in Congress press for more information. A spokesperson for the energy department wrote in a statement that the agency \u201ccontinues to support the thorough, careful, and objective work of our intelligence professionals in investigating the origins of Covid-19, as the president directed\u201d. Chinese officials have disputed that Covid-19 could have leaked from its labs, among them the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products. According to the initial US 2021 intelligence report, Covid-19 first circulated in Wuhan, China, no later than November 2019, when three researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology \u2013 reportedly involved in coronavirus research \u2013 were sick enough to seek hospital care."

            "content": "The team behind the Covid inquiry has insisted there is no conflict of interest in having a PR firm which worked on Whitehall\u2019s response to the pandemic running a listening exercise with bereaved families. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group reacted with dismay after their concerns were dismissed, saying they were \u201cunbelievably let down\u201d. The firm 23red was behind important government messaging such as hand hygiene communication and the \u201cStay at home\u201d slogan. It has now been subcontracted by the ad agency M&amp;C Saatchi to run part of the Covid inquiry\u2019s listening exercise, which seeks to engage with the bereaved and others. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group have said this represents a conflict of interest, with their counsel Pete Weatherby KC raising the matter with the inquiry\u2019s chair during a preliminary hearing on Tuesday. But the inquiry team insisted the nature of the work 23Red means none would arise. \u201cWe sought legal advice and are satisfied there is no conflict of interest that affects the delivery of the listening exercise. M&amp;C Saatchi and 23red do not have a decision making role with the inquiry, and they have no direct access to the inquiry\u2019s legal team or the wider work of the inquiry,\u201d an inquiry spokesperson said. \u201cAdditionally, M&amp;C Saatchi and 23red will not be carrying out any of the listening or have any access to the experiences shared with the inquiry\u2019s listening exercise. Their role is only to help the inquiry reach those most affected by the pandemic, so that they can share their experiences.\u201d But a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said many of its members would feel \u201cunbelievably let down\u201d by the insistence on hiring the firm. Susie Flintham said: \u201c23red were working with the Cabinet Office throughout the pandemic and their conflict of interest is obvious. They shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near the Covid Inquiry, never mind being responsible for how it reaches those worst affected by Covid-19. \u201cIt is unfathomable that they\u2019ve been tasked with \u2018helping the inquiry reach those most impacted by the pandemic\u2019. The fact is \u2018many of those worst affected\u2019 will question 23red\u2019s motivations and integrity, and won\u2019t feel comfortable engaging with a process they\u2019re involved in. \u201cThe fact that these PR companies have rebranded the listening exercise \u2018every story matters\u2019, suggests they don\u2019t have a clue on how to reach those \u2018most affected\u2019.\u201d She continued: \u201cWhy is the inquiry paying a hefty sum of taxpayers money, during a cost of living crisis, to a company whose involvement will put people off participating in it? It feels self defeating and like a clear waste of resources. \u201cIf the inquiry is serious about listening to those worst affected by the pandemic then it must give them a meaningful voice, which at the very least means allowing them to speak at each day of the hearings.\u201d Concerns were first expressed about firms who had been part of the government\u2019s Covid response also being contracted to work on the inquiry into the same last September."

            "date": "2023-02-07T13:16:33Z",
            "content": "Creating an environment in which individuals and marginalised groups were shamed during the Covid pandemic was a \u201ccynical\u201d tactic to steer attention away from the UK government\u2019s errors, an academic study has concluded. The research by medical humanities scholars at the University of Exeter said people from ethnic minority groups, those with medical conditions such as obesity and health professionals all suffered shame and stigma. They argue that by putting the onus on citizens to use their common sense and encouraging people to report rule-breakers rather than formulating cohesive public health policies the perfect conditions for shame to pervade were created. \u201cThere has been a wilful political decision to create shame or to allow it to spread, as a means of shifting focus away from bad governance,\u201d said Luna Dolezal, an associate professor in philosophy and medical humanities and one of three co-authors of the research. \u201cThe uncomfortable conclusion that we draw is that shame has come to define significant elements of the pandemic, and rather than this emotion being experienced by everyone equally, it\u2019s been directed at some of the most marginalised and vulnerable members of society.\u201d Dolezal said by singling out communities \u2013 and often ones without much power \u2013 a \u201cgovernment-sanctioned blame culture\u201d was created. \u201cThis was at a time when we needed cohesion, not division,\u201d she said. Dolezal added that there was a long tradition of \u201ccurtain-twitching\u201d in England. \u201cThat intensified during the lockdowns.\u201d She said she thought the trend had abated. \u201cBut it could easily be reignited.\u201d The book, Covid-19 and Shame: Political Emotions and Public Health in the UK, is being published by Bloomsbury on 9 February. It maps out how and why shame was experienced in England, from the first tweet to mention the term Covidiot on 26 February 2020 to the online shaming of Columbia Road flower market the following month when \u2013 legally \u2013 people continued to visit. It recalls the first \u201clocal lockdown\u201d in Leicestershire, which led to one resident describing feeling like a \u201cLeicester leper\u201d and in a chapter called \u201cCoughing while Asian\u201d discusses the \u201coutpouring of racist hatred and abuse at individuals assumed to be Chinese\u201d and the myth of a healthy western country \u201cunder siege from foreign diseases\u201d. The book highlights the case of a mother who was \u201cnamed and shamed\u201d on social media for not clapping for carers. \u201cI was mortified,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThe post said \u2026 I showed the street up and if I can\u2019t spend a minute showing my appreciation I don\u2019t deserve to use the NHS.\u201d The phenomenon of care workers being spat at and verbally abused, accused of being \u201ckillers\u201d and \u201ccarriers of death\u201d and nurses being told to hide their ID cards and disguise their uniforms on their way to and from work for fear of attack is studied. Another group that was shamed, according to the researchers, were overweight people, who were depicted as more likely to become seriously ill and thus became \u201ca selfish burden on straining health systems\u201d. The study highlighted one particular campaign that used shame. In January 2021 the UK government launched its \u201cCan you look them in the eyes?\u201d campaign aimed at citizens bending the rules and featuring Covid patients in oxygen masks and casting a \u201cshaming gaze\u201d towards the camera. In a chapter called \u201cGood solid British common sense\u201d the authors argued the UK government\u2019s emphasis on common sense held members of the public accountable for the pandemic in ways that encouraged \u201cdeeply damaging patterns of judgment, shame and surveillance\u201d. Fred Cooper, another of the authors and an expert on shame and loneliness, said: \u201cUnable to provide an intrinsically useful or agreed-upon code for effective public health or good pandemic citizenship, appeals to common sense served a cynical political purpose. They eroded trust in scientific expertise, flattered people who like to think that they have it, and created a shamed group.\u201d The research asserts: \u201cOur uncomfortable conclusion is that shame has played a part in the pandemic which, rather than being detrimental to everyone, has been useful to some at the direct expense of the most marginalised and vulnerable.\u201d The book is based on research gathered through two projects: Scenes of Shame and Stigma in Covid-19, funded by the UKRI Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Shame and Medicine, funded by the Wellcome Trust."

            "date": "2023-02-20T11:17:34Z",
            "content": "I first arrived in the UK from Switzerland in 2019 to work at the High Consequence Emerging Viruses Group at what is now the UK Health Security Agency. At the time, my project was focused on Ebola virus disease survivors. I was excited for a new chapter in the Ebola field. But Covid quickly changed our plans. We applied our skills to develop Covid treatments and new antivirals. I was involved in early research to study the Sars-CoV-2 infection, and test vaccine candidates.The lab moved to the University of Oxford, where we joined a consortium of researchers who were studying how the immune system was responding after people had been vaccinated. The whole time, it was like a race. For the first time \u2013 unlike Ebola \u2013 I had some friends and family members who were infected by the pathogen I was working on. Some of them developed severe disease and were hospitalised. One of them passed away. My mother developed long Covid. It was a nightmare, but at least I felt I was playing a role in this great battle. Then, in June 2022, I woke up and had difficulty walking. I assumed I was tired. I had been vaccinated three times, and I had never tested positive before, even after exposure to Sars-CoV-2. But 36 hours later, the lateral flow test confirmed that this virus I had been working on for two years had finally caught up with me. I spent six awful days with terrible pain in my whole body, and I had difficulty walking from one room to the next. Many of my symptoms dragged out for a long time. I lost taste for three weeks and smell for six. I was tired for many weeks afterward. But even now, more than seven months later, the pain in my legs has never gone away. It feels as if I have the legs of an elderly person. I can only exert a small amount of effort at a time while walking. I know there are people in worse condition than me. I am still able to work, for instance. But every moment, I still remember that I got Covid and I never fully recovered. Currently, 2 million people experience self-reported long Covid symptoms in the UK. Because of the prominence of the condition, there is a huge scientific research interest. There are four main hypotheses about what could be causing the disease. Viral reservoirs, or areas in the body where Sars-CoV-2 is persisting even after the initial infection appears to have cleared. Autoimmunity, meaning the immune system could be dysregulated following Covid and could react against the body\u2019s own components. Latent virus activation, meaning that viruses that lay dormant within the body, like Epstein-Barr, or herpes, may be triggered by Covid. And the possibility that long-term inflammation arising from Covid is causing tissue damage. As a researcher myself, the hypothesis of viral reservoirs looks quite relevant to me. There may be places in the body where the virus itself, or its leftover genetic material or protein molecules, are leading to a persistent stimulation of the immune system and chronic inflammation. It was recently shown in a study that Sars-CoV-2 was able to infect and produce its genes and various structural components in a wide range of tissues in the body, including muscular tissue. Interestingly, a study also reported that circulating spike proteins were detected in 60% of patients with long Covid, up to 12 months after acute infection. However, an association does not necessarily mean it is the cause. Actually, when I read new studies about the topic, I am also trying simply to understand what\u2019s going on in my legs. About three months after my initial infection, I requested a blood test with my GP to exclude other muscle conditions. But everything looked normal. I also met a physiotherapist, but as I did not have any mobility issues, he was not able to help me. To get more insight into my condition, I signed up as a patient in the Wilco research study led by Prof Danny Altmann at Imperial College London, which attempts to understand the immune system issues underlying long Covid. I also joined a study led by a team in Luxembourg, developing a phone application to improve symptom tracking and follow-up. And I joined an association of patients, and am in touch with some long Covid communities on social media. I\u2019m starting a new position as an assistant professor in France very soon. My work topic will be mucosal vaccination \u2013 delivering vaccines to places, such as the inside of the nose and mouth, where pathogens actually enter the body \u2013 and one axis of my research will be focused on Covid-19. If we develop vaccine strategies to improve long-term respiratory immunity, it may help to reduce the infection rate, and, ultimately, the long Covid rate, too. Current vaccines are highly efficient at reducing disease severity, but less effective against simply getting infected. My plan is also to develop a project about long Covid and to see if mucosal immunity is different between people who fully recovered following Covid, and people who did not fully recover. In every country we need long-term resources and funding to pursue this type of research. I do not know if I will see any improvement in my condition. Or what will happen if I get another infection. I am still very cautious, and my N95 mask is still my best friend. I work in the field, and I suffer from long Covid, so I have to be involved in this battle. Although it is difficult, every day my long Covid symptoms give me strength to pursue research, to better understand and treat the condition. Stephanie Longet is a postdoctoral researcher in immunology at the University of Oxford, and an expert in infectious diseases and vaccination"

            "date": "2023-02-15T09:17:08Z",
            "content": "Small presses across the UK and Ireland have had a \u201cyear of exceptional sales and profit growth in the face of Brexit and escalating running costs\u201d, according to the British book awards\u2019 chair of judges. Independent presses have also told the Guardian they are optimistic about the future, a very different picture from just three years ago, when research found that more than half of the UK\u2019s small publishers feared they could be out of business by autumn 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to the cancellation of author events, delays in titles being released and poor bookshop sales. These smaller publishers are \u201cshowing that even in a toughened climate, grassroots book making is alive and well\u201d, said Philip Jones, chair of judges for the British book awards, which on Wednesday announced the regional and country finalists for the Small press of the year award, which celebrates those presses delivering diverse, innovative and risk-taking publishing. Recent challenges for independent presses have included increases in the costs of heating, printing and distribution, but Jones said those in the running for Small press of the year had \u201cresponded magnificently\u201d whether \u201cstaking their claim to the mainstream or mining their niche\u201d. \u201cThese publishers are reaping the rewards from dedicated and often inspirational publishing, hands-on author care and community building,\u201d he added. A total 48 small presses are listed across different regions and countries for the Small press of the year award. The presses will compete to win their region first, before contending for the overall prize. Kevin Duffy, founder of Bluemoose Books, which is a finalist in the North England region, says the landscape for small presses is \u201ctough, every week is a battle\u201d, and among the biggest challenges was getting books into retailers. But he says he remains positive, particularly about working with independent booksellers. \u201cIndependent bookshops are telling us that readers are saying they\u2019re not finding anything different, and independent bookshops are pointing to smaller independent publishers,\u201d he adds. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons why independent presses are being shortlisted and winning literary prizes, because we are taking risks the bigger publishers aren\u2019t.\u201d Penny Thomas, publisher at Firefly Press, shortlisted in the Wales category, also says the landscape is tough, and that the cost of living crisis and inflation \u201cmeans sales have to grow fast for indie publishers to survive\u201d. The increase in printing costs and the \u201cpressure to give high discounts to compete with larger publishers is a real squeeze\u201d, she continues. \u201cSmall presses, including those based outside of London, do definitely publish big books, but with relatively diminutive marketing budgets we are always fighting to be seen in the trade and to get those books out to readers,\u201d she adds. A number of 2022\u2019s prize-nominated books came from publishers in the running for the small press award, including the Booker prize-longlisted After Sappho, published by Galley Beggar Press, which is in the East England category, and Goshawk Summer by James Aldred, which won the Wainwright prize for nature writing and is published by London finalist Elliott &amp; Thompson. Bluemoose is the publisher of Leonard and Hungry Paul by R\u00f3n\u00e1n Hession, which was chosen as Dublin\u2019s book of the year for 2021, while The Blue Book of Nebo by Manon Steffan Ros, published by Firefly Press, is longlisted for this year\u2019s Yoto Carnegie medal for children\u2019s writing. Both Duffy and Thomas say awards and working with independent bookshops, which often handsell titles, are a key way for small presses to thrive. Thomas says while things are looking \u201cvery good\u201d for Firefly Press, \u201cwe are realistic enough to know that we have to stay at the very top of our game and publish outstanding books\u201d. \u201cMargins are incredibly tight for small presses, and salaries far from generous,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut we are determined to keep publishing excellent books children will enjoy reading.\u201d The overall Small press of the year winner will be announced at the British book awards, run by the Bookseller magazine, on 15 May, and will also compete in the Independent publisher of the year category at the awards."

            "content": "Zoom is cutting about 1,300 jobs as demand for the company\u2019s video-conferencing services slows with the waning of the pandemic. While announcing the layoffs on Tuesday, which will hit nearly 15% of its workforce, the chief executive officer, Eric Yuan, said he would take a pay cut of 98% for the coming fiscal year and forgo his bonus. \u201cWe worked tirelessly \u2026 but we also made mistakes. We didn\u2019t take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities,\u201d Yuan said. Zoom will incur about $50m to $68m in charges related to the layoffs, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. The company said a substantial part of it will be spent in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company, which became a household name during lockdowns due to the popularity of its video-conferencing tools, has seen its revenue growth slow, and profits are estimated to have fallen 38% in 2022. \u201cI would say incrementally, maybe this is telling us we shouldn\u2019t expect reacceleration in the near term on the revenue side, but we could see additional upside to margins for a company that is already profitable,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria said. Zoom had bumped up hiring during the pandemic to meet surging demand, but now joins US companies in reining in costs to brace for a potential recession. The announcement is the latest in a raft of layoffs that have hit the tech sector, from Amazon to Meta to Google. Companies have laid off thousands this year to ride out a downturn in demand wrought by high inflation and rising interest rates. The video-conferencing software maker also said that its executive leadership team will reduce their base salary by 20% in the same period. Departing employees will receive 16 weeks of salary, healthcare coverage and a bonus for the year, Yuan said."

            "content": "It\u2019s just over two years since the first Pfizer Covid jabs reached Britons\u2019 arms, with the goal of quickly preventing deaths and halting further strain on the NHS. Now, the US pharmaceutical giant hopes once again to play a part in protecting the health service, at a time when staff are striking, waiting lists in England stand at more than 7 million, and the organisation is at breaking point. Pfizer\u2019s president in the UK, Susan Rienow, is lobbying to switch the focus towards early-stage illness to prevent people being hospitalised. \u201cWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity coming out of the pandemic to try to break the cycle of ill health that holds back the economy, the NHS and the health of the population. The key to that is prevention,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough hospital beds for all the patients who need them.\u201d Rienow hopes Pfizer can help move the system from one \u201cprioritised on end-stage disease and significant ill health to a place where we\u2019re actually preventing people from getting sick\u201d. To this end, she is attempting to tackle \u201cthe silent pandemic\u201d: antimicrobial resistance . For years, scientists have bemoaned public apathy about bacteria and fungi that develop an ability to defeat drugs designed to kill them. The World Health Organization estimated that 1.27 million people died due to this resistance in 2019, and this figure is expected to hit 10 million by 2050. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a situation where you don\u2019t have working antibiotics, you almost go back to sort of a medieval dark ages,\u201d says Rienow. The American executive, a Pfizer lifer with two decades at the company under her belt, has made the resistance threat a priority since taking charge last February. We meet at the firm\u2019s UK headquarters in Surrey, a complex designed to look like a hand from the air. The \u201cpalm\u201d is a spacious grassed area where rabbits appear and the occasional deer has been known to leap the fence. Mist covers the tranquil scene \u2013 it\u2019s hard to believe this company was at the centre of the global Covid fightback and all its associated controversies. There\u2019s no sign of white lab coats (the firm\u2019s scientists are in Kent) and the offices are sparsely populated, with endless rows of empty desks a reminder of the pandemic\u2019s remote-working legacy. Pre-Covid, Pfizer\u2019s public profile in the UK largely extended to its landmark erectile dysfunction pill, Viagra, and a failed \u00a369bn tilt at buying AstraZeneca in 2014. Fast forward six years, and both companies were racing to develop a Covid vaccine \u2013 Pfizer teaming with BioNTech and choosing not to take US government support, but to make a profit. Astra, meanwhile, partnered with Oxford University and pledged to simply cover its costs during the crisis. To date, Pfizer has shipped 4.4bn vaccine doses to 181 countries. The firm invested $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) in research and development before regulatory approval, so without a guaranteed return. But it has since raked in $75bn in vaccine sales (and $18.9bn from its Covid pill Paxlovid), triggering accusations of profiteering. Its stock has risen more than 60% since March 2020, to value it at $248bn. Is Rienow comfortable that Pfizer didn\u2019t profiteer from a horrific global crisis? \u201cVery comfortable. The scale of [our] intervention has never been seen before. It was $2bn when you don\u2019t know if you have any revenues at all.\u201d She says executives had a \u201cmoral clarity around the importance of what we were trying to do\u201d. The firm remains in the crosshairs: last month its chief executive, Albert Bourla, was interrogated as he walked through snow in Davos over Pfizer\u2019s vaccine venture. Then, recently, users making false claims that Covid-19 vaccines caused spasms went viral on social media with the tagline \u201cthanks Pfizer\u201d. Are the anti-vaxxers frustrating? \u201cIt is important that if people have questions about the vaccine that they aren\u2019t dismissed. They should speak to their doctor or look for credible sources \u2026 and not just take what they see on social media at face value,\u201d Rienow says. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried very hard during the pandemic to be as transparent as possible.\u201d Rienow, whose father was a heart surgeon, was born one of seven siblings in North Carolina and moved around the US before starting her career consulting in Boston for companies including Pfizer.

She first led Pfizer\u2019s critical care division, and then took on its vaccines business just before the pandemic. She is guarded at times, declining to answer questions on whether the NHS should offer an annual Covid booster programme, on perceptions of big pharma, or on how much she is paid. (Her boss, Bourla, received $24m in 2021, a 15% bump). A senior pharma industry executive describes her as \u201cthoughtful, pragmatic and authoritative\u201d. Her plan to get to grips with antimicrobial resistance includes a new funding method agreed with government which sees Pfizer paid an annual subscription for antibiotics rather than by volume used in the health service. This will encourage research and development of new drugs and reduce the incentive to overuse some existing ones. \u201cIt de-links volume from revenue and thinks about the value of the antibiotics in terms of what it does for society and reducing resistance,\u201d she says. During his leadership campaign last summer, Rishi Sunak set out a vision of the UK as a life sciences superpower. More recently, Kate Bingham, the former chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, and GlaxoSmithKline chief Emma Walmsley have raised concerns about Britain\u2019s ability to remain a force in research and big pharma. Rienow shares their concerns, noting that the UK is falling down industry league tables for manufacturing and research investment, while clinical trials are taking longer than expected. She advocates a return to pandemic tactics, when regulatory hurdles for new treatments were cleared faster through parallel approval processes. But overall, she is hopeful. \u201cThe idea of positioning the UK globally as a life sciences superpower is something that we\u2019re quite excited about\u201d.

            "content": "Nicole Stevens doesn\u2019t know how much further she can stretch her grocery budget. Stevens, 40, based in Battle Creek, Michigan, is a single mother raising two teenage boys. She relies heavily on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), more commonly known as food stamps, to feed her family. Before the pandemic, Stevens recalls being able to spend just $300 on her family\u2019s big monthly supermarket haul. This always meant that she had a little bit of money left over to make additional trips to the store whenever staples like milk and bread inevitably ran out. Today, the same monthly shopping trip costs her $500. Stevens often racks her brain trying to understand what is driving the increase. The frozen dinners her kids love now cost $12 a pack, which she considers expensive for a single meal. A box of cereal goes for $6 these days, more costly than she has ever seen. And eggs are so pricey at the moment that Stevens half-joked about investing in a backyard hen. But food prices aren\u2019t her only concern. In March, Snap benefits are going to fall significantly, forcing Stevens and millions of other poor families across the country into potentially dire situations, including buying less food and skipping meals. Late last year, Congress voted to end a pandemic-era boost to food stamps, which had been giving families extra money every month to help them weather financial uncertainties. Before the public health crisis, Snap benefits were calculated based on income, so those earning more got less in food stamps. However, thanks to the boost \u2013 officially known as emergency allotments \u2013 all families automatically received the highest level of Snap benefits available for their household size. Those already receiving the maximum saw a bump of $95. For example, a family of three with a net monthly income of $1,000 would have received approximately $440 in Snap benefits each month before the pandemic. With the help of emergency allotments, that same family could instead get $740 in Snap each month, the maximum benefit available for the household size. Meanwhile, a family of three with no income would have received $740 a month before the pandemic. With emergency allotments, that benefit rose to $835 monthly. For Stevens, this policy translated to an additional $121 in food stamps each month. That money is now going away at the end of February. \u201cThis is horrible timing,\u201d she said. \u201cThings at the grocery store are so much more expensive than I remember them being, and they\u2019re gonna cut back our food stamps again? Well, we\u2019re going to have to start eating a little less.\u201d She sighed, and mulled over how to tell her youngest that he wouldn\u2019t be able to eat two bowls of cereal every morning any more. On an individual basis, the end of emergency allotments will mean an average loss of $82 in food stamps per person every month, according to US Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates. Nationwide, the move will pull billions of dollars out of the economy. In February, the last month that emergency allotments will be issued, states are currently projecting that they will distribute at least $2.7bn in these benefits. Anti-hunger advocates warn that the ramifications will affect not only poor people, but also the communities they live in. \u201cThat is money that generates economic activity in our local food systems,\u201d said Christina Wong, public policy and advocacy director for Northwest Harvest, a network of food banks and meal programs in Washington state. \u201cIt\u2019s helping to keep your local grocery store in business. It\u2019s helping to support the farmers who are growing the food that\u2019s being sold at farmer\u2019s markets \u2026 The loss of Snap benefits hurts all of us because it contributes to economic slowdown.\u201d Across the country, food pantries and community groups are urgently spreading word about the impending cuts. The omnibus spending bill that terminated emergency allotments only took effect in late December, giving Snap users little time to learn of the changes and prepare for them. Tianna Gaines-Turner, 43, a mother of four living in Philadelphia, was disappointed to learn about the slashing of emergency allotments \u2013 but hardly surprised. \u201cEverything that helps people in need is on the chopping block,\u201d she said. But it would have been helpful for Snap users to have a longer transition period before the change took effect, so that they could gradually adjust their spending habits and prepare for a benefits cut. Emergency food providers are also bracing for a surge in need in the coming months, one that could further strain their already meager resources. Rising costs mean more people need food assistance, while simultaneously making food assistance more expensive for food pantries to provide, says Jenna Umbriac, director of programs at Manna Food, which distributes grocery packages in Montgomery county, Maryland. The organization gave out 40% more food this January compared with the same month last year, Umbriac estimates. Eggs were once an affordable protein to hand out to families, but the pantry can\u2019t make them available on a regular basis any more. A preview of the financial hardship to come can be seen in over a dozen states, including Florida, Arizona and Tennessee, that have already ended emergency allotments for their residents. (While Snap is a federal program, individual states have wide latitude in how they administer the benefits.) In these states, people face increased levels of food insecurity, according to surveys conducted through Providers, a popular app used by Snap recipients to track their food stamps. Indicators of food insecurity included skipping meals, relying on others for food and visiting food pantries. The end of emergency allotments is expected to hit poor seniors particularly hard. That\u2019s because income from social security payments lowers the amount of food stamps recipients can get. In Kentucky, one retiree saw her Snap benefits fall from $240 a month to just $20 a month when the state ended emergency allotments in May 2022, the Guardian previously reported. \u201cThe ending of Snap emergency allotments will impact millions of people, and USDA is working closely with states and partners to prepare them for this change,\u201d said an agency spokesperson. \u201cIt is important to note that emergency allotments were designed to be temporary.\u201d The end of emergency allotments came as part of a compromise, in which Congress agreed to cut the pandemic-era benefit in order to pay for a separate child nutrition program known as Summer EBT. The new program will provide families with extra grocery money to help cover children\u2019s meals during summer months. Families with children eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches would receive $40 per child each month beginning in 2024. Anti-hunger advocates worried that the promised benefits of Summer EBT would be far outweighed by the immediate harm of the imminent Snap cuts. \u201cThis has a lot of ramifications,\u201d said Ellen Vollinger, Snap director at the Food Research and Action Center, which advocates against poverty and hunger. \u201cWhen Snap benefits are cut, it\u2019s not as if the problem of hunger goes away. People don\u2019t go anywhere. They still exist. But they now have to bear the brunt of figuring out what\u2019s their next so-called coping strategy.\u201d The end of emergency allotments is just the beginning of what will probably be a fraught year for food policy. In Washington DC, Congress is set to take on the renewal of the farm bill, a massive package of legislation with wide-ranging ramifications for both agriculture and nutrition programs, the latter which accounts for a large majority of its outlays. Back in Battle Creek, Michigan, Nicole Stevens isn\u2019t thinking about any of that. She\u2019s just worried about how much harder it\u2019s going to be to support her family when her Snap benefits decrease. \u201cFeeding the poor people in this country should be one of the number one things that [the government] try and do,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed or embarrassed to admit that I am one of the poor people. I just am.\u201d"

            "content": "Plans to prevent one of the deadliest cancers for women in Jamaica have been significantly set back by the Covid pandemic, new figures reveal. The scheme to vaccinate schoolgirls against cervical cancer in Jamaica \u2013 which is the cancer with the second highest death rate in the Americas \u2013 began in 2018, but the Pan American Health Organization says inoculation rates fell to just 2.71% in 2021. This represents a drastic drop from the 2019 rate of 32%, and far from the WHO target of 90% by 2030. The cancer, which is curable if caught early, kills 22 in every 100,000 women in Jamaica. By comparison, in the UK the rate is 2.4 in every 100,000, and in Canada it is 2. In more than 95% of cases, cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), thought to effect nearly all adults, and which can be sexually transmitted. HPV vaccine, approved in 2006, has been shown to prevent up to 70% of cervical cancers. Regular screening is also key. A national HPV vaccination programme for girls under 15 was launched in Jamaica in 2018 only to be disrupted by classroom closures during lockdown, said Sebastian Oliel from the Pan American Health Organization. Even the pre-pandemic performance of the vaccination programme was criticised as ineffective due to \u201cpoor planning, inadequate communication and public distrust\u201d. In 2019, its most successful year, fewer than a third of those eligible were vaccinated, mostly due to lack of parental consent. \u201cThe HPV programme concerns three topics which are controversial in Jamaica: young girls, sexually transmitted infections and vaccines,\u201d said Dr Samantha Johnson, the director of Margins to Centre, a Kingston-based health advocacy group for women. \u201cIn a culture that values pre-marital abstinence, these three things converged to discourage vaccinations. Parents feel that giving children the HPV vaccine is the same as telling them it\u2019s OK to have sex. \u201cPromotion of the HPV vaccine came out almost at the same time as the vaccines were introduced in schools,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was not enough time to inform parents and answer their concerns. If you are trying to promote a new film, you don\u2019t start playing trailers the day it starts screening in theatres.\u201d Prevention of cervical cancer in Jamaica is also hindered by low rates of cervical screenings. HPV screenings are not provided by Jamaica\u2019s health service but women are entitled to regular smears that test for cancerous cells. But, according to the latest Lifestyle and Health Survey from 2017, fewer than half of Jamaican women reported having had a smear test in the previous three years, although 70% did report at least one test in their lifetime. \u201cWomen are afraid of the screening process and potential pain, but there is also a fear of a cancer diagnosis itself,\u201d said Nicola Skyers of Jamaica\u2019s Ministry of Health. \u201cSome people just prefer not to know. But I also think that healthcare providers don\u2019t offer screenings often enough. If a healthcare provider is really \u2018selling\u2019 the pap smear, more often than not the woman will choose to have it.\u201d Health workers are forced to focus on cures rather than preventions amid staffing shortages and an overburdened healthcare system, said Skyers. \u201cAs a doctor, you won\u2019t be encouraging every women you see to do a pap smear if you have 40 patients waiting outside.\u201d Johnson hopes HPV vaccination rates will rise. \u201cI know that nurses are already going back to school to deliver vaccines,\u201d she said, adding that a robust public health campaign was needed. \u201cThe campaigns have to be inclusive, not only of parents but also children. Sometimes you find that the child is the one to convince the parent to give them the vaccine.\u201d"

Atagi particularly recommended that everyone aged 65 years and over, as well as younger adults who have medical comorbidities, disability or complex health needs have a 2023 booster dose, the minister said. An additional booster will not be provided for under 18s, except when they have health conditions that would put them at risk, given the low incidence of severe illness and high level of hybrid immunity among this group. The number of reported cases has continued to fall from a peak of 16,000 a week in December, the highest rate recorded since August, to a rolling seven-day average of 2,600 cases. There was an increase in deaths recorded in aged care centres last month caused by the leap in cases earlier in the summer. But there has seemingly been dwindling demand for boosters, with Australia discarding almost 20% of its national Covid vaccine supply in September."

            "content": "Dozens of families in Spain\u2019s Basque Country have taken legal action after a nurse was accused of faking the administration of routine child vaccinations. Local authorities opened an investigation last autumn after parents began publicly voicing concerns about the nurse\u2019s attempts to discourage them from getting their children vaccinated during visits to a health centre in Santurtzi, about nine miles from Bilbao. Parents also raised concerns about the way she appeared to inject the vaccines. The controversy burst into public view this week when 42 families launched a legal challenge that accuses the nurse, who has not been named, of falsifying documents and the misuse of public funds. \u201cAll of these families have been vaccinated \u2013 or not \u2013 by this nurse,\u201d said Aitzol Asla, the lawyer representing the families. \u201cSome noticed that she was administering the vaccines in an odd way; she would jab it in very quickly and then it appeared as though she would throw the whole vial into the rubbish bin.\u201d The nurse had been tasked with immunising children for infections such as meningitis and hepatitis B at a local healthcare centre. After complaints from families in September, healthcare officials carried out antibody tests on about 50 children vaccinated in the centre, dividing them into two groups based on which nurse saw them. \u201cIt was found that most of those belonging to one of the groups analysed were not properly immunised,\u201d the regional health authority said in November. The authority added that the affected children would be properly vaccinated and that testing would be expanded to a further 400 children believed to have been treated by the nurse. It said it would open an inquiry into the nurse, who is reportedly on leave. The health authority did not respond to a request for comment. In the months since, health officials have provided little information to the affected families, Asla said. \u201cThese parents are worried about what could have happened to their children. For example, [if] there was an outbreak of meningitis at a school and parents were sending their kids, thinking they were vaccinated,\u201d he said. \u201cLuckily nothing has happened to date.\u201d The situation has struck a nerve across Spain, where vaccine acceptance rates are among the highest in Europe. A survey in 2022 of more than 25,000 people across the EU found 89% of those surveyed in Spain agreed vaccines were important, while 92% agreed they were effective. The families behind the legal challenge are to appear in court early next month, Asla said.. He described the legal challenge as a first step, launched by parents a \u201cbit desperate\u201d to find out more, towards ensuring this would not happen again. \u201cWe think this is a very serious issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense that a nurse who was against vaccines was engaged to administer vaccines.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-22T19:18:22Z",
            "content": "People from minority ethnic backgrounds no longer have a significantly higher risk of death from Covid-19 than white Britons, for the first time in the pandemic. Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show rates of deaths involving Covid-19 are now substantially lower for all ethnic groups compared with earlier in the pandemic. Experts suggest this could be down to changes in exposure to the virus, vaccination, levels of natural immunity, and the severity of Covid variants. During the first and second wave of the pandemic, between January 2020 and January 2021, minority ethnic groups had a significantly higher Covid-19 mortality rate than white Britons. \u201cIn the first wave and the second wave, the differences in mortality were largely due to social demographic factors. The main reason for the differences was differences in the risk of infection,\u201d said Vah\u00e9 Nafilyan, a senior statistician at the ONS. During the period of successive lockdowns, people from minority ethnic backgrounds were more likely to be exposed to the virus as they were more likely to be key workers or live in multi-generational households. Covid mortality rates were highest for Bangladeshi, Pakistani, black African, and black Caribbean groups, ONS figures show. Deaths from Covid decreased by the third and fourth waves, known as the Alpha and Delta waves, but ethnic disparities remained. \u201cThe Delta wave coincided with the rollout of the vaccination campaign, where the uptake of vaccine was much lower in some groups, such as the black Caribbean and black African groups, compared to the white British group,\u201d Nafilyan said. \u201cOne of our studies found that to a large extent these differences in vaccinations explained the differences in mortality.\u201d Research showed that the Omicron variant caused less severe disease than Delta. \u201cIn addition to that, you\u2019ve got the fact that more and more people have got immunity because they\u2019ve been infected previously. So what hasn\u2019t changed in the Omicron period is the gap in vaccination uptake. It has reduced slightly between groups, but it\u2019s still there,\u201d Nafilyan said. \u201cYou would expect a group that is less vaccinated to have the highest mortality rates, and what we find is it\u2019s not the case. So why is that? We can\u2019t say for sure from the data.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think we can do anything but speculate, but I think it\u2019s good news because the rate of death has gone down substantially.\u201d He said further research was needed to look into the level of immunity in different groups, and see whether groups with lower vaccination levels had higher level of infection Kit Yates, the director of the Centre for Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath, said it was unclear what driving factors were behind the latest figures. \u201cMy best guess would be that there were disparities in terms of exposure levels for different ethnic groups earlier on in the pandemic, when we were actively trying to control transmission. I suspect that these have now largely dissipated given the unmitigated spread situation in which we have found ourselves for the last year or so.\u201d He said another possibility was that the impact of vaccines was diminishing. \u201cWe know that there are disparities in vaccine uptake by ethnic groups. However, combination of vaccine protection waning and the majority of people now being over a year out from their last vaccine may have levelled that playing field.\u201d Dr Habib Naqvi, chief executive of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, said: \u201cWhilst these are estimated figures that need to be explored further, taken at face value, they indicate how much of an impact COVID-19 has had on Black, Asian and ethnic minority communities. The disproportionate impact with regard to severe illness, hospital admissions and mortality rate among diverse communities has been significant, and has resurfaced the critical importance for tackling the root causes of long-standing ethnic and racial inequalities in health, across our population. These inequalities remain relevant today and must be tackled head-on.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-02T02:56:07Z",
            "content": "Cervical cancer vaccination levels are on the rise and experts are \u201chighly optimistic\u201d the disease can be eliminated in a little more than a decade, despite the pandemic and interference from \u201chighly religious\u201d schools. Australia will become the first country in the world to eliminate cervical cancer if it hits its 2035 target. Prior to the vaccine, it is estimated up to 90% of Australians were infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV) at some point. HPV causes almost all cervical cancers, as well as a range of other cancers. The free school vaccination program, which began in 2007, has reduced the HPV infection rate by 92%, which in turn has reduced the rate of cervical abnormalities. The executive director of the Australian Centre for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer, Prof Marion Saville, said the latest statistics \u2013 up to and including 2020 when the first Covid lockdowns began \u2013 show \u201ccoverage has been stable and slowly rising\u201d. \u201cDespite the pandemic, we\u2019re seeing pretty good coverage,\u201d she said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Asked if pandemic-related vaccine misinformation had affected those rates, Prof Karen Canfell, the director of the Daffodil Centre, a joint venture between Cancer Council NSW and the University of Sydney, said the program has always had to deal with vaccine hesitancy but that the rates of coverage have continued to increase over time. This week, a Four Corners episode aired claims that the Opus Dei-affiliated Tangara School for Girls discouraged students from getting the vaccination, claiming it would promote promiscuity. Opus Dei is a small, controversial group within the Catholic church. Former students told the ABC hardly any of their classmates received the vaccine. In a statement, Tangara said it \u201cwas attempting to ensure parents were fully informed about the vaccine and its potential risks by sharing medical and other information from the media with them\u201d. It said its advice was now in line with the medical advice. Saville said it wasn\u2019t too late for those who missed out at school. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has now recommended the vaccination be available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for men and women up to 25 years of age. \u201cWe see people who\u2019ve been to Opus Dei schools who weren\u2019t vaccinated \u2026 That may also be true for highly religious schools,\u201d Saville said. \u201cTo people who might have been at Opus Dei and told the vaccine wasn\u2019t for them, they should have a conversation with their practitioner. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the minister will approve the PBAC recommendation so they can have a funded vaccination up to the age of 25.\u201d The health minister, Mark Butler, is now considering the advice, which also includes a recommendation to reduce the doses needed from two to one. Canfell said the increase in age for funded vaccinations and the reduction in doses were a \u201chuge opportunity for Australia\u201d. She said Australia had led an international process of public health innovations on HPV. \u201cFrom a national screening program to vaccination, then the second generation vaccines, then changing to HPV screening, and now cervical sample self collection,\u201d she said. Saville said Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities had done an \u201camazing job\u201d engaging with the program, with very high first-dose coverage, although the second-dose coverage was somewhat lower. Only needing one dose would help, Saville said, especially if the vaccinations were still offered twice a year at schools to maximise uptake. \u201cWe would like to see maintenance of those two visits to maintain and build on the equity,\u201d she said. While the vaccination is funded up to age 19, it can be prescribed for men up to 26 and women up to 45, if they are willing to pay for it. But while vaccinations at older ages may be beneficial \u2013 especially for those at higher risk of abnormalities \u2013 Saville said \u201cthe older you get the less likely it is to be effective\u201d. In many cases, HPV goes away within a couple of years. Vaccination after that may prevent HPV reinfection, and may reduce but will not eliminate the chance of abnormalities. \u201cAt a certain point our message is that your better protection is screening rather than vaccination,\u201d Saville said. Canfell said it was an exciting time and that Australia was well positioned to meet its target, but that it was important it did so \u201cequitably\u201d and while maintaining communication about lifesaving interventions. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to communicate well that the vaccine is the best intervention for females under the age of 25 and cervical screening is the best intervention for women over 25, and even in that age group it\u2019s important to have HPV screening, even if they\u2019ve been vaccinated,\u201d she said. Cervical cancer will be considered to be eliminated as a public health problem when there is only a four in 100,000 chance of invasive cancer."

            "content": "The way depression manifested itself in mice in the laboratory of the psychiatrist and neuroscientist Eric Nestler was hauntingly relatable. When put in an enclosure with an unknown mouse, they sat in the corner and showed little interest. When presented with the treat of a sugary drink, they hardly seemed to notice. And when put into water, they did not swim \u2013 they just lay there, drifting about. These mice had been exposed to \u201csocial defeat stress\u201d, meaning that older, bigger mice had repeatedly asserted their dominance over them. It is a protocol designed to induce depression in mice, but in Nestler\u2019s lab, it affected some more than others: those with a history of early trauma. \u201cWhat one sees clearly in these mouse and rat models is some that are exposed to early life stress do show greater susceptibility to stress later in life,\u201d says Nestler, who is based at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. This appears to be true for humans, too. The reasons are still unclear, but there is growing evidence that part of the answer lies in epigenetics \u2013 processes that modify the function of our genes without changing the genetic code. Many researchers now think that childhood trauma biologically embeds itself in our bodies, alters how our genes work and puts our mental health at risk. If that thinking holds up, it opens the door to radical new treatments. Just as gene editing is promising new therapies for everything, from heart disease to cancer, there are those who believe tinkering with the epigenome could help us reverse the damage done by trauma \u2013 essentially giving us a way to physically edit out the scars of the past. * * * Although sometimes a difficult childhood can make people more resilient, \u201cearly life trauma is the strongest risk factor for a range of psychiatric conditions, most particularly depression and anxiety\u201d, says Nestler. One of the biggest studies to assert this was a 2010 paper that included data on more than 50,000 adults from across 21 countries. It found that almost all kinds of childhood trauma \u2013 from a parent dying to substance abuse in the family \u2013 were significantly associated with mental illness in adulthood. Remarkably, the analysis suggested that if we somehow got rid of all childhood adversity, we would see a reduction in mental health diagnoses by almost a third. But to understand the biological components of such a link, we need controlled animal experiments. It is in these that researchers have seen how early life adversity leads to epigenetic modifications. Such modifications are most easily thought of as \u201ctags\u201d directly on or surrounding our DNA. In different ways, they regulate how easily specific genes are read and whether or not the proteins that the genes code for are produced, a process called gene expression. \u201cThe metaphor that sometimes people use is [a piece of] music,\u201d says social and psychiatric epidemiologist Erin Dunn of Harvard University. \u201cA composer\u2026 might add certain annotations in order to bring out certain things.\u201d In experiments, researchers can play composers and change gene expression by exposing animals to stress early in life. In one study, for example, Nestler and his colleagues separated mouse pups from their mothers for hours every day and found that, as a result, several hundred genes had altered expression in a brain area associated with depression. It was mice such as these that went on to develop depression at higher rates when put through the social defeat stress protocol. The problem is that there is no way to replicate this in humans. It would be immoral to expose children to trauma and researchers need to remove brain tissue to analyse what epigenetic changes have taken place there. But, says neuroscientist Elisabeth Binder of the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich: \u201cThere is evidence from postmortem brain data that we may see similar things [in humans].\u201d She is referring to a study examining the brains of people who killed themselves. The authors found epigenetic differences on stress-related genes between those who had experienced childhood abuse and individuals who had not. It is good evidence, but in order to find out people\u2019s abuse history, the authors had to ask the bereaved relatives, which may not always be reliable, says Binder. Instead, researchers want to test living people. That means looking for epigenetic marks outside the brain, such as in saliva or blood. While it is still unclear how well they reflect changes in the brain, it is the best scientists have and it does tell a compelling story \u2013 not just of epigenetic scars, but of extreme evolutionary survival strategies. * * * An increasingly popular way to study epigenetic changes in people is through epigenetic clocks. As we grow older, we pick up certain tags that correlate strongly with age and so scientists can quantify our \u2018biological age\u2019 by looking at how many we have. This way, they can determine whether we are biologically ageing quicker or slower. Recently, Binder used the first ever epigenetic clock for children on three- to five-year-olds who had a known history of maltreatment. She found a clear pattern: maltreated children who showed signs of depression and anxiety were biologically nearly three months older than their peers \u2013 a lot for their age. The worse their maltreatment, the older they were. On the back of such research, it is tempting to think that accelerated ageing is exclusively damaging. But the reality is probably more complicated, says psychologist Jennifer Sumner of the University of California, Los Angeles. She differentiates two kinds of trauma: threat and deprivation. \u201cExperiences of threat \u2013 so that\u2019s potential for violence, for physical harm \u2013 those experiences seem to be especially linked to these indicators of accelerated biological ageing,\u201d she says. According to her work, it also coincides with earlier puberty. But in the case of deprivation, such as neglect, teens reach puberty later and their biological age is unaffected. Viewed through a rather grim evolutionary lens, this makes sense. In a threatening environment, growing up faster means that you can reproduce more quickly in case your life is short. But in deprived environments with limited resources, Sumner says: \u201cIt may not be as beneficial to try to develop and reproduce at that time.\u201d So some of the trauma-induced changes may be part of an evolutionary strategy that puts reproductive timing before wellbeing. \u201cThe accelerated ageing can actually increase that reproductive fitness, but it may mean, in the long term, more adverse consequences for physical and mental health,\u201d she says. This seems a rough deal for people looking to live and not just propagate and raises the question: if epigenetic changes can just appear, can we not just reverse them? * * * The short answer is, well, possibly. Scientists can edit the epigenome by using a version of Crispr-Cas9, the innovative gene-editing tool, where the Cas9 enzyme is deactivated so it cannot snip the DNA. \u201cIt\u2019s not like cutting the gene and inserting something,\u201d says Subhash Pandey, a neuroscientist at the University of Illinois Chicago. Instead, it simply finds the right point in the genome and can then remove or add a tag. In a study last year, Pandey used this epigenetic version called Crispr-dCas9 to undo an epigenetic change induced by teenage binge drinking in rats. His previous work connected that particular modification in the amygdala, the brain\u2019s fear centre, to increased anxiety and alcohol use in adults. Rats that had been injected with alcohol in adolescence were significantly more anxious than teetotal fellow rodents. But when Pandey reversed the alcohol-induced change, their anxiety dropped to normal levels. It also worked the other way around; when Pandey introduced the change to rats that did not drink in adolescence, they became anxious in turn. There is a long way to go before epigenetic editing could be used in humans, but Pandey believes \u201cepigenomic editing has high potential for future therapy\u201d. Kinks such as long-term efficacy and safety have to be worked out for any new therapy, he says. However, when it comes to depression and anxiety disorders, which are shaped by a host of different genes, Nestler is more hesitant. \u201cWhat\u2019s causing depression in one person is probably very different from what\u2019s causing depression in another person,\u201d he says. That could make it tricky to find the right tags to reverse. Pandey\u2019s rats also had tubes surgically installed in order for the Crispr (short for \u201cclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u201d) system to reach their amygdala. For most disorders, says Nestler: \u201cWe\u2019re going to need something that is much easier for people.\u201d Instead of Crispr, one option could be a type of tag-removing epigenetic drug. The US Food and Drug Administration has already approved some drugs against certain cancers. Although concerns about side effects remain, Nestler says: \u201cWe\u2019re very interested in their potential in depression as well.\u201d * * * Others think drugs and editing should not overshadow what is most remarkable about epigenetics: its responsiveness to the environment. \u201cThese are marks that are dynamic in response to our life experiences,\u201d says Dunn, whose goal is to prevent depression, not just treat it. \u201cThere are things that can [shift] people\u2019s risk for having health outcomes.\u201d In other words, we should try to mend children\u2019s trauma before they get diagnosed as adults \u2013 not with mental health Crispr, but with social support and therapy. Instead, epigenetics could play a role as a biomarker to flag children at particular risk, she says. Arguably, we do not need epigenetics to tell us that kids with a history of trauma need help. Yet Dunn says: \u201cYou and I could have the exact same experience in terms of adversity, but biologically it impacts us differently.\u201d With limited public budgets, there could be value in separating the truly traumatised from the resilient. She is right that not everyone who goes through trauma is equally affected; that shows up even in Nestler\u2019s mice. The most depression-prone experienced trauma late in childhood, whereas those who were traumatised early \u2013 and perhaps had more time to recover \u2013 showed more resilience. But if we embrace epigenetic drugs and editing, there may be shortcuts to that, too. Nestler recently found a resilience-regulating gene network that can be boosted epigenetically and could offer new drug targets in adults. \u201cMost efforts in the field over decades have been to undo the bad effects of stress,\u201d he says. \u201cOne could also try to institute mechanisms of natural resilience.\u201d Evidently, there will be no shortage of tags to fiddle with. The question remains whether we are willing to lend our brains to it."

            "content": "Moving back into the parental home as an adult was once seen by many youngsters as a retrograde step and even something to be ashamed of. Now, a new study suggests that such a move actually improves the mental health of these \u201cboomerang adults\u201d, thanks in no small part to a stressful and increasingly expensive rental market. The findings of of the first study in the UK to look at the mental health impact of moving home on the adult children surprised demographers at the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER), who were expecting to find it had the opposite effect on wellbeing. Past research has found that parents experience a dip in mental health when their adult children return to live at the family home. But the new study by ISER, part of the University of Essex, found that for their children it was associated with an improvement in mental health scores \u2013 despite losing independence. \u201cWe expected that probably their mental health would get worse if they had to give up their independence and that they might feel that they were falling behind their peer group and going back might seem retrograde,\u201d said professor of population science Emily Grundy, who co-authored the study with Dr Jiawei Wu. \u201cSo we were quite surprised to find that on the contrary their mental health seemed to improve.\u201d While previously moving out of the family home and living independently was seen by many as a mark of adulthood, the research shows how these signifiers are changing. \u201cThe whole process of things that we think are important of transition to adulthood have rather shifted,\u201d said Grundy. As well as rental costs, other factors she points to affecting young adults leaving home include people staying in education longer, getting partners and becoming parents later. Nearly 5 million adults live with their parents, according to the 2021 UK census, a 14.7% increase on 2011. \u2018Boomerang\u2019 Moves and Young Adults\u2019 Mental Well-being in the United Kingdom, published in Advances in Life Course Research, suggests that the so-called \u201cboomerang generation\u201d may find parental support beneficial \u2013 especially if it enables them to escape the stress of the private rental sector. Between 2009 and 2020, it found, 15% of the 9,714 British adults aged between 21 and 35 they studied moved back in with their parents at least once. The more liberal attitudes of parents could also play a role, said Grundy. \u201cAt one time people had to leave home if they wanted to have boyfriends or girlfriends, whereas parents may now be less restrictive about what their children can do.\u201d The potential implications of more adults moving in with their parents include multi-generational mortgages, such as those pioneered in Japan and greater differences between generations. \u201cThey used to say \u2018life begins at 40\u2019 and the idea of that was that your children were independent by then,\u201d said Grundy. \u201cWhereas now, a lot of 40-year-olds have actually got quite young children. \u201cIt also means that the spacing of generations has got much more variable and there may be some people whose children come back and other people who have still got children at nursery, the whole stages of life we maybe need to have a less rigid view about.\u201d But there are huge inequalities, she warned. \u201cWe looked at the people who returned home and changes in their mental health, but there are other people who perhaps can\u2019t return home because their parents haven\u2019t got the resources or space.\u201d Shelter said at least two in five 25-34-year-olds say that rising living costs have increased their fear of becoming homeless and almost half say that worries over rent is making them anxious or depressed. Polly Neate, the housing charity\u2019s chief executive, condemned the \u201cchronic lack of decent affordable social homes\u201d which she said is a \u201csource of anxiety and depression for millions\u201d. But she warned families should not be left to \u201cfill the gap\u201d, which can lead to overcrowding and even exacerbate homelessness. \u201cWhile moving in with your family and exiting the wild west of private renting may improve younger people\u2019s mental health, it\u2019s not a solution to the housing emergency. Not everyone has a family who can take them in, others need to move for work, or they may want to start a family of their own,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving more people under one roof, especially in overcrowded homes, adds extra pressure \u2013 in fact no longer being able to stay with family is a leading cause of homelessness.\u201d Generation Rent said renting in an increasingly unaffordable and competitive private rental market can have a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d on mental health. \u201cSome have developed anxiety, depression or even PTSD from their experiences,\u201d said Tilly Smith, the campaign\u2019s campaigns and partnerships officer. \u201cThe constant threat of an unexpected and unfair eviction notice coming through the mail at any time creates a sense of fear amongst many private tenants.\u201d Case study: I\u2019m sure I prefer my parents to strangers\u2026 luckily they have the space The first time Ella Clarke moved out of her parents\u2019 home was to go to university aged 18. Since then, the 27-year-old has moved back home three times \u2013 first after graduation, then during the pandemic and just over a year ago. In November 2021, after nine months renting in London, she decided she was better off living rent-free with her parents Tim and Louise \u2013 even if she can feel she is reverting back to being a teenager. \u201cNow I\u2019m waiting to earn enough to live by myself. because rent is so high it\u2019s not really worth it,\u201d said Clarke, who has started an upholstery and curtain business. \u201cI\u2019m lucky my parents have the space for me to live and work.\u201d In Colchester, where they live, renting a good quality one-bed flat would cost her around \u00a3750 a month, she said, and a flat share doesn\u2019t appeal. \u201cI\u2019m sure I prefer my parents to strangers.\u201d She does worry about how long it will be until she can afford to move out. \u201cAs much as I\u2019m happy and save money, I would very much like to have my own place.\u201d While she said the rising cost of living has a lot to do with changing generational priorities, there is also a stronger focus on career satisfaction. \u201cA lot of people are sacrificing the traditional things of moving out and having their own house and a nice car in favour of following their passion.\u201d Her parents are happy with the arrangement, she said, but it helps that her older brother lives in Australia and that she is working towards a clear aim. \u201cI\u2019m sure if I\u2019m here in 10 years\u2019 time they might start asking some questions.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-12T11:00:20Z",
            "content": "One Saturday evening, as she was watching TV at home, Barbara heard what she assumed were fireworks going off for a Lunar New Year festival. It was not until the next morning that she learned that the popping had not been celebratory fireworks, but gunshots at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, California, the site of a mass shooting last month that left 11 people dead and nine injured. It was the studio her own parents attended weekly for the past 30 years. After fleeing the Vietnam War and resettling as refugees in the United States, Barbara\u2019s parents, both in their 70s, found joy, comfort and community at Star Dance. Barbara had been to the studio countless times to watch their performances and, occasionally, pick them up late at night when they had \u201cpartied too hard\u201d. The only reason they weren\u2019t there that night was because they were away on a cruise. \u201cMy parents came back the morning after it happened,\u201d said Barbara, 33, who asked that her last name not be used. \u201cI was so shaken, but my parents were nonchalant about it, even though they knew almost all of the victims. I asked if they were sad and my dad said: \u2018We survived a war. This is nothing.\u2019\u201d In the wake of the Monterey Park shooting and another, two days later, on a mushroom farm in Half Moon Bay \u2013 both of which were committed by gunmen of Asian descent, against mostly victims of Asian descent \u2013 many Asian Americans are now working to increase access to mental health care in their own communities. Asian Americans have long faced barriers to care, including language access and cultural stigmas against therapy and other treatments. Overall annual average estimates for the 2008 to 2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health found that of all racial groups surveyed, Asian adults were the least likely to use any mental health service. Kaila S Tang, a psychotherapist and founding team member of the non-profit Asian Mental Health Collective, says that much of that stigma is rooted in trauma. Like Barbara\u2019s parents, many Asian immigrants and refugees survived genocide, war and other hardships before coming to the US. \u201cMany first-generation Asian immigrants have been so focused on survival that there\u2019s no room for anything else, like emotions,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThis survival tactic has protected them, but as a result, they don\u2019t have the tools to cope with the overwhelming emotions. And if you\u2019ve been through something as emotionally challenging as what they\u2019ve experienced, why would you want to revisit that trauma or open that box?\u201d Barbara said that for as long as she\u2019s been alive, her parents have shared almost nothing about their lives in Vietnam. \u201cTheir answers to a lot of my questions are along the lines of \u2018it\u2019s not important; we\u2019re here now.\u2019 They\u2019ve blocked that time out of their memories.\u201d There\u2019s also shame associated with asking for help among Asian immigrants, and a common belief that therapy and counseling are only for people with severe mental illness. According to a 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, Asian American elders receive significantly less emotional support than peers of other races \u2013 one reason being the lack of accommodation for their language needs. Only 15% of Asian Americans aged 65 years and older speak English at home, and 60% have limited English proficiency. Because of these barriers, Asian American organizations have taken a more culturally sensitive approach to the way they provide resources to the community in the wake of the shootings. AAPI Equity Alliance, a coalition of community-based organizations, created in-depth resource guides for Monterey Park community members in seven languages, including English, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Thai, Korean, Spanish and Hindi. The guides contain links to local mental health centers and non-profits, as well as direct language support lines to organizations offering legal assistance, such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice Southern California. Yellow Chair Collective, a psychotherapy private practice group that specializes in serving Asian American clients, is offering six free therapy sessions to those directly affected by the Monterey Park shooting, including victims, survivors and their families in English and Mandarin. The Chinatown Service Center and City of Monterey Park partnered to offer drop-in, multilingual counseling services at the Monterey Park Bruggemeyer library \u2013 a more familiar environment for many of the city\u2019s residents. \u201cWe knew that because of the stigma that counseling services have in the Asian community, people might not be comfortable with going to one of our behavioral health clinics,\u201d said Nina Loc, Chinatown Service Center\u2019s director of behavioral health. \u201cThe library is much more accessible, we\u2019ve created private areas for counseling sessions, and we can match each client with a counselor who meets their specific language needs.\u201d Though Loc said initial turnout was low, they have started to see more clients, including older adults, visit the library over the last several days after being encouraged by their loved ones. \u201cSo much of this work is a collective effort,\u201d Loc said. \u201cWe all have to put in the effort to spread the word and have conversations with the folks who are the hardest to reach.\u201d Tang also believes that it will take time and lots of conversations to change the way the Asian American community addresses mental health, rather than one or two isolated events \u2013 and younger generations can lead those conversations. Tang, whose private practice is based in Atlanta, Georgia, saw an influx of younger Asian Americans seeking therapy after the Atlanta spa shootings in 2021 that left eight dead, six of whom were Asian women. \u201cA lot of Asian cultures are collectivistic \u2013 we\u2019re all about community, and conversation is something we have with our families every day,\u201d Tang said. \u201cWe give recommendations, we gossip, and in that same vein, there can also be moments where we bring up the shootings and ask how they feel about them. The dream is for us to be able to casually have these conversations more regularly.\u201d Though Barbara has struggled with communicating with her parents about the shooting, she is considering seeking therapy for herself to process her emotions first. Then, she said, she will approach her parents again. \u201cSometimes I catch myself thinking that this problem is just too big for me. Like, how do I fight our entire culture\u2019s way of life?\u201d Barbara said. \u201cBut then I remember that I could\u2019ve lost both of my parents in an instant that night. We don\u2019t have time to sit around and hold back, and hide things from each other. This is the generation to break curses.\u201d"

            "content": "Millions of people in England with mental ill-health are not seeking NHS help, and many who get it face long delays and a \u201cpoor experience\u201d, a report says. Long waits for care will persist for years because soaring demand, exacerbated by Covid, will continue to outstrip the ability of severely understaffed mental health services to provide speedy treatment, the National Audit Office (NAO) found. Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog praised NHS England for expanding the amount of care that patients with psychological conditions can access since 2016, as part of a government plan to give mental illness \u201cparity of esteem\u201d alongside physical conditions. It has expanded the workforce, introduced new services, treated growing numbers of people and brought in new waiting time targets. However, despite these moves, the report found that \u201cNHS mental health services are under continued and increasing pressure and many people using services are reporting poor experiences\u201d. Under-18s, the LGBT+ community, minority ethnic groups and people with more complex needs are most likely to find the system inadequate. \u201cWhile funding and the workforce for mental health services have increased and more people have been treated, many people still cannot access services or have lengthy waits for treatment,\u201d the NAO said. It found: An estimated 8 million people with mental health needs are not in contact with NHS services. There are 1.2 million people waiting for help from community-based mental health services. While the mental health workforce grew by 22% between 2016-17 and 2021-22, the NHS recorded a 44% increase in referrals over the same period. In 2021-22, 13% of mental health staff \u2013 17,000 people \u2013 quit. The NHS has met new targets intended to ensure that more people access talking therapy and receive help when they have a first episode of psychosis. However, too many children and young people referred to an eating disorders service are waiting too long for help, the report says. The NHS is meant to ensure that 95% of under-18s with a suspected eating disorder are seen within a week. But in April-June 2022 just 68% did so. An NAO survey of 33 of England\u2019s 54 specialist mental health trusts found that, in response to severe pressure, \u201cmost\u201d trusts had allowed waiting times and lists to increase; 15 had raised the threshold for how ill people had to be before they got care; and six had cut back the services they offered. Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, said failure to treat patients quickly could have damaging lifelong consequences. \u201cI am concerned that children and other vulnerable groups are more likely to have a poor experience of treatment, if they manage to obtain treatment at all,\u201d she said. She urged NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to increase mental health provision in order to help staff who were having to \u201cfirefight on all fronts\u201d. She said: \u201cThe cost to individuals and wider society will be significant if they fail to do so.\u201d Rosena Allin-Khan, the shadow mental health minister, said the NHS\u2019s findings were a \u201csorry indictment of the state of mental health services after 13 years of Conservative governance\u201d. She added: \u201cWaiting lists for mental health treatment are soaring, and health inequalities are growing. The government is haemorrhaging experienced NHS staff in the mental health workforce \u2013 it\u2019s a mess of the government\u2019s own making. Patients are being failed.\u201d The DHSC said: \u201cThis report rightly acknowledges some of the extreme challenges faced by the NHS during the pandemic, and the impacts on patients, services and staff. It also recognises the progress made. Spending and workforce have increased, more patients are being treated, and good progress was made towards meeting targets before the pandemic. \u201cWe are increasing investment in mental health services by over \u00a32bn a year by 2024, and delivering 27,000 more mental health professionals, so 2 million more people will be able to get the mental health support they need.\u201d"

            "content": "Long-term exposure to even comparatively low levels of air pollution could cause depression and anxiety, according to a study exploring the links between air quality and mental ill-health. Tracking the incidence of depression and anxiety in almost 500,000 UK adults over 11 years, researchers found that those living in areas with higher pollution were more likely to suffer episodes, even when air quality was within official limits. Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry, the researchers, from the universities of Oxford and Beijing and Imperial College London, said their findings suggested a need for stricter standards or regulations for air pollution control. The findings come as the ministers face criticism for passing new legally binding air quality guidelines that allow more than double the levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) than equivalent targets set by the World Health Organization. Peers approved legislation this week that allows a maximum annual mean concentration of 12 micrograms per cubic metre by 2028. The WHO completed a review of its 2005 guideline air quality levels in September 2021, halving its limit for PM2.5 to five micrograms. Air pollution has long been implicated in a number of respiratory disorders but, the researchers noted, a growing body of evidence is establishing a link with mental health disorders. So far, however, the only available studies on the risk of depression were carried out in regions with air pollution concentrations exceeding UK air quality limits. The researchers drew on the data of 389,185 participants from the UK Biobank, modelling and giving a score to the air pollution, including PM2.5 and PM10, nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide for the areas in which they lived. They found 13,131 cases of depression and 15,835 of anxiety were identified among their sample within a follow-up period of about 11 years. As air pollution increased, the researchers found, so did cases of depression and anxiety. Exposure-response curves were non-linear, however, with steeper slopes at lower levels and plateauing trends at higher exposure, suggesting that long-term exposure to low levels of pollution were just just as likely to lead to diagnoses as exposure to higher levels. The researchers said they hoped policymakers would take their findings into account. \u201cConsidering that many countries\u2019 air quality standards are still well above the latest World Health Organization global air quality guidelines 2021, stricter standards or regulations for air pollution control should be implemented in the future policy making,\u201d they wrote. Anna Hansell, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the University of Leicester, who was not involved in the research, said the study was yet more evidence to support a lowering of legal limits to air pollution. \u201cThis study provides further evidence on potential impacts of air pollution on the brain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution reported in 2022 on the evidence of associations between air pollution and cognitive decline and dementia. The report concluded that the link was likely to be causal. \u201cHowever, there are few studies to date on air pollution and mental health. This well-conducted new study found associations between air pollution and anxiety and depression in the UK, which experiences lower air pollution than many countries worldwide.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-20T06:30:29Z",
            "content": "Despite a combined economic crisis and drug shortage, Sri Lanka is poised to open its first children\u2019s palliative care centre \u2013 and also hopes to vastly improve the country\u2019s poor survival rates for child cancer. The centre will offer end-of-life care as well as a place to stay for families who have to travel long distances to the country\u2019s only paediatric oncology ward in the capital, Colombo. The new centre is called Suwa Arana (place of healing) and is due to open in June amid a national strategy to more than double Sri Lanka\u2019s survival rates for children with cancer to 60%, as part of a World Health Organization global initiative. Eight-year-old Lochana Lahiru Athauda is one of the children set to benefit from Suwa Arana. He was two when he became one of the 828 Sri Lankan children diagnosed with cancer each year. In the six years since, he has grown used to the 160km (100-mile) return journey from his village in Warakapola, Kegalle district, to Apeksha hospital in Colombo. \u201cThe travel costs are unbearable,\u201d says Lochana\u2019s mother, Enoka Chandani Wijesinghe, who had to quit her job as a computer operator after her son\u2019s diagnosis with acute lymphocytic leukaemia. She tells of the ruinous cost of food and lodging in Colombo: \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting and very expensive for a low-income family like ours. In the three years following Lochana\u2019s diagnosis, we spent all our earnings and sometimes borrowed to ensure his treatment was uninterrupted.\u201d Cancers behave differently in children, and young patients can generally expect better outcomes than adults. However, survival chances are to a large extent determined by where a child lives. While in high-income countries the survival rate for paediatric cancers is 80%, in low- and middle-income countries the rate falls as low as 20%. A lack of data collection means the exact survival rate for Sri Lankan children is not known, but doctors at Apeksha hospital estimate it at 26%. Unlike some low- and middle-income countries, treatment abandonment is low in Sri Lanka, says Sanjeeva Gunasekera, a paediatric oncologist at Apeksha. \u201cThis is due to high literacy levels, family support and a reliable public healthcare system,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople understand that early detection can result in complete cure and that children have a much higher possibility of survival.\u201d The centre is being funded by the Indira Cancer Trust, Sri Lanka\u2019s first such charity, founded in 2016 by former MP Karu Jayasuriya. The trust aims to bridge the gap not only between children living in Colombo and those in rural areas, but between Sri Lankan children and their counterparts in wealthy countries. Suwa Arana is being built close to Apeksha hospital. With 32 ensuite rooms, it will have enough room to house families. \u201cOften, families will travel all together for treatment,\u201d says Joan Hyde, a retired nurse and coordinator of the Suwa Arana project. \u201cThey will be able to come here to recover between treatments and receive food and accommodation free of charge.\u201d Most rooms will only be used for a few days, although some will house children, with their families, during the last months of their lives. Hyde says a child\u2019s cancer diagnosis will often push the whole family into poverty as parents have to leave work to make the regular long-distance trips to the capital and care for the sick child. Gunasekera adds: \u201cParents go through severe hardships and make sacrifices to ensure their children receive uninterrupted treatment. The paediatric ward caters to children but there are no facilities for their parents.\u201d \u201cWhen Suwa Arana is complete, we will be able to stay free of charge and prepare meals for the child as per instructions. This will be a huge burden off poor people like us,\u201d says Thaksila Madhawi, mother of nine-year-old Raini from Veyangoda, who was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2018. Raini\u2019s condition improved after surgery in 2019, and now the family make the 50km journey to Colombo only once every two months. But even so, the visits are increasingly expensive as costs soar in Sri Lanka, where economic turmoil coupled with the pandemic left the country in its worst financial crisis since it regained independence from Britain in 1948. While the economy is slowly stabilising, inflation remains at 54%. Nearly a third of people suffer food insecurity and two in five households spend at least 75% of their income on food. The World Bank projects that a quarter of the population will remain in poverty for many years. \u201cWe can\u2019t even afford the basics for the child let alone meet her nutrition needs,\u201d says Madhawi, who has been relying on food parcels from the Indira Trust to feed her daughter as she recovers. She values the trust\u2019s livelihood support programme which offered her vocational training and a modest allowance. Wijesinghe says that Lochana\u2019s meal costs have doubled and the cost of travel to the hospital quadrupled since the pandemic began. She is not sure how she would have afforded her son\u2019s treatment without support. The financial crisis has also caused a widespread drug deficit. \u201cThere is a shortage of medicines for cancer throughout Sri Lanka,\u201d says Indira Trust chair Dr Lanka Jayasuriya Dissanayake. \u201cThe governmental mechanism for purchasing medicine is disturbed by the lack of dollars \u2013 it is running on donations.\u201d The trust has been working nationwide with 22 hospitals to secure outside donations for cancer medication. \u201cWe procured 500,000 Sri Lankan rupees (\u00a31,140) worth of medicines for one hospital just yesterday,\u201d says Dissanayake. \u201cWe get patients walking daily into our office, asking for medicine. Often, we are able to buy the medication for them.\u201d Even before the crisis, availability of cancer drugs for children was patchy. Between 2019 and 2020, less than half the medication considered essential for treating paediatric cancers was consistently available in Apeksha hospital. Wijesinghe says she has been forced to buy her son\u2019s medication from a pharmacy at an exorbitant price because the hospital was not able to provide \u201ceven simple painkillers\u201d. While the economic crisis postponed the opening of Suwa Arana, the \u00a31.2m project is going ahead thanks to donors from abroad, including the Sri Lanka Medical Association of North America, Tennessee\u2019s St Jude children\u2019s hospital and technical support from the WHO. \u201cNow we just need to pay for the lifts and generators,\u201d says Hyde. The centre will boast a rooftop garden where families can relax, and there will be access to counselling and art therapy. In time, Hyde hopes, they will be able to offer school classes too. \u201cWe want it to be a real place of calm and peace,\u201d she says."

            "title": "Australia\u2019s banks are not a source of economic dynamism but a drag on our economic and social welfare  | John Quiggin",
            "date": "2023-02-15T05:42:38Z",
            "content": "The Commonwealth Bank\u2019s announcement of its $5.15bn profit, with similar announcements expected from the other major banks, is unlikely to be received well in the community. After being told to expect stable interest rates until at least 2024, mortgage borrowers have been hit with a string of increases in the Reserve Bank cash rate, rapidly passed on by the banks. A small reduction in the Commonwealth\u2019s margin between deposit rates and lending rates was not enough to prevent a 9% increase in profits. But is this just griping about a necessary part of our economic and social system? Are the banks, and the financial sector as a whole, making a contribution that justifies their handsome profits and the high salaries paid to executives? The Australian Treasury certainly thinks so. In a 2016 report on the then-booming \u201cfintech\u201d sector, Treasury said it was the largest contributor to the national economy, adding about $140bn to the nation\u2019s GDP over the last year. It has been a major driver of economic growth and considering it employs 450,000 people, it will continue to be a core sector of the economy in the future. Recent failures of Buy Now, Pay Later services have taken some of the sheen off fintech, but there is no sign of a change in the view that the $140bn spent on financial services is good value for money. Retail customers might well disagree. The last really big innovation provided by the banking sector was the introduction of credit cards in the 1970s. Most subsequent innovations (foreign currency loans, honeymoon rates, BNPL) have been little better than confidence tricks, leading people to take on more debt that they can afford, with the true costs hidden from view. Of course, there have been big technological changes resulting from the rise of the internet, but the cost savings from these changes haven\u2019t flowed through to consumers. Bank margins have fallen somewhat over the past 20 years, as can be seen in the Reserve Bank\u2019s own chart. But expressing the margin in percentage point terms obscures the fact that the size of the average mortgage has increased much faster than average wages or prices in general, which determine most of the banks\u2019 operating costs. The margin does include an allowance for bad debts, which would be expected to grow in line with the total amount of debt outstanding. But the banks\u2019 losses from bad debts are tiny in relation to their profit margins and are almost entirely associated with business failures in periods of economic crisis. The rate of foreclosures and mortgage repossessions is tiny \u2013 as low as 0.1% of all loans in most years. But while mortgage and deposit rates are what concern most of us directly, the central claim made in support of our massive financial sector is that, thanks to the deregulation of the 1970s and 1980s, the financial sector has been a major driver of economic growth. According to the claims made in support of deregulation, a dynamic financial sector will increase both the rate of business investment and the efficiency with which investment is allocated. A central implication, which has formed the basis of public policy for the last three decades is that governments should get out of the business of capital investment and ownership. This claim has motivated privatisation, public-private partnership and the perceived urgency of reducing gross public debt. Sadly, there is little evidence to support this claim in Australia, or elsewhere in the world. With the exception of a brief spike in engineering investment during the mining boom, business investment has been declining steadily since the advent of financial deregulation. There is no evidence that the allocation of investment capital has improved. The much-touted \u201cproductivity miracle\u201d of the 1990s disappeared long ago. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, capital productivity has actually fallen, declining by 20% since 1995. It is only the steadily declining price of (almost entirely imported) computing and communications technology that has prevented even poorer economic performance. It is one thing to point out that the financial sector is not contributing as much to the Australian economy as it takes out. Unfortunately, it\u2019s quite another to fix the problems, enmeshed as we are in a dysfunctional global financial economy. At a minimum, though, it\u2019s time to recognise the financial sector as a drag on our economic and social welfare, rather than as a source of economic dynamism and policy guidance. Policies that reduce its size and profitability are more likely to be beneficial than otherwise."

            "date": "2023-02-15T07:00:05Z",
            "content": "Whitehall officials have strategised a series of scenarios about the economic fallout that could follow if China were to invade Taiwan, sources have told the Guardian. Concerns about the major disruption to global supply chains and consequences of any coordinated western response have been examined by civil servants as part of what is said to be routine \u201cforward-scanning\u201d exercises. Foreign Office insiders said there was no change to the scale or urgency of the work, though they conceded Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year had given it renewed prescience. Ahead of an update to the UK\u2019s defence and security strategy, known as the integrated review, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is facing pressure from China hawks in his party to re-classify the country as a \u201cthreat\u201d instead of a \u201csystemic challenge\u201d. On Friday, his predecessor, Liz Truss, is set to give a speech in Japan, which will be viewed as an attempt to push Sunak to take a tougher stance against China amid the clamour over a \u201cspy balloon\u201d shot down in the US, recent incursions against democracy and alleged human rights abuses. The Guardian has learned that Whitehall officials have been sketching out the implications of an invasion of Taiwan by the People\u2019s Liberation Army. Concerns about such a conflict have grown recently, and predictions about when it could take place range as far into the future as 2049. China\u2019s government claims Taiwan as a province and its authoritarian premier, Xi Jinping, is set on what he terms \u201creunification\u201d. A UK government source said officials were looking at \u201cwhat we would do, and what that would mean for our economy\u201d should China launch an invasion that prompted retaliatory economic and trade sanctions by western countries. The response would probably be markedly more complex than the asset seizures and other moves taken against Russia and figures close to president Vladimir Putin. \u201cYou would have to think in a different way than just matching what you did somewhere else,\u201d said a second government source. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the supply chain problems would be greater, but just because it\u2019s complicated that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible.\u201d Of particular concern is disruption to the distribution of microchips, which Taiwan dominates the manufacturing of and which are already in short supply. It was stressed that the invasion of Taiwan was one of a number of scenario plans for \u201cblack swan events\u201d that are regularly rehearsed by the UK government, and that the work was \u201ctheoretical\u201d. Alicia Kearns, a Conservative MP and chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said she welcomed the recognition of \u201cthe seriousness of the threats against Taiwan to global economic security\u201d. She added: \u201cI hope this results in those concerns being reflected in the integrated review and a recognition of the need for urgent deterrence diplomacy.\u201d Though Sunak entered office in November by signalling the end of a \u201cgolden era\u201d of relations with China, he has been notably less hostile towards Xi\u2019s administration than Truss. During last summer\u2019s Tory leadership contest, Sunak said that \u201cChina and the Chinese Communist party represent the largest threat to Britain and the world\u2019s security and prosperity this century\u201d \u2013 language he has since backed away from using. Truss was said to have initiated a revision of the integrated review to reclassify China as a threat. But sources suggest the Sunak administration\u2019s update \u2013 which is being pencilled in for publication on 7 March \u2013 will not go that far. In the latest of a series of interventions designed to rehabilitate her political career after becoming the shortest-serving prime minister, Truss is expected to speak at the Inter Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac) symposium in Tokyo on Friday. She is said to be planning to put pressure on Sunak to take a more hawkish approach to foreign policy, and voice concerns that efforts to counter the threat from China have been too weak. In her Mansion House speech as foreign secretary last April, Truss said \u201cwe must ensure that democracies like Taiwan are able to defend themselves\u201d. She also called for an \u201cassertive approach\u201d to \u201cconstrain our rivals\u201d \u2013 who she branded \u201cpariahs and outliers\u201d for not respecting sovereignty. Relations with Beijing are likely to come under growing scrutiny given the discovery of a \u201cChinese spy balloon\u201d in the US, and the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has launched its own security review of what it called a recent spate of \u201cairspace intrusions\u201d. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise China poses a systemic challenge to our values and interests \u2013 a challenge that grows more acute as it moves towards even greater authoritarianism. \u201cWe have brought in new powers to block any Chinese investments that risk our national security and we are currently updating the integrated review, which will take into account the evolving challenges posed by China.\u201d"

            "title": "Retirement boom among UK\u2019s older workers creates economic headache",
            "date": "2023-02-04T16:00:06Z",
            "content": "\u201cI always laughed at people who said they\u2019d never been so busy since they retired,\u201d says David Richards, mopping his brow as he takes a break from the fast-paced game at Wyre Forest Leisure Centre near Kidderminster. At 58, the retired GP from nearby Bewdley is among the younger players in this midweek morning game of pickleball \u2013 a cross between tennis and badminton that is growing rapidly in popularity across Britain. Players in this packed session for older people range from 55 to more than 80, reflecting a nationwide surge in early retirement since the pandemic. For Richards \u2013 and many others like him \u2013 the tumult of the past few years led him to reconsider his priorities. \u201cThe workload and stress levels just went through the roof in general practice. I struggled.\u201d He now fills his time with pickleball, badminton, yoga, tai chi and rambling. \u201cI was fortunate to be able to take early retirement, and I thought I\u2019d better start looking after myself \u2013 lose a bit of weight, get my blood pressure down.\u201d Since Covid struck, the number of 16- to 64-year-olds officially economically inactive \u2013 neither working nor job-hunting \u2013 has shot up. Driven in large part by retirement, it is a trend that is ringing alarm bells in government amid concerns over worker shortages and looming recession. For many, the inactivity is involuntary. Millions have left the workforce because of long-term health conditions or caring responsibilities \u2013 developments made worse by an underfunded care system and crumbling health service. Others stay out of the workforce from personal choice: many students are delaying the start of their working lives and the number of retired people has boomed to more than 1.1 million. Here in Wyre Forest \u2013 the local authority district encompassing Kidderminster and towns and villages along the banks of the Severn \u2013 the figures are particularly stark. The number of people inactive due to retirement has quadrupled in three years to 5,200 \u2013 almost a tenth of the local working-age population. Compared with the national average of about 3%, it is up there with retirement hotspots such as the Yorkshire Dales and Devon. Barry Walmsley chairs the local University of the Third Age (U3A) group, which puts on the weekly pickleball game and a plethora of other activities for those no longer in work. He says membership has ballooned to 800. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a slightly younger demographic that hasn\u2019t gone back to work after Covid and are looking for things to do. We\u2019re gaining members rapidly.\u201d The feeling among the pickleball group \u2013 led by Michael de Groot, a semi-retired 63-year-old Dutchman, who introduced the game to the area \u2013 is that many have managed to retire thanks to building up decent pensions and paying off their mortgage. The average house price in this pocket of the Midlands is on the low side, at about \u00a3200,000, and this age group may have benefited from generous retirement plans long since watered down for younger workers. \u201cWe\u2019re all baby boomers,\u201d says Sue Corbett, who retired from teaching at in nearby Stourport at 61, and is now in her 70s. \u201cWe paid into a good pension scheme, and I could draw it from 60. I feel grim for younger generations. I\u2019ve got two boys in the same position. My kids aren\u2019t going to get their pensions until they\u2019re 68. They\u2019ll be paying their mortgages off. They\u2019re just in normal jobs \u2013 not high-flying jobs \u2013 paying their way with kids.\u201d Not that boomers are all bad for the economy. For many, their contribution is as part of an economically hidden army of childcare providers for their grandchildren, and as volunteers in the local community. It is not hard to see why Wyre Forest is a popular retirement destination. Birmingham is in striking distance for culture, restaurants and shops, and there are country walks, pubs, and picturesque towns and villages. Ian Miller, chief executive of Wyre Forest district council, says that for many people in the Black Country and Birmingham, Stourport, where caravan parks, a funfair and chip shops line the banks of the Severn, is the closest thing they have to seaside. \u201cA lot of people will have come to the area as kids and then chosen to retire here. Property prices are low in the scheme of things, and there are some low-cost options with the caravan parks.\u201d Yet this is not a place full of affluent silver shirkers. Kidderminster has seen its fair share of economic and social problems since the decline of its carpet industry. More than 20,000 people once worked in the factories that still dominate the town\u2019s streetscape; they now employ barely a handful. Jackie Roberts, who manages the Weavers Wharf shopping centre, has opened a \u201cwarm hub\u201d in a former Shoe Zone store in town, selling baked potatoes and a hot drink for \u00a31, squash for 10p, and slices of cake for 20p to support those struggling to make ends meet. \u201cIt\u2019s a town of two halves. We go from the uber-rich, international pop star status [Robert Plant, the Led Zeppelin frontman, lives nearby], to the bottom 5% of deprivation for the country.\u201d With soaring energy bills and inflation above 10%, early retirement is not possible for everyone. Official figures are showing a reversal of the recent increase, indicating that some people are being drawn back to work. The government is keeping a close eye on the trend. With employers struggling to recruit enough workers nationwide, Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, has launched an urgent review of workforce challenges. The idea is to come up with policies to encourage those who have left the jobs market since Covid to return. Britain is the only country in the developed world with employment still below pre-Covid levels at the start of this year, and these shortages were among headwinds highlighted by the International Monetary Fund in its stark downgrade for UK growth last week. A government spokesperson said older workers were a \u201chuge asset\u201d to the British economy, and that supporting people to start or return to work was one of its \u201cbiggest challenges\u201d. \u201cThis is why we continue to look into workforce participation and drive down economic inactivity at pace.\u201d Between the last two censuses, in 2011 and 2021, the median age in Wyre Forest has increased by three years to 47 \u2013 higher than the national average. Without a university campus, and fewer job opportunities than in the past, younger people have left the area, leaving companies struggling to recruit. Richard Manser is among local business owners finding it tough. The managing director of Five Star Windows, he employs about 100 and is struggling to find people to sell and fit windows, doors and conservatories. It is holding back growth after a boom in lockdown as people turned to home renovations, and with growing interest in energy efficiency during the cost of living crisis. Like many employers, Manser is concerned about a lack of younger workers coming through to replace older staff as they hit retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a laidback retirement area here,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously there are businesses doing well, like us. And it\u2019s good for us that people are choosing to retire here \u2013 they\u2019re a good demographic [to sell to] for us. But it\u2019s also a struggle to find the right people to represent your company and go out and do it.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-06T06:00:14Z",
            "content": "How can inflation be dropping at the same time job creation is soaring? It has taken one of the oldest presidents in American history, who has been in politics for over half a century, to return the nation to an economic paradigm that dominated public life between 1933 and 1980, and is far superior to the one that has dominated it since. Call it democratic capitalism. The Great Crash of 1929 followed by the Great Depression taught the nation a crucial lesson that we forgot after Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency: the so-called \u201cfree market\u201d does not exist. Markets are always and inevitably human creations. They reflect decisions by judges, legislators and government agencies as to how the market should be organized and enforced \u2013 and for whom. The economy that collapsed in 1929 was the consequence of decisions that organized the market for a monied elite, allowing nearly unlimited borrowing, encouraging people to gamble on Wall Street, suppressing labor unions, holding down wages, and permitting the Street to take huge risks with other people\u2019s money. Franklin D Roosevelt and his administration reversed this. They reorganized the market to serve public purposes \u2013 stopping excessive borrowing and Wall Street gambling, encouraging labor unions, establishing social security and creating unemployment insurance, disability insurance and a 40-hour workweek. They used government spending to create more jobs. During the second world war, they controlled prices and put almost every American to work. Democratic and Republican administrations enlarged and extended democratic capitalism. Wall Street was regulated, as were television networks, airlines, railroads and other common carriers. CEO pay was modest. Taxes on the highest earners financed public investments in infrastructure (such as the national highway system) and higher education. America\u2019s postwar industrial policy spurred innovation. The Department of Defense developed satellite communications, container ships and the internet. The National Institutes of Health did trailblazing basic research in biochemistry, DNA and infectious diseases. Public spending rose during economic downturns to encourage hiring. Even Richard Nixon admitted \u201cwe\u2019re all Keynesians\u201d. Antitrust enforcers broke up AT&amp;T and other monopolies. Small businesses were protected from giant chain stores. By the 1960s, a third of all private-sector workers were unionized. Large corporations sought to be responsive to all their stakeholders \u2013 not just shareholders but employees, consumers, the communities where they produced goods and services, and the nation as a whole. Then came a giant U-turn. The Opec oil embargo of the 1970s brought double-digit inflation followed by the Fed chair Paul Volcker\u2019s effort to \u201cbreak the back\u201d of inflation by raising interest rates so high the economy fell into deep recession. All of which prepared the ground for Reagan\u2019s war on democratic capitalism. From 1981, a new bipartisan orthodoxy emerged that the so-called \u201cfree market\u201d functioned well only if the government got out of the way (conveniently forgetting that the market required government). The goal of economic policy thereby shifted from public welfare to economic growth. And the means shifted from public oversight of the market to deregulation, free trade, privatization, \u201ctrickle-down\u201d tax cuts, and deficit-reduction \u2013 all of which helped the monied interests make more money. What happened next? For 40 years, the economy grew but median wages stagnated. Inequalities of income and wealth ballooned. Wall Street reverted to the betting parlor it had been in the 1920s. Finance once again ruled the economy. Spurred by hostile takeovers, corporations began focusing solely on maximizing shareholder returns \u2013 which led them to fight unions, suppress wages, abandon their communities and outsource abroad. Corporations and the super-rich used their increasing wealth to corrupt politics with campaign donations \u2013 buying tax cuts, tax loopholes, government subsidies, bailouts, loan guarantees, non-bid government contracts and government forbearance from antitrust enforcement, allowing them to monopolize markets. Democratic capitalism, organized to serve public purposes, all but disappeared. It was replaced by corporate capitalism, organized to serve the monied interests. Joe Biden is reviving democratic capitalism. From the Obama administration\u2019s mistake of spending too little to pull the economy out of the Great Recession, he learned that the pandemic required substantially greater spending, which would also give working families a cushion against adversity. So he pushed for the giant $1.9tn American Rescue Plan. This was followed by a $550bn initiative to rebuild bridges, roads, public transit, broadband, water and energy systems. And in 2022, the biggest investment in clean energy in American history \u2013 expanding wind and solar power, electric vehicles, carbon capture and sequestration, and hydrogen and small nuclear reactors. This was followed by the largest public investment ever in semiconductors, the building blocks of the next economy. Notably, these initiatives are targeted to companies that employ American workers. Biden has also embarked on altering the balance of power between capital and labor, as did FDR. Biden has put trustbusters at the head of the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the justice department. And he has remade the National Labor Relations Board into a strong advocate of labor unions. Unlike his Democratic predecessors, Biden has not sought to reduce trade barriers. In fact, he has retained several from the Trump administration. But unlike Trump, he has not given a huge tax cut to corporations and the wealthy. It\u2019s also worth noting that in contrast with every president since Reagan, Biden has not filled his White House with former Wall Street executives. Not one of his economic advisers \u2013 not even his treasury secretary \u2013 is from the Street. I don\u2019t want to overstate Biden\u2019s accomplishments. His ambitions for childcare, eldercare, paid family and medical leave were thwarted by Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. And now he has to contend with a Republican House.

            "date": "2023-02-08T14:29:44Z",
            "content": "Turkey\u2019s stock exchange closed this morning for the first time in 24 years to prevent a $35bn (\u00a329bn) selloff this week from turning into a rout. The move followed a panic among foreign investors in the wake of the massive death toll and at least $1bn worth of damage to buildings from the strongest earthquake to hit the country in the past 100 years. \u201cOur stock exchange has decided to halt trading in equities, futures and options markets,\u201d Borsa Istanbul said in a statement after market-wide circuit breakers had halted trading twice. The exchange was unable to say when trading would resume. Investors were disenchanted with Turkey before the earthquake after a series of statements from president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government that it would resist after the economic policies adopted by the big industrialised economies. The controversial leader, who has attempted to increase trade and aid to his country in talks with both Washington and Moscow during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has refused to increase interest rates to tackle runaway inflation. The Turkish lira collapsed after Erdo\u011fan forced the central bank to cut rates to spur growth as the country came out of the Covid-19 pandemic. The injection of cheap money into the economy pushed inflation to record highs. Turkey\u2019s annual inflation rate fell sharply in December, but only to 66.8% from 84% in the previous month before falling again in January to 58%. It was 49% in the same period last year. A Reuters poll found that most City economists believe inflation will still be as high as 43.2% by the end of 2023, double the level predicted by the finance ministry in Ankara. Treasury and finance minister Nureddin Nebati told Bloomberg in an interview before the earthquake that he rejected Wall Street\u2019s prediction of a U-turn by the administration following May\u2019s local elections. He said the \u201cindependent\u201d central bank would keep cutting rates as inflation slows and maintain them at low levels, adding that this was in line with his country\u2019s new economic model. Before the earthquake, Turkey was expected to be forced to seek external funds to finance its growing current account deficit. Government bond prices have plummeted this year, pushing up the cost of borrowing to among the highest in the developing world. The pressure from investors for a rise in interest rates \u2013 which is the price they demand for repatriating their funds back to Istanbul \u2013 is likely to become more intense after the earthquake. Shabbir Ansari, a senior insurance analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cThe preliminary estimate of economic loss due to the current catastrophic event is more than $1bn, and it will take years for Turkish insurers to settle the insured losses. The economic loss is expected to be more than two times the losses from a similar earthquake in 2020.\u201d He said insurers in Turkey were already reeling under the pressure of high inflation that affected their profitability. High inflation rates pushed the average cost of claims for insurers higher. \u201cAs companies are yet to recover from the impact of the 2020 earthquake, the recent earthquake will further impact the profitability of property insurers. As a result, Turkish property insurers are expected to register underwriting losses in 2023 and 2024,\u201d he added. The benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index has lost 16% this week, shedding almost $35bn from share values. Turkish stocks, which are this year\u2019s worst performers globally, entered a technical bear market on Tuesday after falling more than 20% from their January high."

            "date": "2023-02-03T07:52:21Z",
            "content": "The beleaguered empire of the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani is spiralling into crisis, as an escalating stock rout triggered by fraud claims cuts the value of his conglomerate in half. Traders sent shares in the listed flagship Adani Enterprises down more than 25% shortly after markets opened in Mumbai on Friday, despite attempts by the company to restore investor confidence. Other listed entities, such as Adani Green Energy and Adani Ports, were also down sharply. The relentless selling has now wiped more than US$115bn from the value of Adani companies in the two weeks since US-based Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani companies were worth a combined US$220bn before the report was published. The companies, spanning ports, power, coal and renewables, accused Hindenburg in a 413-page rebuttal of engaging in a calculated attack on India, while noting that the US investor, an activist short seller that profits from falling share prices, is making money from the chaos. The plunging share prices raise questions about how Adani, which runs Australia\u2019s contentious Carmichael coalmine and rail project in Queensland, can raise capital when the market has turned so aggressively against it. There is also the prospect of forced asset sales. Reuters reported that Adani entities made scheduled payments on outstanding bonds on Thursday, adding that the conglomerate plans to issue a credit report by the end of the week to address liquidity concerns. Pressure on Adani\u2019s finances intensified this week after it abandoned a much-vaunted US$2.5bn share sale, which would have been used, in part, to pay down debt. The fundraising was pulled because participating investors would have suffered large losses should the sale have gone ahead given falling share price movements. \u201cWe have an impeccable track record of servicing our debt,\u201d Adani said in a video address after abandoning the fundraising. \u201cThis decision will not have any impact on our existing operations and future plans.\u201d The billionaire chairman has support from a prominent Abu Dhabi investor with ties to the royal family, along with investor and political support from within India. On Friday, Adani responded to critics of his apparent close ties to India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, dismissing claims his companies had avoided oversight. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that my professional success is not because of any individual leader,\u201d he told India Today television, according to an AFP report. Political opposition groups in India are pressuring parliament to debate the impact of the Adani fraud claims on investors and the country\u2019s banking sector. There are also calls for an independent probe into the allegations. The most dramatic claims refer to what Hindenburg calls a \u201cbrazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme\u201d that has driven up the price of the listed Adani companies, and inflated the net worth of its billionaire chairman. Hindenburg alleges that this is done by using shell companies to manipulate the price of the listed ones by holding large positions. Adani has denied the allegations and said any dealings with related parties were properly accounted for. The chairman\u2019s personal net worth has taken a significant hit, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. After sitting alongside Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates among the world\u2019s richest just a couple of weeks ago, Adani has dropped out of the top 20 once Friday\u2019s share price falls are taken into account."

            "date": "2023-02-27T00:01:35Z",
            "content": "The total value of all homes across the UK has reached a record high of \u00a38.7tn but rising mortgage costs are likely to lead to a dip in 2023. The country\u2019s 30m homes were valued by the estate agent Savills at a combined \u00a38.68tn at the end of 2022, a rise of just over 5% or \u00a3425bn on a year earlier. However, it was a smaller rise than the \u00a3700bn annual increase in 2021 and the \u00a3500bn rise in 2020 as buyers paid more for roomier homes during the pandemic and the subsequent shift towards working from home. \u201cThe growth in house prices over the past three years has added considerably to the paper wealth of homeowners, driven in no small part by the well-documented \u2018race for space\u2019 over the period,\u201d Lucian Cook, the head of residential research at Savills, said. Savills said it expected 2022 to represent a \u201chigh watermark\u201d for the value of the nation\u2019s homes for the next few years and warned prices were likely to fall as rising mortgage costs squeezed first- and second-time buyers. \u201cThough mortgage borrowing equates to less than a fifth of the nation\u2019s housing stock value, the cost and availability of that debt will be crucial to the shape of the housing market over the next four or five years,\u201d Cook said. \u201cRecent figures from HMRC indicate that buying activity peaks among those in their 30s, with the under 45s accounting for 59% of all purchases. \u201cCombined with the prospect of lower levels of house building, we expect that 2022 will represent a high watermark for the value of the nation\u2019s housing stock for a few years.\u201d The figures compiled by the firm were for all homes including those owned outright or with a mortgage, as well as private- and social-rented properties. Of the \u00a38.7tn worth of residential property in the UK, just over \u00a37tn is owner by owner-occupiers, with \u00a31.7tn of the value owed in mortgage debt. Of this, almost half \u2013 a record \u00a33.34tn \u2013 was held by mortgage-free homeowners. \u201cThe total value of all housing has risen by almost a quarter (23%) since 2019, while outstanding mortgage debt went up by a lower 11%,\u201d Cook said. \u201cSo, while outstanding borrowing increased by \u00a3168bn, the growth in the total equity pot was well over nine times that figure at \u00a31.46tn.\u201d Owner-occupiers have been the major beneficiaries of this value growth, Savills said. According to their estimates, almost 40% of the growth (\u00a3645bn) over the past three years was enjoyed by those who have paid off their mortgage debt, while mortgaged owner-occupiers accounted for 34% (\u00a3549bn) of the increase. According to Cook, a few key trends have created a shift in who has benefitted from house price growth over the past five years, concentrating the greatest gains in the hands of owner-occupiers rather than buy-to-let landlords. \u201cNot only have we continued to see people who benefitted from the homeownership boom of the latter part of the 20th century joining the ranks of the mortgage-free, but there\u2019s also been a modest recovery in numbers of mortgaged homeowners, due to increased levels of first-time buyer activity over the period,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, however, we\u2019ve seen pressure on privately rented housing stock levels, due to increased regulation and taxation despite rising tenant demand. As a result, growth in the total value of mortgaged owner occupied homes exceeded that seen across the private rented sector, reversing a trend over the previous five years.\u201d Between 2012 and 2017 the value of private rented stock grew by \u00a3495bn, according to Savills estimates, more than the \u00a3443bn growth in the value of homes owned by mortgaged homeowners. But over the five years to the end of 2022, the value of private rented stock rose by a much lower \u00a3222bn, while mortgaged owner-occupier homes added a total \u00a3669bn to their value."

            "date": "2023-02-22T17:56:44Z",
            "content": "Wales\u2019s Six Nations match against England will go ahead as planned on Saturday after a player strike was narrowly averted following a series of crisis meetings on Wednesday. The Wales squad were adamant they would down tools for the lucrative fixture in Cardiff if the Welsh Rugby Union did not grant concessions to their demands over contracts, but that drastic option has been dodged after a breakthrough was finally reached. Industrial action would have forced the WRU to call off Saturday\u2019s fixture, thereby crippling the union, given the match is worth in excess of \u00a39m, and having an effect on the rest of the competing nations. The reputational damage suffered would have been catastrophic \u2013 the captain, Ken Owens, said on Wednesday that Welsh rugby had already become a \u201claughing stock\u201d \u2013 and Six Nations organisers would have been reeling with the match due to be broadcast in the BBC\u2019s prime Saturday late afternoon slot. The players were insistent that their threat was genuine, but after meeting the WRU\u2019s acting chief executive, Nigel Walker, and Malcolm Wall, chairman of the Professional Rugby Board, they have relented. The threat of strike action materialised amid an ongoing delay to the new six-year financial agreement between the WRU and the four Welsh regions. Due to that delay, regions had been unable to offer players contracts for next season, leaving dozens uncertain of their future. As a result, the Wales players gave the WRU and the PRB a set of demands to meet if strike action were to be averted. They wanted representation on the PRB via the Welsh Rugby Players Association, demanded an end to the 60-cap rule \u2013 which prevents players with fewer than 60 caps being eligible for selection if they are based outside Wales \u2013 and had called for a change to the structure of the proposed contracts. After crunch talks at Wales\u2019s training base between the WRU, the PRB and dozens of players, confirmation came that the match would be on. The cap rule has not been entirely scrapped but the threshold has been reduced to 25, players will be offered both fixed and fixed variable contracts and the WRPA chief executive, Gareth Lewis, will have a seat on the PRB. Walker also confirmed that regions would be able to offer contracts from next week. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to announce that after extensive conversations and discussions over the last week the Wales-England game will go ahead as scheduled,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important going forward that we continue the dialogue, but not under the circumstances we\u2019ve had over the last week or so.\u201d With the match going ahead, Wales must now regroup in an effort to avoid a third straight Six Nations defeat. Warren Gatland delayed naming his team on Tuesday but will do so on Thursday. Owens said the contract row had been a distraction but that Wales would be prepared to face an England side chasing a first win in Cardiff since 2017. \u201cWe are obviously happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been huge frustration over the last number of months that it got to this stage. We felt we had to make a stand, but the conversations that have taken place over the last 10 days or so have shown that some positive resolutions can be found. \u201cThe players are satisfied, hence why the game is on. It has been very tough, hugely frustrating. It has been a difficult period, but we have fronted up in training and prepared as we would for any Test match and we are looking forward to getting out there and going toe-to-toe with England. \u201cOf course it has been a distraction with everything that has been going on, but I have got to commend the players\u2019 professionalism in this. When we have crossed that white line at training, we\u2019ve done our work as professional players. We are really ready for Saturday. \u201cWith the events of the last six to eight weeks everybody in Welsh rugby needs to pull together now to find the best way forward. We need to do it collaboratively to put Welsh rugby back at the top of world rugby, and not the laughing stock which I think we are at the moment.\u201d England, meanwhile, are seeking a second win under Steve Borthwick after comfortably seeing off Italy. Borthwick will keep changes to his side to a minimum with the returning Courtney Lawes set to take a place on the bench, providing cover to what is shaping up to be an unchanged pack. In the backs, Borthwick must make one change after a knee injury ruled out Ollie Hassell-Collins, with the head coach mulling over whether to hand the 20-year-old Henry Arundell a first start. Anthony Watson, Joe Marchant and Cadan Murley are alternative options. Arundell scored his first Twickenham try for England after coming off the bench against Italy and the full-back Freddie Steward has backed him to flourish in Cardiff, whether from the start or as a replacement. \u201cHe\u2019s a freak really,\u201d said 22-year-old Steward. \u201cHe\u2019s the most powerful guy I\u2019ve ever seen, I think \u2013 the way he explodes when he\u2019s running; his skillset, he is ridiculously talented. I think I\u2019m young and he\u2019s a lot younger than I am, so the potential he has is scary.\u201d Tom Curry will play no part in England\u2019s Six Nations campaign after it was revealed his fresh injury will keep him sidelined for at least the next four weeks. Curry was due to return against Wales after recovering from an injury to his right hamstring but sustained a similar injury to his left leg during an England training session on Monday, his club, Sale, have confirmed."

            "date": "2023-02-21T23:00:07Z",
            "content": "Tens of millions of dollars worth of Australian retirement savings have been exposed to the beleaguered Adani Group as the Indian conglomerate faces a stock rout after allegations of fraud. Several major superannuation funds, including those that cater for government workers in Queensland and employees at the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), invested in the company after allocating money to emerging markets to boost returns. Australia\u2019s $243bn Future Fund, which was set up to strengthen the commonwealth\u2019s long-term financial position, also has an exposure to two Adani companies that are now worth a fraction of the original investment. \u201cAny super fund investing in Adani Group companies has failed its members on climate action and due diligence,\u201d Will van de Pol, a Market Forces asset management campaigner, said. Analysis of superannuation holdings by the climate activist group shows that the investments are collectively worth tens of millions of dollars, but only represent a small fraction of an individual fund due to the diversified nature of their stock holdings. Adani companies have been subject to relentless selling since a 24 January report by US investor Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation and accounting fraud. Adani Group published a 413-page rebuttal of the allegations, likening the US short-seller\u2019s report to an attack on India, but it has been unable to arrest a relentless slide in the value of the company. Shares in seven listed Adani companies have shed about US$125bn (A$182bn) since the report, representing well over half the value of the ports-to-power conglomerate that runs Australia\u2019s contentious Carmichael coalmine and rail project in Queensland. \u201cThese funds have used members\u2019 money to prop up Adani\u2019s unacceptable coal expansion plans, including the disastrous Carmichael mine, and failed to see glaring investment risks that existed for years before being outlined in the Hindenburg report,\u201d Van de Pol said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian Retirement Trust, a Brisbane-headquartered manager with more than $200bn in assets, was exposed to at least six Adani entities worth several million dollars before the report was released. The investment was part of a \u201cpassive\u201d allocation, whereby the fund appoints external fund managers to invest on its behalf in a particular country or sector, often tracking an index. The fund, which offers products to Queensland government employees and their families as part of its service, did not respond to questions. CBA\u2019s super fund for its workers, Group Super, had a small exposure as did Brighter Super, which is the traditional fund for local government employees in Queensland. \u201cThe fund has a very small exposure to Adani via two passive, indexed portfolios,\u201d Brighter\u2019s chief investment officer, Mark Rider, said, adding that the $2.5m investment represented 0.008% of the fund\u2019s overall holdings. Following a freedom-of-information request by former senator Rex Patrick, the Future Fund recently disclosed it had a $33.1m investment in two Adani companies before the share price collapse. One of those companies, Adani Total Gas, has so far in 2023 lost 75% of its value. The Future Fund\u2019s chief executive, Raphael Arndt, told a Senate committee last week the investment was made through an external fund manager with a mandate to invest in emerging markets, such as India. \u201cThose managers run their own due diligence on the companies they invest in,\u201d Arndt said. The large size of the Adani conglomerate, which is the biggest airport and private seaport owner in India, meant its shares found their way into the portfolios of many fund managers around the world seeking to profit from the rise of the Indian economy. Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund had a sizeable holding, but sold most of its Adani stakes before the share collapse. The $70bn Hesta fund, primarily catering for health and community service workers, had one of the larger exposures to Adani among Australian funds in recent years."

            "date": "2023-02-14T13:49:39Z",
            "content": "US inflation continued to cool in January, rising at an annual rate of 6.4%, according to figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The consumer price index (CPI) \u2013 which measures a basket of goods and services \u2013 has now fallen for seven consecutive months, down from a four-decade high of 9.1% last June, and down from an annual rate of 6.5% in December. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.5% from 0.1% in December, showing the continuing strength of inflationary pressures as the cost of housing/shelter rose again. The fall was smaller than some economists had expected, but January\u2019s rise was still the smallest 12-month increase since the period ending October 2021. After subtracting volatile food and energy prices, the so-called \u201ccore index\u201d rose 5.6% over the last 12 months, its smallest 12-month increase since December 2021. While the fall is welcome news and has mitigated some of the cost of living crisis that has seen the price of goods from eggs and orange juice to rents and healthcare soar, the latest reading is still far higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual target rate of 2% inflation. The still-rising cost of shelter accounted for nearly half the monthly \u201call-items\u201d increase, rising 0.7% over the month and 7.9% higher than a year ago. The indexes for food, gasoline, and natural gas also contributed to the rise. The latest inflation numbers follow evidence of the continuing strength of the US jobs market. In January, the US added more than 500,000 new jobs, roughly three times the number economists had been expecting. The strength of the jobs market has worried some Fed officials, who are concerned that the tight labor market will lead to wage rises and will feed inflationary pressures. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has acknowledged that the spike in inflation \u2013 the most severe in decades \u2013 is easing. But earlier this month he indicated that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates as it fights to bring price rises back to the Fed\u2019s target rate. Powell said: \u201cWe covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-02T06:00:53Z",
            "content": "Turn up. Take the temperature of the economy. Raise interest rates. That\u2019s the been the pattern from the responsible technocrats at the Bank of England for more than a year now \u2013 and they show no sign of stopping. Between the depths of the global financial crisis in March 2009 and the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, interest rates were changed only five times, and three of those were in response to unexpected shocks: one after the Brexit vote in 2016, and two at the arrival of the pandemic in 2020. There was one period of more than seven years when interest rates were pegged at 0.5%. All that has changed in the past year or so, a period in which Threadneedle Street has become hyperactive. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has raised official borrowing costs at each of its last nine meetings, taking interest rates from 0.1% \u2013 the lowest since the Bank was founded in 1694 \u2013 to 3.5%. A 10th increase is expected at noon on Thursday. Critics of the Bank say it\u2019s being forced to play catchup after getting inflation forecasts hopelessly wrong. Supporters say this is only true with the benefit of hindsight. What is certain is that Thursday\u2019s decision comes at a time when the Bank is facing an acute policy dilemma. On the one hand, the economy is showing signs of weakening. Higher mortgage costs have taken the heat out of the housing market, with the Nationwide building society reporting a fifth monthly fall in property prices. Business failures are rising as tougher financing conditions wipe out \u201czombie\u201d companies only viable while rates were at ultra-low levels. The International Monetary Fund said this week the economy would contract by 0.6% this year and the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading industrial nations to go backwards. Faced with this scenario in previous years, the Bank would have been cutting interest rates, not raising them. Yet, after peaking at a 40-year-high of just over 11%, inflation as measured by the consumer prices index has fallen back only slightly and is still above 10%. The Bank\u2019s legally mandated job is to bring inflation back sustainably to its 2% target and the MPC is concerned that if it allows price pressures to become embedded they will be hard to shift. The fact that the latest MPC meeting takes place against a backdrop of widespread industrial action, prompted by workers seeking to maintain their living standards in the face of a rising cost of living, will make some members of the committee even more determined to act decisively. The dilemma facing the MPC is encapsulated by the differing views of what the Bank should do from two of its former members. David Blanchflower said based on the \u201cbleak\u201d growth outlook and falling inflation, he would be voting for a one percentage-point cut in interest rates. \u201cYou cut rates in a recession, you don\u2019t raise them to make it worse,\u201d he said. Andrew Sentance, by contrast, said there was evidence high inflation was increasing wage pressures and he would be voting for a half-point increase to 4%. \u201cYou have to create some slack in the labour market. That\u2019s not something you really want to do but the labour market is quite tight and a bit more slack would be helpful in dampening down inflationary pressure.\u201d The current MPC is no less split. At its last meeting in December, six members voted to raise rates by 0.5 points, two wanted them left unchanged and one voted for a 0.75 point increase. A similar lack of unanimity is expected on Thursday, with the committee divided between those who think raising rates further risks overkill, and those who think tough action now will avoid the need for even tougher action later. The interest-rate doves see the risk of an unnecessarily deep recession, while the interest-rate hawks are concerned by core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy and food \u2013 running at above 6%. Despite the gloomy forecast from the IMF, the Bank is likely to be less downbeat than it was three months ago, the last time it delivered a health check on the economy. Two things have made the picture slightly brighter: the financial markets have calmed down since the end of Liz Truss\u2019s short-lived premiership; and global energy prices have fallen. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s downbeat prediction in November of a record two-year long recession and a doubling of unemployment illustrates the perils of forecasting when so much depends on volatile factors such as gas prices. \u201cThe significant fall in wholesale gas prices in the last few months means inflation should fall faster and the economy shrinks by less, and for less time, than the Bank of England anticipated three months ago. \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s growth forecast will also receive a boost from the decline in market interest rate expectations. Three months ago, investors expected Bank rate to peak at around 5.25%. Now, they expect a peak of around 4.25%.\u201d At a time when other leading central banks are raising rates, anything other than a half-point increase would be a surprise. Assuming that is the case, attention in the markets will turn to whether an 11th and even a 12th successive rate rise is in prospect. Lord Mervyn King, a former Bank governor, once said that the success of a central bank should be judged by how boring it was. Currently, the Bank of England is anything but."

            "content": "Britain\u2019s inflation rate could fall to below 2% by the end of the year, according to new financial industry forecasts, handing the chancellor a boost to the public finances before a general election in 2024. Predictions that falling gas prices will accelerate the decline this year in the consumer prices index (CPI) from last month\u2019s level of 10.1% could also support a recovery in household living standards and persuade the Bank of England to cut interest rates earlier than expected. Investment bank Citi said the CPI was likely to fall to 2.3% in November, below the Bank of England\u2019s estimate of a 4% inflation rate the fourth quarter of the year. Fund manager Investec said it could slide to 1.6% by December. Inflation has remained in double digits since last July \u2013 barring a brief drop to 9.9% in August \u2013 triggering a wave of pay demands to compensate workers for the loss of spending power. Most of the increase was due to rising energy and food prices, which Citi\u2019s chief UK economist, Benjamin Nabarro, said were now falling at a faster rate than had been expected at the beginning of the year. Interest rate rises by the Bank of England are also expected to have a dampening effect on consumer spending, further reducing the pressure on prices. A slide in inflation to 2% would allow the prime minister to more than fulfil his pledge to halve inflation by the end of the year and make it easier to resolve a wave of public sector strikes over pay. \u201cThe faster reduction in inflation [this year] primarily reflects an easing in pricing pressures, particularly in energy,\u201d Nabarro said, adding that inflation could be as low as 5% by July. Philip Shaw, chief UK economist at Investec, has forecast a fall in inflation to 1.6% by the fourth quarter, driven by falling energy prices and a squeeze from higher lending rates for 1.5m households that must remortgage this year. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said such predictions of low inflation this year relied on several assumptions. \u201cThat inflation could fall to 2% by the end of the year isn\u2019t implausible. The ongoing and substantial decline in wholesale energy prices should translate into falling household bills in the second half of this year, while lower commodity prices and shipping costs will also gradually feed through into prices in the shops. \u201cBut there are significant risks which mean inflation may not fall so quickly. UK wages growth is still historically strong which could mean services sector inflation, in particular, proves stickier than hoped. A further escalation in the war in Ukraine which intensified pressures on energy supplies could see energy prices jump back up again. \u201cAnd Chinese demand for gas and other commodities after the lifting of Covid restrictions could rebound more than expected, pushing prices up and slowing the pace at which inflation drops.\u201d In August last year, Nabarro forecast that rising energy prices would send the CPI to as high as 18.6% in the first quarter of 2023. The forecast was based on an expected jump in the energy price cap this year from \u00a32,500 to \u00a35,816. The fresh projections reflect a likely fall in household energy bills as wholesale gas prices continue to drop. A fall of 80% since last August is expected to be included in the price cap from June, according to the latest forecasts from consultancy Cornwall Insight, pushing down the price cap to nearer \u00a32,100 by the fourth quarter. A change in the weightings on the CPI index to include a greater proportion of gas and electricity is also expected to accelerate the decline in inflation. The Office for National Statistics increased the weighting in January from 3.6% to 4.8%, meaning that the falls in energy prices will have a strong drag on overall consumer prices over the rest of the year."

            "date": "2023-02-15T07:20:24Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s annual inflation rate fell for a third consecutive month in January, easing pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates, but remained in double digits and near the highest levels for 40 years. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said annual inflation as measured by the consumer prices index fell to 10.1%, continuing a decline from 10.5% in December and its recent peak of 11.1% in October. City economists had forecast a modest drop to 10.3%. The fall was driven by a continued drop in petrol and diesel prices for motorists at the start of the year, as well as the price of air and coach travel falling back after a steep rise in December. Restaurant, cafe and takeaway prices also fell month on month, while the cost of furniture dropped as retailers put on January sales. The latest figures come as the central bank considers whether further interest rate increases are warranted to tackle inflation, a move that would add to pressure on borrowers after 10 successive rate rises in the past 18 months. UK inflation remains higher than in the US or the 20 EU countries in the eurozone, and some forecasters have said the UK\u2019s acute worker shortages and other constraints on the economy such as Brexit could add to inflationary pressure. US inflation fell to 6.4% in January, and is estimated at 8.5% in the eurozone. Grant Fitzner, the chief economist at the ONS, said inflation had probably peaked after reaching the highest levels since 1981 in October. \u201cBarring geopolitical risks and barring something completely unexpected, yes [it has peaked] \u2026 The general direction does seem to be south,\u201d he said. Rishi Sunak has promised to halve the annual inflation rate this year as the cornerstone of his economic plans. Most economists forecast a fall over the coming months amid a drop in global energy prices, and as the initial surge in markets after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine drops out of the annual inflation rate. Wholesale energy and commodity prices have fallen sharply in recent months, including a drop in European gas prices to the lowest level in 17 months. However, overall consumer prices remain high and are still rising fast, albeit at a slower annual rate than in December. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cWhile any fall in inflation is welcome, the fight is far from over. High inflation strangles growth and causes pain for families and businesses \u2013 that\u2019s why we must stick to the plan to halve inflation this year, reduce debt and grow the economy.\u201d The ONS said there were further indications that costs facing businesses were rising more slowly than in previous months, driven by falls in crude oil, electricity, and petrol prices. However, food and drink inflation remained at close to the highest rates since the 1970s, with the soaring price of milk, bread and other basic essentials pushing up prices by almost 17% in a year. Rising prices for alcohol and tobacco also added to upward pressure on inflation, following on from seasonal price cuts in December. Charities warned that the rising cost of a weekly shop was putting the most pressure on lower-income households, who spend proportionally more on basic essentials than those on higher incomes. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said the poorest 10th of households experienced an inflation rate of 11.7% in January, compared with only 8.8% for the richest. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said food prices remained high because of the knock-on impact from rising energy and fertiliser prices after the invasion of Ukraine. \u201cSo as Christmas discounts faded away, households will have felt the pressure in their weekly grocery shop.\u201d The government is preparing to reduce the level of energy support for households and businesses this spring, amid concerns from charities and company bosses that Britain\u2019s cost of living emergency is far from over. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cDespite Britain\u2019s enormous potential, in April households will be hit by another economic blow when energy prices go up. With inflation still close to a 40-year high, people will be asking if 13 years of Tory government has left them and their family feeling better off. The answer will be no.\u201d Economists said weaker inflation could ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates above the current rate of 4%, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Services inflation fell back from 6.8% in December to 6% in January. The figure is closely watched by the central bank for signs that rising workers\u2019 pay is leading to companies pushing up their prices. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said: \u201cA word of caution: one month does not make a trend. By definition, the Bank of England\u2019s focus on \u2018persistence\u2019 suggests policymakers are going to be less fazed by month-to-month gyrations in this data. That said, our view is that services inflation has probably peaked.\u201d"

            "content": "The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has said that more interest rates rise will be needed to cool inflation and the red-hot US jobs market. \u201cWe think we are going to need to do further rate increases,\u201d Powell said on Tuesday at the Economic Club of Washington. \u201cThe labor market is extraordinarily strong.\u201d The Fed chair\u2019s comments came hours ahead of Joe Biden\u2019s State of Union address to Congress at which he is predicted to tout his administration\u2019s economic record, including strong job growth. The US added 517,000 new jobs in January \u2013 far higher than expected and a sign of the continuing strength of the jobs market. The report came two days after the Fed announced another quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate, its eighth consecutive rate increase as the central bank fights to tame inflation. \u201cThe disinflationary process, the process of getting inflation down, has begun and it\u2019s begun in the goods sector,\u201d Powell said in Washington. \u201cBut it has a long way to go. These are the very early stages of disinflation.\u201d Reacting to the stronger-than-expected employment report, analysts now expect interest rates to rise above 5% to ease wage pressure in the labor market and begin to cool inflation to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. In December inflation stood at 6.5%. While some have begun to declare victory over inflation, Powell said last week that officials need \u201csubstantially more evidence\u201d to be confident that inflation is heading downward. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019re going to react to the data,\u201d Powell said on Tuesday. \u201cSo if we continue to get, for example, strong labor market reports or higher inflation reports, it may well be the case that we have to do more and raise rates more than is priced in.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-13T13:03:13Z",
            "content": "The EU is predicted to narrowly avoid recession as a result of a milder-than-expected energy shock, although households face difficult times ahead as cost of living pressures ease only gradually, the European Commission has said. Economic growth for the 27 countries of the EU is forecast to be 0.8% in 2023, compared with a 0.3% projection last autumn, when fears of winter power outages and the rising cost of living ran high. In the 20-country eurozone, the economy will expand by 0.9% in 2023, boosted by a better-than-expected performance in Germany and Italy, as well as relatively stronger growth in Spain. The rapidly declining price of gas means inflation has now peaked, with the headline rate forecast to fall from 9.2% in 2022 to 6.4% in 2023, then 2.8% in 2024. \u201cThe EU economy entered 2023 on a healthier footing than expected and looks set to escape recession,\u201d the EU economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, told reporters. He warned, however, that inflation in 2023 would remain stubbornly high, putting pressure on households. \u201cEuropeans still face a difficult period ahead, with growth still expected to slow and inflation set to relinquish its grip on purchasing power only gradually.\u201d The commission estimates that in 2022 the EU experienced economic growth of 3.5%, a better rate than either China or the US. The UK, by contrast, expanded by 4.1% in 2022 but is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to be the only economy to shrink in 2023 among major industrialised countries. Despite a better-than-expected start to the year for the EU, growth will slow compared with 2022, as wages lag behind prices, meaning consumers are likely to be cautious about spending money. The EU is now expected to avoid recession, as a result of falling gas prices. The European gas benchmark, the Dutch TTF, was trading at \u20ac55 (\u00a349) a megawatt hour in late January, below its pre-Russia-Ukraine war level. The EU has so far overshot its plan to reduce gas consumption, and managed to keep gas storage levels high throughout the winter, helped by milder weather. According to the commission, gas consumption in October and November 2022 was 25% below the 2017-21 average, compared with a 15% reduction target. Despite success in weaning itself off Russian gas, Germany is forecast to experience a mild economic decline in early 2023. EU officials attribute this to increasing energy prices, combined with government support for January and February not being disbursed in March. Germany\u2019s large export-oriented economy will also be hindered by weak foreign demand. Overall, the commission is forecasting 0.2% growth for Germany in 2023, one of the weaker performances in the EU, although better than the 0.6% contraction forecast three months ago. France will also be below the EU average, with moderate economic growth of 0.6% forecast for 2023. In the EU\u2019s second-largest economy, economic activity is expected to remain subdued over the first half of 2023, with a gradual recovery from the summer, as cost of living pressures begin to ease. Meanwhile, Italy is expected to experience a 0.8% expansion in its economy this year, after a small decline at the end of 2022. Italian household spending and investment is expected to pick up in the second half of the year, as cost of living pressures ease and the economy begins to benefit from Italy\u2019s \u20ac192bn EU-backed Covid recovery plan. Spain is expected to chalk up economic expansion of 1.4%, helped by a strong performance in 2022 when the country was boosted by high demand from tourists seeking post-Covid foreign travel. The continuing strength of Spain\u2019s tourism sector, as well as a boost in construction and equipment spending from its \u20ac69.5bn Covid recovery plan, are expected to support the Spanish economy in 2023. The UK was last week shown to have narrowly avoided a recession, with zero growth in the final quarter of 2022. The Bank of England has predicted a shallow recession for the UK economy in 2023, as it warned that Brexit was damaging the economy more quickly than it had anticipated. Gentiloni said the main risks to the commission\u2019s forecasts were geopolitical tensions and the evolution of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, which left investors and companies facing \u201ca high degree of uncertainty\u201d."

            "title": "UK narrowly avoids recession after figures show growth flatlining",
            "date": "2023-02-10T10:03:15Z",
            "content": "The UK has avoided entering a recession by the slimmest of margins as figures show its trade deficit with the EU hit record levels in the last three months of 2022. A decline in gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.5% in December was offset by increases in the two previous months to leave the economy\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter at roughly the same level as the previous three months. Negative growth in the fourth quarter would have signalled recession, after the UK economy shrank by 0.2% in the third quarter \u2013 a figure revised up from the initial estimate of a 0.3% contraction. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the figures underscored Britain\u2019s resilience, adding that they showed the economy was the fastest-growing in the G7 group of rich nations last year. However, the economy remains 0.8% below its pre-pandemic peak in 2019, in contrast with the US, which has experienced growth of 5.1% over the same period, and the 2.4% improvement among the 19 members of the eurozone. Business groups said the situation remained difficult, with one describing the drop in December as \u201cbrutal\u201d and a harbinger of a difficult year ahead. The dismal growth figures came as separate data showed trade with the rest of the world declined during the last quarter along with retail sales, with the normally buoyant shopping period in the run-up to Christmas failing to live up to hopes. The Office for National Statistics said the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the EU widened in the final quarter of 2022 to its highest level since records began in 1997 as imports from the bloc rocketed to \u00a382bn against an exports total of \u00a349.2bn. While the deficit largely reflected the huge increase in gas imports, the ONS said there was a sharp deterioration in the balance of goods and services traded with the rest of the world. It said the shortfall widened \u00a32.4bn to \u00a326.8bn, which the statistics agency said was \u201cdriven by lower exports of both goods and services\u201d. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the economy was \u201cstuck in the slow lane\u201d and called on Hunt to bring forward \u201ca proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants\u201d to prevent a 40% increase in household energy bills in April that she said would make the cost of living crisis worse. Hunt is under pressure to open his chequebook to maintain a subsidy for household gas bills beyond April by blocking a \u00a3500 increase in the energy price cap to \u00a33,000. Many of his MPs believe the economy is unlikely to recover unless he also increases the pay offer to public sector workers to end a string of debilitating strikes. In a round of TV interviews, he said he could not afford to extend the \u00a32,500 energy price cap and an increase in public sector pay would be inflationary. The Confederation of British Industry said that without a significant move by the government to aid businesses a recession in 2023 was likely. It said the chancellor needed to take \u201ca bolder approach to tackling labour and skills shortages and falling business investment\u201d. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: \u201cDespite skirting a technical recession for now, December\u2019s GDP fall confirms that the economy took a nosedive at the end of 2022. \u201cThe UK is facing a particularly brutal year, with high inflation, stealth tax rises and the lagged impact of numerous interest rate hikes still likely to push us into a summer downturn by hammering incomes and confidence.\u201d Strike action across many industries and a drop in school attendance were also blamed for the sharp drop of GDP in December. The ONS said the quarter\u2019s figures were rescued by a return to the office that pushed up activity in the administrative sector. With the cost of living crisis eating into household spending power and many small businesses struggling to stay afloat, few economists had predicted a strong performance for the final quarter of last year. Bank of England policymakers said in their latest outlook for the UK economy that they expected GDP to grow by 0.1% in the last three months of 2022. Ben Jones, the lead economist at the CBI, said: \u201cWe may have avoided a technical recession late last year but we probably won\u2019t avoid one this year. While we expect that the downturn will be shallow, if we act now, we can make the recession even shorter than predicted. \u201cAll eyes are on the chancellor\u2019s March budget, when businesses will be looking for a bolder approach to tackling labour and skills shortages and falling business investment. In particular, firms will be looking for a permanent replacement to the super-deduction, as well as a focus on innovation and the green economy, to help boost economic growth in the years ahead.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-21T15:22:29Z",
            "content": "A rebound across the UK\u2019s services sector in February has raised hopes that the country might avoid recession in the first half of this year. Analysts said the bigger than expected surge in business activity appeared to show that the UK would narrowly avoid a recession, though the squeeze on consumer spending from the energy crisis and a struggling manufacturing sector would continue to put the brakes on the economic recovery. The pound edged up by more than half a cent to hit $1.211, the highest since last Wednesday as foreign exchange analysts calculated that stronger economic growth would increase the chances of further interest rate rises by the Bank of England to cool inflation. Bank of England rate-setters said in their most recent outlook for the UK economy they expected gross domestic product (GDP) to shrink by about 1% across this year and the first quarter of 2024, making it the only G7 nation to suffer a recession in 2023. The early or \u201cflash\u201d measure of private sector activity by S&amp;P Global/Cips found that the services industry index jumped to an eight-month high of 53.3, where a figure above 50 indicates expansion. The index shows how much firms have increased production, employment and their order books to achieve a rounded measure of commercial activity. Services companies, which make up about three-quarters of private sector activity, reported a stronger demand for business services \u201camid an improving global economic outlook and reduced domestic political uncertainty\u201d. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which compiled the index, said business confidence was damaged in the second half of last year, which was characterised by a fractious Conservative party leadership election and the unstable premiership of Liz Truss. \u201cThe broader business mood has been buoyed by signs of inflation peaking, supply chains improving and recession risks easing. The stress created by last autumn\u2019s mini-budget is also continuing to work its way out of the financial system,\u201d he said. The composite flash PMI, which includes the manufacturing sector, increased to 53.0 after a rebound in factory output for the first time in six months. The manufacturing PMI remained below 50 at 49.2, but firms pointed to stronger demand from overseas clients and that \u201cimproving supply conditions had helped to boost factory production\u201d. A survey by the CBI found that factory owners were much gloomier than the PMI registered after a drop in output and orders. A net balance of -16% of manufacturers reported a drop in output volumes in the three months to February, the CBI said in its latest healthcheck, revealing the fastest fall in manufacturing output since September 2020. February\u2019s figure was down from -1% in the three months to January, and \u201ca significant disappointment to last month\u2019s expectations of +19%\u201d, the CBI said. The quarterly figures are likely to be skewed by the gloom experienced in December after Liz Truss\u2019s mini budget, dragging down the three-month on three-month average, though some analysts said it showed manufacturers continued to be affected by high borrowing costs, Brexit-related export delays and a shortage of skilled workers. Gabriella Dickens, the senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe CBI survey suggests the manufacturing sector isn\u2019t quite out of the woods yet, in contrast to the message from the S&amp;P Global/Cips PMI released earlier in the day.\u201d The eurozone composite PMI also revealed a resilient services sector across the 19-member euro bloc, which offset a fall in the manufacturing index from 48.8 to 48.5. The composite rose to 52.3 in February\u2019s flash estimate, up from 50.3 in January. This was 1.6 points above consensus of 50.7 and the highest reading since May 2022. According to S&amp;P Global, \u201crising demand, healing supply chains, order book backlog reduction and improved confidence\u201d underpinned the upturn in the eurozone."

            "date": "2023-02-16T16:53:13Z",
            "content": "London\u2019s blue-chip share index, the FTSE 100, hit a new all-time high at over 8,000 points on Thursday. But why is the FTSE 100 so strong, when the UK economy is expected to fall into recession this year and so many businesses and households are struggling? Five factors have helped the share index outperform other global markets since the start of last year. The energy boom The jump in oil and gas prices after Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine a year ago has buoyed the profits and share prices of the FTSE 100\u2019s two oil giants. Shares in Shell have gained almost 60% since the start of last year, from \u00a316.22 in January 2022 to more than \u00a325 today, making Shell the most valuable member of the index, at \u00a3179bn, matching AstraZeneca. Shares in BP have climbed by almost two-thirds since the start of 2022, from 330p to 555p today. Both companies have reported record profits for last year, with BP more than doubling its earnings to $28bn (\u00a323bn), and Shell making annual profits of $40bn in 2022, up from the $19bn in 2021. The biggest FTSE riser on Thursday was British Gas owner Centrica, after it reported a tripling of annual profits to a record \u00a33.3bn for 2022. Bumper profits at energy companies have angered campaigners who are calling for tougher windfall taxes. It\u2019s the global economy The FTSE 100 tracks the 100 largest companies listed in London, and its largest members are multinationals whose sales and profits come from around the world. Companies in the FTSE 100 derive approximately 75% of their revenues from overseas. The fortunes of banking giant HSBC (the third most valuable company on the index, worth \u00a3122bn) or Unilever (number four, at \u00a3107bn) depend on the global economy, rather than just the UK. Hopes for the global recovery have risen this year, as wholesale energy prices have fallen back. Inflation in major economies including the US may have peaked, suggesting central banks might begin to ease the pace of rapid rate hikes. The IMF lifted its growth forecasts for this year at the end of January, predicting the UK would be the only advanced economy to shrink in 2023. While UK GDP could shrink by 0.6%, global growth is forecast by the IMF to be 2.9% this year. FTSE earnings are influenced by changes in the foreign exchange market, where the pound has depreciated against the euro and US dollar over the last year. UK might do better than thought Hopes that UK recession will be less severe than previously feared have also lifted stocks in London this year. The Bank of England now expects a less severe downturn this year, with inflation expected to fall sharply in 2023. The Bank is now forecast to stop its cycle of raising interest rates this summer, with the City now anticipating Bank rate could peak below 4.5% in August. After the turmoil of last autumn\u2019s mini-budget, rates were expected to hit 6%. A shallower recession would support consumer spending. UK retailer JD Sports has been the top riser so far this year, up a sparkling 46% since the beginning of January, with British Airways parent company IAG having gained 35%. Shareholder payouts The FTSE 100 contains a lot of companies that pay decent dividends, so is attractive to investors seeking to generate income. FTSE 100 dividends are forecast to hit a record high this year, with shareholders expected to receive \u00a385.8bn, up from \u00a379.1bn in 2022. Share buybacks, where companies use spare cash to acquire and cancel their own share, have also boosted the FTSE 100. Both BP and Shell have announced billions of pounds of share buybacks \u2013 a way of returning cash to investors \u2013 during 2022. Some of the big shareholder handouts have come in for criticism, with the argument being that the cash could instead be used to increase investment in renewables and reduce prices. The FTSE lacks tech stocks The FTSE 100 has a decidedly old-economy feel to it. Banks, oil companies, and tobacco firms reek of the 20th century, while the index lacks the major technology companies which boomed in the pandemic. But London\u2019s largest companies look more attractive in the current environment, where investors are favouring defensive stocks, and those which benefit from higher commodity prices and interest rates. Tech stocks on the other hand have fallen out of favour in recent months, with Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Tesla all down compared with six months ago. \u201cDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, tech companies and growth stocks were massively in fashion \u2013 precious few of which are included on London\u2019s main index,\u201d says John Moore, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin. \u201cNow, with inflation persistently high, elevated oil prices, and interest rates rising the consumer staples giants, oil and gas explorers, mining groups, and financials that make up the FTSE 100 are looking at a much more supportive near-term environment,\u201d Moore explained."

            "content": "Morning everyone. When our leading scientists sound the alarm on a looming \u201cglobal health crisis\u201d from the spread of superbugs, it makes you take notice. We\u2019ve got the full story on their dramatic warning, and we\u2019re also reporting on a big new push to win hearts and minds on the voice to parliament. Australia Voicing support | Dozens of Australia\u2019s leading social justice and civil society bodies are launching a new partnership to support the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum, with one member of the group calling the consultation body \u201ca basic human right\u201d. Health alarm bells | The spread of superbugs resistant to antibiotics and antifungal treatments threatens a \u201cglobal health crisis\u201d unless there is greater coordination and better management of patient data, according to a report by the CSIRO and the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. It comes as researchers say that an invasive strep A variant first identified in the UK and thought to be behind a surge in deaths has likely contributed to a similar uptick in serious disease and hospitalisations in Australia. Veterans\u2019 woe | An increasing number of health clinics are refusing to accept the gold card that entitles veterans and their dependants or partners to free healthcare, Guardian Australia has learned. Super breakout | Two Liberal moderates, Russell Broadbent and Bridget Archer, have broken ranks and endorsed the treasurer\u2019s efforts to discuss possible changes to the superannuation system\u2019s generous tax breaks. Cyber clash | Labor could face opposition in the Senate to its plans to expand the government\u2019s powers to directly intervene in the IT systems of companies during cyber-attacks. World Protocol peace | The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has sealed a deal with the EU to end the dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol \u2013 the complex fix for the region\u2019s post-Brexit trade rules. But although it was widely hailed as \u201cextraordinary\u201d, it is likely to face opposition from hardline Brexiter MPs and Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP unionist party, and may not draw the Brexit poison. Israel violence | Scores of Israeli settlers have gone on a violent rampage in the northern West Bank, setting alight dozens of cars and homes after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman. It piles pressure on the US president, Joe Biden, to intervene. Beijing visit | Xi Jinping\u2019s plan to meet Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, in Beijing on Tuesday highlights the widening gulf between the US and China over the war in Ukraine. \u2018Media is racist\u2019 | Elon Musk has come out in support of the beleaguered American cartoonist Scott Adams who was dumped by hundreds of newspapers for racist remarks. Bond rewritten | A week after a controversy about the rewriting of Roald Dahl\u2019s novels, the James Bond books are to be reissued with a number of racial references removed and a disclaimer about \u2018\u201coffensive\u201d attitudes. Full Story The \u2018wild west\u2019 of online sperm donation in Australia Jack Nunn found out by chance that he and his mother were some of the many descendants of a prolific sperm donor at a time when regulations had not been established to try to prevent this practice. Tory Shepherd explains why people are choosing not to use the IVF system. In-depth As two polls show Labor\u2019s lead in the NSW election campaign is shrinking, we look at the key issues for the state\u2019s independent candidates who could be left holding the balance of power. From feral horses to rural bridges, and \u201cjobs for the boys\u201d to gambling reform, Tamsin Rose gives you the lowdown. Not the news In an industry first, the Melbourne Theatre Company has formed a special group of artists including Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr, Zindzi Okenyo and Tony Briggs to advise management about diversity. Okenyo, co-director of Seven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner, pictured, said: \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about how we can be even more inclusive and how we move forward together.\u201d The world of sport Cricket | An exciting finish lies ahead in the second and final test between England and New Zealand in Wellington today with the tourists needing 210 more to win. Rugby league | Fresh from a win over Penrith in the world club showdown, St Helens captain James Roby tells Donald McRae what keeps him going at the age of 37. Football | Catch up on the European leagues including Barcelona slipping up again, a blizzard in the Bundesliga, Napoli romping in Serie A and Manchester United taking out the Carabao Cup. Media roundup One of Australia\u2019s biggest trucking companies, Scott\u2019s Refrigerated Logistics, has gone bust, putting 1,500 jobs at risk as well as supermarket supply chains, according to the West Australian.

            "title": "Can a museum embody environmental justice? ",
            "date": "2023-02-08T08:01:10Z",
            "content": "Founded in 1960, Storm King\u2019s contemporary sculpture collection graces 500 acres of rolling meadows and forestland in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley Where else can you witness a multi-ton modernist masterpiece like Alexander Liberman\u2019s Iliad \u2013 cherry red steel tubes stacked on to one another, 36ft by 54ft \u2013 against green meadows and forests? The museum\u2019s visitation increased sharply during the height of the pandemic, as exploring outdoor art offered a welcome break from fraught indoor contact. But can a museum accommodate increased traffic while also ensuring accessibility \u2013 and protection of its prized landscape? A 2018 study by the cultural consultant Amy Kaufman indicated that Storm King must manage competing interests: a desire to capture an increase in Hudson Valley tourism and preserve ecological integrity on its grounds. Storm King\u2019s leadership decided on a plan that would increase accessibility and biodiversity on the campus, and it recently announced a $45m capital campaign to enable that work. Like many, I knew the Instagram-friendly aesthetics of Storm King, but not its ethos. Beka Sturges, a principal landscape architect at Reed Hilderbrand and member of the design team for the project, told me the museum has long been a pace-setter in progressive museum practices. Could this renovation and its mandate of social and environmental justice be a bellwether? Is it possible that notions of beauty and justice are evolving \u2013 and that museums like Storm King might begin to reflect those values not just on their walls but on their grounds? \u201cWe want to make the museum as inclusive and straightforward as possible,\u201d Sturges told me. \u201cWe want it to feel generous. We want you to feel like you\u2019re welcome \u2013 that you\u2019re supposed to be there.\u201d Ideally, the museum\u2019s generosity extends to the public, but also to the landscape itself and its native species. \u201cIt\u2019s exceptionally rare for landscape to be treated as seriously as art, as it is at Storm King,\u201d Sturges said of the project. She moves fluently between art, literature and ecology as she discusses the land, noting an opportunity for the \u201cforest frame, tender meadows, and maple swamp\u201d to \u201cbecome more than background or a buffer, but an actual protagonist in the foreground of the museum experience\u201d. Sturges hopes that more visitors can \u201cappreciate that they have a relationship to the land\u201d \u2013 one that invites them to care for it. Storm King currently uses controlled burns in the offseason to keep its meadows healthy, and it has replaced trees in its three all\u00e9es, which were planted in the 1960s by William Rutherford, when Storm King was reclaimed from a gravel quarry that supported the construction of the New York Thruway. Now tired, stressed sugar maples will be replaced with native species more adapted to global heating. In the renovation, more than 650 trees will be planted on site for shade and biodiversity purposes. \u201cWe know now that 40% of the world\u2019s plants have become extinct,\u201d Sturges says. \u201cHow do you get people to see plants and all that they give us?\u201d Modifications to Storm King\u2019s landscape will be, in Sturges\u2019 view, a quietly radical way to demonstrate forward-thinking cultural values, and show that equity work can be both beautiful and influential. A tour of the grounds A landscape-driven institution like Storm King isn\u2019t just daunting because of its scale \u2013 which can be difficult for less able-bodied visitors to traverse \u2013 but because, as an artistic entity, it\u2019s viewed by many as an elite space. The architect and disability advocate Josh Safdie told me over a Zoom call that museums are seen by many to possess \u201cunspoken rules\u201d \u2013 intimidating ideas about what one should wear, how one might engage with the art and the community. Safdie, who has consulted for Storm King on disability access for years, believes there are ways to curate space internally and externally to make more people feel welcome. Safdie heads his own mission-driven architecture firm focused on design for disability access. He told me that disabled citizens were the largest minority population in the US. \u201cThere\u2019s capital-A Accessibility \u2013 which is about meeting the legal requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s also lowercase-a accessibility, which is about adjusting norms and unspoken rules so that everyone can feel welcome in a space. Inclusivity is more than just physical accessibility. There\u2019s also cultural accessibility.\u201d Many enter museums fearing hidden costs, dress codes, perceived physical safety, and rules of engagement. Clear guidance about how to move through a museum\u2019s space reduces anxiety about belonging. I asked Safdie why more widespread accessibility to a cultural institution like Storm King matters. \u201cI believe strongly in the power of art to connect people and to be soothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to connect with the natural landscape, community, quietude, and art of unusual scale \u2026 something that is bigger than you.\u201d I visited Storm King on a quintessential fall day. The maples were ablaze on the park\u2019s hills. I felt the usual stress about where to park and how to enter. Storm King hopes its \u201cnew visitor sequence\u201d will eliminate any bewildered feelings: there is one large parking lot, signage, a new welcome center, restrooms, group gathering spaces, and an S-curved path with a navigable slope that takes a visitor right to the first awe-inspiring view of the celebrated Calder arch. I could instantly see the challenge in making a large landscape characterized by rolling hills accessible. Storm King has recently furnished tram rides, and will add a visitor map and elevators, and continue to adjust the grading of pathways. Consolidated parking and a new welcome center will simplify entering the museum. Safdie has encouraged the institution to think of establishing \u201clily pads\u201d \u2013 clear landing points where a visitor can plan a continued route through an experience while getting their needs met, and easily identifying the next point. Jessica Burke, who works with Storm King, drove me around the museum grounds in a cart so that I could orient myself. We began at Maya Lin\u2019s undulating Wavefield, a four-acre installation finished in 2009 that reclaims a former gravel pit on the south-west edge of the property. As we drove, I saw the museum\u2019s all\u00e9es in various stages of growth, lined with pin oaks and black gum trees. A longtime practitioner of environmental repair, the museum has turned other former gravel pits into ponds. The art collection is vast and inimitable. Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s Mermaid, a colorful sailboat that sailed in the 1995 America\u2019s Cup, perches over a dark pond. (Burke shared that the sail went missing after the Cup, and its whereabouts are still a mystery.) We viewed Louise Bourgeois\u2019s bulbous 2001 Eyes, Rashid Johnson\u2019s Stacked Heads, and more works from Calder and Anthony Caro, Mark di Suvero, Louise Nevelson, and others. Some sculptures can be experienced visually, but others are best experienced in a tactile way \u2013 viewed from inside, or with the element of sound and echo. Storm King will keep the physical accessibility of art in mind with future installations. In addition to being more inclusive in the experience of art, the institution aims to be inclusive in its collection and collaborations. Storm King will balance celebrating icons of modernist sculpture like Caro and Calder with supporting transformational opportunities for new artists like Brandon Ndife and the climate-focused Jean Shin. In the heart of the park, I saw a large crane assembling one of Calder\u2019s sculptures, Jerusalem, on a knoll. Given the scale, heft and cost of some of these large works, it struck me how rare it is to have them gathered together and oriented just so for viewers on acres of well-tended land. The size of Calder\u2019s work is awe-inspiring, and seeing it against the colorful maples and green meadows was otherworldly and enchanting. I understood immediately the value of more people experiencing this wonder. Amy Weisser, deputy director of strategic planning and projects at Storm King, joined us and told me over an outdoor tea that the landscape dictates the movement of the eye. Most of Storm King\u2019s buildings are hidden on forest edges so that the focus remains on the art. Weisser refers to the grounds as a \u201csculpted landscape\u201d, where \u201cthe mechanics of visiting are hidden\u201d. We got back into the golf cart to explore another segment of the property. \u201cThe health of the landscape is part of the wonder of being here,\u201d Weisser said, nodding toward the shaded and fragrant north woods. Museums were originally intended as places to share collections of work \u2013 places to contemplate beauty and the wider world, to be in conversation with our higher selves. Perhaps, in 2023, notions of beauty are more aligned with justice \u2013 to other humans, as well as the natural world. Visitors might come to Storm King to experience the awe-inspiring scale of landscape and sculpture, but also to marvel at the environmental health of a meadow supporting thriving insect and bird populations. This model of caretaking and repair is one all institutions \u2013 academic, corporate, artistic \u2013 can follow. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 February 2023 because an earlier version sited Alexander Liberman\u2019s work Olympic Iliad at Storm King. That sculpture resides in Seattle; an earlier Liberman work, Iliad, is at Storm King."

            "title": "Untouchable review: Trump as \u2018lawless Houdini\u2019 above US justice",
            "date": "2023-02-12T07:00:17Z",
            "content": "This book by a former federal prosecutor is subtitled \u201cHow Powerful People Get Away With It\u201d but its overwhelming focus is Donald Trump and Merrick Garland, the most famous unindicted miscreant of modern times and the attorney general most responsible for the failure, so far, to prosecute any of his offences. Elie Honig writes that a \u201cstaggering parade\u201d of Trump\u2019s henchmen have been indicted, convicted, imprisoned or all three: Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Steve Bannon, Peter Navarro, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman, Thomas Barrack, Elliott Broidy, Sam Patten, George Nader, Allen Weisselberg and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 the Trump Organization itself. And yet, somehow, \u201ca lawless Houdini \u2026 stands at the epicenter of the carnage, untouched, undeterred, and, if anything, emboldened\u201d. Honig thinks the district attorney of Fulton county, Georgia, is still \u201cthe most likely to indict Trump\u201d for his efforts to tamper with election results. But Honig makes a powerful case that \u201cthe prime opportunities to hold Trump criminally accountable for his actions have passed\u201d, as federal and state prosecutors, especially Garland, \u201chave fumbled away their best chances and inexcusably allowed years to lapse without meaningful action\u201d. In the last four years, justice department leaders have zigzagged between extremes. First there was the wildly political and persistently dishonest William Barr, whose efforts to keep Trump safe ranged from keeping his name out of the indictment of Cohen for illegal hush money paid to Stormy Daniels, to Barr\u2019s flatly false assertion that evidence developed by the special counsel Robert Mueller was \u201cnot sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense\u201d. Then came Garland, who is the opposite of Barr but who so far has managed to be nearly as helpful to Trump as his predecessor. \u201cThe problem,\u201d Honig writes, \u201cis in seeking to \u2026 restore political independence [for the justice department], Garland has gone too far ... \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do the job without regard to politics. But it\u2019s another to contort ordinary prosecutorial judgement to avoid doing anything that might even be perceived as political or controversial.\u201d Honig prosecuted more than a hundred members of the mafia. He recounts several such cases, highlighting the similarities between the chiefs of famous families like the Luccheses and Gambinos and the man at the top of the Trump Organization. One way in which they operate the same way is to make sure subordinates lie to protect their boss, without being directly ordered to do so. For example, Cohen perjured himself when he said Trump\u2019s efforts to build a tower in Moscow ended before the Iowa caucuses in 2016. They actually continued for months, into the \u201cheart of the presidential campaign\u201d. Honig writes: \u201cTrump never said to Cohen, \u2018I need you to lie for me.\u2019 Instead, Trump openly lied in public about the timing of the Russia deal \u2018for all to see\u2019 \u2013 including Cohen. \u201cTherein lies the beauty of being a boss. Trump never said the magic words that would have obviously given rise to criminal liability.\u201d Honig also focuses on the dubious ethics of the former Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr, who bungled a chance to indict two of Trump\u2019s children over the Trump Soho project, then did the same with an investigation of Trump himself. The lawyer for Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump was Marc Kasowitz. As the New Yorker, ProPublica and WNYC reported, Kasowitz gave Vance a $25,000 campaign contribution in January 2012 \u2013 just five months before meeting with Vance about the Trump kids\u2019 case. Vance returned Kasowitz\u2019s contribution just before his meeting with Kasowitz. Three months after the meeting, Vance dropped the case against the Trumps. Incredibly, just a few weeks after that, \u201cVance accepted a brand new, even larger campaign contribution from Kasowitz, who personally donated almost $32,000 and raised at least $18,000 more.\u201d Five years later \u2013 only after the New Yorker had reported those additional contributions \u2013 Vance returned Kasowitz\u2019s contribution again! \u201cThis much is beyond dispute,\u201d Honig writes. \u201cThe sequence here looked terrible.\u201d But no one comes out looking worse than Garland. Trump was protected while he was in the White House by a decades-old justice department memorandum which concluded it was impossible to indict a sitting president. After 21 January 2021, Trump lost that protection. But for many months, Garland did nothing concrete to take advantage. Honig offers the seven-count indictment he says he would have brought against Trump if he were the prosecutor in charge. It would include: Count 1: obstruction of justice. The Mueller report\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s firing of the FBI director James Comey and his attempts to fire special counsel Mueller provides overwhelming evident that \u201cTrump obstructed justice\u201d. Count 2: campaign finance violations connected to hush money paid to two of Trump\u2019s alleged former girlfriends. Count 3: bribery, extortion, foreign election aid and witness retaliating and tampering, all of which were the subject of Trump\u2019s first impeachment. Count 4: conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding and election interference \u2013 the subject of the second impeachment. Honig\u2019s final conclusion: while \u201cGarland plays by Marquess of Queensbury rules\u201d, Trump is \u201ca remorseless street brawler\u201d. Garland could have brought criminal charges \u201cbut he didn\u2019t, at least not in a timely manner \u2026 As many advantages as the system gave to Trump, and as aggressive and effective as he has been in exploiting them, Garland still could have achieved some measure of justice, if he had just done his job.\u201d This week brought the news that Jack Smith, the special counsel belatedly appointed by Garland to investigate Trump, had subpoenaed Trump\u2019s former vice-president, Mike Pence, as part of his investigation of the former president\u2019s post-election activities. Perhaps the justice department will manage to defy expectations and return an indictment against Donald Trump. This powerful book, however, offers very little hope for that most desirable outcome.

            "date": "2023-02-06T06:56:38Z",
            "content": "Good morning. An astonishingly long article by Liz Truss \u2013 with her first post-premiership interview coming later on Monday - is probably the most immediate irritant for Downing Street today, but once No 10 is done picking the bones out of that, they have another serious problem on their plate that just won\u2019t go away: the future of the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab. Stories about Raab\u2019s alleged bullying of government officials have been rumbling on for months \u2013 and they simply keep coming. After a week of additional allegations, the Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday that an unnamed serving cabinet minister now felt that his position had become untenable. \u201cRaab has got to go,\u201d they said, adding that they had \u201cheard too much\u201d from civil servants claiming \u201cthat he\u2019s an absolute shit\u201d. The allegations \u2013 which are the subject of an inquiry, and are strongly denied by Raab \u2013 are a political nightmare for Rishi Sunak. But they also pose important questions about the line between rigorous management and bullying in a high-pressure environment, and about how seriously the government takes the welfare of the staff working on its behalf. Today\u2019s newsletter, with the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor Jessica Elgot, is a primer on what you need to know. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Turkey earthquake | More than 300 people have been killed in Turkey and Syria, with the toll expected to rise, after one of the most powerful quakes to hit the region in at least a century. Rescue workers and residents frantically searched for survivors trapped under the rubble after the tremor, which was felt in Lebanon and Cyprus. For the latest, follow the live blog here. Strikes | Deadlock over NHS pay is putting patients in danger and risks hardening the position of unions, 10 chief nurses have warned on the eve of the biggest strikes in the health service\u2019s history. Nurses and ambulance staff both strike today and tomorrow before further NHS walkouts on Wednesday and Friday. Police | Hundreds of police officers in the UK should never have been appointed, the head of the police watchdog has said, after his team reviewed hiring practices and found dishonesty on applications from serving officers and undeclared \u201cred flags\u201d. HM inspector of constabulary Matt Parr also said that there was a \u201cculture of misogyny\u201d within the service. UK news | The headteacher of a prestigious private school in Surrey has been found dead alongside her husband and daughter. Emma Pattison, the head of Epsom College, was found at the school along with her husband, George, 39, and seven-year-old Lettie on Sunday morning. Grammy awards | Beyonc\u00e9 has become the most awarded artist in Grammys history, winning four awards on Sunday night to bring her total to 32. Harry Styles won album of the year for Harry\u2019s House and Adele won best pop solo performance for Easy on Me. In depth: Why the Dominic Raab story won\u2019t go away *** What are the allegations against Dominic Raab? The recent spate of stories are not the first time that Dominic Raab has faced questions about his behaviour. In 2018, his former diary secretary Rebecca Tott \u2013 who had recently lost her job over allegations she met men though a \u201csugar daddy\u201d website \u2013 told the Sun he was a \u201cbully\u201d who reduced colleagues to tears. Raab called those claims \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d and \u201can attempt to cash in\u201d. But the new allegations, which began to emerge after his reappointment as justice secretary when Rishi Sunak became prime minister, \u201care very different, partly because there are so many of them,\u201d said Jessica Elgot, who somehow found time to speak despite also fitting in the endurance test of that 4,000 word Liz Truss essay. In November, the Guardian\u2019s Pippa Crerar reported that senior civil servants in the justice department had been offered \u201crespite or a route out\u201d over claims that Raab was \u201cdemeaning rather than demanding\u201d and \u201ca bully\u201d. Then the Sun came out with the memorable \u2013 if contested \u2013 claim that he threw tomatoes from his Pret salad around \u201cin a fit of rage\u201d. The next day, the Observer reported sources saying that concerns over his behaviour had also been raised during his time as Brexit secretary. Rishi Sunak said he didn\u2019t \u201crecognise that characterisation of Dominic\u201d, and added: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any formal complaints about him.\u201d (Keep that word \u201cformal\u201d in the front of your mind.) Within a few days, Sunak had appointed an independent investigator after Raab wrote to him saying he had \u201cjust been notified that two separate complaints have formally been made against me\u201d. If the intention was to put the story in the deep freeze, it hasn\u2019t worked. Complaints kept coming, and in January, sources put the number of civil servants involved in formal complaints at 24. That figure that has since risen. *** What do we know about the alleged victims\u2019 stories? The inquiry is reported to have heard that some of the staff working under Raab had to be signed off sick, and that some were even suicidal. And while most people working in government understand that a stressful environment is inevitable, the Raab allegations appear to go beyond that, Jessica said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard in general to find people who say how terrible their minister is,\u201d she said. \u201cYou usually hear quite complimentary things. The complaints allege that with Raab, it wasn\u2019t just about making the work better, it was a kind of powerplay that undermined people.\u201d One of the complaints, which the Observer revealed yesterday represents the concerns of 27 Ministry of Justice officials, claims that staff felt under such pressure that some \u201chave visited their GPs, and some have subsequently been signed off work for extended periods of time.\u201d Last week, the Mirror published anonymous accounts of staffers losing weight, having breakdowns, and feeling like they were in a \u201ccontrolling and abusive relationship\u201d. Saturday\u2019s Times (\u00a3) carried a raft of further anonymous accounts, with some saying that Raab relished \u201cthe imbalance of power\u201d with younger staffers. One of the reporters behind that story, Henry Zeffman, said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the nature of the stories and their sheer number \u2013 \u201clots we couldn\u2019t include because of space limitations,\u201d he said on Twitter. *** What do Raab\u2019s defenders say? They tend to view the allegations as an eyeroll-inducing overstatement of behaviour that might be robust, but does not reach the level of bullying. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested that the claims might be \u201csnowflakey\u201d. Lord Lister, formerly Boris Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, said that Raab was \u201cnot an easy man\u201d but that he had never seen him be a bully, and added: \u201cI\u2019m of an age where you used to express yourself completely, whatever you thought.\u201d Yesterday, transport secretary Grant Shapps told GB News that \u201cfrom personal experience I\u2019ve only ever seen him being very polite\u201d and characterised him as someone \u201cvery determined \u2026 who knows what he wants to get out of the system.\u201d Raab, for his part, has strenuously denied the claims, and said via a spokesman that he simply \u201csets targets \u2026 to focus relentlessly on delivery\u201d. \u201cSome people who know him are outraged on his behalf,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cAnd there are plenty of Tories who see him as the victim of attacks by politically motivated civil servants.\u201d *** What does it mean for Sunak? Let\u2019s go back to that word \u201cformal\u201d. One of the reasons the story kicked up a gear last week, prompting suggestions that Raab\u2019s position now appeared seriously under threat, was the question of exactly what Sunak knew when he appointed him \u2013 and whether he had information that fell short of knowledge of \u201cformal complaints\u201d. On Wednesday, the Times reported that officials had highlighted \u201cissues\u201d with Raab (\u00a3) in his ministerial roles. At PMQs, Labour leader Keir Starmer asked Sunak: \u201cIs he saying his officials hid this information from him, or was he just too incurious to ask any questions?\u201d No 10 was repeatedly asked what Sunak knew after that, but stuck to the line that he \u201cwas not aware of any formal complaints\u201d. Make of that what you will. The politics of the affair are extremely difficult for Sunak, who would be loath to lose another minister so soon after the firing of Nadhim Zahawi, and must balance maintaining his authority with his promise of \u201cintegrity and accountability\u201d when he took office. And, Jessica said, he has a longstanding relationship with Raab \u2013 indeed, she pointed out, he was quoted defending his colleague when that 2018 story from the former diary secretary emerged. \u201cRaab really put his neck on the line for him during the leadership race with Truss,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went out and was very critical and he knew that could cost him a place in a Truss cabinet. Sunak owed literally nothing to Zahawi \u2013 he backed Truss, then he wrote an article calling for \u2018Boris 2.0\u2019. This is different.\u201d *** What happens next? There have been suggestions \u2013 strongly denied by Raab \u2013 that he could resign before the inquiry concludes; Sunak appears likely to await the report before making a decision, and the number of complaints suggest that it could be some time before it is resolved. \u201cOne of the big problems for Raab is the fact that Sunak has said that he will do things very differently,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really direct comparison with the Priti Patel case\u201d \u2013 where Boris Johnson\u2019s ethics adviser resigned because the prime minister overruled his finding that Patel had broken the ministerial code with \u201cbehaviour that can be described as bullying\u201d. Partly because of that unfortunate precedent, many Conservatives are sceptical about Raab\u2019s long-term prospects. Jessica added: \u201cEvery MP you speak to privately says that they believe that he\u2019s toast.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading After Sunday night\u2019s last ever episode of Happy Valley (above), Lucy Mangan gives it a five star review, calling it (tonal spoiler here, I guess?) \u201cbrutal, tender, funny, compelling and heartbreaking to the last\u201d.

His mental health was deteriorating as he grappled with acclimating back to normal life, as well as dealing with single parenthood and financial worries. It was only when his daughter decided to leave home at the age of 16 that he had an epiphany \u2013 and walked around the entire coastline of the UK to figure himself out. Over the last five years, Lewis\u2019s life has transformed. While the initial experiences were gruelling, he found that his foraging skills improved and, crucially, that he could rely on the generosity of strangers to help him along the way. Lewis has racked up 112,000 followers on Facebook and raised more than \u00a3277,000 for SSAFA, an armed forces charity that supported him during his hardships. He met his wife on his journey in 2020, with whom he now has a son, and, with their dog, they have become a solid support for Lewis. Perhaps most importantly, making this life-changing leap has profoundly changed the way Lewis sees himself in the world: \u201cWe have a very small possibility of living a life on this planet and you\u2019ve just got to bloody make the most of it.

            "date": "2023-02-06T06:00:15Z",
            "content": "The Rev Al Sharpton has warned that racially charged incidents such as the brutal death of Tyre Nichols in the US will also occur in the UK without far-reaching police reforms. On the eve of a two-day visit to the UK, the US civil rights veteran said that \u201csystemic racism\u201d and a \u201cculture of policing that produces brutality\u201d must be addressed. Nichols, a 29-year-old father and black man, died in hospital three days after being pulled over and beaten by police officers in Memphis on 7 January. Sharpton, the president of the National Action Network, who last week delivered the eulogy at Nichols\u2019 funeral, called for reforms of UK policing. \u201cThe failure to address systemic racism in UK policing and the culture of policing that produces brutality against our people will only lead to more incidences like the tragedy of Tyre Nichols,\u201d he said in a statement. His comments contrast with Suella Braverman, the home secretary, who in September said that \u201cinitiatives on diversity and inclusion should not take precedence over common-sense policing\u201d. A damning UN report last month found that the government has failed to address \u201cstructural, institutional and systemic racism\u201d against people of African descent in Britain. \u201cWe have serious concerns about impunity and the failure to address racial disparities in the criminal justice system, deaths in police custody, \u2018joint enterprise\u2019 convictions and the dehumanising nature of the stop and (strip) search,\u201d the UN working group said in a statement. Sharpton will expand on his comments on Monday when he begins his UK visit. He is expected to address Nichols\u2019 death and the parallels of allegations against the police in the UK. It follows demands for justice from the families of Chris Kaba, who was shot in the head in Streatham, south London, after a car pursuit in September, and Oladeji Omishore, who died after being after being shot with a Taser weapon on Chelsea Bridge and then being pulled from the River Thames. The IOPC is conducting a criminal investigation into the officer who discharged their firearm which led to Kaba\u2019s death. The IOPC is also conducting an investigation into Omishore\u2019s death but do not consider that a more thorough conduct investigation is required. Sharpton will also raise police searches of black children after the outcry over Child Q, the 15-year-old girl who was strip-searched at school by female police officers while on her period. Nichols, who had been pulled over after an alleged minor traffic violation, was pepper-sprayed, stunned with a Taser and beaten by five black officers who took turns to hold him up for others to attack him. Footage of the incident was released on 27 January and led to unrest across several US cities. Sharpton, who has been at the forefront of the US civil rights movement since 1991, used Nichols\u2019 funeral to condemn the officers for being a \u201cdisgrace to their race\u201d before adding that the officers would not have attacked a white man in the same way. \u201cYou know you couldn\u2019t get away with doing that in Tennessee to a white guy. You\u2019ll find out you ain\u2019t getting away with it doing it to a black guy,\u201d he said. Sharpton, who is attending an event by Operation Black Vote on Monday, is also expected to address electoral rights in the UK amid fears that new laws requiring photo ID at polling stations will disfranchise black and Asian voters. Lord Simon Woolley, the founder of OBV and a mentee of Sharpton, said: \u201cThe Revd Al Sharpton is coming to the UK at a critical time when simply acknowledging systemic race inequality is proving difficult.\u201d"

            "title": "Scottish leadership election leaves gender reform hanging in balance",
            "date": "2023-02-16T19:20:14Z",
            "content": "The future of transgender rights in Scotland remains in limbo, as SNP politicians warn that a leadership contest must not become dominated by ongoing rows on gender recognition reform. Meanwhile, Scottish Greens sources suggest that any rowback on reform could lead to the collapse of the party\u2019s power-sharing agreement with the SNP. A key challenge for whoever replaces Nicola Sturgeon is whether to continue with her plan to challenge the UK government\u2019s decision to block Holyrood\u2019s gender bill through the courts. Scottish government sources confirmed on Thursday that ministers were still taking legal advice on the prospect of challenging the section 35 order that was announced by the UK government in January, which prevents the bill from going for royal assent. They said a decision was unlikely to be reached until much closer to the 16 April deadline. On Thursday evening, the SNP\u2019s national executive committee confirmed that the results of its leadership contest would be announced on 27 March, giving the new leader just over three weeks to decide. A number of SNP politicians, both supportive of and opposed to the bill, raised concerns that the leadership election could become mired in the increasingly toxic debate that has dogged the party for several years, leaving voters unclear whether the party shares their priorities. One MP said: \u201cPeople on the doorstep are not talking to me about GRR [gender recognition reform] but about the cost of living crisis. \u201cThe leadership contest shouldn\u2019t become all about the bill. The contest must concentrate on what to do to unify the party and lead us to independence.\u201d While Sturgeon was an unapologetic defender of the legislation, which would simplify how an individual may legally change their gender, Scottish equalities campaigners have raised concerns that a new leader less committed to reform \u2013 as at least one potential contender is known to be \u2013 might offer concessions to the UK government rather than formally challenge section 35. Another SNP MSP who was closely involved in the bill\u2019s progress through Holyrood said that while they expected at least one candidate to emerge who was opposed to the reforms, they would be surprised if the new leader did not continue with the legal challenge. \u201cThis is about much more than gender reform, it\u2019s about whether the Scottish parliament can pass its own legislation. I\u2019d be surprised if a nationalist leader didn\u2019t challenge that, and I\u2019m much more concerned about winning that challenge,\u201d they said. A Scottish Green party source said the party\u2019s joint leaders, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, would almost certainly resign from their ministerial posts if the new SNP leader either delayed or rewrote the gender recognition bill. That would lead to the collapse of the formal cooperation deal brokered by Sturgeon and Harvie in 2021, which led to the SNP sharing power for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s a red line for the party,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no compromise on this.\u201d Sturgeon\u2019s successor would almost certainly see that threat as another significant argument in favour of fighting to keep the bill on track. \u201cI think they would walk if a new SNP leader didn\u2019t do everything in their power to get that bill on to the statute book,\u201d the source said. He also suggested that if the government watered down or dropped the bill, SNP MSPs would revolt in far greater numbers than the nine SNP backbenchers who voted against it. Senior SNP sources suggest the successful leadership candidate must offer a robust defence of the bill itself but also open up dialogue, while shifting focus to other pressing domestic concerns such as heating and healthcare. The SNP MP Joanna Cherry, a vocal critic of the changes, tweeted immediately after Sturgeon\u2019s resignation announcement that a leadership contest must \u201crestore the SNP\u2019s tradition of internal party democracy, open respectful debate and intellectual rigour\u201d."

            "title": "Calls for radical reform of gun laws after Plymouth shooting",
            "date": "2023-02-20T19:14:44Z",
            "content": "Senior police officers, families of shooting victims and anti-gun campaigners have called for a \u201cradical reform\u201d of the firearms licensing system after an inquest jury found \u201ccatastrophic\u201d failings allowed the Plymouth gunman, Jake Davison, to legally possess a shotgun that he used to kill five people. Pressure is mounting on the UK government to overhaul the 50-year-old licensing legislation and ensure police forces are adequately funded to allow them to fully examine the suitability of gun owners. Speaking after the inquest, relatives of his victims described the actions of Davison, who was fascinated with \u201cincel\u201d culture, previous mass shootings and serial murderers, as \u201cpure evil\u201d but said he had been given a \u201clicence to kill\u201d by Devon and Cornwall police. They also argued that the home secretary, Suella Braverman, would be \u201cbetraying\u201d them if she did not change the system. They said: \u201cThere needs to be radical reform. That means fewer guns in circulation with robust safeguards.\u201d It has emerged that senior officers believe there are still \u201cmany\u201d firearms in the hands of people who should not have them, despite the former home secretary Priti Patel ordering them to look again at cases where they returned firearms to people after confiscation. Only two forces, one of them Devon and Cornwall, removed guns from owners after re-examining cases. A senior Devon and Cornwall officer, Ch Supt Roy Linden, accepted this meant there were \u201cmany guns\u201d in the hands of people who should not have them. Debbie Tedds, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead on firearms licensing, said she was \u201creally concerned\u201d about this. Alarm bells have also been rung because the number of shotgun certificate applications Devon and Cornwall are rejecting has doubled since the Plymouth shootings but the rate in the rest of England and Wales has remained at just 3%, suggesting some forces may still be looking too leniently on applications. The new chief constable of Devon and Cornwall, Will Kerr, who came into the post the year after Davison\u2019s attacks, is among those calling for fundamental change. He said the firearms legislation, introduced in 1968, was \u201cno longer suitable\u201d, arguing that the emphasis was on \u201cpermitting rather than preventing gun ownership\u201d. He said: \u201cCurrently we are faced with 43 police forces independently interpreting discretionary guidance from a law created in 1968.\u201d Tedds agreed that the legislation needed to be overhauled to make the licensing regime for shotguns as strict as for section one firearms, such as rifles. On 12 August 2021, Davison, 22, killed his mother, Maxine, 51; three-year-old Sophie Martyn; her father, Lee, 43; Stephen Washington, 59; and Kate Shepherd, 66, in Keyham, Plymouth, before turning his weapon on himself. The inquest jury said \u201ccatastrophic failures\u201d within Devon and Cornwall\u2019s firearms licensing unit led to an \u201cunsafe culture\u201d and the force had failed to protect the victims and the wider public. Kerr and Tedds agreed with the Plymouth families and the jury that a national accredited training scheme for firearms enquiry officers (FEOs) was needed. There have been calls for such a scheme since the Dunblane tragedy more than 25 years ago, with inspectors, coroners and campaigners all warning that lives will continue to be lost until one is brought in. A curriculum has been drawn up and a delivery plan is being worked on but there is still no start date. The Home Office will also come under pressure to increase the cost of firearms certificates. At the moment it only costs \u00a379.50 for a shotgun certificate and \u00a388 for a section one firearm, but it costs up to \u00a3520 to process each certificate. A concern raised during the shootings inquest was that this was leading to forces being under pressure and cutting corners. Yet another worry is that there may still be flaws in the way police and GPs work together to make sure FEOs can find out about medical issues, such as mental health problems, that applicants may have. After the Plymouth shootings, the government brought in new statutory guidance, meaning nobody will be granted a firearms licence unless the police have reviewed information from a doctor. A computer marker system designed to flag up issues has been brought in but the British Medical Association says it will be five years before this is working fully. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has issued a series of recommendations to Devon and Cornwall police and the Home Office to strengthen licensing controls. A Devon and Cornwall firearms licensing supervisor has received a written warning over the Davison case. The IOPC also found that a firearms enquiry officer would have had a case to answer for misconduct, had they not left the police. The jury made no mention of links between Davison and incel culture. But in its report on the shootings, the IOPC highlighted that in April 2021 Davison made a video in which he appeared to identify with incel spree killers. It added: \u201cIt is possible that Mr Davison may have started planning the shooting during his final days, as he searched online for information about anti-terror policing in the UK, incel serial killers, and instructions on reloading firearms.\u201d The Plymouth jury\u2019s conclusions follow the deaths this month of Epsom College\u2019s headteacher, Emma Pattison, her husband, George, and their seven-year-old daughter, Lettie. Detectives are examining the possibility that George Pattison killed his wife and daughter and then himself with a legally held firearm. Chrissie Hall, the coordinator of the Gun Control Network, set up after Dunblane, said the licensing system was \u201cbroken, inadequate and dangerous\u201d. She said: \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a multiple shooting, there\u2019s an inquest and the mayhem and chaos within firearms departments is laid bare.\u201d Sue Redman, a trustee of a foundation set up in memory of her best friend, Kelly Fitzgibbons, who was shot dead by her partner alongside her daughters Ava, four, and Lexi, two, in 2020, said: \u201cThe whole licensing process seems to be geared up to the idea that people have the right to have a shotgun, not that it is a privilege. More training and more resources are needed.\u201d Peter Squires, a professor of criminology and public policy at the University of Brighton, said the Plymouth and Epsom shootings showed the dangers posed by firearms and supplies of ammunition kept by private citizens in family homes. \u201cThe system is not fit for purpose,\u201d he said. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation described the licensing system as \u201clargely unprofessional, overburdened and poorly resourced\u201d and said it was putting public safety at risk. \u201cIt is invariably considered a Cinderella service,\u201d said a spokesperson. The Home Office said it would \u201creflect on the coroner\u2019s report, including any recommendations, and respond in due course\u201d."

            "title": "Ohio train derailment reveals need for urgent reform, workers say",
            "date": "2023-02-20T09:00:32Z",
            "content": "US railroad workers say the train derailment in Ohio, which forced thousands of residents to evacuate and is now spreading a noxious plume of carcinogenic chemicals across the area, should be an \u201ceye-opening\u201d revelation for Congress and \u201can illustration of how the railroads operate, and how they\u2019re getting away with a lot of things\u201d. Workers and union officials cited the Norfolk Southern Railway derailment in early February as a glaring example of why safety reforms to the industry \u2013 which include providing workers with paid sick leave \u2013 need to be made. Thirty-eight cars on the train derailed in the town of East Palestine, near the Pennsylvania border, including 11 cars carrying hazardous materials that incited an evacuation order, a controlled release of chemicals, and fears of harmful chemical exposure to residents, wildlife and waterways. Unions and rail companies have been at loggerheads for years over new contracts that would address what workers describe as poor working conditions, and would provide paid sick days amid grueling schedules caused by labor cuts. \u201cWithout a change in the working conditions, without better scheduling, without more time off, without a better work-life balance, the railroad is going to suffer,\u201d said Ron Kaminkow, the general secretary of Railroad Workers United, an Amtrak engineer in Reno, Nevada, and the vice-president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (Blet) local 51. \u201cIt\u2019s just intrinsic, with short staffing. Corners get cut and safety is compromised.\u201d Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO\u2019s transportation trades department, said the loss of workers in recent years, which has coincided with record profits for railroad corporations, was the driving force for deteriorating conditions on US railroads. The railroad industry workforce plummeted from over 1 million workers in the 1950s to fewer than 150,000 in 2022, with a loss of 40,000 railroad jobs between November 2018 and December 2020. The six major railroad corporations that have yet to agree to provide workers with paid sick days reported over $22bn in profits, and spent more than $20bn on stock buybacks and shareholder dividends last year. Regan said the derailment in Ohio was an example of why these working-condition issues need to be addressed. \u201cIt increases a lot of risk in what is a very dangerous industry. When things go wrong there can be very tragic consequences,\u201d added Regan. The corporations are also opposing reforms to implement mandatory participation to an anonymous close-call reporting system so workers can report safety concerns without fear of reprisal and identify problems before they result in accidents, said Leo McCann, chair of the rail labor division of transportation trades department. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an eye-opener,\u201d McCann said of the Ohio derailment. \u201cIt\u2019s an illustration of how the railroads operate and how they\u2019re getting away with a lot of things.\u201d Workers criticized the decision by Congress and the Biden administration to impose a tentative new contract agreement on all railroad unions, despite more than half of represented members voting to reject it due to the lack of paid sick days. The majority of workers in precision railroad scheduling systems \u2013 operational systems focused on cutting costs \u2013 currently have no paid sick days and face attendance points for taking time off, which could result in termination. Workers have complained that disciplinary attendance systems, coupled with drastic staffing cuts, have diminished morale, incentivized workers to continue working through illness or fatigue and increased safety risks. On 2 February, all 12 railroad unions issued a resolution demanding paid sick days for railroad workers. Bernie Sanders and Republican senator Mike Braun held a press conference with union representatives on 9 February to add further pressure to corporations to provide workers with at least seven paid sick days. The renewed push comes shortly after CSX Transportation announced it came to an agreement with two unions representing 5,000 railroad workers to provide four days of paid sick leave to all workers and allow workers to use up to three personal leave days for sick leave. \u201cThe next step is to make sure we bring other railroads to the table and hopefully get a resolution,\u201d said Regan. \u201cThis is the worst relationship that has been between the railroads and their workers in my career.\u201d He said the tension had been exacerbated by the rail companies\u2019 determination to increase profits by cutting staff. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going to treat your employees that way, to continue to try to squeeze as many pennies out of each individual worker as you possibly can, without any regard for their wellbeing, you\u2019re going to have really contentious bargaining sessions like we had last year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe railroad companies do not want to actually participate. They\u2019re just anti-regulatory in their mind, but that\u2019s not the case here: it\u2019s about safety, and to ensure workers can go home to their families at night and not have a tragedy happen to them,\u201d added McCann. \u201cThe railroads are more interested in profitability and keeping their return on investment up and their numbers down so they can satisfy Wall Street, and they just live behind this shield hoping nothing will happen.\u201d"

If nothing else, his documentary makes a persuasive and powerful case against climate crisis fatigue: the helpless feeling that whatever you can do as an individual is too little, too late; and besides what\u2019s the point when it\u2019s fossil fuel companies driving the crisis? In County Durham, he joins locals who have been fighting off plans for a new open-cast coal mine in the gorgeous countryside of the Pont Valley for decades. He arrives as they mount a last-ditch battle, occupying the valley in a makeshift camp. The mining company needs to build an access road before its licence expires. The clock is ticking. Meanwhile, over in western Germany, Felgate visits one of Europe\u2019s biggest opencast mines in the ancient Hambach forest. Campaigners have built a community of tree houses to protect the remaining 10% of trees (being high up makes it harder for police to evict them). It\u2019s genuinely shocking seeing the results of open-cast mining, which involves digging up the earth\u2019s surface to reach relatively shallow seams of coal. The landscape is left apocalyptically barren, dead-looking. Back in County Durham, there\u2019s jubilation at the discovery of an endangered crested newt, which is protected by law. That should put a stop to the mine. Not so fast, says a seasoned activist, jaded by experience: \u201cThe legal system privileges those who can pay for expensive lawyers.\u201d I hope it\u2019s not a spoiler to say that the film ends happily all round; though still, there\u2019s a gnawing sense of hopelessness. Here\u2019s one German protester, who\u2019s lived in the trees for six years: \u201cI continue to do it not because I have any hope but because I think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d \u2022 Finite: The Climate of Change is released on 15 February in cinemas."

            "content": "Could celery help fight climate change? Peatlands in lowland Britain have been drained for agriculture and releasing carbon for years, but paludiculture, or wet farming, aims to rewet drained peatland and grow crops that can tolerate high water levels. In Greater Manchester, the local wildlife trust is growing celery on bogland that was drained for farming, leaving a small relic of old peat below the surface. The drains and ditches of the old field were blocked up, the water table allowed to rise 10cm to 50cm below the surface, preventing the peat releasing its carbon, while celery has been planted \u2013 a crop that tolerates wet conditions. In the Fens, cattail bulrushes are being grown in rewetted old peat, then harvested and processed as fireproof insulation for housing, biodegradable food packaging, and as compost for commercial growers. The plants also clean up excess nutrients from the water they grow in and help store water. At the Great Fen in Cambridgeshire, a paludiculture trial is growing sphagnum moss. This is highly absorbent and naturally antiseptic, and was used as bandages in the first world war. The top of the moss can even be turned into a substitute for peat compost for growing seedlings."

            "date": "2023-02-08T23:00:07Z",
            "content": "We have an early contender for the least surprising newsflash of the year: fossil fuel companies will not, of their own volition, save us from climate breakdown. The oil and gas multinational BP revealed on Tuesday that it set a record annual profit last year, reaching a staggering US$27.7bn thanks to Vladimir Putin\u2019s murderous ego pushing global fossil fuel prices into the stratosphere. It more than doubled its 2021 profit. The company that once rebranded itself as \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d celebrated this news by announcing it would scale back its climate change plans. It had expected its carbon dioxide emissions would fall by 35% to 40% by 2030 compared with 2019. The chief executive, Bernard Looney, says it has now scaled that back to a 20% to 30% reduction. Put another way, BP has increased the forecast of how much oil and gas it will be producing in 2030 by 2m barrels a day. Profit is there to be had, and it says it would be ignoring its responsibility to its millions of shareholders not to grab it. BP is not alone in reaping the benefits of war in eastern Europe. Earlier this week Shell posted a profit of US$40bn, about a third higher than its previous record. ExxonMobil and Chevron have also set company records for windfall gains. In Australia Woodside Energy has dramatically expanded its fossil fuel plans and emissions footprint after taking over BHP\u2019s global petroleum development portfolio. Its oil and gas production last year was higher than forecast and 40% more than in 2021, setting up a company-record $US5.3bn profit. It aims to increase output by at least another 15% this year and continues work on a major gas export expansion in northern Western Australia that could extend production on the Burrup peninsula until 2070. Santos had a more difficult year \u2013 traditional owners in the Tiwi Islands won a landmark legal case against the company to stop drilling for its A$6.1bn Barossa gas project \u2013 but still managed a 65% increase in revenue. It plans other new developments, including a long-promised gas field at Narrabri, where work on a pipeline is under way. Despite some claims that mostly ignore the case for cutting emissions, whether it is needed to meet future local demand remains in dispute. Like most of their international competitors, Woodside and Santos argue their fossil fuel expansion can be consistent with the science-based goal set at the landmark 2015 Paris climate conference of trying to keep global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Evidence and logic tell a different story. Woodside has set a voluntary target of cutting its direct pollution \u2013 known as scope 1 emissions \u2013 by 30% by 2030, compared with the average across recent high production years. Despite the company\u2019s claims, it is significantly less than what scientists say is required from emitters in wealthy countries on the way to net zero by 2050. It is unclear just how much the company plans to actually reduce emissions from its extraction sites and processing facilities. It says it is taking steps in this direction, but Woodside\u2019s chief executive, Meg O\u2019Neill, also last year said it had invested so heavily in carbon offsets that it had already nearly paid for enough emissions cuts elsewhere to meet its 2030 goal. There are a few points to make on all this from organisations that have looked at the global numbers. The International Energy Agency made plain nearly two years ago that no new oil and gas fields should be opened if the world were to have a chance of keeping 1.5C in play. And an expert group set up by the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to advise on greenwashing of net zero claims said the need to act was so great that companies should prioritise making deep cuts in absolute emissions in line with the 1.5C target by 2030, with high-quality offsets to be reserved only for cuts above and beyond that. It should be noted there remain significant doubts over which offsets qualify as high quality. Guterres laid out his view on the implications for the fossil fuel industry in his trademark blunt fashion in a speech in New York this week in which he set out his priorities for the year. \u201cI have a special message for fossil fuel producers and their enablers scrambling to expand production and raking in monster profits,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you cannot set a credible course for net zero, with 2025 and 2030 targets covering all your operations, you should not be in business. Your core product is our core problem. We need a renewables revolution not a self-destructive fossil fuel resurgence.\u201d These are fighting words, chosen to grab maximum attention. Guterres has said similar things before. The message back from the fossil fuel industry remains that, for all the changes some have made to claim they are part of a cleaner future, they don\u2019t really buy it. The reason for this seems pretty straightforward. The fallout when they fail to act, though growing, remains smaller than the rewards for pumping out more pollution. Their actions, and those of the governments and business leaders that support them, undermine the shift that is happening elsewhere as the price of solar continues to fall and other solutions become more viable. Which bring us to the debate over the safeguard mechanism, the Coalition\u2019s failed emissions trading scheme in all but name that will come before parliament for a revamp over the next few weeks. There will be plenty of important technical debates over its design and no shortage of political noise. But its success will ultimately come down to a couple of simple tests. Will it drive an efficient shift away from fossil fuels, rather than prop them up? And will it help the other industries it is applied to \u2013 including steelworks, aluminium smelters, other manufacturing and non-fossil fuel mining \u2013 change practice and survive in a low- or zero-emissions world? Because anything else would be a waste of time."

            "content": "Blooming daffodils in New York City. Leaves sprouting from red maples in North Carolina. Cherry blossoms about to bud in Washington. Record winter warmth across much of the eastern US has caused spring-like conditions to arrive earlier than ever previously recorded in several places, provoking delight over the mild weather and despair over the unfolding climate crisis. In New York, one of several US cities to experience its warmest January on record, spring conditions have arrived 32 days before the long-term normal, which is its earliest onset of biological spring in 40 years of charting seasonal trends by the National Phenology Network. Spring activity has, meanwhile, arrived at least 20 days earlier than usual for huge swathes of the US south-east and east, with parts of central Texas, south-east Arkansas, southern Ohio and Maryland, along with New York, all recording their earliest spring conditions on record so far this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unsettling, it\u2019s certainly something that is out of the bounds of when we\u2019d normally expect spring,\u201d said Teresa Crimmins, director of the National Phenology Network and an environmental scientist at the University of Arizona. \u201cIt perhaps isn\u2019t surprising, given the trajectory our planet is on, but it is surprising when you live through it.\u201d Winter has barely registered for millions of people in the US north-east, with states across the New England region all experiencing their warmest January in the 155-year national record. New York City, which experienced more lightning strikes than snowfall in a balmy month, notched an average temperature 10F higher than the long-term average. The Great Lakes, meanwhile, have had a record-low amount of ice coverage during their usual February peak. The procession of warm days has coaxed flowers from plants, with thousands of citizen observers reporting early budding in numerous locations to the National Phenology Network, a coalition of academics, government agencies and volunteers. Volunteers on the ground have noted instances of blooming over the past 15 years, while the longer 40-year record comes from a model of spring-like conditions devised by the network. This year, blooms have already been emerging from common lilacs in Pennsylvania, eastern redbuds in Virginia, tulip trees and red maples in North Carolina, and daffodils and violets in New York City, observers have told the network. Perhaps the most famous symbol of spring in the US, the cherry blossoms found in the heart of Washington DC, have started to bud, too, and could break a three-decade record for early blossoming, according to the National Park Service. The warm winter, and the galloping arrival of spring-like weather, is part of a longer-term trend of milder winters and scrambled seasons due to the heating of the planet caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Crimmins said her network of observers have voiced \u201csurprise, concern and anxiety\u201d over another early spring, which follows a string of similar early onsets over the past decade or so. \u201cThis year the US has clearly been chopped in half and the eastern half is so much further ahead of schedule in terms of spring,\u201d she said. \u201cAlmost everyone I speak to about this has this existential anxiety that we are seeing climate change playing out in real time.\u201d While many people may celebrate a winter without the need for heavy coats or wariness over slippery ice and snow, the rapid arrival of spring conditions has a host of negative ramifications, scientists say. Pollen pumped out by prematurely unfurling plants can trigger earlier seasonal allergies and parasites such as ticks, some able to spread afflictions such as Lyme disease, are able to spread and establish themselves at a time when temperatures should be too cold for them to thrive. More fundamentally, the shifting seasons risk severing a whole series of relationships essential to the natural order. Insects may miss feeding upon early-blooming plants, while migrating birds, which decide to start their seasonal journeys by the length of the day, may find a dearth of food for them when they arrive. The plants, meanwhile, risk being killed off by frosts that can arrive after they\u2019ve blossomed. This situation poses a threat to the food system, which is reliant upon insect pollination, and gives an edge to certain invasive species of plant that thrive in the warmer conditions, according to Dr Deborah Landau, director of ecological management at the Nature Conservancy. \u201cI\u2019m seeing the trends I rely upon, the calendar I have trusted to see rare plants in bloom, just completely disappear,\u201d said Landau, who has been charting plant and animal behavior for the past 22 years. \u201cEverything has been thrown out of whack, species that have evolved together for millennia are now off-kilter. There is this cascading effect on everything that is more than just a missed cherry blossom season.\u201d Landau said that people will start to see the true costs of early springs through higher prices for certain pollinator-dependent foods and the spread of tick-borne diseases, even if the consequences of this are still not apparent to most. \u201cI\u2019m seeing things green up and bud early and the weather reports just say \u2018lucky you, what another lovely warm day,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI just groan because I know the pollinators won\u2019t have anything to eat. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d"

I went out on to mum\u2019s front deck. What I saw and heard will stay with me for ever. A lake was encroaching, steadily moving up the road. Above the roar of the rain and helicopters buzzing, I could hear children screaming and voices crying: \u201cHelp! Help!\u201d My daughter appeared next to me. \u201cWhat\u2019s that noise, Mummy?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy are those children screaming? Will someone help them?\u201d This wasn\u2019t a moment I expected to have, living in this country. I wasn\u2019t ready. I decided to evacuate us again. We drove up the hill and saw boats launching where we ride bikes on Sunday. A steady stream of tinnies on trailers were coming down the hill. As soon as we were safe, I went online and saw my friends asking to be saved. Some were saying goodbye, like they thought they were going to die. My brain was still confused. I knew I\u2019d lost my house and everything in it. I remember thinking it would be OK \u2013 that we\u2019d all be looked after, that surely there was a flood unit somewhere that was being deployed. It didn\u2019t happen. The government was just as unprepared as we were. Climate change is supposed to happen somewhere else, to other people in other countries \u2013 to someone else\u2019s children. It isn\u2019t supposed to end up in my house, in my town. We\u2019ve been hearing about it \u2013 warned about it \u2013 for years, but it was always something in the future, happening somewhere else. Now it\u2019s here, in Australia, and we need to do something about it. People ask me all the time \u201cwhat I want to see happen\u201d, like being a survivor of an extreme weather event has made me an expert on the topic. What I want is to see more people taking action on climate change more seriously. I joined Australian Parents for Climate Action because I wanted to do something \u2013 not wait for everyone else to fix the problem. Now I want to see politicians from all parties doing the same \u2013 working together to fix the problem. According to the CSIRO\u2019S latest State of the Climate report, these extreme weather events are going to become more frequent and intense; we need to keep our communities safe. Coal and gas giants make billions of dollars profit every year as they pump greenhouse gas emissions into our environment threatening our future and destroying our environment. Our climate is changing fast, and for the worse. I want this to stop for the sake of my daughter\u2019s future. When I went home for the first time after the flood had receded, everything was brown, slimy and wet. Everything stank of sewage, inside and outside. I remember kneeling in my daughter\u2019s room and crying over books. Books I\u2019d read when I was a little girl that I\u2019d lovingly kept for my child. Books I\u2019d read 1,000 times. Books that used to smell like books. Over the next 12 months we threw everything we\u2019d ever owned on to a huge stinky pile outside our house. We ripped down walls, we laughed and cried. Everyone got gastro constantly. But we were the lucky ones, we had insurance and a place to live. Many of my neighbours 12 months on still don\u2019t have walls; they don\u2019t have flushing toilets. Some are still living in caravans in their driveways. I feel like Australia has forgotten them. I\u2019ve never raised my child to be fearful of climate change. She doesn\u2019t even know what it means. I did this to give her a few more years of innocence, but even with my careful planning for her mental health, climate change came to us. It broke down our doors and windows and delivered a rain of shit on to everything we loved. I don\u2019t want this to be her future, or the future for any child. There are solutions, Australia is just not utilising them. We need to work together, we need to at least try to reduce emissions to keep our communities, our children safe, because next time, it could be your child.

            "date": "2023-02-28T13:37:39Z",
            "content": "The continued global rise in sales of SUVs pushed their climate-heating emissions to almost 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency. The 330m sport utility vehicles on the roads produced emissions equivalent to the combined national emissions of the UK and Germany last year. If SUVs were a country, they would rank as the sixth most polluting in the world. Climate campaigners are increasingly concerned about the impact of SUVs. The activist group Tyre Extinguishers said it had deflated the tyres of hundreds of SUVs in Europe on Monday nightin the run-up to the first anniversary of its campaign. The vehicles are larger and heavier than regular cars and use on average 20% more fuel. The increased number of SUVs in 2022 were responsible for a third of the increase in global oil demand. Purchases of SUVs have soared in recent years, rising from 20% of new cars in 2012 to 46% of all cars last year, the IEA reports. The rise continued in 2022, includes significant growth in the US, India and Europe, despite the overall number of cars sold falling slightly. About one in six SUVs sold in 2022 were electric. But the IEA experts said: \u201cElectric SUVs are growing in popularity, but not quickly enough to offset the increasing oil consumption and emissions of the wider fleet. \u201cElectric SUVs also require larger batteries to power them, so a growing electric SUV market would impose additional pressure on battery supply chains and further increase demand for the critical minerals needed to make the batteries.\u201d Cities targeted by Tyre Extinguisher groups on Monday included London, Paris, Berlin and Milan. The activists claim to have deflated more than 10,000 tyres in the past year in 17 countries, including the US and New Zealand, using lentils to jam open air valves. A spokesperson said: \u201cThings were quiet over the winter but we are now emerging ready for another year of lentil-based action. We act because politicians will not take even baby steps to make our streets and climate safe. We won\u2019t stop until these polluting vehicles are history.\u201d The Tyre Extinguishers said they wanted \u201cbans on SUVs in urban areas, pollution levies to tax SUVs out of existence, and massive investment in free, comprehensive public transport\u201d. Electric car sales soared in 2022, the IEA said, rising by 60% from 2021 to more than 10m vehicles. However, 29m non-electric SUVs were sold. Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and emobility at European campaign group Transport &amp; Environment, said: \u201cCarmakers are culling small cars in pursuit of profit. VW, Stellantis and BMW have all said they are moving towards selling fewer cars and focusing on more premium SUV models. But larger cars put more pressure on the planet.\u201d \u201cFor drivers, this means more expensive models and higher running costs, especially at a time of high energy prices,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven the stakes, regulators should ensure European small cars don\u2019t disappear. The best way is to tax big cars. Subsidies for electric cars should support entry-level EVs that are made in Europe.\u201d In 2021, the UK\u2019s National Audit Office reported that rising sales of SUVs and an increase in road traffic had cancelled out reductions in CO2 emissions from electric car sales."

            "date": "2023-02-10T13:01:07Z",
            "content": "An Australian government proposal to allow big polluters to use unlimited carbon offsets as an alternative to cutting their own greenhouse gases would likely greenlight new coal and gas developments and lead to a rise in emissions, a new analysis says. The report by Climate Analytics found land-based offsets \u2013 created through projects including tree planting and forest regeneration \u2013 had fundamental scientific problems that meant they would not deliver what was promised of them. Carbon offsets are key to the Albanese government\u2019s plan to revamp a failed Coalition policy, known as the safeguard mechanism, and require the country\u2019s 215 biggest emitting facilities to cut emissions by 4.9% a year. Under Labor\u2019s proposal, businesses would be able to meet emissions limits by buying an unlimited number of carbon offsets, known as credits, as well as directly cutting emissions onsite. Each credit represents a tonne of carbon dioxide reduced or avoided somewhere else. A government-ordered review of Australian carbon credits led by the former chief scientist Prof Ian Chubb last month did not accept allegations the crediting system lacked integrity, but recommended significant changes in how the scheme is managed. Climate Analytics said the review had \u201ceffectively ignored well-grounded criticism on its key methodologies from prominent experts and scientists\u201d. Its analysis found most land-based offsets failed to deliver genuine, new or permanent emissions reductions. It said the problems were exacerbated when offsets were used to justify more fossil fuel mining, as that ultimately resulted in far more CO2 being released into the atmosphere than was stored in vegetation when the credits were created. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), which commissioned the report with the group Solutions for Climate, said it showed while offsets were a necessary emissions reduction tool \u201cthey should be a last resort and they are very risky\u201d. \u201cThey are no replacement for genuine emissions reduction on the ground,\u201d ACF\u2019s climate program manager, Gavan McFadzean, said. McFadzean said a problem with the government\u2019s plan for the safeguard mechanism was that it did not distinguish between high-emitting industries that should stay while cutting emissions, such as smelting and cement, and other industries like coal and gas which needed to be rapidly phased out. He said the government should require businesses to follow an emissions reduction hierarchy from least to most effective ways to reduce pollution. \u201cThe best way to protect the climate is by stopping emissions going into the atmosphere in the first place. It\u2019s not by planting trees,\u201d he said. The real world impact of offsets Climate Analytics said that while companies under the safeguard mechanism could claim they were reducing their pollution by buying credits, in reality allowing unfettered use of offsets could lead to a rise in emissions and threaten the government\u2019s ability to meet its targets, including a 43% cut by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. \u201cThe likely result of the proposal for unlimited use of offsets is to provide a green light for new coal and gas production while allowing existing producers to continue polluting unchecked,\u201d the report said. In global terms, it calculated that every carbon credit used to offset one tonne of CO2 from liquified natural gas production in Australia led to about 8.4 tonnes of CO2 going into the atmosphere, once the gas was sold and burned overseas. In the case of coal, every Australian carbon credit used to offset a tonne of emissions from coalmining was associated with between 58 and 67 tonnes of CO2. Ryan Wilson, the lead author of the report, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a considerable real world impact of enabling fossil fuel companies to offset their emissions and continue \u2013 or even expand \u2013 production, rather than actually reduce their emissions.\u201d The report said forests and other natural ecosystems provided vital carbon stores that needed to be protected, but offsets from the land sector were \u201cparticularly susceptible to integrity issues\u201d and could not be guaranteed as permanent carbon stores. It said there was a difference between a tonne of CO2 emitted by fossil fuel industries and a tonne stored in vegetation, as the tonne in the atmosphere would have a far longer life. The safeguard mechanism Labor\u2019s changes to the safeguard mechanism will become a major political focus in coming weeks. The government\u2019s plan is backed by major business and industry groups, but is opposed by the Coalition. It leaves the government likely needing support from the Greens and two crossbench senators to pass legislation to create a new \u201csafeguard crediting mechanism\u201d \u2013 a step that would allow companies that emit less than a newly set pollution limit to be rewarded. These companies would earn a \u201csafeguard credit\u201d \u2013 different to existing Australian carbon credits \u2013 that could then be sold to polluters that emit more than their limit. The government says it will give businesses an incentive to cut emissions onsite. John Connor, the chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, which represents businesses that generate and invest in carbon credits, said the proposal would drive onsite emissions cuts, as it had to if it was to succeed. He called on the government should require annual cuts to deliver at least a 50% reduction in national emissions by 2030, and at least 70% by 2035. But he said it would also take time before some industries could invest in the steps needed to cut pollution directly and offsets had a role to play. \u201cThe safeguard mechanism has to pass the pub test \u2013 that it is driving decarbonisation at [its] source over time \u2013 but we can also not avoid the fact that properly regulated [credits] are climate solutions in themselves,\u201d he said. Connor said he did not disagree that there was a difference between absolute emissions, but said \u201cI do despair that there\u2019s a conflation that will mean we lose the opportunities from high integrity [credits].\u201d The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has said Labor\u2019s other proposed changes do not require legislation and can be made using regulation. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has sharply criticised the government\u2019s plan, accusing Labor of \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201cgreenwashing\u201d for allowing new coal and gas mines to open and offset their emissions.

            "content": "A vexed debate over the future of a major Australian climate policy that has been bubbling away for months is coming to a head. The Albanese government has given itself a tight deadline to land what is possibly the most substantial step to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with its climate targets that it promised before winning power last year. The policy is called the safeguard mechanism. It was introduced (and named, badly) by the Coalition. It was meant to limit emissions from industry but hasn\u2019t. The previous government chose not to properly enforce it. Labor has promised to revamp it. Part of the revamp requires legislation, which the government wants to pass in the next three weeks of parliament. The other part will be made through changes to regulation before a 1 July start. What are the political divisions? With the federal Coalition opposed to climate action, the government needs the support of the Greens and at least two other crossbenchers to get the legislation through. That is not guaranteed to happen and we have seen some performative displays of hostility over the divisions between Labor and the minor party. The two parties are engaged in a public staring contest. But the key players \u2013 the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, and the Greens leader, Adam Bandt \u2013 are talking. The Greens\u2019 starting position is that the government needs to block new coal and gas developments. Labor promised before the election not to do that. Something is going to have to give for a deal to be done. The possibility that it won\u2019t is giving some observers flashbacks to Kevin Rudd\u2019s carbon pollution reduction scheme and the blame game that followed its premature death in 2009. Failure would have climate, economic and political ramifications. There is no backup proposal on offer. But the details of the scheme matter. There remains widespread uncertainty about what the safeguard mechanism even is. The confusion is aggravated by a parallel debate over the role that carbon offsets should play. What is the safeguard mechanism? It was designed by the Coalition under Tony Abbott, ostensibly to put a limit on emissions from the country\u2019s biggest industrial sites. It covers 215 sites that each emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Together they produce 28% of Australia\u2019s emissions. Roughly half the facilities are fossil fuel operations \u2013 gas extraction sites, liquified natural gas processing plants and coalmines. Unless carbon capture and storage miraculously becomes viable, these facilities will need to make reductions now and ultimately be phased out if Australia is to address the climate crisis. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The rest of the facilities should have a long future but need cleaner ways of operating. They include steelworks, aluminium smelters, cement producers, chemical manufacturers, major transport companies and airlines. After coming to power in 2013 the Coalition abolished a functioning carbon pricing scheme that had required polluters to pay for their CO2. Its replacement was a \u201cdirect action\u201d policy to buy some emissions cuts using taxpayers\u2019 funds. The safeguard mechanism was introduced at the same time to stop industrial emissions increasing and wiping out the cuts paid for by taxpayers. Each big polluting facility was given an emissions limit \u2013 known as a baseline \u2013 based mostly on historic output. But with few exceptions the baselines were not enforced. Polluters were allowed to increase their limits. A bunch of new polluters opened \u2013 including several big emitting LNG plants \u2013 adding to national pollution, and industrial emissions increased significantly. What is Labor planning? Labor, bruised and battered by more than a decade of climate wars, made a political call before last year\u2019s election that its best chance of avoiding another misleading scare campaign about the cost of emissions reductions was to work with what was already in place. Bowen has released a proposal under which polluters will be given new baselines at levels that better reflect emissions. In most cases companies will be required to cut emissions intensity \u2013 how much they release relative to production \u2013 by 4.9% a year. They can choose how much happens onsite and how much comes from buying offsets. The idea behind offsets \u2013 known as Australian carbon credit units, or ACCUs \u2013 is that they allow companies to pay for cheaper emission reductions elsewhere. But the government\u2019s proposal to allow fossil fuel developers to buy an unlimited number of offsets while continuing to emit is contentious. We\u2019ll come back to that. Bowen is taking submissions on the design. Business and industry groups have strongly supported the change at a global level but individual companies are arguing that they can\u2019t cut emissions so rapidly or that they need financial help. The government will make decisions on a site-by-site basis. The minister has said some companies may be allowed to make a smaller annual cut but they will need to have a strong case that a 4.9% annual cut will make them less internationally competitive. He has pointed out that many companies have made net zero commitments and their future competitiveness will turn on being able to show they are acting on that. The government has promised $600m to help some industries embrace cleaner practice, with more expected. Labor has also promised to create a new \u201csafeguard crediting\u201d system that would basically turn the scheme into a form of emissions trading. Polluters that make extra cuts would earn a credit for every tonne of CO2 cut below their baseline. Safeguard credits could be sold to polluters who have not made enough cuts and need to account for their extra emissions. The idea is this would give industry an extra incentive to cut emissions onsite and greater flexibility to meet their targets. Safeguard crediting is not a Labor idea. It was proposed by the Coalition and legislation was drawn up under the Morrison government. On this point, the new government just adopted what was already there. For reasons not properly explained, the Coalition under Peter Dutton has now decided it is a bad idea. What about new fossil fuel proposals? This is one of the two big concerns held by people concerned it won\u2019t do enough to cut emissions \u2013 and it is the major sticking point between Labor and the Greens. Official emissions projections last year assumed several gas projects \u2013 including Scarborough in northern Western Australia, the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory and Narrabri in New South Wales \u2013 will go ahead. New and expanded coalmines are also proposed. The government says it won\u2019t stop new fossil fuel developments if investors believe there is demand for coal and gas and if the developments are approved under environmental laws (which mostly don\u2019t consider the impact of a project\u2019s emissions). Bowen says initial emissions baselines for these developments would be set at \u201cinternational best practice\u201d, and that the design leaves room for new projects to go ahead and the country to still meet its 43% emissions reduction target for 2030. From a scientific basis, the Greens are on solid ground. The International Energy Agency, the UN and the globe\u2019s climate science bodies have warned that the world must stop opening new gas and oilfields and coal plants and make deeper emissions cuts this decade if it is to stay within safe limits of global heating and reach net zero emissions by 2050. Labor\u2019s position is based on electoral politics and the argument that fossil fuel exports can continue while there are buyers. What happens now? We will see if the two parties can find middle ground \u2013 and whether the government can win support from two of the independent senators from among David Pocock, ex-Green Lidia Thorpe and the Jacqui Lambie Network. More heated rhetoric over the division appears inevitable but some of this is for show. The Greens know Labor won\u2019t back their coal and gas demand. Sarah Hanson-Young summed things up when she said it was an \u201coffer, not an ultimatum\u201d. But the minor party has signalled the territory on which it wants to negotiate \u2013 restrictions on new fossil fuel developments. Bowen has said Labor is open to talking about the detail but won\u2019t do anything at odds with the policy it took to the election. Will the safeguard mechanism actually cut emissions? This is a more difficult question to answer than it should be. There has been some over-the-top criticism claiming there is no difference between Labor and the Coalition on climate. This clearly isn\u2019t true. Labor\u2019s plan can, and should, lead to genuine CO2 reductions. But despite Labor suggesting otherwise, its success will clearly in part turn on the number and scale of new fossil fuel developments. It will also be shaped by the extent to which companies rely on carbon offsets rather than making cuts onsite, and the integrity of those offsets. Offsets have become a divisive issue but there is a pretty basic principle that is sometimes lost \u2013 you can\u2019t offset your way to dealing with the climate crisis. Emissions reductions will need to be deep and direct. High-quality offsets can play a role when used by industries that genuinely don\u2019t have options to make direct cuts, or that want to drive even deeper cuts than they can onsite. And projects that store CO2 in the landscape are clearly needed. What\u2019s the problem with offsets? Offsets could be used to justify new fossil fuel developments that would add vast amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere for decades to come. The goal is to cut emissions, not facilitate new ones. While a carbon credit is meant to represent one tonne of CO2, scientists say an offset created through forest regeneration is not equal to a tonne released from fossil fuels. The latter can persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years. The former is much less likely to survive as long. It is another argument that offsets should be used sparingly. Bowen\u2019s rationale for not imposing limits on offsets is that a cut of nearly 5% each year is substantial, that some firms do not yet have technology available to make substantial direct cuts and businesses need flexibility to achieve their goals while keeping costs down. He says he is confident the policy will lead to significant onsite cuts and that companies say they want to make direct reductions. There is logic to this. If they don\u2019t they will face a rising annual offsets bill. But Labor has not released analysis to show how much of the cuts they expect to be direct, or explained why it it is against placing some sort of limit on how many offsets can be used to ensure cuts are made onsite. How big a role will offsets play? RepuTex, a consultancy that did some work for Labor before the election but also at times criticised its policy, has released modelling that offers some support for the government\u2019s case. It estimates that in 2030 the bulk of cuts \u2013 74% \u2013 will be onsite. It found about half the emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism would be hard to directly reduce, but said there would be ample low-cost opportunities to make direct cuts. On the other hand, a report by Climate Analytics found that allowing unlimited offsets could effectively give fossil fuel companies the green light to go ahead with new developments and increase the CO2 being released into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, arguments about the integrity of carbon offset projects continue. There has been reasonably broad, but not universal, support for recommendations made by a review of the carbon credit system led by Prof Ian Chubb, including by some sharp critics of the scheme. Bowen has said he will implement all recommendations. What that means in practice will be important. A new analysis led by one of the most vocal critics \u2013 Prof Andrew Macintosh, a former chair of a government Emissions reduction assurance committee \u2013 says flawed existing carbon credit projects could create at least 60m low-quality carbon credits that do not represent genuine new reductions if Chubb\u2019s overarching review is not followed by a detailed project-by-project evaluation. If Macintosh is correct, and if the government doesn\u2019t intervene, it suggests the safeguard mechanism\u2019s ability to cut emissions could be compromised. As with everything on this difficult subject, the debate still has a long way to run."

We slide slowly \u2013 though not silently \u2013 into mirror-smooth Loch Ossian. Reflections of bare-branched trees ripple, a bird of prey hovers on the horizon. It doesn\u2019t get much wilder than this; a full immersion into the elemental Highlands. We\u2019re staying at the Loch Ossian youth hostel at the water\u2019s edge, one of the most remote in the UK. Off-grid, with no vehicle access and sleeping 20 in two bunkrooms, it\u2019s a place to truly escape from the world (and we have it all to ourselves). Old black-and-white photos of early female mountaineers hang on the walls; our damp hiking gear dries on racks by the fire; at night the pitch-black sky twinkles with countless stars. I\u2019m here with Wilderness Scotland on a trip to test \u201chow low can you go?\u201d when it comes to low-impact, low-carbon travel. On our three-day itinerary we\u2019ll explore by foot, e-bike and electric vehicles, visiting rewilding projects and learning about the landscape and people working to protect it, too. \u201cThis is how the future of travel could look: treading lightly and encouraging connection to the land,\u201d says Wilderness Scotland\u2019s Ben Thorburn, one of our guides for the weekend. \u201cOn a trip like this, your carbon impact could be less than if you stayed at home.\u201d Last year, in partnership with consultancy eCollective, the company undertook a complete carbon audit of more than 300 suppliers to calculate the carbon cost of every holiday offered. It\u2019s a step towards their goal of becoming true net zero by 2030 and reducing carbon emissions by 90% in that time. As well as cutting emissions as much as possible, they buy reputable offset credits and plant trees to sequester more carbon and restore habitats. Customers can also opt into plant additional trees. Our trip starts on the Caledonian Sleeper from London to Inverness (a fraction of emissions compared with flying). It\u2019s still dark when I wake and peer out from my cabin, the landscape slowly coming into focus as we pull closer to the station. An electric car awaits \u2013 the company is working to replace all vans with electric vehicles \u2013 and we glide across the Cairngorms national park to our first stop, Lynbreck Croft near Grantown-on-Spey. Lynn Cassells and Sandra Baer bought the 150-acre croft back in 2016 with little money, no plan and no farming experience, just a craving for a wilder life. We tour the site, learning of the challenges and rewards of farming in symbiosis with nature \u2013 and the determination needed to succeed. Polytunnels brim with produce, Highland cattle and rare breed pigs roam and Lynn talks about the importance of soil health. As well as selling their produce, they run tours and workshops for those wanting to learn more about smallholdings and regenerative farming. We picnic in the autumn sunshine with views of the Cairngorms on the horizon, not wanting to leave. Visits to local sustainable businesses feature on many Wilderness itineraries and that evening \u2013 after a hike along the Speyside Way from Boat of Garten to Aviemore \u2013 we head to Inshriach estate and distillery, where Walter Micklethwait makes small-batch craft gin using wild juniper berries and locally picked ingredients. Hidden in the woods, the bar combines a wild west saloon with speakeasy vibe; the cocktails and magical setting make for a fun evening before we return to Aviemore for dinner and our B&amp;B. Loch Ossian, on the Corrour estate, can only be reached on foot or by bike so the next morning our e-bikes are delivered to the roadside near Moy Lodge and we saddle up to cycle the 15 miles to the hostel. They make easy work of climbs through woodlands and open tracks across Rannoch Moor. The autumnal palette of rust and gold, splashed with waterfalls and gushing rivers, stands out against a steely sky. On the top of the hillside a red stag appears, perfectly silhouetted, and grouse fly up from the grass. It begins to rain heavily, but nothing can dull the glory of the landscape. We arrive at the hostel dripping but happy \u2013 and before bed there\u2019s one last foray in the dark to the Corrour Station House Restaurant, where the venison comes from the estate. This is the highest railway station in the UK and the next day we board the West Highland Line (recently equipped with a dedicated bike carriage) for the picturesque ride to Spean Bridge. One of Wilderness Scotland\u2019s partners is Trees for Life, which is working to rewild the Highlands and restore the Caledonian Forest. Before our train back home we visit the flagship Dundreggan estate \u2013 where the UK\u2019s first rewilding centre will open in March. We tour the tree nurseries and walk through the beech forests, learning where natural regeneration works and where reforestation is needed. It\u2019s an interesting end to a whirlwind long weekend that has shown how travel can educate, excite and be fun, with minimal impact on the planet. Carbon emissions for a trip such as ours would be around 38kg a person for three days (including everything from accommodation to food, but not the train up), says Ben, when the average CO2 a person a day in the UK is 15kg. Not all itineraries can have such a light footprint, of course, but it\u2019s an inspiring step in the right direction. The trip was provided by Wilderness Scotland, which offers a range of low-carbon guided and self-guided holidays that incorporate sustainable accommodation and experiences. Prices on the Caledonian Sleeper from London Euston to Inverness or Aviemore start from \u00a355 for a seat, classic rooms from \u00a3205 for two, Club rooms from \u00a3255 for two"

After the Greens signalled they would use the looming parliamentary negotiation to pursue the party\u2019s long-sought ban on new coal and gas, a number of Labor frontbenchers used question time to launch a pre-emptive strike, warning both the Greens and the Coalition against sabotaging emissions reduction efforts. While the climate change minister, Chris Bowen \u2013 who will spearhead the safeguard negotiations \u2013 struck a more conciliatory tone about the Greens, the frontbenchers Tanya Plibersek and Madeleine King unleashed in the parliament. \u201cWe remember what the Greens did in 2009 when they failed to support the carbon pollution reduction scheme,\u201d said King, the federal minister for resources. \u201cWhat they did is teamed up with the Liberals and the Nationals opposite to make sure there was no action on climate change nearly 13 years ago.\u201d Plibersek, the environment minister, said \u201csabotaging\u201d climate action was \u201cno surprise\u201d from the Coalition but Greens members \u201cwould actually be shocked to see Greens members of parliament getting ready to sit next to Peter Dutton and Barnaby Joyce to vote against action on climate change \u2026 against a safeguard mechanism\u201d. The Greens have been signalling for months they want the Albanese government to stop new coal and gas projects.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup While some members of the government went on the offensive, the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, defended their position in a speech to a climate integrity summit hosted by the Australia Institute. She said the minor party had made \u201can offer, not an ultimatum\u201d and there were several ways the government could protect the environment while stopping new coal and gas developments. They included backing a Greens bill to amend national environment laws to introduce a climate trigger that would require the environment minister to reject new fossil fuel projects that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. \u201cThey would be treated the same way as nuclear projects are treated under the existing act,\u201d she said. Hanson-Young said a climate trigger would also help address the impact of climate change on Australian wildlife, noting that Plibersek had set a target of zero new extinctions of native species. She cited the International Energy Agency, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and the world\u2019s scientists as saying there could not be new fossil fuel projects if the world wanted to limit global heating to the level agreed in the landmark Paris agreement. \u201cThe government should be going down this path and the Greens\u2019 open offer on the safeguard mechanism is another incentive for them to do so,\u201d she said. Given that the Coalition has ruled out supporting Labor\u2019s overhaul of the safeguard mechanism \u2013 a climate policy promised to cut industrial emissions \u2013 Labor will require the support of the Greens in the Senate. Toughening the safeguard regime will be a critical component of meeting the more ambitious climate targets the Albanese government legislated last year. The government wants the reforms in place by July, and business is urging the parliament to move past the climate wars that paralysed policy action for more than a decade. A point of contention over the scheme is how much of the emissions reduction would be made directly by industry, and how much would come from carbon offsets, which allow industry to pay for cuts elsewhere. The widespread use of offsets have been become controversial after allegations that some projects lack integrity. An analysis released on Wednesday by the consultants RepuTex, which modelled Labor\u2019s climate policy before last year\u2019s election, estimated that up to three-quarters of cuts by 2030 would be made through onsite cuts by polluters, with carbon offsets playing a lesser role. Late on Wednesday there was a further tactical escalation. Labor pushed its signature housing australia future fund bill through the lower house, despite the reservations of the Greens \u2013 whose support they will require in the Senate to pass the legislation. The Greens had sought negotiations with the government for more funding for affordable and social housing, plus support for renters. But in a move that surprised the minor party, the government instead rammed the bill through the House without amendment. That led to a situation where the four Greens MP left the chamber and abstained from voting, with their housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, saying they were reserving their position. Most Coalition MPs simply didn\u2019t attend the chamber for division votes, while those present decided not to vote either. A notable exception was the Liberal MP Bridget Archer, who supported the government in getting the bill through. The final vote passed \u201con the voices\u201d, with no formal division called as there were no votes opposing it. Chandler-Mather said the Greens wanted to negotiate \u201cin good faith\u201d and had decided not to oppose the bill but accused the government of a \u201ctheir way or the highway\u201d approach. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly concerned by the behaviour of a government that seems to think that it is above democracy,\u201d he said."

Australian startup Recharge finalises deal to take over UK battery maker Britishvolt The Australia-based company Recharge Industries will take over collapsed battery maker Britishvolt after finalising a deal with administrators late on Sunday in the UK.

Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported some of the key business indicators for the quarter, including a surprising 10.6% jump, seasonally adjusted, in company profits. Wages and salaries, by contrast, rose a more modest 2.6%. Westpac, for instance, had tipped profits to rise only 1%, while the market \u201cconsensus\u201d was for a 1.8% increase. The profit surge is likely to bolster the case to look at whether companies pushing through higher prices than the underlying cost of inputs (such as labour) might be the real source of inflationary pressure. The Australia Institute is among the groups that reckon so, as we saw last week: The spread of profit, as you might expect, varies by industry. The real estate industry, where property sales and prices have been on the skids, was the lagging sector in the December quarter. Given the way interest rates are headed, this trend might well persist. Inventories, meanwhile, sank 0.2% in the quarter. Sounds a bit dull, but the shift reversed a 0.4 percentage point rise in the September quarter, and the shift alone will lop off 0.8 percentage points of GDP growth for the final three months of 2022. Foreign trade figures out tomorrow from the ABS will provide the last of the GDP figures that economists need to update their forecasts for what Wednesday\u2019s numbers should look like. Delegation of vice-chancellors to join education minister on India visit A dozen vice-chancellors are joining education minister Jason Clare on an official visit to India this week, as the federal government moves to strengthen its ties with the nation\u2019s tertiary sector. On the five-day visit, Clare will sign a mutual recognition agreement for qualifications with India, while Universities Australia (UA) will also renew its formal partnership with the Association of Indian universities. Clare has raised the possibility of establishing Australian campuses in India to capitalise on India\u2019s goal to educate 500 million students by 2035 under its national education plan. UA said education would be key to a growing trade relationship with India, currently Australia\u2019s second largest and fastest growing source of international students after China. There are around 128,979 Indian students enrolled with Australian providers, representing 17% of the entire makeup. CEO of UA Catriona Jackson will accompany the prime minister on a visit to India following Clare. She said universities \u201cfully support\u201d the federal government\u2019s commitment to sign the agreement. Higher education and research are central pillars of our relationship, and universities are eager to use the opportunities in front of us to ratchet up our engagement ... we are entering a golden era in our education relationship with India. We must make the most of it for the benefit of both our nations. Australian Technology Network of Universities (ATN) executive director, Luke Sheehy is among the delegation. In semester one of 2022, there was a 275% increase on Indian enrolments at ATN universities. This delegation will help solidify the already deep affinity we share. There is an enduring genuine affection with India, along with great partnerships which have been signed in economic agreements, and education has always taken a leading role. It follows the resignation of 13 academic fellows last year from the Australia India Institute \u2013 Australia\u2019s leading India thinktank \u2013 over concerns about academic freedom, as reported by the Saturday Paper. Leifer allegedly abused student in another teacher\u2019s windowless office, court told Malka Leifer, a former principal of Adass Israel school in Elsternwick, arranged for a student to meet her in another teacher\u2019s office that had no windows and a lockable door before abusing her, a court has heard. Leifer has been charged with 29 offences against three sisters between 2003 and 2007, including 10 counts of rape. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is facing trial at the county court in Melbourne. Dr Vicki Gordon, a clinical and forensic psychologist who treated one of Leifer\u2019s alleged victims, told the court on Monday about the notes she had taken after an appointment in March 2008. During the session, Gordon said the woman had been \u201cfull of shame\u201d and would send her text messages regarding the alleged abuse committed by Leifer while sitting across from her \u201cbecause she couldn\u2019t mouth the words. She was too embarrassed\u201d.

The inquest into the shooting death of Warlpiri teenager Kumanjayi Walker resumed on Monday. Walker, 19, was shot dead by Rolfe during a botched arrest in the remote Northern Territory community of Yuendumu in 2019. Rolfe was cleared of all criminal charges in relation to the shooting. He has been pursuing legal action to avoid giving evidence at the inquest, and wrote an open letter before leaving the country late last week. Rolfe said in a 2,500-word statement published on Facebook that he was a \u201cgood cop\u201d who \u201cloved the job\u201d, but that he had been \u201cpainted\u201d as racist and violent. Acting for the NT police, Ian Freckleton SC on Monday said the force was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about Rolfe\u2019s conduct.

Mark Gladman, a former deputy general counsel at the Department of Human Services, told the commission that after researching the scheme he believed it was \u201cweak\u201d. Gladman said he advised his superior at the time, acting chief counsel Lisa Carmody, that the department should seek the Australian government solicitor\u2019s (AGS) opinion on the program. The inquiry was shown draft instructions that Gladman and colleagues had prepared for the AGS. As it turned out, the AGS didn\u2019t end up providing a legal opinion until late March 2019, more than two years later. It said then the scheme was likely unlawful. Carmody, who was acting in the role in early January, told the commission on Monday she had brief discussions with the AGS before her usual boss, Annette Musolino resumed in the role. Carmody said she also provided hard copies of the documents \u2013 including Gladman\u2019s teams draft advice on the scheme \u2013 to Musolino when she returned from leave in January 2017. Musolino is expected to appear again at the royal commission. Carmody agreed the draft advice \u2013 which sought to mount a legal defence for the scheme \u2013 was \u201cunconvincing\u201d. The advice was never finalised. The inquiry before Catherine Holmes AC SC continues. Qantas announces leadership changes Andrew David, the chief executive of Qantas Domestic and International, will retire from the company in September, as the airline announces changes to its leadership structure. Less than a week after announcing a record $1.43bn half-year profit, Qantas on Monday announced that ahead of David\u2019s departure, his role \u2013 which was combined during Covid \u2013 will again be split into two portfolios for domestic and international. From July, former Air New Zealand executive Cameron Wallace will take over as chief executive of Qantas International. David will remain as chief executive of Qantas Domestic until his retirement in September. \u201cThis will provide the management bandwidth required as each business welcomes new aircraft and expands its network,\u201d Qantas said in a statement. Both the roles will report to the chief executive of the broader Qantas Group, Alan Joyce, who himself is expected to leave Qantas later this year. NZ to stage global fundraiser to support Cyclone Gabrielle recovery New Zealand will stage an international fundraising appeal to support its Cyclone Gabrielle recovery, and a one-off lotto draw next month. Prime minister Chris Hipkins said the appeal was modelled off a similar fundraising effort following the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes, which raised more than $NZ94m ($A86m). This global appeal means we can harness local and international donations and channel them to the communities and projects that need them the most. The cyclone was NZ\u2019s biggest storm in a generation, affecting one-third of its land mass and causing billions of dollars worth of damage. The final bill may never be known, but includes huge rebuilds of road, rail and energy infrastructure, as well as housing, and lost earnings from vast swathes of agricultural land. Hipkins said he hoped Kiwis in the one million strong diaspora \u2013 which includes hundreds of thousands in Australia \u2013 would consider giving. New Zealanders who have gone abroad and done well and want to get something back to the country, my message to them is \u2018We would love your support\u2019. Businesses that have a relationship with New Zealand and want to chip in and help out with the rebuild, again, we would love to hear from them as well \u2026 This is a charitable appeal. So we\u2019re really targeting anyone who\u2019s in a position to feel that they can contribute and do something that\u2019s for the wider community. Gabrielle\u2019s death toll remains at 11. Earlier fears of a much larger toll are subsiding, with police revealing they had whittled down the number of missing people from almost 7,000 to five. Of the outstanding people, three are on active charges, including two who breached bail prior to the cyclone. \u2013 AAP Thanks for your attention this Monday, Elias Visontay will take you through the rest of today\u2019s news. Young girl in critical condition after falling from rocks in Queensland A young girl is in critical condition after falling from rocks at North Stradbroke Island on Saturday. News.com.au is reporting the eight-year-old girl fell from the lookout on the island: Her father jumped in after her and found her unconscious, holding her head above water as they waited for help. It is believed she was swept off the rocks and under water for a period of time. Queensland Ambulance Service have told Guardian Australia two patients were assessed \u201cfollowing a post immersion incident\u201d off South Gorge Beach shortly before 11.30am on 25 February. A female child was airlifted to Queensland Children\u2019s Hospital in a critical condition and a male adult was transported by road to Murrie Rose centre and further transported to Princess Alexandra hospital stable. UN scolds Australia for its treatment of sick refugees Australia has copped a pasting from the United Nations for its treatment of asylum seekers who remain stuck in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, AAP reports. The UN high commissioner for refugees has joined human rights groups and grassroots advocates in demanding the immediate evacuation of about 150 people being held offshore. Greens senator Nick McKim has introduced proposed laws that would see 66 people on Nauru and another 92 in PNG transferred to community detention in Australia if they posed no security risk. People evacuated to Australia would be provided with access to medical treatment. A parliamentary inquiry investigating the bill has received more than 30 submissions, with unanimous support for the legislative amendment. The UNHCR and Human Rights Watch were among those to support a more humane and cost-effective approach to achieving \u201cimmigration enforcement goals\u201d. The UN lambasted the government, saying it had a legal responsibility towards the safe settlement of asylum seekers under international rules. The agency said: The government of Australia cannot seek to divest itself of responsibility or limit jurisdiction and responsibility under international law for those taken to Nauru or Papua New Guinea. Its submission described observing first-hand how the physical and psychological health of asylum seekers and refugees transferred offshore by Australia had deteriorated over the last decade. Human Rights Watch said 12 asylum seekers had died since 2013, when the offshore processing policy was introduced. The organisation also pointed out Australian taxpayers had been left to pay the exorbitant bill. Salmon company Tassal tried to block release of report on antibiotic use, documents show Tasmania\u2019s largest salmon company, Tassal, sought to block the release of monitoring reports submitted to the state\u2019s Environment Protection Agency (EPA) after using more than two tonnes of antibiotics at two of its fish farms. In early January 2022, Tassal and Huon Aquaculture reported outbreaks of vibrio, a bacterium the Tasmanian Salmonid Growers Association says can cause an infection with a \u201chigh mortality rate\u201d.

Labor announced the creation of three centres in the Hunter, Illawarra and western Sydney at a cost of $42m to form the vocational backbone needed to build trains, buses and ferries. Labor leader Chris Minns told reporters at Lake Macquarie today: There is a proud tradition of train building in the Hunter. It\u2019s been happening in this region for over 100 years and I firmly believe that Australians are world leaders when it comes to engineering and manufacturing \u2013 they just need a government in this state that\u2019s going to back local and buy local. We\u2019re determined to change government policy to make sure that we can build trains right here in NSW. The opposition said 1,000 jobs building trains in the region would be created in its first term through Domestic Manufacturing Centres of Excellence, run by Tafe. Minns said relying on overseas contractors had blown the budget for the Liberal-National coalition government in the top six transport infrastructure projects by 40 to 50% and domestic manufacturing was needed to jump start the economy. Nothing will change unless there\u2019s a change of government. We believe in domestic manufacturing and we\u2019ve got the policies to back it up. Severe thunderstorm warning for northern NSW The NSW SES is issuing a severe thunderstorm warning for northern NSW including Grafton, Kempsey, Armidale, Tenterfield, Glen Innes and Dorrigo. These areas could also see damaging winds and large hailstones. If you\u2019re in those areas, stay safe! Indian students facing lengthy visa delays Indian students with Australian PhD placements facing lengthy student visa delays are urging the federal government to clear a backlog as the education minister signs a broad-ranging tertiary education deal. Atul Kumar Rai is in a WhatsApp group with more than 100 students who\u2019ve been awarded fully funded PhD scholarships at Australian universities and are still waiting for visa outcomes \u2013 some for up to three years. Rai lodged his visa application in March 2022 after receiving a fully-funded scholarship at the University of Wollongong. He has received a common response when reaching out to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection: Unfortunately, ensuring all the legal requirements are met in relation to an application can take some time. In particular, it can take several months to obtain any necessary health, character and security clearances from other agencies ... I am unable to provide you with a definitive timeframe for the finalisation of your application. Rai said during this time, he had submitted $3,500 for health insurance and visa application fees. This week, minister for education Jason Clare is visiting India to sign deepened agreements for mutual recognition in the higher education sector. Rai questioned why higher education pathways were being fostered when students were having their scholarships lapse. Delaying the visas will be slowing down the growth and development of both countries. We are the brands of our country and educational institutions. We will play a very vital role in the exchange of knowledge, technology and culture of both countries. We don\u2019t need relaxed working hours or post study visa relations. We just want our student visa. It feels like we are left behind. We have sleeping disorder, anxiety issues during this period. Parkarsh Kumar received multiple international PhD offers after graduating in Taiwan in 2021. He chose Australia for its reputation and the mutual relationship agreements between the two nations. My dream of becoming professor at a reputed Indian university is getting shattered after waiting for so long and yet no communication from the Department of Home Affairs. I am currently waiting for more than 14 months. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said it understood visa application delays were causing concerns for students. One in ten student visas for postgraduate research aren\u2019t being processed within 12 months, with delays cited if applications are \u201ccomplex\u201d or incomplete. Half of visas are finalised within four months. The Optus and Medibank incidents have exposed \u201cgaps\u201d in Australia\u2019s existing incident response functions, according to a discussion paper released this afternoon. The discussion paper calls for regulatory changes \u2013 including potentially a new Cyber Security Act. Most controversially, the paper suggests that the government\u2019s power to step in to assist organisations or companies respond to cyber attacks could be expanded to a wider range of circumstances. But it is worth pointing out that this is not government policy as yet. The discussion paper was released shortly after Anthony Albanese addressed the cybersecurity roundtable in Sydney. It was drafted by an expert advisory board chaired by former Telstra boss Andrew Penn and whose other members are former air force chief Mel Hupfeld and cyber security expert Rachael Falk. The authors say they have heard from industry that business owners \u201coften do not feel their cybersecurity obligations are clear or easy to follow\u201d. The paper says it is \u201cclear from stakeholder feedback and the increasing frequency and severity of major cyber incidents, that more explicit specification of obligations, including some form of best practice cyber security standards, is required across the economy to increase our national cyber resilience and keep Australians and their data safe.\u201d It adds: It is clear that a package of regulatory reform is necessary. How this would be implemented, including the potential consideration of a new Cyber Security Act, drawing together cyber-specific legislative obligations and standards across industry and government, and the details of these reforms is something on which feedback will be welcomed. This should also consider whether further developments to the [Security of Critical Infrastructure] Act are warranted, such as including customer data and \u2018systems\u2019 in the definition of critical assets to ensure the powers afforded to government under the SOCI Act extend to major data breaches such as those experienced by Medibank and Optus, not just operational disruptions.\u201d That proposal would expand the circumstances where the Australian Signals Directorate could step in to \u201cassist\u201d in the response to a cyber attack. Other proposals for feedback include strengthening Australia\u2019s international strategy on cyber security (such as boosting assistance to south-east Asian and Pacific countries). The paper also urges the government to lead by example, highlighting the fact that Australian government entities \u201chave a long way to go to properly secure government systems\u201d. It also suggests more help for small and medium businesses. Feedback is sought by 15 April. New coordinator for cybersecurity to be announced Albanese ends his speech announcing a new coordinator for cybersecurity will be appointed within the home affairs portfolio: We want all Australian businesses to be able to pick tech themselves but also protect their customers. And I don\u2019t underestimate the challenge we are facing, this is an ever evolving threat and it will need adaptation from us and for business and for government to make sure we keep on top of this. That\u2019s why today, as well as part of this process, we are announcing a coordinator for cybersecurity. We want that coordination to be done centrally so it\u2019s most effective, that\u2019s why that will be located in the Department of Home Affairs under the responsibility of minister Clare O\u2019Neil, so there is a clear pathway forward, and I believe that is a critical contribution that we can make. Albanese goes on to say the government is determined to turn around a situation where Australia has been \u201coff the pace\u201d for too many years when it comes to the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat. We, of course are conscious as a government as well about state-sponsored attacks, which increasingly prevalent, stealing classified information, to cyber criminal acts aimed at seeking to secure some profit or in some cases, ransomeware attacks, which are increasingly prevalent as well. So, clearly as it stands government policies and regulations, business sectors systems and measures, and our general awareness of capacity as a nation are simply not at the level that we need them to be. \u2026This is really fast moving. It\u2019s a rapidly evolving threat and for too many years Australia has been off the pace. Our government is determined to change that. He tells the industry and experts at the roundtable: We want to use your expertise and experience to build a national cybersecurity strategy that is practical, that\u2019s useful and adaptable. For every level of government, every branch of the public service every agency and institution, for business, large and small and for people. Albanese on strengthening national cybersecurity But back to Australian shores, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese is speaking about developing a national cybersecurity strategy at the roundtable taking place today in Sydney. Albanese opens his speech reflecting on the importance of cybersecurity not only for Australian business and national security but also the importance for individuals to feel their identity is protected. Cybersecurity is national security, it is business security but it is also personal security for 25 million Australians. \u2026 Strengthening Australia\u2019s cybersecurity is a fundamental priority for our government. We recognise it is an essential part of life, the way that every Australian and every business and every community organisation deals with each other, on a day-to-day basis. It is absolutely critical as well for maintaining trust in our public institutions, and our public service. It\u2019s critical to maintain confidence in your commercial dealings, and also in your intellectual property, which is often the foundation of your wealth creation. It\u2019s also vital to individuals, individuals quite rightly feel violated when their details are online. It is no different from someone breaking into your house and stealing something from you because it is your property, and in some cases it\u2019s your identity as well. It\u2019s currently Sunday night in Los Angeles where the Screen Actors Guild awards are taking place with nominees stepping out onto the red carpet now ahead of the ceremony. Australia\u2019s own Cate Blanchett, nominated for her leading role in Tar, is impressing in a sparkling black Armani Priv\u00e9 gown in her march towards the Oscars. A NSW parliamentary committee has accused premier Dominic Perrottet of hindering its probe into lucrative overseas trade roles, AAP reports. The committee said in its final report released today: The premier\u2019s refusal to assist this inquiry in its investigations has impeded the committee\u2019s ability to determine his role in the selection of Stephen Cartwright as the NSW Agent General UK, as well as determining his remuneration. The inquiry was launched to investigate former NSW deputy premier John Barilaro\u2019s appointment to a taxpayer-funded US trade position and was later expanded to examine similar lucrative roles, including that of Cartwright. The upper house committee report found Barilaro interfered in that hiring process by meeting with Cartwright, and failed to engage with a candidate who had previously been preferred for the job. Barilaro also talked with Cartwright about his salary expectations, boosting his expectations. The committee report said this was highly inappropriate and showed poor judgment. Cartwright, who eventually landed an annual pay packet of $600,000 along with a $105,000 rent allowance, applied pressure to public servants during negotiations, the committee found. The premier dismissed the report\u2019s findings and denied Barilaro had acted inappropriately. He told reporters today: This is typical of Labor, back in the upper house playing more games. The premier cited independent reports commissioned by the government. Wong to take part in G20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in New Delhi Wong will then travel on to India \u2013 the first time she has visited that country since being sworn in as foreign affairs minister last May. The main commitments are the G20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in New Delhi, and the strategic conference known as the Raisina Dialogue. The G20 has struggled to come to a unified position on the war in Ukraine. A statement issued after a meeting of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors held in Bengaluru, India, on Friday and Saturday said that \u201cmost members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine\u201d. That statement which included language that \u201cdeplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine\u201d \u2013 was not agreed by G20 member countries Russia and China. Wong said today: I look forward to working with my counterparts on how we can address contemporary international challenges, including strengthening the multilateral system, food and energy security, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief \u2026 This year is an important milestone in Australia\u2019s bilateral relationship with India, with many high-level ministerial visits between our two countries. Prime minister Anthony Albanese, minister for trade and tourism Don Farrell and minister for resources Madeleine King will travel to India over the next month, and later this year Australia looks forward to hosting Indian prime minister Narendra Modi when he attends the Quad leaders\u2019 meeting. Wong to travel to India and Malaysia this week Just days after returning from Kiribati and Fiji, Penny Wong will travel to Malaysia and India this week. Malaysia has previously expressed concerns that the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan could contribute to a regional arms race. Australia, the US and the UK are expected to announce the finer details of those submarine plans next month, so it seems likely this and the parallel defence strategic review could come up in discussions. The foreign affairs minister said she looked forward to holding introductory meetings with members of the new Malaysian government, including the prime minister, minister of foreign affairs and minister of economy. Wong said she would use the visit to Malaysia to \u201creaffirm our shared priorities\u201d and to advance \u201cour significant trade and economic links, cooperation on defence and regional security, and the close ties between our peoples\u201d. Referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), Wong added: Australia is committed to working with Malaysia to support Asean\u2019s vital contribution to regional peace and security. GPs call on other states to follow Queensland offering pill testing One of the nation\u2019s peak doctors\u2019 bodies has called on states and territories to introduce illicit pill testing to \u201csave lives\u201d after Queensland unveiled plans for a trial. The Queensland government on Saturday announced plans to have at least one drug-checking trial site running within six months in a bid to reduce avoidable deaths. The move comes days after the state government tabled legislation aimed at decriminalising illicit drug possession and five years after drug checking was first trialled at a Canberra music festival. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has backed the pill-testing plan, calling on other state and territory leaders to do so to \u201csave lives\u201d. RACGP president Dr Nicole Higgins says people will take illicit drugs despite the risks so governments should try to minimise harm, \u201cnot stick our heads in the sand and pretend otherwise\u201d. She said in a statement today: From what has occurred in other jurisdictions, we know that many people who submit drugs for testing don\u2019t take them when they find out what they actually contain. Prevention is better than punitive action. A \u2018war on drugs\u2019 mindset gets us nowhere. I call on our nation\u2019s leaders to follow the lead of the ACT and now Queensland and introduce fixed and mobile pill-testing sites to save lives. However, Queensland opposition health spokeswoman Ros Bates, a registered nurse, said the move to allow pill testing was \u201csoft on drugs\u201d and pointed to a suggestion from NSW police that pill testing gave users false confidence about safety. Victoria and NSW have resisted pushes to roll out approved testing sites despite multiple coronial inquests into drug-related festival deaths recommending the measure. \u2013 AAP As we\u2019ve mentioned on the blog, Woodside is the latest corporation to be recording big profits, following similar boons for Qantas, CBA Woolworth and Coles posted last week. Guardian columnist Greg Jericho gives you a visual on just how much profits are soaring ahead of wages. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions Sally McManus says the graph paints a picture of the continuing transfer of wealth to corporate Australia, causing \u201cgreedflation\u201d. Flowers and a fruit tree have popped up out of a pothole in the town of Wallan north of Melbourne, along with a sign that reads \u201cWallan Botanical Gardens\u201d. The Whittlesea Leader has appealed to their readers for information behind the unusual sight on the Northern Highway, with comments attesting to a collective frustration among the community at the lack of action to fix local roads. The issue of potholes have become particularly acute in towns like Wallan which were affected by last year\u2019s east coast floods which ravaged roads and transport networks creating an infrastructure crisis. Overseas in France, where potholes are known as \u201cnids-de-poule\u201d (literally \u201chen\u2019s nests\u201d), frustration over the state of the country\u2019s roads has also taken an ironic turn. The \u201cOperation Hen\u2019s Nest\u201d campaign has been running by the French Federation of Angry Bikers (\u201cLa F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise des Motards en Col\u00e8re\u201d) sets up mock hen\u2019s nests in potholes, adding signs or writing on the roads to alert users to their presence. Woodside\u2019s climate report falls short, activist groups says Along with its earnings (\u2018ka-ching\u2019) report, energy giant Woodside has also released its latest annual climate statement, which is always a tricky issue when you\u2019re a company based on digging up or drilling fossil fuels. Shareholders at last year\u2019s annual general meeting came close to rejecting the company\u2019s climate report for 2021, with only 51% approving it. Expect this year\u2019s report to be back on the AGM voting list, with Greenpeace, Market Forces and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility rejecting it to be a \u201cfail\u201d. The company states: Woodside aims to thrive through the energy transition by building a low-cost, lower carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio. (\u201cLower carbon\u201d, according to Woodside, is based on a comparison against \u201chistorical and/or current conventions\u201d.) Anyway, the company aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions of its scope 1 pollution (resulting from the production of gas and oil) by 15% by 2025, and 30% by 2030. To deal with emissions from users\u2019 burning the fuel, the company has set aside $US5bn for \u201ctargeted investments in new energy products and lower carbon services by 2030\u201d. Glenn Walker, head of Greenpeace Australia Pacific\u2019s advocacy and strategy, said Woodside had made almost no progress on plans to reduce emissions, despite setting an \u201caspirational\u201d net-zero goal by 2050. Walker said: Woodside\u2019s Climate Report is a schoolboy effort, essentially a rehash of its previous year\u2019s plan that betrays the company\u2019s lack of genuine commitment to emissions reduction. Woodside is betting the farm on a fantasy future increase in gas use that is utterly at odds with modelling from credible energy analysts such as the International Energy Agency. The Woodside-led Burrup Hub gas project, which would release more than 6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent pollution (or about 12 times Australia\u2019s national emissions), is among the firm\u2019s proposed projects. Will van de Pol, acting executive director of Market Forces, said Woodside\u2019s plans were \u201cincompatible with a net zero emissions by 2050 pathway\u201d. Woodside continues to promote a strategy that undermines climate action by paying big executive bonuses for increasing oil and gas production and progressing new oil and gas projects,\u201d van de Pol said, adding Market Forces urged investors to vote for the \u2018Capital Protection\u2019 shareholder resolution, vote against the company\u2019s remuneration report and reject directors standing for reelection at the company\u2019s AGM in April. Alex Hillman, ACCR\u2019s lead analyst, said fossil fuel companies like Woodside might have made \u201chuge profits\u201d in 2022 but such windfall gains would likely prove \u201cshort-lived\u201d as energy markets accelerate their shift towards renewables. Hillman said: Today, Woodside remains stubbornly rusted on to its underwhelming 2021 climate plan, saying its \u2018strategy remains consistent\u2019. Regardless of material investor concerns about the company\u2019s overreliance on offsets, Woodside has confirmed it still plans to use offsets to meet 100% of its restated scope 1 emission reduction target. Woodside\u2019s directors have a tin ear on climate risk and it\u2019s time they were called to account. April, it seems, would be the occasion for such an accounting, if there is to be one. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has called for the end of broad Covid-19 vaccine mandates in his state, saying the jab has no effect on transmission. Public health orders mandating vaccines for health professionals expired in November but some workplaces can require mandatory vaccination under their own applicable work, health and safety obligations. Perrottet told Sydney radio 2GB this morning: There is no evidence that vaccines in the current environment have any impact at all on transmission of Covid. I could not be clearer. He said health facilities imposed some vaccine requirements on workers before the pandemic, usually for influenza, and that was the point he wanted to get back to. In the areas of the public service that I can make that direction, I have it and it has been enacted. I\u2019ve also worked very closely with the private sector who have followed my position. According to the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance [NCIRS], Covid-19 vaccines are effective in preventing severe disease but are not as effective in preventing transmission. NCIRS advice states: The Covid-19 vaccines were designed to protect individuals from Covid-19 and severe disease. Like most vaccines, they were not designed to reduce transmission. Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) recommends adults get a vaccine booster if they haven\u2019t been vaccinated or caught the virus in the past six months, and are either over 65 or have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe Covid-19. \u2013 with AAP Former Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham has switched parties in the hope of re-entering NSW parliament for the Legalise Cannabis party, AAP reports. The party maintains the criminalisation of cannabis use and possession are both ineffective and unfair, and have a disproportionate impact on sick, young and Indigenous people. Also running on the party\u2019s ticket is former Australian Idol host James Mathison. The party is confident after having two upper house MPs elected in the most recent Victorian and Western Australian elections. Buckingham told AAP: We think there\u2019s a good chance [and] we\u2019re going to run a positive campaign. The majority of Australians now support legalisation. Medicinal cannabis use is growing across NSW, with close to 500,000 people using the drug nationally. Buckingham \u2013 previously an MLC for the NSW Greens \u2013 resigned from the party in 2018, saying it had become a \u201ctoxic\u201d organisation which had \u201cabandoned the core principles they were founded on\u201d. His resignation came after months of infighting and pressure from his parliamentary colleagues. Despite his controversial exit, Buckingham said he was ready to return to the political fray. I\u2019ve still got a lot of friends in the environmental movement. I\u2019ll be happy to work with the Greens to get cannabis law reform over the line. If elected, the party will push to make cannabis legal for adults and to change road rules the party says discriminate against users. It also wants criminal records for prior cannabis offences to be expunged. Severe thunderstorms predicted for the Hunter in NSW The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting severe thunderstorms for the eastern ranges and coastal hinterland of NSW this afternoon and evening. They said the Hunter region is facing the highest risk, with the possibility of destructive winds and giant hailstones as well as severe thunder. A court has ordered failed recycling scheme REDcycle be wound up following the discovery of tonnes of stockpiled plastic, AAP reports. NSW supreme court registrar Leonie Walton ordered the scheme\u2019s parent company RG Programs and Services be wound up today, appointing Benjamin Carson of Farnsworth Carson as liquidator. Supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths were partners in the scheme and on Friday offered to take back the plastic until it can be \u201cviably processed for recycling\u201d. The two companies say they paid $20m to REDcycle over a decade and were not told about the stockpiling. The scheme abruptly stopped operating in November and has since admitted to stockpiling more than 12,000 tonnes of plastic in NSW, Victoria and South Australia. REDcycle has previously denied the stockpiling was a cover-up, saying it was an attempt to ride out problems including a spike in returned plastics, a fire at its largest taker of the material and insufficient recycling capabilities in Australia. Supporting creditors will have to chase their own costs. Walton said: [It\u2019s] their choice to be here \u2013 up to them to take it up with the liquidator. Australia\u2019s biggest gas and oil company Woodside has done very nicely out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reporting today a full-year net profit after tax of $US6.5bn (or A$9.7bn). That was up 228% on a year earlier, and includes the proceeds of its takeover of BHP\u2019s oil assets. The main profit driver, though, was soaring global energy prices in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine a year earlier. The disruptions and subsequent sanctions on Russian energy helped push up the \u201crealised price\u201d of Woodside\u2019s production 63% to the equivalent of $US98.40 per barrel of oil. The market watches most closely the so-called underlying profit, which also rose 223% \u2013 or more than triple \u2013 to $US5.2bn. Investors were also keen on the dividend payout, which for the full year were $2.53 a share or 87% higher than the previous year. Woodside as one of the big gas producers has been unhappy about the Albanese government\u2019s invention to place a price cap of $12/gigajoule for domestic supply. Increasingly, though, the worry is what the ACCC is coming to come up with in terms of a mandatory code of conduct, reviews of prices and a \u201creasonable\u201d price test for future developments. To that end, the company was keen to state its payments in taxes and royalties had more than tripled in the past year to $A2.7bn. Woodside CEO Meg O\u2019Neill said in a statement accompanying today\u2019s results: [O]ur tax payments are expected to again increase significantly in 2023. Investors at least seem cheered by the numbers, with Woodside\u2019s share price recently up about 2.5% to $35.47. The gain was in stark contrast to overall market\u2019s drop of about 1% on concerns about higher inflation \u2013 and higher borrowing costs \u2013 in the US. Melbourne restaurant changes dress code after turning away Russell Crowe A high-end Japanese restaurant in Melbourne, Mr Miyagi, has changed its dress code after staff turned away Russell Crowe last week. Owner Kristian Klein told the Herald Sun\u2019s Page 13 that he stood by his staff\u2019s decision to ban Crowe, his girlfriend Britney Theriot and their guests saying their \u201cslobby gym gear\u201d didn\u2019t meet his restaurant\u2019s standards of dress. However, the restaurant has reconsidered its dress code sharing a sign on social media which reads: Dress smart casual unless you\u2019re Russell Crowe, then wear whatevs **management reserve the right to refuse entry. The post was accompanied by an open letter to Crowe in the caption: Dear Russell,\u2060 During your last visit it seems we got off on the wrong foot. After much reflection on what occurred, we have made a permanent change to our dress code. \u2060 We would love to see you again in the future, you\u2019re always welcome at Mr. Miyagi. Little relief in sight amid \u2018staggering\u2019 rise in rents In what won\u2019t be news for many who are renting, the cost of accommodation is soaring in many parts of the country, particularly for houses. According to data from PropTrack, rental increases are exceeding a third over the past year in the most stretched regions of Australia. With vacancy rates at below 1% in some places and the number of both overseas students and migrants picking up, more increases in prices are coming, as noted by our colleague Bridie Jabour: One effect of higher interest rates is that the ability of renters to get into the property market is reduced since their loan limits are reduced faster than real estate prices have fallen \u2013 so far, at least. According to ANZ, capital city prices will fall 10% in 2023, to bring the total peak-to-trough decline to 18%. \u201cA modest recovery in the latter part of 2024 remains our base case,\u201d it said last week. It\u2019s far from the busiest time for auctions, but the latest numbers so far don\u2019t point to a lot of panic selling. Figures from CoreLogic showed that preliminary clearance rates for the past week were just shy of 70% (before they\u2019ll be revised down a bit). The key change is that there were about a third fewer auctions than this time last year as would-be vendors hold off or even withdraw from their property from the market. Wider spread of Japanese encephalitis than previously thought, Victorian health department says A survey of more than 800 people in northern Victoria has found the Japanese encephalitis virus has infected more people than first thought, the Victorian Department of Health said. The survey, which also asked people to give a blood sample, found approximately one in 30 participants had evidence of having a prior Japanese encephalitis infection. The department says the results suggests many more people may have been infected than the 13 cases reported in last year\u2019s mosquito season. Participants who showed evidence of prior infection were identified in all three regions that took part in the survey: Loddon Mallee, Goulburn Valley and Ovens Murray. Victoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer Assoc Prof Deborah Friedman said: By finding more cases than we were previously aware of, this important research reinforces the risk to all in the community that mosquito-borne diseases pose \u2013 especially in light of recent flood activity. There are sensible steps people can take to avoid mosquito bites. Wear long, loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing, use insect repellents, clear stagnant water around homes or properties, and avoid the outdoors when mosquitoes are observed, especially at dusk and dawn. The eligibility criteria for vaccination against Japanese encephalitis has been extended to seven local government areas: Greater Bendigo, Northern Grampians, Hindmarsh, Horsham, Buloke, Yarriambiack and West Wimmera. \u2018Drastic increase\u2019 in principals wanting to retire early or quit, new research shows The number of school principals wanting to retire early or quit has tripled since 2019, research shows, as heavy workloads and teacher shortages place pressure on the sector. The research, released by the Australian Catholic University today surveyed about 2,500 principals in 2022. Sixty-five principals planned to quit or retire early in 2022 \u2013 more than triple than three years before than. It found heavy workloads and a lack of time to focus on teaching and learning were the top two sources of stress, followed by teacher shortages and mental health issues of students and staff, including burnout and stress. ACU Investigator and former principal Dr Paul Kidson said the numbers pointed to a worrying trend: It is a drastic increase when you look at the whole picture. Principals\u2019 workloads, stress caused by issues including the national teacher shortage across public, Catholic, and independent schools, and demands outside the classroom have escalated to unsustainable levels. This data shows serious dashboard warning lights flashing all over the place. These are warning signs that we have not seen so acutely before, and we have almost 2,500 people saying the same thing. \u2018No intention\u2019 of making super changes, PM says Anthony Albanese says his government has \u201cno intention of making changes in superannuation\u201d but says it wants to have a debate about its purpose \u2013 not exactly shutting down expectations that those with the biggest super balances could see their lucrative tax breaks trimmed down. The PM appeared on The Project last night, where he got a few questions on the potential super changes that others in the government have been discussing. On the table at this stage is the potential for tax concessions for super voluntary contributions (taxed at 15%, much lower than income tax) to be shaved down for people with balances over $3m \u2013 which is less than 1% of the country. Channel 10 showed the PM a clip of an interview during last year\u2019s election when Albanese said the government had no intention of making changes to super. Albanese responded: I said, we had no intention. That\u2019s not the objective here. But people are coming forward with ideas. We\u2019re not shutting down debate. It is appropriate there be debate about the policy future across a range of issues, particularly in the context of the trillion dollars in debt we inherited. But we have no intention of making changes in superannuation. We will have the debate about the purpose and the definition of what it is and try to enshrine that in legislation, so people get what the purpose is much more clearer. Albanese went on to say that the government \u201chad no changes\u201d. Of course, this is a common type of phrasing from governments considering changes, to say they have made no changes (with a \u201cyet\u201d often the unsaid but mutually understood part of that line): We\u2019ve had no changes. We\u2019re not here announcing changes. We are having a discussion about the purpose of superannuation. This is all hypothetical. So if we make an announcement, then you can scrutinise what that announcement is, but we\u2019ve made it very clear that no decisions have been made. Australia\u2019s T20 World Cup glory against South Africa In sporting news, Australia has taken out the T20 World Cup for the third time in a row, enjoying a 19-run victory over host nation South Africa. Player of the match Beth Mooney scored an unbeaten 74 from just 53 deliveries, helping to guide Australia for six for 156. You can read the full report from Raf Nicholson at Newlands: For the first time in Australia, a class action by former footballers is being launched agains the AFL for the effects of concussion injuries. It\u2019s an issue my colleague Stephanie Convery has been covering with powerful stories about what individuals like Terry Strong and their families have gone through. The Melbourne firm Margalit Injury Lawyers is bringing the action in the supreme court, and managing principal Michel Margalit has spoken to ABC News about the issue: We have been consulting with many, many former AFL players and AFLW players. It\u2019s astounding how many people have suffered from life-altering concussion-type injuries. At this time we have been building a case and we have intention in lodging a class action this week in relation to their loss of earnings and pain and suffering. At this stage, what we have been looking at is a public liability-type of claim which is separate to any of the compensation funds that currently exist. There are a number of piecemeal fund-related compensation schemes and what we\u2019re concerned about is that these funds do not properly compensate the players and the compensation available is much, much less and there aren\u2019t appropriate measures for redress if people are not happy. There\u2019s been a huge groundswell over the previous years. There\u2019s been class actions in America and in the UK. The class action in America garnered a settlement of almost a billion dollars, but there\u2019s also been more science emerging and it\u2019s not around the impact of concussion as such, but because that\u2019s been well-established since 1995, but we\u2019re now able to prove that these players who have ongoing symptoms that it\u2019s actually connected to their playing of football. Margalit says compensation is expected \u201cto be in the same vicinity as the NFL class action, so many hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d. Scamps on Liverpool plains Independent MP Sophie Scamps visited the Liverpool plains last week for a conference of farmers and traditional owners fighting Santos coal seam project and the accompanying Hunter gas pipeline. While the inland plains are a long way from Scamps\u2019 northern beaches seat of Mackellar, she said she was concerned about the project because her constituents\u2019 top concern remains climate action. Scamps told ABC News this morning: Strong action on climate change has been the No 1 issue for the people of Mackellar before and during the election. We just conducted a survey and strong action on climate change is one of the things top of mind for the people there. \u2026 We know that oil and gas can\u2019t go ahead anywhere. And that is what is proposed on the Liverpool plains. On the concerns from locals in the Liverpool plains, Scamps says: They are concerned about the impact on climate change, because methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases \u2013 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. They\u2019re also very concerned and we had people in tears, very concerned about the impact on food product ion on the farmland. The Liverpool plains, it is one of the most fertile pieces of land, matched only with the Ukraine, is the alluvial soil which is up to 10 metres deep there. It is Australia\u2019s food bowl and also the rest of the world\u2019s food bowl. So farmers are concerned about how this will impact their farming. They are concerned and any change to the levels of the land will make a huge impact. The subsidence that can happen with coal-seam gas mining would be a big problem for them. And then the other major is \u2013 how it will impact the water supply and the aquifers below the land. Because with coal-seam gas, you need to take out the water first. It needs to be expelled and evaporated and that will impact the aquifers below the land and we know that those aquifers in the Liverpool plains feed the Murray-Darling Basin. There\u2019s huge impacts down the line. So food security, water security, climate change and just destruction of the environment. Our rural editor Gabrielle Chan and photographer-at-large Mike Bowers were at the same conference.

Thousands gathered at Hamer Hall and video tributes came from Elton John, Hugh Jackman, Dolly Parton, Pink, Barry Gibb and Mariah Carey. Newton-John, who has a string of No 1 hits worldwide and starred in movies such as Grease and Xanadu, died in August aged 73. Members of Newton-John\u2019s family also gave touching tributes, with her husband John Easterling saying she was a \u201chealer\u201d. You have to understand, I wasn\u2019t an Olivia fan, I didn\u2019t know any Olivia music, I\u2019d never even seen Grease. But at this small theatre in Miami, she started singing Pearls on a Chain, and there was this healing moving through the audience. And it hit me like a laser beam in the chest, that Olivia was a healer, and this was one of her mediums of healing. IT outage at Gold Coast airport In more airport news, an IT outage at the Gold Coast airport has left passengers unable to check in for flights. Tudge advisers to front robodebt inquiry Top advisers to former human services minister Alan Tudge will appear at the royal commission into the unlawful robodebt scheme, AAP reports. The chief of staff and a former policy adviser to Tudge will front the inquiry in Brisbane at the fourth block of hearings into the automated debt assessment and recovery program. The robodebt scheme continued to operate for several years despite concerns it was unlawful, with some people taking their own lives while being pursued for debt. Tudge has already appeared before the inquiry, where he said his understanding of income averaging was that it had been used for decades and it did not occur to him it may have been unlawful: My mind was not acting as a lawyer. It was acting as an implementer of the policy. Tudge has since announced his resignation from federal politics, triggering a byelection in his outer-eastern Melbourne seat of Aston. Three other former social service ministers are also set to front the hearing this week. Stuart Robert and Michael Keenan will front hearings for the first time while Marise Payne will reappear after previously giving evidence in December. Annette Musolino, former chief counsel at the Department of Human Services, will also appear for the second time. The royal commission is set to hand down its report on 30 June after the deadline was extended when an extra 100,000 documents were produced. Hundreds of Jetstar travellers spent almost seven hours on the tarmac at Alice Springs airport yesterday. Their flight from Bangkok to Melbourne was diverted to Alice Springs after a passenger experienced a suspected stroke and required urgent medical assistance. Upon arrival into Alice Springs the passenger was taken to hospital by ambulance. While the aircraft was on the ground in Alice Springs, an electrical issue was detected, which required a replacement part to be sourced from Sydney. Jetstar explained that the 320 passengers had been stuck on board because the airport lacked customs facilities: As a domestic airport, Alice Springs does not have customs processing facilities and we worked with Border Agencies, the NT Police and the local Airport Authority to provide passengers with the option to disembark into a specially partitioned section of the Airport. They were then transferred directly onto the replacement aircraft. We worked with the local Airport to provide passengers with food, drinks and snacks. We appreciate this has been a lengthy delay and frustrating experience. Safety is always our first priority, and we thank passengers for their patience and understanding as we supported the passenger requiring urgent medical assistance and worked to get everyone else on their way as quickly as possible. The passengers from Thailand have arrived in Melbourne after a second aircraft flew them from Alice Springs yesterday afternoon. The government will set up a new cybersecurity office inside the Department of Home Affairs and investigate whether to ban the payment of ransoms to hackers, in the wake of major online attacks affecting millions of Australians. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and home affairs minister Clare O\u2019Neil will announce later today that it will establish a coordinator for cybersecurity, leading a National Office for Cyber Security, inside the Department of Home Affairs. It will lead a central response from the government to major cyber incidents. The government claims it has inherited \u201ca cyber mess\u201d from the former Coalition government. The new position will lead coordination and action on hacks like the Optus breach. The announcement will come in a cybersecurity roundtable that the PM will lead in Sydney today. Areas of discussion for that meeting will include whether the government should prohibit the payment of ransoms or extortion demands by cyber criminals, in a bid to deter such attacks \u2013 the logic being, that if Australians are legally banned from paying ransoms, criminals will have less chance of getting ransoms. The meeting will also discuss what impact such a ransom ban would have, as well as talk about boosting cyber skills and workforce through education or immigration changes. O\u2019Neil: The case for change is clear. Australia has a patchwork of policies, laws and frameworks that are not keeping up with the challenges presented by the digital age. Voluntary measures and poorly executed plans will not get Australia where we need to be to thrive in the contested environment of 2030. To achieve our vision of being the world\u2019s most cyber secure country by 2030, we need the unified effort of government, industry and the community. The expert advisory board\u2019s leader, Andy Penn, said Australia\u2019s national security and economic success \u201crely on us getting our cyber settings right\u201d: If we are to lift and sustain cyber resilience and security, it must be an integrated whole-of-nation endeavour. We need a coordinated and concerted effort by governments, individuals, and businesses of all sizes. Cyber attacks occurred last year with \u2018no cyber emergency response function\u2019, O\u2019Neil says A new national cybersecurity coordinator will be appointed today as the government wants to better prevent large-scale data breaches of people\u2019s personal details. The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, said it would have made a \u201chuge difference\u201d had the new coordinator and agency been in place when the Optus and Medibank cyber attacks occurred last year: When Optus hit \u2013 much to my shock as cybersecurity minister \u2013 there was no cyber emergency response function in the Australian government. I\u2019m really angry about that. Those events were completely foreseeable events that were completely not foreseen by the previous government. Now we dealt with those incidents well, but that is in spite of government structures, not because of them. Literally cabinet ministers stepped in and managed the incident in a way that is not sustainable when we are under basically relentless cyber attack. So what we will have now is an individual in the public service who is going to coordinate the response across government and make sure that not only are we deterring and preventing cyber attack \u2013 we\u2019re not going to reduce cyber risk to zero \u2013 that Australians can get up off the mat quickly get services restored, get their data protected, get their identity numbers changed. These are the sorts of things that this person would have been able to do much more seamlessly. Labor\u2019s lead narrows a month out from NSW election The NSW Coalition government appears to be closing the gap on Labor less than a month before voters decide who will lead the state for the next four years, a key poll shows. The Newspoll survey of 1,014 voters published in the Australian shows primary support for Labor has fallen by four percentage points since September to 36%, while the Coalition has gained two points to 37%. Premier Dominic Perrottet has increased his lead as preferred premier over opposition leader Chris Minns to 43% versus 33%. In September Perrottet led his opposition counterpart by 39% to 35%. But on a two-party-preferred basis Labor leads the government on 52% versus 48%, the poll published today found. If replicated across the state on election day on 25 March, Labor could win 42 seats and the Coalition 41, with crossbenchers likely to decide which party will form government. The Newspoll was conducted between 20 and 23 February. \u2013 AAP \u2018It really was a war zone\u2019 On the state of thousands still displaced a year on from the northern rivers floods, Murray Watt had this to say: There has been substantial progress in the recovery. When those floods hit we were talking about something like 18,000 people who\u2019ve been displaced from their homes across Queensland and New South Wales and obviously the numbers now are far fewer than that, but we have to be honest and acknowledge that there are people still living in situations that none of us would want to be living in. So we do continue to work with the New South Wales government to get people back in their homes as quickly as possible. But I guess it does reflect that just the sheer scale of this event. I\u2019ll never forget the scenes that I saw and it\u2019s more when I arrived there. It really was a war zone whether you\u2019re talking about the CBD or particularly places like South and North Lismore, which were just completely destroyed. And unfortunately, you know, as much as we might like to think that people would be back in their homes immediately, it does take a bit of time. But every time I go there, I\u2019m reminded of the urgency of getting things moving. I had another meeting with the NSW Reconstruction Commission, when I was there last week, to say if there\u2019s anything we can be doing at a federal level to help with it. Watt says the buy backprogram is \u201cdefinitely further advanced in Queensland than it is in New South Wales\u201d and expects the uptake in NSW to accelerate after 3oo to 400 offers are made by the end of AprilL But if the Queensland experiences any guide, once those offers do start being made, they do accelerate, and I\u2019d certainly be hopeful that will happen in New South Wales as well. Flood recovery funding The federal and NSW government have unveiled a $300m disaster recovery program in a bid to end the northern rivers\u2019 cycle of repair/damage/repair after floods. Emergency management minister Murray Watt is speaking to ABC radio a year after the devastating floods. Asked about whether this funding is only a drop in the ocean when a report out in January estimated the cost of the northern rivers flood disaster at close to $10bn, Watt insists the funding from governments has made a substantial difference, \u201cbut the reality is that the damage was immense and it can\u2019t be fixed immediately\u201d. Watt says this new funding will be different because the focus will be on building back not as it was before, but with better standards of flood mitigation: What\u2019s different about the funding that we\u2019re announcing today with the NSW government is that we\u2019re not just repairing roads and bridges and causeways to the same standard they were, which only guarantees that they\u2019re going to flood again in the future. We\u2019re actually making them more resilient so that when we do face future flooding, we hopefully can protect people a lot better than they were protected last time around \u2026 This kind of long-term thinking is something that we haven\u2019t really seen enough of at the federal level. And we\u2019re now partnering actively with state governments, we\u2019ve approved similar programs in Queensland and other states as well, because we want to make sure when we are spending what is literally billions of dollars recovering from these events, that we actually think about the future and try to limit that damage further down the track as well. $25m for Alice Springs community organisations The government is committing $25m to community organisations in Alice Springs as part of the federal response to alcohol-related crime and anti-social behaviour in the Northern Territory. The money is to provide funding certainty for organisations running wellbeing projects, remote outreach programs and alcohol projects. The funds were announced this month by Anthony Albanese but the specific organisations to receive the cash have now been named. Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney said the funding represented a two-year extension, which she said would \u201cgive organisations the certainty they need and allow them to continue the important work they\u2019re doing\u201d: Certainty in access to safety and community wellbeing services is critical for First Nations communities, especially children and young people living in and around Alice Springs. Marion Scrymgour, Labor MP for the NT seat of Lingiari, said the groups getting funding were \u201care at the coalface of the challenges facing our region\u201d: Having spent a lot of time with community organisations \u2013 I know how hard they work for our community. The organisations being funded include $6.3m for the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress Aboriginal Corporation, for transport, alcohol, violence intervention and family violence services; $1.3m for the Akeyulerre Aboriginal Corporation, for wellbeing and self-reliance projects; $2.6m for Bushmob Aboriginal Corporation, for remote outreach and youth residential rehabilitation; and $2.6m for drug and alcohol services for prisoners and transitional programs. Future emissions from existing and new Australian coal and gas production are likely to dwarf official government estimates and undermine the Albanese government\u2019s planned revamp of the climate change policy known as the safeguard mechanism, according to a new analysis. The analysis by the global research firm Climate Analytics, commissioned by climate groups, comes at the start of a two-day parliamentary inquiry hearing into the government\u2019s planned changes to the scheme. The safeguard is a Coalition policy that was proposed to limit pollution from 215 major industrial facilities but hasn\u2019t. You can read about its history and Labor\u2019s plan here. The Climate Analytics report, commissioned by the Solutions for Climate Australia, said the government appeared to have substantially underestimated the likely future emissions from coal and liquefied natural gas production. It said official projections for the LNG industry suggested a 20% rise by 2030. Climate Analytics estimated the increase above 2021 levels was likely to be 36%. For coalmines, the government projected a 10% fall in emissions. Climate Analytics projected at least a 23%, and possibly up to a 116%, increase. The report did not look directly at the economic impact on proposed developments of companies being required to either make deeper emissions cuts each year, or to effectively pay for cuts elsewhere by buying carbon offsets. But Climate Analytics\u2019 chief executive Bill Hare said he believed the likely result for fossil fuels developments would be rising direct emissions and a \u201cfree for all\u201d of offset use: The safeguard mechanism will therefore not work to drive emissions down as it\u2019s supposed to, particularly given the integrity issues found to be widespread within Australia\u2019s offset scheme by independent experts. You can read about what could happen given Labor has ruled out banning new fossil fuel projects here. Press freedom roundtable Attorney general Mark Dreyfus will today convene a press freedom roundtable in Parliament House, saying journalists should never be \u201ccharged or even jailed just for doing their jobs\u201d. Major outlets including Guardian Australia, the ABC, News Corp, Nine, SBS and Seven will attend the meeting, which the government announced last month. At the time, Dreyfus said the government \u201cbelieves a strong and independent media is vital to democracy and holding governments to account\u201d, and said improved protections for press freedom were needed. \u201cThe Albanese Government intends to progress legislative reform as a priority,\u201d he said, with Monday\u2019s meeting to discuss options for reform. The meeting will bring together two dozen organisations and companies, including the Alliance for Journalists\u2019 Freedom, the Right to Know Coalition, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, the Press Council, AAP, Australian Radio Network, First Nations Media, Private Media and Solstice Media. Dreyfus said: I\u2019m looking forward to a full and frank discussion about press freedom issues in Australia and further options for reform. A strong and independent media matters. There is agreement across the Parliament and the community that improved protections are overdue. Unlike the former government, which ignored successive bipartisan committee reports, the Albanese Government will progress press freedom reform as a priority. Future emissions from existing and new Australian coal and gas production are likely to dwarf official government estimates, new analysis shows. It could undermine the Albanese government\u2019s planned revamp of the climate change policy known as the safeguard mechanism, according to global research firm Climate Analytics. The research has been commissioned by climate groups and comes at the start of a two-day parliamentary inquiry hearing into the government\u2019s planned changes to the scheme. Also out today, the government is setting up a new agency set up to tackle mass cyber attacks, with the with prime minister Anthony Albanese today announcing the establishment of a coordinator for cybersecurity. The announcement of the new post as well as the release of a discussion paper about a new cybersecurity strategy will be made at the cybersecurity roundtable in Sydney today, which will be attended by business, security and tech leaders, as well as home affairs minister Clare O\u2019Neil. O\u2019Neil told ABC Radio the new agency would attempt to provide strategy and structure when cyber attacks occur as well as ensuring different parts of the government were effectively communicating with each other. Emergency management minister Murray Watt will be speaking to ABC Radio shortly a year, on from the Northern Rivers flood disaster. We\u2019ll bring you what he has to say. In Melbourne last night thousands of friends, family and fans gathered for a last farewell for Dame Olivia Newton John at her state memorial, which included speeches from her husband and daughter, as well as music from her friend Delta Goodrem. Let\u2019s get into it."

            "date": "2023-02-01T14:53:24Z",
            "content": "The chief executive of Darktrace has launched a staunch defence of the embattled cybersecurity company saying it is run with the \u201cgreatest integrity\u201d, after allegations of irregular sales, marketing and accounting practices raised by a US-based hedge fund. Poppy Gustafsson published a 1,200 word defence of the company she co-founded in 2013, after its share price collapsed to a record low after the publication of a highly critical 70-page report by New York-based Quintessential Capital Management (QCM) on Tuesday. \u201cWe embrace the scrutiny of the public markets,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it is also important to refute any unfounded inferences about the listed business we are today and push back in the strongest terms on any suggestions that this is a business that is not being run with the greatest integrity.\u201d Gustafsson said the purpose of publishing the lengthy statement was to \u201cexplain what we\u2019ve done to establish and enforce robust processes in our business\u201d. \u201cI stand by my team and the business I represent,\u201d she added. \u201cOur technology is world class, created here in the UK by some of the brightest minds. We will continue to address any legitimate questions that may arise.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, Darktrace launched a \u00a375m share buyback of 35m shares in an attempt to bolster investor confidence. Darktrace\u2019s share price has fallen more than a fifth since it was disclosed on Monday that QCM had taken short positions betting against its future performance. On Tuesday, the hedge fund published a 70-page report that alleged Darktrace employed questionable sales and accounting practices to drive up the value of the company before its multibillion pound flotation on the London Stock Exchange in 2021. The report also repeated criticism of the links between the management of Darktrace and Autonomy, both of which were founded by Mike Lynch. The controversial British billionaire is fighting extradition to the US over fraud charges relating to accounting irregularities before the $11bn (\u00a39bn) sale of Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard in 2011. Lynch denies all charges. On Wednesday, Darktrace said it had a \u201cresilient business model\u201d and $368m in cash that allowed it to continue to \u201csufficiently invest in its product pipeline, go-to-market strategy, business foundations and targeted mergers and acquisitions\u201d. Gordon Hurst, the chair of the company, said the \u00a375m buyback was the \u201cbest use of Darktrace\u2019s surplus cash in current market conditions\u201d. Investors were cheered by the financial vote of confidence pushing the company\u2019s share price back up 7% to 225p, after its record low of 198p on Tuesday. On Wednesday, QCM followed up its report by circulating a list of 27 questions for Darktrace to answer. Last year, the short seller Shadowfall launched a similarly scathing attack on Darktrace, while analysts at the UK investment bank Peel Hunt published a report citing anonymous Darktrace clients calling its products \u201csnake oil\u201d."

            "title": "German minister warns of \u2018massive\u2019 danger from Russian hackers",
            "date": "2023-02-26T17:38:30Z",
            "content": "Germany\u2019s interior minister has warned of a \u201cmassive danger\u201d facing Germany from Russian sabotage, disinformation and spying attacks. Nancy Faeser said Vladimir Putin was putting huge resources into cyber-attacks as a key part of his war of aggression. \u201cThe cybersecurity concerns have been exacerbated by the war. The attacks of pro-Russia hackers have increased,\u201d she said in an interview with the news network Funke Mediengruppe published on Sunday. The danger of state-sponsored and state-steered spying and sabotage activities remained very high, Faeser said. She called on the federal and regional governments to work together to fend off cyber-attacks and to \u201cpermanently continue to develop\u201d their ability to do so. \u201cWe are in competition with ever new manners of attack and technologies,\u201d she said. The government was expanding its Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), Faeser said, and she described efforts to \u201ccreate new instruments with which the security authorities can stop cyber-attacks and resolve them\u201d. Since Germany started supporting Ukraine with weapons deliveries and by introducing sanctions against Russia, cyber-attacks have been on the rise, in particular against energy providers and military organisations. Security experts have been warning of the considerable danger these pose to German domestic security, specifically the cyber-attackers\u2019 ability to target critical infrastructure, as well as political operations such as the Bundestag. The German parliament was the target of one of the biggest cyber-attacks Germany has ever faced, in May 2015, when the internal computer system was attacked, data was stolen and MPs\u2019 offices were forced offline. The GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, is believed to have been behind the attack. In 2020, the office of the then chancellor, Angela Merkel, was hacked. She revealed to parliament that emails had been obtained from her constituency office in what she called an \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpainful\u201d assault. Shortly after the start of the war against Ukraine, there was a wave of attacks in Germany, apparently originating from the hacker group Ghostwriter, which is alleged to be under the control of Russian intelligence services. In recent weeks, there have been cyber-attacks on everything from airports to town hall administration, affecting daily life to differing degrees. The Russian group Killnet recently announced it planned to pay closer attention to disrupting life in Germany. Digital experts have said Germany is under a state of \u201cpermanent fire\u201d from hackers. Financial institutes, armament factories, energy providers, humanitarian organisations and tax authorities have all been targeted. Experts say the attacks are often well disguised but cybercrime investigators frequently find that Russian hackers are behind them. Wolfgang Wien, the vice-president of Berlin\u2019s foreign intelligence service, BND, warned at a security conference in Potsdam last summer that Germany\u2019s digital world had been infiltrated by hackers from Russia and China in particular. \u201cRussia is in our networks, China is in our networks,\u201d he said. In recent analysis Google stated that Moscow was \u201cpulling out all the stops\u201d to recruit private hacker groups and attach them to the bandwagon of the GRU. Marc Korthaus, of the Berlin IT security company Sys11, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper that attacks were becoming increasingly politicised. When Germany made the decision this month to deliver Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, the number of attacks on German targets leapt, Korthaus said. \u201cHowever, those were not sophisticated or particularly demanding attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that worries us. Because these attacks are little more than a warning signal \u2013 and that is something we have to take seriously.\u201d Simpler attacks were often followed by more technically sophisticated ones, he said, with initial attacks often viewed as hackers \u201ctesting the waters\u201d. Alexander Vukcevic, the director of protection labs for the IT security company Avira, told the same paper: \u201cEvery time Europe intensifies its sanctions against Russia or accelerates aid to Ukraine, the hackers intensify their attacks.\u201d When the Bundestag voted in favour of tank deliveries, there was similar activity, though the parliament was able to fend off attacks to its own network. During the Munich Security Conference, at which the Russian invasion of Ukraine was the central talking point, hackers attacked Nato\u2019s IT systems. When Bulgaria said it was standing by Ukraine, Killnet attacked government computers in Sofia, Vukcevic said. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 March 2023 to correct a misspelling of the surname of Alexander Vukcevic."

            "title": "Darktrace hires EY to review finances after short-seller attack",
            "date": "2023-02-20T15:21:27Z",
            "content": "Darktrace has hired EY to conduct an independent review of its finances as it tries to defend itself against a hedge fund that alleges questionable marketing, sales and accounting practices at the cybersecurity company. The FTSE 250 company said the accountancy firm EY would provide \u201cadditional independent third-party review of its key financial processes and controls\u201d, in a statement to the stock market on Monday. A New York-based hedge fund, Quintessential Capital Management (QCM), has bet against Darktrace, taking a short position on shares. It accused Darktrace last month of a series of questionable and aggressive marketing, sales and accounting practices in a 69-page report. \u201cAfter a careful analysis, we are deeply sceptical about the validity of Darktrace\u2019s financial statements and fear that sales, margins and growth rates may be overstated and close to a sharp correction,\u201d QCM alleged. Darktrace strenuously denied the allegations. Poppy Gustafsson, its chief executive and co-founder, published a lengthy response saying that the company was run with \u201cthe greatest integrity\u201d and had \u201cworld class\u201d technology. Gordon Hurst, the chair of the Darktrace board, said: \u201cThe board believes fully in the robustness of Darktrace\u2019s financial processes and controls. As a sign of that confidence, we have commissioned this independent third-party review by EY. We look forward to the outcome of this review.\u201d Darktrace said it would report EY\u2019s findings but these would not be ready in time for half-year results on 8 March. Grant Thornton is the company\u2019s auditor. Quintessential\u2019s managing partner, Gabriel Grego, said: \u201cWe welcome Darktrace\u2019s decision to initiate an independent review of its finances. We hope that such review will be of sufficient granularity, scepticism and impartiality to provide insights about the dubious transactions we flagged in our report.\u201d The company had been struggling before Quintessential\u2019s report. Analysts and other hedge funds had raised concerns about Darktrace\u2019s business model and its technology. The company also has to contend with the difficulties around Mike Lynch, the co-founder of Darktrace and one of its largest shareholders. Lynch is fighting extradition to the US, where he is accused of fraudulently inflating the value of his previous technology company, Autonomy, before its \u00a38.4bn sale to Hewlett-Packard in 2011. Lynch denies the allegations. Darktrace shares dropped by 17% to 210p in the two days after the Quintessential report. Since then they have recovered to 266p, valuing the company at \u00a31.9bn. However, that is still far below their high of more than \u00a310 a share in autumn 2021, and just above the 250p price at which its shares floated on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. Its shares gained 3% on Monday after the appointment of EY. Lynch and his wife, Angela Bacares, have in recent months reduced the size of their Darktrace stakes to a combined 12% of the company, worth more than \u00a3210m at the end of last week. Quintessential\u2019s position did not appear in the latest daily short-selling data published by the Financial Conduct Authority, the regulator, suggesting that the hedge fund\u2019s activity is below the 0.5% of issued share capital mark at which it is required to disclose it. Previous disclosures showed that its short position climbed to 1.3%, before dropping gradually to 0.38% by 16 February. The UK-based Marshall Wace, one of the world\u2019s biggest hedge funds, also held a 1.07% short position on Friday. Marshall Wace disclosed its short position in October 2022. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 February 2023 to correct a misspelling of the first name of Mike Lynch."

            "date": "2023-02-21T14:00:02Z",
            "content": "Anthony Albanese will flag additional investment in Australia\u2019s military capability during a major speech in Canberra on Wednesday, while characterising the next steps in the contentious Aukus nuclear-powered submarine pact as the \u201csingle biggest leap in our defence capability in our history\u201d. Amid persistent speculation the prime minister will travel to the US in March to unveil next steps in Aukus, Albanese will use a speech to the National Press Club as a scene setter for the government\u2019s response to the landmark Defence Strategic Review, undertaken by the former defence force chief Angus Houston and the former defence minister Stephen Smith. The prime minister will confirm his intention to release an unclassified version of the defence review, along with the government\u2019s response, before the budget in May. Before those events, Albanese will give an undertaking on Wednesday that the military will be given the resources it needs both \u201cto defend our nation and deter potential aggressors\u201d. While the Aukus pact remains controversial with two former prime ministers and with neighbours in the region, including Indonesia and Malaysia, because of concern it could fuel a regional arms race at a time of escalating great power competition, Albanese will characterise the security arrangement between Australia, the US and the UK as \u201cthe future\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The prime minister will tell the press club Aukus \u201cfurther formalises the common values and the shared interest that our three nations have in preserving peace and upholding the rules and institutions that secure our region and our world\u201d and reflects Australia\u2019s view that \u201cpartnerships and alliances are key to our security\u201d. But Albanese will acknowledge that plugging capability gaps and contributing to regional stability will also require investments in sovereign defence capability, \u201cincluding advanced manufacturing\u201d, generating \u201cnew jobs, new industries and new expertise in science and technology and cyber\u201d. After a stark warning from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on Tuesday night that Australia is facing an unprecedented challenge from espionage and foreign interference, Albanese will also flag an intention to host a new cybersecurity roundtable next week. The event will bring together representatives from industry, civil society, security agencies and the public service \u201cto discuss the shared imperative we all have to upgrade and uplift our cybersecurity\u201d. Albanese will argue that Australia\u2019s intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to be resourced to counter complex threats ranging from foreign interference and \u201cviolent extremism in all its forms\u201d. The prime minister will say that the shooting at Wieambilla in Queensland, where two young police officers and a neighbour were gunned down in December, constituted \u201ca terrible reminder of the dangers of violent extremism\u201d. That attack, he says, underscores the importance of governments \u201ccontinuing to upgrade our national cooperation on gun reform\u201d. With opinion polls suggesting Albanese is now past post-election highs in voter approval, the prime minister will use the platform of the National Press Club on Wednesday to characterise his government\u2019s policy agenda as seeking to provide \u201cstability, confidence and security\u201d at a time of increasing \u201cvolatility and complexity and uncertainty\u201d. Albanese will argue that pursuing greater security for Australians also encompasses policy in the economy, in energy, industry, jobs and wages, and in strengthening Medicare and aged care. The prime minister will say that since coming to office the government has been \u201cconfronting a decade of national policy failures\u201d \u2013 domestic problems that have been compounded by global economic and security shocks. While battling shocks while in office is inevitable, \u201cthe measure of a government\u2019s performance and a nation\u2019s strength is not whether these events occur \u2013 it\u2019s whether we are prepared [and] how effectively we respond. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do to protect our people and our economy from the worst of the consequences, and it\u2019s what we learn. It\u2019s how we adapt and reform and improve.\u201d The prime minister will say that Australians are sick of political short-termism, stunts and scares, and tired of governments \u201cpicking phoney fights instead of tackling real problems\u201d. He will say the best way to counter a political culture corrosive to democracy \u201cis to demonstrate the capacity of government to deliver real improvement in people\u2019s lives\u201d and inject \u201ca greater sense of purpose to the work of government\u201d. Last month Albanese pitched this year\u2019s voice to parliament referendum as a gesture of trust in the Australian people at a time when increasing polarisation and misinformation means democracy needs to be \u201cnourished, protected, cared for, treated with respect\u201d."

            "content": "It is now 4pm in DC. Here are the key events that happened across the country today: A top White House cybersecurity adviser is set to retire next week, according to reports. On Wednesday, CNN reported that Chris Inglis is expected to depart the White House on February 15. Inglis is currently the National Cyber Director. Inglis, who has over forty years of national security experience, currently heads an office which was created in 2021 by Congress to advise the president on cybersecurity matters and to track how federal agencies manage their cybersecurity. The accused Libyan man behind the deadly 1988 Lockerbie bombing which killed 190 Americans has pleaded not guilty to three federal criminal charges in Washington DC. On Wednesday, 71-year old Abu Agila Mohammad Mas\u2019ud pleaded not guilty to two charges of an aircraft resulting in death and one charge of destruction of a vehicle used in foreign commerce, resulting in death. If found guilty, Mas\u2019ud faces life imprisonment. Former senior staff at Twitter began testimony on Wednesday before the House oversight committee about the social media platform\u2019s handling of reporting on Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. The hearing has set the stage for the agenda of a newly Republican-controlled House, underscoring its intention to home in on longstanding and unsubstantiated allegations that big tech platforms have an anti-conservative bias. Joe Biden is drew pantomime-type laughs and boos from the crowd in DeForest, Wisconsin as he chuckles about sparring with \u201cmy Republican friends\u201d during their heckling when he delivered the state of the union address last night. He spoke on the economy, already touting the low unemployment rate of 3.4%. Biden also talked about the bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, and how funds from that going into infrastructure are going to refurbish crumbling bridges and other structures in Wisconsin and across the country, boosting jobs and middle class incomes. Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz has been appointed by House speaker Kevin McCarthy to a select committee investigating the \u2018weaponization\u2019 of the government, NBC reports. Gaetz, who was one of the far-right Republicans that opposed McCarthy\u2019s nomination as House speaker, replaced Texas Republican Chip Roy, according to the outlet. During a press conference on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Biden put the Republicans who heckled during his SOTU address last night \u201con the defense.\u201d \u201cHe called members out on live television in front of millions of Americans and effectively put them on the defense\u2026 That\u2019s what the president did is put them on the defense.\u201d A new proposal in Missouri seeks to ban nearly all discussion of LGBTQ people, making it far more restrictive than Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law passed last year. Republican state senator Mike Moon\u2019s bill would only allow licensed mental healthcare providers to talk to students about LGBTQ issues and gender identity in K-12 public schools, and only if guardians grant permission first. A tense exchange between Republican congressman George Santos and Republican senator Mitt Romney was caught on video last night as Biden was due to deliver his address. \u201cYou ought to be embarrassed,\u201d Romney told Santos, who is expected to face an investigation by the House Ethics Committee following revelations that the freshman congressman falsified large portions of his biography. Joe Biden\u2019s strong performance at the State of the Union address last night was a blow to critics on the right \u2013 and within his own party \u2013 and seemed a certain boost to the chances of him running for a second term in the White House in the 2024 election. And amid questions over his age as the oldest US president in history, at 80, vice president Kamala Harris praised him as bold and vibrant in an interview this morning, while he boosted her in a celebratory tweet. That\u2019s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. We will be back tomorrow with the latest developments in US politics. Thank you. The US Navy has released dramatic photos of the suspected Chinese spy balloon that was shot down on Saturday. In a Facebook post, the US Fleet Forces Command wrote: \u201cSailors assigned to Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group 2 recover a high-altitude surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Feb. 5, 2023. EODGRU 2 is a critical part of the Navy Expeditionary Combat Force that clears explosive hazards to provide access to denied areas; secures the undersea domain for freedom of movement; builds and fosters relationships with trusted partners, and protects the homeland. At the direction of the President of the United States and with the full support of the Government of Canada, U.S. fighter aircraft under U.S. Northern Command authority engaged and brought down a high altitude surveillance balloon within sovereign U.S. airspace and over U.S. territorial waters Feb. 4, 2023. Active duty, Reserve, National Guard, and civilian personnel planned and executed the operation, and partners from the U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration, and Federal Bureau of Investigation ensured public safety throughout the operation and recovery efforts.\u201d A top White House cybersecurity adviser is set to retire next week, according to reports. On Wednesday, CNN reported that Chris Inglis is expected to depart the White House on February 15. Inglis is currently the National Cyber Director. Sworn into office in July 2021, Inglis, who has over forty years of national security experience, currently heads an office which was created in 2021 by Congress to advise the president on cybersecurity matters and to track how federal agencies manage their cybersecurity. In a statement to CNN, Inglis said that the office is \u201cis viable and valuable \u2013 in its capabilities, its people, and its influence on issues that matter: protecting our Nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, strengthening and safeguarding our technology supply chain, expanding pathways to good-paying cyber jobs, and so many more.\u201d The accused Libyan man behind the deadly 1988 Lockerbie bombing which killed 190 Americans has pleaded not guilty to three federal criminal charges in Washington DC. On Wednesday, 71-year old Abu Agila Mohammad Mas\u2019ud pleaded not guilty to two charges of an aircraft resulting in death and one charge of destruction of a vehicle used in foreign commerce, resulting in death. If found guilty, Mas\u2019ud, who is believed by US prosecutors to have built the bomb, faces life imprisonment. The bombing, which occurred on Pan Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988 above Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and another 11 people on the ground. The flight was traveling from London to New York. It is considered one of the deadliest terror attacks in American history. Last month, Scotland and US authorities announced that Mas\u2019ud was in American custody. A detention hearing has been set for later this month. Former senior staff at Twitter began testimony on Wednesday before the House oversight committee about the social media platform\u2019s handling of reporting on Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. The hearing has set the stage for the agenda of a newly Republican-controlled House, underscoring its intention to home in on longstanding and unsubstantiated allegations that big tech platforms have an anti-conservative bias. Recently departed Twitter employees speaking include Vijaya Gadde, the social network\u2019s former chief legal officer, former deputy general counsel James Baker, former head of safety and integrity Yoel Roth and former safety leader Anika Collier Navaroli. The hearing centers on a question that has long dogged Republicans \u2013 why Twitter decided to temporarily restrict the sharing of a story about Hunter Biden in the New York Post, released in October 2020. The Post said it received a copy of a laptop hard drive from Donald Trump\u2019s then-personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Hunter Biden had dropped off 18 months earlier at a Delaware computer repair shop and never retrieved. Twitter initially blocked people from sharing links to the article for several days, citing concerns over misinformation and spreading a report based on potentially hacked materials. \u201cAmericans deserve answers about this attack on the first amendment and why big tech and the swamp colluded to censor this information about the Biden family selling access for profit,\u201d said the Republican committee chairman James Comer ahead of the hearing, referring to Trump\u2019s characterization of the Democratic political establishment as a swamp. \u201cAccountability is coming,\u201d he added. In opening statements on Wednesday, the former Twitter staffers described the process by which the story was blocked, stating that it triggered Twitter\u2019s rules against sharing hacked materials. The article had been greeted with skepticism due to questions about the laptop\u2019s origins, and Twitter policy restricted the sharing of unlawfully accessed materials. While the company explicitly allowed \u201creporting on a hack, or sharing press coverage of hacking\u201d, it blocked stories that shared \u201cpersonal and private information \u2013 like email addresses and phone numbers\u201d \u2013 which the Post story appeared to include. The platform amended these rules following the Biden controversy. Roth, the former head of safety and integrity, said Twitter had acknowledged that censoring the story was a mistake. \u201cDefending free expression and maintaining the health of the platform required difficult judgment calls,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no easy way to run a global communications platform that satisfies business and revenue goals, individual customer expectations, local laws and cultural norms and get it right every time.\u201d Full story here: Joe Biden is drawing pantomime-type laughs and boos from the crowd in Wisconsin as he chuckles about sparring with \u201cmy Republican friends\u201d during their heckling when he delivered the state of the union address last night. The US president is referring to the uproar that ensued among Republicans in the House last night when, as he said, \u201cthey sure didn\u2019t like me calling them on it\u201d when he referred to some Republican members who want to cut the long-standing benefits programs Social Security and Medicare, the popular retirement and health insurance programs for seniors. There is no doubt that Biden is feeling confident. The event just ended and he stepped gingerly off the platform at the gathering in DeForest. He noticeably walks like a relatively fit 80-year-old \u2013 rather slowly \u2013 but has had fire in his speech last night and this afternoon. Such are the signs that he is preparing to announce that he\u2019ll run for president again in 2024, surely with vice president Kamala Harris on the ticket once again? He\u2019s now mingling with workers at the event, smiling, chuckling, taking selfies with them. Joe Biden is on a roll in Wisconsin this afternoon, touting the US economy and expanding on his theme at the state of the union address last night that, half way through his term, he wants to \u201cfinish the job.\u201d Inflation is still high but most experts believe it\u2019s peaked and the most recent jobs figures, the Democrats\u2019 performance in last November\u2019s midterm elections and the US president\u2019s performance in his address last night were better than expected, \u201cWe are building an economy where no-one is left behind,\u201d Biden said. He is pledging to \u201crestore the dignity of work\u201d the \u201cpride and self esteem\u201d that come with well-paid employment. Joe Biden is speaking now in DeForest, Wisconsin, on the outskirts of the state capital Madison. The US president is on a high after a strong performance at the state of the union address last night. He\u2019s speaking on the economy, already touting the low unemployment rate of 3.4%. He\u2019s also talking about the bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, and how funds from that going into infrastructure are going to refurbish crumbling bridges and other structures in Wisconsin and across the country, boosting jobs and middle class incomes. Hello again, it\u2019s been a lively day so far in US politics news as the ripples from Joe Biden\u2019s state of the union address, and the Republicans\u2019 response, continue across the reflecting pools of Washington and the sensibilities of the nation. The US president is due to make a fresh speech in Wisconsin at the top of the hour, where he will talk about the economy. We\u2019ll have that for you live so stick with us. Here\u2019s where things stand: Right-wing Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz has been appointed by House speaker Kevin McCarthy to a new select committee created since the GOP won a slim majority in the House, investigating the \u2018weaponization\u2019 of the government. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Biden put the Republicans who heckled during his SOTU address last night \u201con the defense.\u201d A new proposal by Missouri Republicans seeks to ban nearly all discussion of LGBTQ people, making it far more restrictive than Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law passed last year. A tense exchange between Republican congressman George Santos and Republican senator Mitt Romney was caught on video last night as Biden was due to deliver his address. The Utah senator thinks con artist Santos should be tossed out of congress. Joe Biden\u2019s strong performance at the State of the Union address last night was a blow to critics on the right \u2013 and within his own party \u2013 and seemed a certain boost to the chances of him running for a second term in the White House in the 2024 election \u2013 with vice president Kamala Harris on the ticket, too. Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz has been appointed by House speaker Kevin McCarthy to a select committee investigating the \u2018weaponization\u2019 of the government, NBC reports. Gaetz, who was one of the far-right Republicans that opposed McCarthy\u2019s nomination as House speaker, replaced Texas Republican Chip Roy, according to the outlet. Roy said that he spoke with McCarthy last night after Biden\u2019s State of the Union address. \u201cWe had a conversation. I thought it made sense for me to balance my life and to do what I need to do,\u201d Roy said, NBC reports. \u201cI would like to be on it but I\u2019ve got just way too much going on\u2026 I decided it would be better for everybody and for the cause to free that up,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Gaetz told NBC that he \u201cis honored to serve on the Weaponization Subcommittee and will be working very hard.\u201d During a press conference on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Biden put the Republicans who heckled during his SOTU address last night \u201con the defense.\u201d \u201cHe called members out on live television in front of millions of Americans and effectively put them on the defense\u2026 That\u2019s what the president did is put them on the defense,\u201d Jean-Pierre said, referring to several Republicans who jeered at Biden\u2019s assertions that Republicans want to slash social security and Medicare costs. \u201cThey keep saying they want to cut Medicare and social security. They want to put it on the chopping block. And so he\u2019s going to defend it with them on the defense again,\u201d she said. In response to criticisms from public health advocates who felt that Biden did not thoroughly address the opioid crisis and threat of fentanyl in his address, Jean-Pierre said: \u201cYou heard last night a powerful call to action\u2026for members of both parties to step up, come together and fight the flow of fentanyl\u2026which is something that you\u2019ve seen from this president\u2026 He understands we have homework to do\u2026but this cannot be a political issue. It\u2019s a matter really, truly, as we\u2019re seeing in communities, a matter of life or death. So that includes additional actions to go after traffickers, tougher penalties, expanding access to life-saving treatments\u2026 But what we saw from Republicans was jeers and casting blame and Republicans\u2026should come together to find solutions to can to tackle the same exact issues the president wants to tackle.\u201d A new proposal in Missouri seeks to ban nearly all discussion of LGBTQ people, making it far more restrictive than Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law passed last year. Republican state senator Mike Moon\u2019s bill would only allow licensed mental healthcare providers to talk to students about LGBTQ issues and gender identity in K-12 public schools, and only if guardians grant permission first. \u201cThis is protecting vulnerable children and attempting to protect them from conversations that need to be had with the approval of the parent and potentially at home,\u201d Moon told a Senate education committee, the Associated Press reports. Meanwhile, North Carolina senators on Tuesday passed their own limits on LGBTQ education in schools. Under the new bill, public school teachers would be required in most circumstances to notify parents before they address a student by a different name or pronoun. Georgia Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene who heckled at Biden last night pushed back against claims that far-right Republicans took the apparent bait from Biden whose calls for political unity was met with boos. \u201cI didn\u2019t take any bait\u2026 As a matter of fact, I got so many messages from people in my district and people across the country, it was like I won my election again. You know what, people are pissed off,\u201d she told CNN this morning. During Biden\u2019s SOTU address last night, Greene booed Biden and called him a \u201cliar\u201d following his assertion that some Republicans have proposed to cut social security and Medicare. During her interview with GMA on Wednesday morning, vice president Kamala Harris defended Biden\u2019s actions towards China\u2019s high-altitude balloon, which has been criticized by numerous Republicans. \u201cWe invite competition with China, but we do not seek conflict. We do not seek confrontation. What the president did\u2026it\u2019s consistent with our perspective and our commitment, which is we are prepared to compete, but at the same time, if there\u2019s any violation of our sovereignty, we\u2019re going to act. And that\u2019s what the president did,\u201d she said. Republicans have fired at the Biden administration over its wait to shoot down the Chinese balloon, arguing that the delay jeopardized US security and could have potentially endangered American citizens. In response to a question about the prospect of bipartisanship amid tense relations with the GOP, Harris said, \u201cThe president, it\u2019s his nature and it\u2019s his commitment to the American people to work across the aisle. That\u2019s not going to stop even if some people are cynical about it.\u201d Following Biden\u2019s SOTU address last night where he called for universal preschool and teacher raises, the president tweeted on Wednesday, \u201cLet\u2019s give public school teachers a raise.\u201d During his address last night, Biden said: \u201cRestoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class. When we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world. But the world has caught up.\u201d The country is currently facing a teacher shortage as a result of low wages, high stress and an increasingly divided educational culture war following conservative pushback against topics such as American history, racism, gender and sexuality, among others. A tense exchange between Republican congressman George Santos and Republican senator Mitt Romney was caught on video last night as Biden was due to deliver his address. \u201cYou ought to be embarrassed,\u201d Romney told Santos, who is expected to face an investigation by the House Ethics Committee following revelations that the freshman congressman falsified large portions of his biography. Romney later told reporters that Santos \u201cshouldn\u2019t have been there\u2026\u201d \u201cGiven the fact that he\u2019s under ethics investigation, he should be sitting in the back row and being quiet instead of parading in front of the president,\u201d he said. Joe Biden\u2019s strong performance at the State of the Union address last night was a blow to critics on the right \u2013 and within his own party \u2013 and seemed a certain boost to the chances of him running for a second term in the White House in the 2024 election. And amid questions over his age as the oldest US president in history, at 80, vice president Kamala Harris praised him as bold and vibrant in an interview this morning, while he boosted her in a celebratory tweet. The whole show appeared to amplify the steady drumbeat that Biden will run again \u2013 and put Harris on the ticket with him as he did in 2020. The president presented his administration\u2019s achievements at last night\u2019s speech including record job growth. He also called on Republicans to help him \u201cfinish the job\u201d of ensuring economic recovery and healing sociopolitical divides across the country. \u201cTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can\u2019t work together in this new Congress,\u201d said Biden, adding, \u201cPride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years.\u201d Biden also addressed other major issues including US-China relations, threats to social security and Medicare, police violence, gun control, reproductive rights, and political violence. Notable guests at the address included Tyre Nichols\u2019 family, Monterey Park shooting hero Brandon Tsay, U2 singer Bono, Paul Pelosi and Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova. Harris praised Biden, saying that he \u201cdid a great job.\u201d Good morning, US politics readers. We are coming off the back of Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address last night where he presented his administration\u2019s achievements since taking office in 2021 and condemned Republicans seeking to cut social security and Medicare \u2013 to which a few responded with boos and heckling. During what some saw as a \u201csoft launch for his 2024 campaign,\u201d Biden also addressed the US being in the \u201cstrongest position in decades\u201d to challenge China, called for the need of meaningful policing as Tyre Nichols\u2019 family watched on from the audience, and condemned rightwing threats to democracy. In response to Biden\u2019s address, Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders delivered her own speech, calling the president \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cunfit to serve.\u201d The former president Donald Trump\u2019s White House press secretary also condemned his Democratic supporters, calling them the \u201cwoke mob\u201d and \u201cradical left\u201d. As we bring you the latest on today\u2019s US politics, here\u2019s what we can expect today: Biden will deliver remarks on the economy later this afternoon in Madison, Wisconsin. Vice-president Kamala Harris will travel to Atlanta, Georgia to participate in a conversation on climate change. Three former Twitter executives will testify at the House oversight committee over the social media platform\u2019s handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story."

            "date": "2023-02-02T06:00:53Z",
            "content": "Turn up. Take the temperature of the economy. Raise interest rates. That\u2019s the been the pattern from the responsible technocrats at the Bank of England for more than a year now \u2013 and they show no sign of stopping. Between the depths of the global financial crisis in March 2009 and the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, interest rates were changed only five times, and three of those were in response to unexpected shocks: one after the Brexit vote in 2016, and two at the arrival of the pandemic in 2020. There was one period of more than seven years when interest rates were pegged at 0.5%. All that has changed in the past year or so, a period in which Threadneedle Street has become hyperactive. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has raised official borrowing costs at each of its last nine meetings, taking interest rates from 0.1% \u2013 the lowest since the Bank was founded in 1694 \u2013 to 3.5%. A 10th increase is expected at noon on Thursday. Critics of the Bank say it\u2019s being forced to play catchup after getting inflation forecasts hopelessly wrong. Supporters say this is only true with the benefit of hindsight. What is certain is that Thursday\u2019s decision comes at a time when the Bank is facing an acute policy dilemma. On the one hand, the economy is showing signs of weakening. Higher mortgage costs have taken the heat out of the housing market, with the Nationwide building society reporting a fifth monthly fall in property prices. Business failures are rising as tougher financing conditions wipe out \u201czombie\u201d companies only viable while rates were at ultra-low levels. The International Monetary Fund said this week the economy would contract by 0.6% this year and the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading industrial nations to go backwards. Faced with this scenario in previous years, the Bank would have been cutting interest rates, not raising them. Yet, after peaking at a 40-year-high of just over 11%, inflation as measured by the consumer prices index has fallen back only slightly and is still above 10%. The Bank\u2019s legally mandated job is to bring inflation back sustainably to its 2% target and the MPC is concerned that if it allows price pressures to become embedded they will be hard to shift. The fact that the latest MPC meeting takes place against a backdrop of widespread industrial action, prompted by workers seeking to maintain their living standards in the face of a rising cost of living, will make some members of the committee even more determined to act decisively. The dilemma facing the MPC is encapsulated by the differing views of what the Bank should do from two of its former members. David Blanchflower said based on the \u201cbleak\u201d growth outlook and falling inflation, he would be voting for a one percentage-point cut in interest rates. \u201cYou cut rates in a recession, you don\u2019t raise them to make it worse,\u201d he said. Andrew Sentance, by contrast, said there was evidence high inflation was increasing wage pressures and he would be voting for a half-point increase to 4%. \u201cYou have to create some slack in the labour market. That\u2019s not something you really want to do but the labour market is quite tight and a bit more slack would be helpful in dampening down inflationary pressure.\u201d The current MPC is no less split. At its last meeting in December, six members voted to raise rates by 0.5 points, two wanted them left unchanged and one voted for a 0.75 point increase. A similar lack of unanimity is expected on Thursday, with the committee divided between those who think raising rates further risks overkill, and those who think tough action now will avoid the need for even tougher action later. The interest-rate doves see the risk of an unnecessarily deep recession, while the interest-rate hawks are concerned by core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy and food \u2013 running at above 6%. Despite the gloomy forecast from the IMF, the Bank is likely to be less downbeat than it was three months ago, the last time it delivered a health check on the economy. Two things have made the picture slightly brighter: the financial markets have calmed down since the end of Liz Truss\u2019s short-lived premiership; and global energy prices have fallen. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s downbeat prediction in November of a record two-year long recession and a doubling of unemployment illustrates the perils of forecasting when so much depends on volatile factors such as gas prices. \u201cThe significant fall in wholesale gas prices in the last few months means inflation should fall faster and the economy shrinks by less, and for less time, than the Bank of England anticipated three months ago. \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s growth forecast will also receive a boost from the decline in market interest rate expectations. Three months ago, investors expected Bank rate to peak at around 5.25%. Now, they expect a peak of around 4.25%.\u201d At a time when other leading central banks are raising rates, anything other than a half-point increase would be a surprise. Assuming that is the case, attention in the markets will turn to whether an 11th and even a 12th successive rate rise is in prospect. Lord Mervyn King, a former Bank governor, once said that the success of a central bank should be judged by how boring it was. Currently, the Bank of England is anything but."

            "date": "2023-02-26T00:05:05Z",
            "content": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves through the global economy and now, a year on from the start of the attack, the world is fundamentally changed. Trends that were already in motion have accelerated, as the need to move away from fossil fuels to greener, renewable energy supplies became more urgent. Food prices have soared, increasing hunger in the developing world, and forcing governments, businesses and people to adapt to lasting shifts. Here we take a look at five ways the global economy has changed: Inflation The surge in global energy prices since the invasion has pushed inflation across advanced economies to its highest levels in decades, squeezing household incomes and weighing on economic growth. In the UK, soaring gas and electricity bills drove inflation to a peak of 11.1% in October, the highest level since 1981. The inflation surge led central banks to increase interest rates, which drove up borrowing costs for households and businesses. Mortgage costs in the UK and several other nations have risen sharply, stoking fears of a property crash. Economists expect inflation to cool rapidly over the coming months, as the initial surge in energy prices drops out of the calculation for the annual increase in rising living costs. However, gas and electricity prices remain much higher than before the invasion. Jim Watson, director of the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, said: \u201cBy April, UK household bills will have trebled in the space of two years, pushing millions more households into fuel poverty.\u201d Green transition Western nations have scrambled to cut their reliance on Russian oil and gas by building up domestic supplies, writes Damian Carrington. While this has involved renewed investment in fossil fuels, and reopened debates on fracking, windfall taxes and industry reform, Putin has also unwittingly accelerated the transition to renewables. New analysis from Zero Carbon Analytics shows the EU has already found substitutes for nearly 75% of Russian fossil gas imports, and that global gas demand has plateaued for the first time. \u201cBefore its invasion of Ukraine, Russia was by far the world\u2019s largest exporter of oil and natural gas,\u201d it said. \u201cSince the war, its standing has severely diminished. Flows of Russia\u2019s pipeline gas to Europe have plummeted by 80% in just a year. At the same time, the cleaner alternatives to Russian fossil fuels are growing rapidly \u2013 renewable power capacity worldwide rose by about a quarter in 2022.\u201d Seb Kennedy of consultancy TransitionZero said Europe was now building renewable energy supplies at a faster pace: \u201cThe past year has seen a fundamental shift away from coal and gas power, with support for renewables taking on new urgency that shows no sign of waning.\u201d Global development Russia and Ukraine are, respectively, the world\u2019s largest and fifth-largest exporters of wheat, accounting for almost a third of global exports. They are also significant producers of fertilisers and other essential commodities. As war disrupts these supplies, food prices have rocketed to unprecedented levels. While this has posed challenges globally, developing nations that are net food importers are particularly exposed. Countries in north Africa and the Middle East are among the biggest buyers of Russian and Ukrainian wheat. But these poorer countries are facing a double whammy. Moves by the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in response to soaring inflation has pushed up the value of the dollar, making it more expensive for developing countries to import goods and borrow money on global markets denominated in the US currency. Trade International trade was already fragmenting before the Russian invasion, but the trend has been accelerated in the past year amid rising geopolitical tensions and concern over supply chain security. After the disruption caused by Covid, and with an eye on the conflict and shifting global relations, companies have pushed to reshore or \u201cfriendshore\u201d production, bringing it closer to home. Russia itself had relatively few export links with the rest of the world \u2013 it deals mainly in commodities \u2013 but has found itself further isolated as a result of sanctions. However, these were applied mainly by western countries; Russia\u2019s trade with Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America has grown. Ian Stewart, chief economist in the UK at accountancy firm Deloitte, said: \u201cThe lure of cheap raw materials from Russia is spurring sanctions avoidance on a previously unseen scale. Russian oil shunned by the EU has found ready customers in China, India and Turkey.\u201d End of the oligarch? Russia\u2019s oligarchs lost almost $95bn last year as the result of sanctions: they have been shedding $330m a day ever since the Kremlin launched its invasion. Questions have been raised over whether the influence of the country\u2019s politically connected business elite has been permanently diminished, after years of accumulating luxurious London properties, superyachts and football clubs. Roman Abramovich, the former Chelsea FC owner, was the biggest loser, seeing his fortune fall by 57% to $7.8bn, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. However, there are signs that the clampdown hasn\u2019t worked as well as had been hoped. Sanctions enforcement has proved patchy, with regulations varying widely between countries. Progress in the UK to close loopholes in transparency rules has been slow. Meanwhile, oligarchs have been offered shelter by jurisdictions outside the sanctions zone, such as Turkey and the UAE."

            "content": "If the Reserve Bank\u2019s record run of interest rate rises is sapping the heat out of the economy, Shannon Battisson isn\u2019t detecting it. Battisson is national president of the Australian Institute of Architects, representing 14,000 members across the nation, and the director of architecture firm The Mill. It\u2019s an industry that is usually highly sensitive to the rising cost of debt, but Battisson\u2019s Canberra-based practice retains \u201ca huge waitlist\u201d for residential work. \u201cCertainly the end of last year was just crazy, crazy busy in the profession,\u201d she says. Staff were worried clients would abandon potential projects as interest rates climbed but \u201cwe certainly haven\u2019t seen that\u201d. The firm\u2019s more nationally based commercial work, too, has \u201cgrown steadily\u201d since the first Covid lockdown. \u201cThere\u2019s momentum really across the board,\u201d Battisson says, according to conversations she\u2019s had with the institute\u2019s national council. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Building supply giant Boral also posted a jump of more than 50% in first-half profit in a \u201cdifficult inflationary environment\u201d. Such buoyant sentiment is not universal. The building sector remains a hotspot of commercial failures as companies struggle to find workers and cope with soaring costs for cement, steel and other materials. But these are examples of what RBA governor Philip Lowe referred to in Tuesday\u2019s 25 basis-point hike in the cash rate as the \u201cstrong domestic demand\u201d stoking inflationary pressures. Indeed such strength is why the RBA expects \u201cfurther increases in interest rates will be needed over the months ahead\u201d to quash those pressures. Underlying inflation \u2013 a gauge that strips out the more volatile changes \u2013 ran at a record annual clip of 6.9% in the December quarter, well outside the central bank\u2019s 2%-3% target range. For experts such as Timo Henckel, a professor at the Australian National University and a member of a \u201cshadow RBA board\u201d, a key risk is that the central bank jacks up its cash rate too high. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be caught out again and being overly \u2018dove-ish\u2019, like they were a year ago\u201d when the RBA was slow to start lifting rates, Henckel says. Hence \u201cthe slightly more \u2018hawkish\u2019 stance\u201d this past week. Uncertainties of monetary policy \u2013 including how responsive the economy might be to higher interest rates \u2013 means the RBA could go too far. Some researchers reckon interest-rate impacts will be felt more sharply and for longer than in the past. Australia\u2019s financial mix may also make the economy particularly twitchy. About 800,000 mortgages will soon shift from fixed rates of about 2% to more than double that this year as loan periods expire, joining the 85% or so of borrowers already on those variable and rising rates. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cPlus, you\u2019ve just got a higher \u2013 a much higher \u2013 level of [household] debt compared to most other countries as well,\u201d Henckel says. \u201cSo that adds to the sensitivity.\u201d Denita Wawn, CEO of the Master Builders Australia, says demand for builders is \u201cshowing signs of dipping [amid] the strong uplift in interest rates\u201d. \u201cWhile we are seeing a slowing in demand for new homes, we recognise the Reserve Bank has a difficult challenge to strike the right balance when curbing inflation,\u201d she says. Master Builders forecasts new-home building activity will decline over the short-term before rebounding by 2026-27 \u2013 when inbound migration recovers, fostering more demand and helping to alleviate some of the industry\u2019s \u201clabour challenges\u201d, Wawn says. The MBA, much like the architects in Battisson\u2019s firm, sees government spending shoring up work in the sector. During the pandemic, state and federal authorities announced projects that are only getting started now or will do soon \u2013 the kind of work that is largely immune to higher lending rates. \u201cAs we wait for the recovery in private sector demand to play out, the role of the government and other public sector entities will be crucial in supporting demand for building and construction,\u201d Wawn says. Kristen Beadle, manager public practice at CPA Australia and an expert in corporate insolvencies, says she\u2019s already seeing \u201ca significant increase in the number of companies entering some kind of external administration\u201d. The level of such business strife is now reaching pre-Covid levels, catching up in part after a moratorium imposed during the early lockdowns to avert a cascade of corporate failures. Still, the pickup is a lagging indicator given the often lengthy time it takes for companies to deploy various survival strategies \u2013 such as stringing out payments to creditors and suppliers \u2013 before calling in outsiders. \u201cWe will probably see more come into play in the first half [of 2023],\u201d Beadle says. While much of the focus has been on the so-called \u201cmortgage cliff\u201d of higher repayments facing households when they refinance fixed-interest loans, a similar problem faces many businesses, she says. And since many owners of small companies put up their homes as collateral for loans, forced home sales often follow business failures. Andrew McKellar, CEO of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry representing 160 business associations, shares the view that the RBA should be careful not to overestimate the economy\u2019s health. A recent ACCI-Westpac Survey of Industrial Trends showed general conditions \u201cdeteriorating considerably\u201d in the last three months of 2022. New orders were flat just as firms were battling rising energy bills, supply chain constraints and labour shortages \u2013 and now higher debt repayments. \u201cWe have already seen that lending for new homes has plummeted, with recent ABS data showing its plunged by 62.4% since a peak in January 2021,\u201d McKellar said. \u201cWe do want to see inflation ease, but we don\u2019t want to see the Reserve Bank squeeze the life out of the economy in the process.\u201d"

            "content": "The impending recession could leave borrowers struggling to repay their debts, the high street bank Santander UK has said as it put aside more cash to protect itself from potential defaults. The UK arm of the Spanish bank said on Thursday that while the outlook for the British economy remained uncertain, a recession in 2023 was likely. It said that despite government support for energy bills, rising prices would continue to eat away at disposable income, which \u201ccould impact lending repayments\u201d. The warning was issued alongside the bank\u2019s full-year results, which showed the lender put aside \u00a3321m in 2022 to cover potential defaults, compared with the \u00a3233m it released a year earlier as Covid restrictions began to lift. The higher figure was because of the \u201cdeterioration in the economic environment\u201d, including higher interest rates, lower economic growth, and a drop in house prices, which Santander predicts will fall by about 10% to levels not seen since 2021. \u201cThese challenges for households and businesses are expected to continue into 2023 and could impact credit quality,\u201d the bank said, referring to the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and mortgages. On Wednesday Virgin Money set aside \u00a366m to cover a possible rise in bad debts in the first quarter. However, the challenger bank said repayments had been stable so far. Santander\u2019s provision for potential defaults weighed on the lender\u2019s profits, which rose just 2% to nearly \u00a31.9bn over the year to December. The flat growth was despite a 12% increase in net interest income to \u00a34.5bn, as the interest rate rise allowed it to charge more for mortgages and loans. Profits were also subdued by the \u00a3421m it put aside to cover the cost of fraud and scams, as well as a \u00a3108m regulatory fine from the Financial Conduct Authority. In December, the UK regulator issued the bank with a penalty over \u201cserious and persistent\u201d gaps in its anti-money laundering controls between 2012 and 2017. Santander UK said it was also affected by a \u201cmarked slowdown\u201d in mortgage lending at the end of the year as interest rates increased to 3.5%. \u201cThe global economic environment and rising cost of living have presented challenges for many of our customers and clients,\u201d Santander UK\u2019s chief executive, Mike Regnier, said. \u201cOur focus has been to provide targeted and practical support, including advice on household budgeting and a toolkit for SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises] to help them through the ongoing inflationary pressures.\u201d Overall, the Spanish banking group reported an 8% drop in profit to \u20ac15bn (\u00a313bn)."

And it creates children who question: \u2018Why are things the way that they are in society?\u2019\u201d Offered in some form at most US colleges and universities, African American studies \u2013 an interdisciplinary field that examines the history, culture and politics of Black Americans \u2013 isn\u2019t always found in high school curriculums. That could change soon thanks to a new advanced placement (AP) exam by the College Board, the country\u2019s largest standardized test company. High schools are incentivized to offer their AP courses because many colleges and universities grant students credit for passing marks on AP exams. But few AP courses have been as divisive as this one. AP African American studies is the product of nearly a decade of work by the College Board, prominent African American studies scholars and high school educators. A pilot version of the course is being taught by 60 teachers across the country, and the exam won\u2019t officially launch until 2025. But it became a heated national controversy last month after Florida\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, vowed to block schools from teaching the course, saying it violated state law and \u201csignificantly lacks educational value\u201d. The Florida education department then cited examples in the pilot of what it termed \u201cwoke indoctrination\u201d that would run afoul of recently passed Florida laws that clamp down on class discussions about racism. Among the things Florida objected to: the course\u2019s discussions on reparations, queer studies, feminist thought and intersectionality \u2013 referring to the way various systems of oppression are interconnected. The state also singled out the inclusion of writings by Black scholars like Angela Davis (for being a \u201cself-avowed Communist and Marxist\u201d), bell hooks (for using the phrase \u201cwhite supremacist capitalist patriarchy\u201d), and Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, who coined the term \u201cintersectionality\u201d to describe the way different forms of oppression interconnect. That led to another firestorm last week, when the College Board published a revised framework for the course \u2013 on the first day of Black History Month \u2013 with those scholars\u2019 writings removed, along with all other secondary sources. The new version also changed Black Lives Matter from a required to an optional topic, and added \u201cBlack conservatism\u201d as a potential research subject. The blowback was swift. David J Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, called the move \u201cinfuriating\u201d. Crenshaw said that the revisions were reinforcing a system of \u201csegregated education\u201d in the country. Ta-Nehisi Coates, another prominent intellectual struck from the course, said the College Board shouldn\u2019t have to bend to politicians who \u201cjust want a curriculum that makes people feel comfortable and feel good about themselves\u201d. The College Board quickly issued a statement denying that the changes were politically motivated, claiming that it had finalized its revisions before DeSantis\u2019s rebuke. However, on Thursday, a leaked letter from the Florida department of education claimed the College Board had been in consistent contact with the DeSantis administration about the course. The letter details numerous complaints made by the administration to the College Board about the teaching of topics such as intersectionality and the social construction of race, claiming that they would not comply with Florida law. The College Board issued a letter of its own denying that the concerns of the administration had in any way shaped the course changes. It said: \u201cWe never received written feedback from the Florida education department specifying how the course violates Florida law, despite repeated requests.\u201d Then, in a slightly frantic PR strategy, the College Board released a new letter on Saturday acknowledging it had made \u201cmistakes in the rollout that are being exploited\u201d but wanted to \u201cclear the air and set the record straight\u201d. It went on to accuse the Florida education department of \u201cslander\u201d and said scholarly articles were still to be added to the course. \u201cWe should have made clear that contemporary events like the Black Lives Matter movement, reparations, and mass incarceration were optional topics in the pilot course,\u201d it wrote, adding that \u201cFlorida is attempting to claim a political victory by taking credit retroactively for changes we ourselves made but that they never suggested to us.\u201d This robust, at times enraged statement, is a contrast in tone to a New York Times interview given by David Coleman, the head of the College Board, on 1 February. Then he justified the removal of works by contemporary Black scholars by saying students might struggle to connect with secondary sources by theorists as they were \u201cquite dense\u201d. Despite what the College Board now says, earlier versions of the syllabus included structural racism, racial capitalism, mass incarceration, reparations, intersectionality and Black Lives Matter as required topics. Later revisions do downgrade these topics to optional, while introducing other new optional topics like Black conservatism. Ridgeway, the Philadelphia public high school teacher, called that \u201ca cop-out\u201d. Her students learn better by reading both primary and secondary sources, and removing scholars like Davis, hooks and Crenshaw would only lead back to the same kind of depoliticized history she was taught growing up, she says. And even if theoretical texts might be dense, teachers can find ways to make them more accessible. \u201cHow dare you deprive them of the opportunity to learn from different perspectives of incredible intellectuals within the field?\u201d Ronda Taylor Bullock, a former high school teacher who now runs We Are, a non-profit that provides antiracism training for children, parents and educators, agrees: \u201cThe changes that are happening aren\u2019t edits \u2013 they\u2019re the erasure of Black voices, Black academics, Black experiences. It\u2019s cowering to white supremacy, cowering to political power, versus recognizing the academic merits of how the curriculum was from the beginning.\u201d But one teacher who has been teaching the pilot course says the uproar is overblown. Melissa Tracy, a Delaware charter school teacher among the 60 chosen for the trial by the College Board, says she\u2019s \u201cstill in the process of digesting the new changes\u201d, which \u201care to be expected in a pilot\u201d. The course is no different than any other AP course she\u2019s taught, \u201cand you can supplement your curriculum as needed with secondary sources, projects, et cetera. That\u2019s always been the case with AP since day one, since I started teaching AP in 2008.\u201d It\u2019s also not the first time that an AP course has been caught in a political maelstrom. In 2014, the Republican National Committee blasted a framework for AP US history as anti-American, saying it \u201cemphasizes negative aspects of our nation\u2019s history while omitting or minimizing positive aspects\u201d. That prompted the College Board to issue a revised framework emphasizing that teachers would have leeway to develop their own examples for the course. Adam Laats, a historian of American education, argues that the College Board isn\u2019t so much making political choices as market calculations. \u201cThe company makes $96 per student, per test. And the company just wants the maximum number of people to take the maximum number of tests. So they\u2019re bowing to the market pressure that the political pressure represents.\u201d Laats says the College Board\u2019s revisions to AP African American studies reflect its formula for developing products: \u201cThe College Board tends to move to the middle in terms of what is already accepted as standard knowledge. In the first draft, they try to hit the middle of the academic community, and then they plan to move to the middle of broader society with the second.\u201d The influence of the college board on US education is on some teachers\u2019 minds. \u201cPeople are asking more questions about the validity of the College Board, or whether to even support them at this point, considering how they\u2019ve shifted so quickly after the criticism,\u201d Bullock says. Ridgeway says she\u2019s undecided as to whether she will teach the course at her school when it\u2019s offered, though she\u2019s signed up for a training. \u201cBut if a lot of it is whitewashed or incorrect, I would be very leery about teaching the material and will probably end up supplementing with my own reading.\u201d Delaware charter school teacher Tracy hopes the skeptics will give the course a chance. She says she\u2019s gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback: \u201cSome of my students are actually frustrated with what is happening in other parts of the country, because they truly believe that all students should have access to the course,\u201d she says. \u201cI have some students who have commented: \u2018This is the first time I really see myself in the social studies curriculum.\u2019\u201d And not just the students, but their families. At the beginning of the school year, she spotted one student on her cellphone during the class: \u201cI said: \u2018Hey, put that away.\u2019 And she said: \u2018Well, I\u2019m recording notes and sharing information with my mom, because she never got to take it. And so she\u2019s taking the course with me.\u2019\u201d"

            "date": "2023-02-19T07:00:02Z",
            "content": "It is the year of the octogenarian. American TV viewers can find Patrick Stewart, 82, boldly going in a new series of Star Trek: Picard and 80-year-old Harrison Ford starring in two shows plus a trailer for the fifth installment of Indiana Jones. And a switch to the news is likely to serve up Joe Biden, at 80 the oldest president in US history, or Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, who turns 81 on Monday. But while action heroes are evergreen, the political class is facing demands for generational change. \u201cAmerica is not past our prime \u2013 it\u2019s just that our politicians are past theirs,\u201d Nikki Haley, 51, told a crowd of several hundred people in Charleston, South Carolina, as she launched her candidacy for president in 2024. It was a shot across the bow of not only Biden but former US president Donald Trump, who leads most opinion polls for the Republican nomination but is 76 years old. Haley, notably, mentioned Trump\u2019s name only once and avoided criticisms of him or his administration, in which she served as UN ambassador. Instead, the former South Carolina governor called for a \u201cnew generation\u201d of leaders and said she would support a \u201cmandatory mental competency test for politicians over 75 years old\u201d. It was a clue that in a party long shaped in Trump\u2019s image, where ideological differences are likely to be slight, his senior status could offer primary election rivals a line of attack. Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, said: \u201cShe said what a lot of people are thinking, or are maybe afraid to say, and for that she deserves a lot of credit. The basic foundation of her argument, which is that we need to turn the page and find a new generation of leadership, is 100% right.\u201d Gerontocracy crept up on Washington slowly but inexorably. Biden, elected to the Senate in 1972, has been a public figure for half a century and, if re-elected as president, would be 86 at the end of his second term. At a recent commemorative event at the White House he hosted Bill Clinton, who was president three decades ago \u2013 but is four years his junior. The octogenarian McConnell is the longest-serving leader in the history of the Senate and has offered no hint of retirement. Chuck Schumer, Democratic majority leader in the same chamber, is 72. Senator Bernie Sanders, standard bearer of the left in the past two Democratic primaries, is 81. But there are finally signs of erosion in the grey wall. Last month Patrick Leahy, 82, a Democrat from Vermont, stepped down after 48 years in the Senate. Last week Senator Dianne Feinstein of California announced her retirement at 89 after months of difficult debate about her mental fitness. Most profoundly, last month saw Democrats\u2019 top three leaders in the House \u2013 Nancy Pelosi, 82, Steny Hoyer, 83, and 82-year-old Jim Clyburn \u2013 make way for a new generation in Hakeem Jeffries, 52, Katherine Clark, 59, and 43-year-old Peter Aguilar, as well as the arrival of Maxwell Frost, now 26, hailed as the first Gen Z congressman. Presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle may now seek to harness this hunger for change in the contest for the world\u2019s most stressful job in 2024. A CNBC All-America Economic Survey in December found that 70% of Americans do not want Biden to run for re-election, giving his age as the principal reason. Chen, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for California state controller last year, commented: \u201cHe has exhibited some of the manifestations of somebody who probably has seen better days and that\u2019s hard to hide on the campaign trail. There\u2019s a big difference between running for president at 70 or 75 \u2013 and what was possible in the 2020 election when Covid was still raging and a lot of the interactions were different \u2013 than running in 2024. I do think his age is going to be an issue.\u201d Biden typically brushes off such talk with the simple refrain: \u201cWatch me.\u201d The president underwent a routine medical checkup this week and Dr Kevin O\u2019Connor, his personal physician since 2009, concluded that Biden \u201cremains a healthy, vigorous 80-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency\u201d. Karine Jean-Pierre, 48, the White House press secretary, said: \u201cIf you watch him, you\u2019ll see that he has a grueling schedule that he keeps up with, that sometimes some of us are not able to keep up with.\u201d Noting Biden\u2019s string of legislative achievements, she added: \u201cIt is surprising that we get this question when you look at this record of this president and what he has been able to do and deliver for the American people.\u201d After a strong performance in the midterm elections, a serious challenge to Biden from within the Democratic party still looks unlikely. Defenders say the obsession with his age merely illustrates his lack of other vulnerabilities after two years in which he has done much to win over moderates and progressives. Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, asked: \u201cDid anybody watch the State of the Union? Joe Biden is fully capable of executing his job as president of the United States. He\u2019s in better shape in some people half of his age. So they need to start focusing on the positives because repetition creates reality: perception is reality in politics. \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction and it undercuts the successes that Joe Biden actually has as president of the United States. There is much more concern over Donald Trump\u2019s mental acuity and physical presence than Joe Biden. Joe Biden can run circles around Donald Trump.\u201d A White House doctor once memorably proclaimed that Trump has \u201cincredible genes\u201d and could have lived to 200 years old if only he had been on a better diet. But on the Republican side he could face challenges not only from Haley but Florida governor Ron DeSantis, 44, former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, 59, former vice-president Mike Pence, 63, and 57-year-old Senator Tim Scott. Each has previously endorsed Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d mantra and may now struggle to disavow it. No-holds-barred attacks on Trump himself risk alienating his fervent base. But as Haley showed this week, the promise of generational change might serve as a coded rebuke in party that is no stranger to dog whistles. Drexel Heard, 36, who was the youngest executive director of the biggest Democratic party in the country (Los Angeles county), said: \u201cHypocrisy is a weird thing in American politics. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see if Nikki Haley only talks about Joe Biden\u2019s age and doesn\u2019t talk about Donald Trump\u2019s age and how the media calls her out on that. She\u2019s going to say things like: \u2018Well, you know, I\u2019m just saying that we need generational change.\u2019 She\u2019s never going to call Donald Trump out.\u201d Trump will not be the first Republican candidate to face questions over his age. At a debate in 1984, the moderator reminded Ronald Reagan that he was already the oldest president in history at that time. Reagan, 73, replied: \u201cI want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d Even his Democratic opponent, Walter Mondale, laughed at the line. Reagan won re-election in a landslide. Trump, for his part, will have an opportunity to silence Republican doubters at his raucous campaign rallies. Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to Clinton, said: \u201cIf he can\u2019t do that, if he seems older and less energetic, then I can imagine the generational appeal sticking. But if his juices start flowing and he is able to do what he did seven years ago, then the generational appeal will be likely to fall somewhat flat.\u201d Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, and a 77-year-old grandfather, added that it is not the \u201cconsensus view\u201d among Republicans that Trump is too old to move back into the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more support inside the Democratic party for the proposition that Biden is too old than there is inside the Republican party for the parallel proposition that Trump is too old,\u201d he said. Of all the Congresses since 1789, the current one has the second oldest Senate (average age 63.9) and third oldest House of Representatives (average age 57.5). Critics say the backup of talent puts it out of step with the American public, whose average age is 38. One example is around the tech sector and social media as members of Congress have often struggled to keep pace with rapid change and its implications for society. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: \u201cI\u2019m 70, so I have great sympathy for these people: 80 is looking a lot younger than it used to, as far as I\u2019m concerned. But no, it\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019ve got to get back to electing people in their 50s and early 60s.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the right time for president. You have a good chance of remaining reasonably healthy for eight years if you get a second term. Everybody knows that makes more sense but here we are. What can you say? This was the option we were given in 2020 and we\u2019re going to get essentially the same one in 2024.\u201d"

            "content": "No one can say they weren\u2019t warned. Mass opposition to wars tends to emerge only after they have been waged for some time, yet protests against the Iraq war reached unprecedented heights well before it began. On 15 February 2003, the largest demonstration in British history took place in London, attended by an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million people. It was also part of the largest ever international anti-war protest, with perhaps as many as 30 million people demonstrating across every continent. The march itself was a carnival of resistance. There were people of every age, race, religion and nationality, from huge numbers of school students to members of the Muslim community and other faith organisations and trade unionists. There were tens of thousands of banners and placards ranging from \u201cmake tea not war\u201d to \u201cnot in my name\u201d. Part of the reason for the sheer size of the march was that people thought that being there in person, as individuals, really could make a difference and convince the government not to go to war. This turned out not to be the case. The march and the wider anti-war movement did not stop the war. And we still live with the consequences of both the conflict itself, and the rejection of democratic accountability demonstrated by the government. Tony Blair\u2019s contempt for this mass expression of public opinion was clear. There were months of intense pro-war government campaigning, including the infamous WMD dossier. The war was forced through parliament despite a very large rebellion of Blair\u2019s own MPs. He went to war in close alliance with the rightwing governments of George Bush in the US, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar in Spain. The war was a catastrophe for the people of Iraq, with more than a million dead and millions more displaced, and a country that has still not recovered from the war and occupation. While the march itself did not stop the war \u2013 mass industrial action would have been required to do that, and while we achieved some strikes on protest day, they weren\u2019t sufficient \u2013 we did change public opinion. Because of the protests, every action Blair took would be contrasted with the large and obvious public distaste for the war. It is surely much harder now for governments to launch the kind of war seen in Iraq, with full-scale invasion and occupation. Interventions since tend to avoid boots on the ground, relying on drones and other forms of remote warfare. Blair\u2019s reputation was shredded by the war. He lost 1 million votes in the 2005 election. Despite the award of a knighthood (a suitably distant 19 years after Iraq) he was heavily criticised by the Chilcot report and has never recovered, regardless of his grandiose pronouncements on the world stage. But this was about more than one man, since his actions had a direct and negative effect on politics, leading to disillusionment over the rejection of public opinion. There are many reasons for the distrust of politicians that has marked recent decades in Britain and elsewhere, but Blair\u2019s lies over the Iraq war have surely been a major factor. Then we have the legacy of the war itself. We saw the development of al-Qaida in Iraq, and the growth of terrorism in the region. Democracy and stability are as elusive as ever. The Nato bombing of Libya in 2011, which led to regime change and civil war, was another failure of British intervention for which the people of north Africa are still paying the price. In the past 20 years we have also seen a massive increase in arms spending worldwide, with world military spending passing $2tn for the first time last year, and the increased fracturing of international relations, especially after the Libya bombing. There is now the threat of conflict between major imperial powers. The war in Ukraine is one where Nato members and Russia, both nuclear-armed, are in increasingly direct conflict, something that would be greatly exacerbated by the supply of fighter planes to Ukraine. There is a new and increasingly tense cold war between the US and China. As a result there is an even greater push for increases in defence spending, with both Germany and Japan committed to doubling theirs. The legacy of this blatant disregard for anti-war voices in 2003 has been to create an even more dangerous international situation now. As the threat of much greater war in Europe and the Pacific grows, peace has never been at such a premium. I was proud to be part of organising the demonstration then. We should remember that many of the people calling for war and militarism now are those who brought us Iraq.

            "date": "2023-02-09T20:23:45Z",
            "content": "More than 200 prisoners jailed by Nicaragua\u2019s authoritarian regime during a ferocious two-year political crackdown have been freed and flown to the United States. \u201cThis is huge,\u201d Georgiana Aguirre-Sacasa, the daughter of one of the prisoners \u2013 the elderly former foreign minister Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa \u2013 said on Thursday morning as she digested the news of her father\u2019s release. \u201cThis has been a very long slog for us and I just can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said, her voice breaking with emotion as she spoke. \u201cI woke up at 5am to all of this. I cannot believe that he is on a flight to Dulles [airport in Washington DC] right now. I cannot believe it \u2026 It has been 19 months,\u201d she said of her father who was arrested and jailed in July 2021. Aguirre-Sacasa said the released Nicaraguan prisoners included key members of Nicaragua\u2019s political opposition such as the former presidential candidates Cristiana Chamorro and Arturo Cruz. Another on the plane was the opposition activist F\u00e9lix Maradiaga, who was detained in June 2021 in the lead-up to Nicaragua\u2019s presidential elections which President Daniel Ortega won, amid widespread claims the vote had been rigged. The 25-year-old former student leader Lesther Alem\u00e1n, who famously confronted Ortega during a failed 2018 revolt against his regime, was also among the released prisoners. \u201cEverybody is on the plane \u2026 all of them,\u201d Aguirre-Sacasa said as she raced from Oakland to Washington to pick up her freed father. \u201cIt is a massive freeing\u201d of prisoners, the dissident former ambassador Arturo McFields told the Associated Press on Thursday morning. McFields, who broke with Nicaragua\u2019s \u201cdictatorial\u201d president last March, said the US state department had confirmed 222 prisoners were sent to Washington by plane earlier in the day. Nicaragua\u2019s crackdown began in June 2021 as Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, moved to obliterate any challenge to their Sandinista government before the November presidential election. Over the following months scores of opponents were thrown in jail before Ortega \u2013 a former revolutionary icon who has been in power since 2007 \u2013 won another five-year term in an election the US president, Joe Biden, claimed had been \u201crigged\u201d. That crackdown came after another major offensive against government opponents following a 2018 uprising against Ortega that saw hundreds killed and thousands injured. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans fled abroad in the wake of that clampdown, with many prominent politicians, religious leaders, activists and artists seeking shelter in other countries. In an interview late last year the celebrated Nicaraguan author Gioconda Belli, who lives in exile in Madrid, voiced despair over her country\u2019s \u201cOrwellian\u201d authoritarian tack. \u201cI feel very desolate about what is happening,\u201d she said, amid reports the political prisoners were being deprived of food and tortured in Nicaraguan jails. \u201cSome of them look really haggard,\u201d Belli added, vowing to keep speaking out against Ortega\u2019s dictatorship. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, called the release \u201ca constructive step towards addressing human rights abuses\u201d in Nicaragua and \u201cthe product of concerted American diplomacy\u201d. The move \u201copens the door to further dialogue between the United States and Nicaragua\u201d, added Blinken, who said the US was providing medical and legal support to the former prisoners \u201cto ease their arrival\u201d. At Dulles international airport outside Washington DC, dozens of relatives and Nicaraguan activists waited for the released prisoners, many waving the country\u2019s flag and one carrying a portrait of Jesus Christ. After the charter flight from Managua landed at the airport, most of the former detainees were taken to a nearby hotel, but around 15 of them were taken to hospital, according to a state department official. After landing in the US one of the released prisoners, the economist and politician Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro, said he planned to see his wife and daughter \u201cfor the first time in a year and a half\u201d and eat a \u201cgood hamburger with fries\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very traumatic situation as you can imagine,\u201d added Chamorro, 52, who was seized at his home in June 2021 and later sentenced to 13 years in jail for allegedly conspiring to undermine the integrity of the Nicaraguan state. Ariana Guti\u00e9rrez voiced incredulity and joy as she waited for her mother, the human rights activist Evelyn Pinto, who was arrested in November 2021, to arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal. It\u2019s very exciting. It\u2019s something that I can\u2019t believe,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna give her the biggest hug ever. Just tell her how much I love her and just welcome her here.\u201d Nicaragua\u2019s government made no immediate comment on its decision but state-controlled media outlets carried remarks from a magistrate who said the prisoners had been deported in order to protect national security, public order and peace. \u201cThe deportees were declared traitors to the motherland,\u201d Octavio Rothschuh Andino told a court in Managua, according to the Sandinista mouthpiece El 19 Digital."

            "content": "Good morning. Joe Biden has arrived in Kyiv to meet Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden\u2019s public itinerary had suggested he would be visiting Poland, but the US president arrived in Ukraine\u2019s capital this morning and has been spotted on a walkabout in the country\u2019s capital. In a statement, the US president said he was there to announce \u201canother delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, anti-armor systems and air surveillance radars\u201d as well as more sanctions. The New York Times is reporting that Biden travelled to Kyiv after a hours-long train ride from the border with Poland. He and Zelenskiy visited Saint Michael\u2019s monastery as an air raid warning sounded across the city. The newspaper described the visit as \u201ca demonstration of his administration\u2019s resolve in the face of Russia\u2019s year-long invasion of the country\u201d. The White House has issued a statement about Biden\u2019s visit to Ukraine this morning. It reads: \u201cAs the world prepares to mark the one-year anniversary of Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine, I am in Kyiv today to meet with President Zelenskiy and reaffirm our unwavering and unflagging commitment to Ukraine\u2019s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. When Putin launched his invasion nearly one year ago, he thought Ukraine was weak and the west was divided. He thought he could outlast us. But he was dead wrong.\u201d What else is happening? The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, backed a call from Estonia for the bloc\u2019s members to buy arms jointly to help Ukraine \u2013 an approach officials have said would be more efficient than EU members placing individual orders. EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the plan in Brussels today. He said the war was over unless the EU boosted its military support. How would it work? Borrell said he would table plans at the meeting to use the existing \u20ac3.6bn (\u00a33.2bn) European peace facility for the EU to procure ammunition jointly on the model of the procurement of vaccines during the Covid crisis. Facebook and Instagram to get paid verification as Twitter charges for two-factor SMS authentication Facebook and Instagram users will soon need to pay to be verified on the social media platforms, as Meta follows in the footsteps of rival platform Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s chief executive, announced in a Facebook post on Sunday that the service would first roll out in Australia and New Zealand later this week. The company said it would cost US$11.99 a month on web or US$14.99 on iOS and Android (or, in Australia, $19.99 on web or $24.99 on iOS and Android). Zuckerberg said in addition to a blue badge the service would offer \u201cextra impersonation protection\u201d, improved reach for verified users and direct access to customer support. In a blog post, Meta said it would rely on government ID documents to prove the identity of verified accounts to avoid the embarrassment of accounts impersonating people and brands \u2013 as happened when Twitter initially introduced its paid verification service. What else is going on at the social media company? Meta cut 11,000 staff in November \u2013 the equivalent of 13% of its workforce \u2013 amid falling ad revenue and economic downturn. The company\u2019s share price fell by more than 70% in 2022 before a rebound and in July it reported its first ever fall in revenue. What has Elon Musk said? Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, responded to the news in a tweet saying it was \u201cinevitable\u201d Meta would follow Twitter. Ohio train derailment reveals need for urgent reform, workers say Railroad workers have said the train derailment in Ohio, which forced thousands of residents to evacuate and is now spreading a noxious plume of carcinogenic chemicals across the area, should be an \u201ceye-opening\u201d revelation for Congress and \u201can illustration of how the railroads operate, and how they\u2019re getting away with a lot of things\u201d. Workers and union officials cited the Norfolk Southern Railway derailment in early February as a glaring example of why safety reforms to the industry \u2013 which include providing workers with paid sick leave \u2013 need to be made. Thirty-eight cars on the train derailed in the town of East Palestine, near the Pennsylvania border, including 11 cars carrying hazardous materials that incited an evacuation order, a controlled release of chemicals and fears of harmful chemical exposure to residents, wildlife and waterways. Unions and rail companies have been at loggerheads for years over new contracts that would address what workers describe as poor working conditions and would provide paid sick days amid grueling schedules caused by labor cuts. What has the Ohio senator Sherrod Brown said? Speaking on Sunday to CNN\u2019s State of the Union, the Democrat said the derailment, which released toxic chemicals including the carcinogenic vinyl chloride, was an episode of \u201cthe same old story\u201d, and that Norfolk Southern \u201ccaused it\u201d. In other news \u2026 Critics are accusing the British publisher of Roald Dahl\u2019s classic children\u2019s books of censorship after it removed colourful language from works such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda to make them more acceptable to modern readers. Heavy rains in coastal areas of Brazil\u2019s south-east have caused flooding and landslides that killed 36 people and displaced hundreds of others, S\u00e3o Paulo state authorities said yesterday. Rescue workers are searching for victims, reconnecting isolated communities and clearing blocked roads. The revisionist German war drama All Quiet on the Western Front has swept the board at the Baftas in London, taking a remarkable seven awards, including best picture. The night\u2019s other big winner was The Banshees of Inisherin, which also gained significant momentum in this year\u2019s Oscars race. North Korea fired two ballistic missiles off its east coast today, South Korea\u2019s military said, as the sister of Kim Jong-un warned the nuclear-armed state could turn the Pacific into a \u201cfiring range\u201d. The tests prompted the head of the ruling party in South Korea to warn that continued provocations by Pyongyang would only strengthen calls for the South to develop its own nuclear deterrent. A Catholic bishop in southern California, who was hailed as a \u201cpeacemaker\u201d, was shot and killed on Saturday blocks away from a church, stunning the Los Angeles religious community. Detectives were investigating the death of Bishop David O\u2019Connell as a homicide. Don\u2019t miss this: From cradle to compost \u2013 the disruptors who want to make death greener Americans are looking for greener ways to die, and a new wave of deathcare startups are rising to the occasion. After death, bodies are typically handled in one of two ways: embalmed and buried in a casket, or incinerated and turned into ashes. But both of these options have contributed to the environmental crisis \u2013 with fossil fuel-intensive cremation emitting chemicals such as carbon monoxide into the air and burials taking up large swathes of land. As interest in alternatives rises, startups aiming to disrupt these practices are gaining steam. The growth in demand comes in part due to Covid-19, experts say. The pandemic brought death to the forefront of the public consciousness and exposed concerns about its environmental destruction. \u2026 or this: White Lotus inspires love of Italian maximalist look Fans of The White Lotus will be familiar with the classic Sicilian vases known as testa di moro that adorn the fictional luxury hotel in the second season of the TV drama. The director uses these ornaments as a powerful visual motif to remind viewers to be wary of the guests and their actions. But their appearance in the hit show has also prompted a surge of interest in Italian maximalist ceramics. While maximalism \u2013 and Italy in general \u2013 are already having a pop culture moment, evident in fashion, television and interiors, The White Lotus has only helped to drive the trend. \u201cOver-the-top seems to be the rule of the day,\u201d said Carl J Dellatore the New York writer, textile designer and author of More Is More Is More. Climate check: Climate crisis brings whiff of danger to French perfume capital Since the 17th century, Grasse has been known worldwide for its fragrant flowers. Situated just inland from the French Riviera, Grasse enjoys a microclimate that allows fields of may rose, tuberose, lavender and jasmine to blossom. Today, the region produces flowers for some of the world\u2019s biggest luxury brands, including Dior and Chanel. Grasse\u2019s jasmine sells for a higher price than gold. Around the world, Grasse\u2019s producers are recognised as leaders in the industry: in 2018, Unesco placed the region\u2019s perfume culture on its intangible cultural heritage list. But climate change is threatening this tradition. Extreme weather patterns such as droughts, heatwaves and excessive rainfall have made growing flowers increasingly difficult. Last Thing: Art fair visitor breaks $42,000 Jeff Koons balloon dog sculpture A small sculpture valued at $42,000 (\u00a335,000) by the renowned artist Jeff Koons has been broken at the opening night of an art fair in Miami, by a woman who gave it a little tap. The incident took place at the Bel-Air Fine Art gallery during the VIP-only opening of the Art Wynwood contemporary arts fair on Thursday. The blue sculpture, part of Koons\u2019 famous \u201cballoon dog\u201d series, was perched on a pedestal featuring the name of the American artist when the woman \u2013 an unidentified art collector \u2013 was said to have tapped the sculpture, which then fell to the floor and shattered into smithereens. The art adviser Benedicte Caluch told the Miami Herald the sculpture was covered by insurance, so the woman would not have to foot the bill.

            "title": "Philippines president summons Chinese ambassador over laser incident",
            "date": "2023-02-15T05:14:13Z",
            "content": "Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos has summoned the Chinese ambassador to express serious concern over the \u201cincreasing frequency and intensity of actions\u201d by China against Philippine vessels. The meeting came a day after the Philippines accused a Chinese coastguard ship of directing a \u201cmilitary-grade laser light\u201d at one of its vessels, temporarily blinding a crew member and disrupting a mission in the South China Sea. The report of the incident prompted condemnation from the US, which said it stood by the Philippines, describing China\u2019s conduct as \u201cprovocative and unsafe\u201d, while the Australia\u2019s and Japan\u2019s embassies in Manila also expressed concern. Philippine foreign affairs spokesperson Teresita Daza said that a diplomatic protest had been filed, saying \u201cthese acts of aggression by China are disturbing and disappointing.\u201d The incident took place on 6 February, one month after Marcos visited Beijing for meetings that included discussions of how the two sides could avoid triggering a crisis in the disputed water way. The Philippines, as well as Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei all have claims to parts of the South China Sea, which is rich in resources and a crucial transit route for oil. However, China says it has sovereignty over it almost entirely \u2013 a claim that an international tribunal in The Hague in 2016 found to have no legal basis. At Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Marcos had expressed his concern \u201cover the increasing frequency and intensity of actions by China against the Philippine coast guard and our Filipino fishermen\u201d, including its use of a \u201cmilitary grade laser\u201d against one of its vessels, the presidential communications office said. The Philippine coast guard accused a Chinese ship of shining a green laser light twice towards one of its boats to deliberately block a mission that was bringing food and supplies to its troops at Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef in the disputed Spratly Islands. It also accused the Chinese vessel of making \u201cdangerous manoeuvres by approaching about 150 yards from the vessel\u2019s starboard quarter\u201d. The Chinese coastguard had also blocked Philippine ships from reaching Second Thomas Shoal during a mission in August, the coastguard in Manila said. In a statement, the Chinese embassy in Manila said that Chinese ambassador Huang Xilian met Marcos on Tuesday and that they \u201cexchanged views on how to implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state, strengthen dialogue and communication, and properly manage maritime difference between China and the Philippines\u201d. Marcos, who took office in June, has taken a firmer stance against Chinese aggressiveness on the South China Sea, say analysts, and has strengthened ties with the US, which had become strained under the previous president Rodrigo Duterte. Earlier this month, the Philippines granted the US expanded access to its military bases in \u201cstrategic areas of the country\u201d. Duterte also recently visited Japan to strengthen defence ties. Richard Heydarian, an academic and commentator on regional politics, described Marcos as overseeing \u201cnothing less than a quiet revolution\u201d in Philippine foreign policy\u201d. This included a \u201ccalibrated rhetoric on bullies, uncompromising stance on [the West Philippine Sea], coupled with tough alliance-building,\u201d he said in comments on Twitter, referring to the South China Sea."

            "title": "Nikos Christodoulides elected Cyprus\u2019s president with 52% of vote",
            "date": "2023-02-12T19:08:05Z",
            "content": "Nikos Christodoulides, a former foreign minister, has been elected the eighth president of Cyprus, beating the career diplomat Andreas Mavroyiannis in a high-stakes, closely fought race. Christodoulides, 49, won 51.92 per cent of the vote compared with 48.09 per cent for his opponent, who had been backed by the leftist party AKEL. A mere 15,041 ballots had divided the loser from the winner. \u201cTonight a long but beautiful journey has come to an end,\u201d said Mavroyiannis, a former chief negotiator in peace talks with Turkish Cypriots, conceding defeat. \u201cIt gave me the opportunity to meet thousands of people and hopes and dreams for our country.\u201d The result was immediately met with jubilation by supporters of the new president, as fireworks lit up the Nicosia sky and supporters clapped and danced. But in an election filled with rare drama and suspense, it was also quick to elicit dread. Christodoulides, who ran as an independent, had been backed by groups that take an openly hostile stance on talks to reunify the Mediterranean island. For many his victory dashed hopes of a solution being found in the near future to the decades-long dispute that has left Cyprus, the EU\u2019s most easterly state, bitterly divided. \u201cToday Greek Cypriots have voted in a government with very nationalist tendencies,\u201d said Cleopatra Kitti, a Cypriot policy adviser at the Athens-based thinktank Eliamep. \u201cIt is unlikely to back a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation any time soon which means this is likely to be another wasted opportunity.\u201d The election came a week after Christodoulides emerged as the frontrunner in a first round that also pitted the two candidates against Averof Neofytou, the leader of the centre-right DISY, in power for the last 10 years. Neofytou\u2019s defeat marked the first time that DISY, the biggest political force in the island\u2019s internationally recognised republic, had failed to make it to a runoff. The humiliation had been widely pinned on Christodoulides, who, refusing to toe the party line, had broken ranks to announce his candidacy. Although leading DISY figures had signalled they would back Mavroyiannis, the party\u2019s refusal to formally endorse either candidate had thrown the race wide open. \u201cThe outcome is down to conservative voters being unable to overcome the ideological barrier of voting for an AKEL candidate,\u201d said Christoforos Christoforou, a leading analyst specialised in electoral behaviour. \u201cFears over AKEL\u2019s management of the economy are also clearly still very real,\u201d he added referring to the island\u2019s banking crisis a decade ago, which has been widely blamed on the disastrous handling of the economy by the leftwing then president, Demetris Christofias. Cyprus has been ethnically split with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living either side of a UN-patrolled ceasefire line since the 1974 Turkish invasion. Ankara sent in troops after a coup engineered in Athens sought to unite the island with Greece. In the intervening years reunification efforts have repeatedly failed. With memories of peaceful coexistence fading fast, the poll had been described as the most significant election since 1960 when the former British colony won independence. The last round of negotiations which brought both communities as well as the island\u2019s guarantor powers \u2013 Greece, Turkey and the UK \u2013 around the table collapsed in disarray in Switzerland in 2017. Not since talks began after the invasion has a hiatus been as long. \u201cThe longer we take to settle this, the further we are from a resolution that would see all Cypriots living peacefully together again,\u201d said Kitti. But while Christodoulides wooed supporters saying he would renegotiate the basis on which the UN-brokered talks have so far been held, he is also conscious that Greek Cypriots must regain the trust of the international community if the peace process is to be resurrected. Outgoing president Nicos Anastasiades, in power since 2013, had been blamed for obstructing a solution at the 11th hour. The leader had been unable by law to seek another five-year term in office. Analysts said while Mavroyiannis would undoubtedly have taken a more conciliatory stance, Christodoulides had also shown he wanted to revive talks. During the campaign he suggested that Cyprus could support Turkey\u2019s desire to see its Customs Union upgraded with the EU as well as visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens entering the bloc in exchange for Ankara agreeing to open up a port for Cyprus-flagged ships. \u201cIf the EU is smart it will work on that suggestion because it could break the logjam,\u201d said Fiona Mullen at the Nicosia consultancy Sapienta Economics."

            "title": "Former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf dies after long illness",
            "date": "2023-02-05T10:26:12Z",
            "content": "Pervez Musharraf, the former army general and president of Pakistan who ruled for almost a decade after seizing power in a coup in 1999, has died in Dubai after a long illness. The Pakistani military confirmed his death in a statement, expressing \u201cheartfelt condolences on the sad demise of Gen Pervez Musharraf, former president, CJCSC and chief of army staff\u201d. Musharraf, 79, was one of Pakistan\u2019s most divisive leaders. His rule was marked by oppression, human rights abuses and a weakening of democracy, but also a period of economic growth. In 2019, a court found Musharraf guilty of high treason for his actions as president, including suspending the constitution in 2007. He was sentenced to death by a special court but that was later overturned. Since 2016, he had lived in exile between the UK and the Middle East after being allowed to leave Pakistan for medical treatment. Musharraf had amyloidosis, a rare disease that occurs when an abnormal protein builds up in organs and interferes with normal functions. He was admitted to hospital in the UAE last year. Last year he had expressed a desire to return to Pakistan to spend the \u201crest of his life\u201d in his home country, but it had been met with fierce resistance by politicians and the public. Musharraf\u2019s body will be brought back to Pakistan for burial on Monday. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, whose brother the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was overthrown and imprisoned by Musharraf when he seized power in 1999, tweeted a short message offering his \u201ccondolences to the family of Gen (rtd) Pervez Musharraf. May the departed soul rest in peace.\u201d Musharraf was born in pre-partition Delhi and his family moved to Karachi after 1947. He quickly rose through the ranks of the army and was Pakistan\u2019s top military general when he led a bloodless coup against the Nawaz Sharif government. After seizing power, he suspended the constitution, declared a state of emergency and designated himself the \u201cchief executive\u201d. Under the new military rule, Nawaz Sharif was put on trial for treason and forced into exile to Saudi Arabia. In 2001, Musharraf formally appointed himself president and oversaw several changes to Pakistan\u2019s constitution. Over the course of the next seven years, civil and democratic institutions in the country were eroded while the military\u2019s control over politics was even more deeply entrenched. After the 9/11 attacks, Musharraf became known for allying closely with the US on its War on Terror and was once described by President George W Bush as a \u201ccourageous leader and friend of the United States\u201d. However, his decision to support the US invasion of neighbouring Afghanistan to topple the Taliban and fight extremism from Pakistani soil would prove deeply unpopular after it led to heavy civilian casualties and left a lasting legacy of anti-western sentiment in the country. According to Musharraf, the Bush administration had threatened to \u201cbomb Pakistan back to the stone age\u201d if the country did not cooperate with America\u2019s war on Afghanistan. As Musharraf began to lose support around 2007, his rule became even more draconian. He suspended the constitution again, imposed martial law, sacked the chief justice of the supreme court and arrested activists and lawyers, prompting mass protests. After the assassination of the opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, who had returned to Pakistan to fight Musharraf in the election, the national mood soured even more and calls began to grow for him to be impeached. He resigned in 2008 and was forced into exile. Musharraf had returned to Pakistan in 2013 in a bid to return to power but he was disqualified for life from running and faced an arrest warrant for his alleged involvement in the assassination of Bhutto. He was put on trial for treason but the country\u2019s powerful military establishment allowed him to leave the country in 2016 on medical grounds. In 2019, he was found guilty in absentia and sentenced to death for treason, but a court later nullified the ruling. The response to his death in Pakistan was muted, with many senior figures refraining from commenting on his complex legacy out of respect."

            "title": "Biden talks with Poland president to focus on troop deployments",
            "date": "2023-02-21T15:13:12Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden is holding talks with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, about the strengthening of Nato\u2019s eastern flank in the face of Russia\u2019s continuing war in Ukraine, the White House said. Biden met Duda at lunchtime on Tuesday before a speech in the evening outside Warsaw\u2019s Royal Castle, his second address there in less than a year, underlining the increasingly close relationship between the US and Poland as the Ukraine war grinds on. \u201cThe United States needs Poland and Nato as much as Poland and Nato need the United States,\u201d the US president said at the start of the meeting. \u201cPoland has been a critical player,\u201d the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters on Tuesday morning after Biden and his team arrived back in Poland from their surprise rail trip to Kyiv. \u201cIt has been critical to hosting very large numbers of Ukrainian refugees. It has been a critical logistics hub for military assistance going into Ukraine, and it has been a strong voice as part of a unified western effort to try to ensure that there are no cracks, that the west and that the larger coalition of nations holds together strongly for as long as it takes.\u201d Last year, Biden gave Poland what it had long requested: a permanent US base on its territory, where US forces now number 10,000. Nato established four new battle groups in south-east Europe, doubling its overall force on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank. Sullivan said that military deployments would be at the top of the agenda in Biden\u2019s talks with Duda, but he did not specify whether that would involve the announcements of further deployments. \u201cThere is the larger question of Nato force posture and the continuing commitment of the US to play a critical role in the defence of the eastern flank allies, including Poland,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cSo the president will have the opportunity to reinforce his fundamental message from last year that he intends to defend every inch of Nato territory and that he will do so not just with rhetoric, but with the kinds of actions where we put in place the necessary capabilities.\u201d \u201cWe are grateful that this visit takes place in our country,\u201d Duda said at the start of his meeting with Biden at Warsaw\u2019s presidential palace. \u201cIt\u2019s also an important message to the world that Poland is secure\u201d. Biden\u2019s visit comes at a time of increasing Polish assertiveness stemming from the Ukraine crisis. The country has publicly vowed to increase its defence spending from 3% of GDP to 4% \u2013 the highest proportion in Nato \u2013 but government insiders say it will exceed that. Senior ministers believe years of raising the alarm about Russia have been vindicated. Piotr Gli\u0144ski, a deputy prime minister, said Warsaw had to pursue a policy of military buildup because \u201cwe have a very aggressive enemy\u201d in Russia and \u201cthe only argument they understand is the strength of power\u201d. Its key allies in that effort are the US and the UK, and to a lesser extent the Baltic states. Biden\u2019s visit, Gli\u0144ski argued, was important because it vindicated \u201cour new policy of being independent\u201d within Nato. He said it showed that the US recognised the importance of the bilateral relationship, reflecting Warsaw\u2019s effort in the war in Ukraine. \u201cThey are using us as a hub and respect our position as a partner.\u201d Polish officials are quick to point out that Biden has now made two significant bilateral visits to Warsaw as president, while his only trip to Germany so far was for the G7 summit in Bavaria last year. Close relations with the US are, for Poland\u2019s conservative ruling Law and Justice party, an essential alternative to close ties with Germany, criticised by Gli\u0144ski as having, in effect, appeased Russia before the war. \u201cOne of the reasons that this war is now in Ukraine was the bankruptcy of German policy,\u201d the deputy prime minister said. Although Gli\u0144ski stressed that Poland needed to have a strong partnership with Germany, Warsaw had to be \u201cnot on the level of being dependent\u201d politically or economically \u2013 justifying increased defence spending, a government policy that the Polish MP Micha\u0142 Jach, chair of parliament\u2019s defence committee, said was of only a few that commanded support across the political spectrum. Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago transformed the relationship between Washington and Warsaw, which had been tense in the first year of Biden\u2019s presidency because of Poland\u2019s democratic backsliding under the Law and Justice party, particularly on the independence of the judiciary and press freedom. Sullivan said Biden would raise those issues in his talks with Duda, but added that the president raises them \u201ceverywhere he goes\u201d, making clear that such considerations are no longer a major hindrance to the bilateral relationship. With each passing month, the Ukraine war elevates Poland\u2019s position in Washington\u2019s view of Europe. For Biden, Warsaw has become an emotional touchstone, said Daniel Fried, a former US ambassador to Poland. \u201cYou don\u2019t go to Warsaw if you\u2019re trying to back out,\u201d Fried said. \u201cHe wants to rally the free world, and other than Ukraine itself, Poland is the right place to do it, because the Poles feel this on their skin. They know what\u2019s at stake. They understand that if Ukraine falls to Russia, a lot of other countries are on the chopping block next, including themselves.\u201d In visiting Poland, Biden has come to one of the most welcoming places on Earth for him personally, a respite from his poor approval ratings at home. In the Pew Research Center poll last year, 91% of Poles expressed favourable view of the US, up from the 65-75% range over the previous years. In the same survey, 82% of Poles expressed confidence in Biden to do the right thing regarding world affairs. In another poll, conducted by the Polish group CBOS in July 2022, Biden was ranked the second most trusted world leader, with a score of 74%, behind only Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s 86%. Western munitions stream across the Polish border to Ukraine as the fight heads towards its second year, while members of Kyiv\u2019s military are being trained to use Leopard 2 tanks in the country. It remains a surprise that Russia has not sought to cut supply lines from the west, which some experts believe may be a focus for Moscow in the future.
