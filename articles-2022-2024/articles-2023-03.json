            "content": "The 2022 election ended months ago, at least in most of the country. In a rural county on the US-Mexico border in Arizona, though, the election and its fallout linger, causing heated divisions and offering a view into how conspiracy theories could upend elections across the country. While statewide candidates in Arizona who embraced election lies lost their races in November, the election denialism movement hasn\u2019t died off, especially in legislative and local offices, where Republicans continue to push for restrictions to voting and ballot counting that would hinder access and make elections less secure. Fueled by false claims about whether ballot tabulation machines are properly certified or accurate, supervisors in Republican-controlled Cochise county tried to conduct a full hand count of its election results and attempted not to certify the county\u2019s results. Their efforts ultimately failed, but they reveal how election denialism has taken hold in parts of the United States and could continue to wreak havoc on American democracy. A rural, red county The effort to question election results has been led by two of Cochise county\u2019s Republican supervisors, Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby, who were both vocal in their efforts to upend the county\u2019s elections. Courts intervened, stopping the hand count effort and forcing certification, but the supervisors, including Crosby who still refused to participate in certification, remain adamant that the county\u2019s elections are not secure. As recently as February, Judd and Crosby said they weren\u2019t certain of the county\u2019s results because there wasn\u2019t a hand count. In the months since the November election, the county\u2019s elections director, Lisa Marra, resigned, citing \u201coutrageous conduct and objectively difficult and unpleasant working conditions\u201d. Crosby and Judd sued Marra when she refused to help with the hand count plan. In Marra\u2019s absence, the board of supervisors gave the Republican county recorder, David Stevens, near-total control over local elections. Stevens is an election skeptic with close ties to Mark Finchem, the election-denying Republican who lost and refused to concede his race for Arizona secretary of state. The board\u2019s vote to make Stevens interim elections director prompted the Democratic attorney general, Kris Mayes, to file a lawsuit against the county, alleging the move \u201cthreatens the lawful administration and operation of elections\u201d. The effects of the county\u2019s decisions do not just affect local residents. Arizona is a swing state and will play a decisive role in the 2024 presidential election, as it did in 2020. If the supervisors hinder certification again next year, it could disenfranchise county voters and delay statewide results for this critical piece of the electoral map. In this red county, nearly 40% of voters are registered Republicans, the county\u2019s largest voting bloc. Many have embraced the supervisors\u2019 conspiracy theories. At a county meeting in February, community members floated ideas that would dismantle the existing election system, praising the supervisors for their \u201cincredible courage\u201d. Residents who have spoken at county meetings say they want a hand count because they don\u2019t trust machines. Hand counts are less accurate than machine tabulations because they are more prone to human error. They also take longer and are more costly, which can lead to delayed results, elections officials and outside experts have warned. Maricopa county\u2019s so-called \u201caudit\u201d, which hand-counted just two races, lasted several months. Some Cochise residents have also suggested limiting voting to one day, rather than the longer period of early and mail-in voting most Arizonans use to vote. On the same day Cochise supervisors heard from locals who believe elections are not secure, elections committees in the Arizona legislature heard presentations about how elections were stolen and the powers they had to stand up to the federal government, a sign of the continued prominence of election denialism in the statehouse and a further sign that Cochise county is not the only place where these ideas still reverberate. The ongoing election battles have some in Cochise county on edge. Some have organized a recall of Crosby. Others have filled meeting rooms and given fiery speeches to their elected leaders. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of trust lost out here in the community,\u201d said Elisabeth Tyndall, the chair of the Cochise county Democrats. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not just Democrats, that\u2019s everybody. They don\u2019t know if they can trust their board of supervisors.\u201d But for many far-right Republicans, the supervisors represent a stand against the government that has been several years in the making. Some have come from other counties to Cochise, finding a more willing audience than in counties like Maricopa, where the Republican-controlled board has staunchly defended its elections. Brandon Martin, the chair of the Cochise county GOP who has run for Congress several times, praised the supervisors\u2019 efforts to push for a hand count. \u201cWe had some very strong Republicans in a very conservative stronghold stand up and say, we\u2019re gonna do the right thing, and we\u2019re gonna do the right thing by the people who elected us.\u201d Why here? Cochise county lines the south-east corner of Arizona, bordered by New Mexico and Sonora, Mexico. A former mining stronghold once dominated by union labor, Cochise county was not always conservative. But in the years since the mining industry declined, the area has grown redder as jobs disappeared and the border industry grew. Judd, one of the far-right county supervisors, attended the January 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally near the US Capitol, and Crosby is a former border patrol agent. Their crusade, particularly the decision not to certify the election without court intervention, was in part a protest against the election in Maricopa county, Judd has said. Judd and Crosby\u2019s call for a hand count echoed Trump and his allies, who insisted that tabulation machines played a role in Trump\u2019s loss. Opponents of machines often claim they are not certified properly, which allows for tampering. The Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office has shot down those rumors several times. Tabulation machines in Arizona also go through logic and accuracy tests before elections, and a percentage of ballots are hand-counted after an election to ensure accuracy. Stevens supported the full hand count idea, too, saying he would help try to make it happen. Marra, the former elections director, was opposed, as was the Democratic supervisor Ann English and the county\u2019s attorney, who warned the idea did not comply with state law. Changing the election so close to election day would be a logistical nightmare and confusing to voters, they argued. After lengthy debate in county meetings, a judge ultimately decided the move was illegal. The case is now on appeal. The hand count battle kicked off a series of election disputes that culminated in fired-up local Democrats and a national lens on the rural county. Next came the refusal to certify the county\u2019s results, which could have disenfranchised county residents if their votes were not added to state totals. Judd and Crosby did not vote to certify the election in time, resulting in a lawsuit that sought to compel them to do their official duties. A judge ruled that they had to certify, forcing a vote later that day, for which Crosby did not show up. While voting to certify, Judd said: \u201cI am not ashamed of anything I did.\u201d The hand count and certification delay carry a cost, the total of which is not yet clear. So far, the county has approved nearly $120,000 in legal fees related to the issues. New elections director Before resigning in February, Marra, who had run county elections since 2017, wrote a letter giving the county two weeks to remedy the hostile work environment or she would quit. \u201cThere have been no deficiencies in any election Ms Marra has conducted,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThat the board continues to entertain and give credence to election conspiracy theories damages Ms Marra\u2019s professional reputation and places her safety at risk.\u201d Before Marra\u2019s departure, the deputy director retired in January, leaving just one employee in the election department. Marra has since been hired by the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office as deputy state elections director. Marra\u2019s supporters were outraged at her departure. They worry about who would want her old job, considering the problems she faced. \u201cShe literally stood up against allowing Crosby to get access and Stevens to get access to those ballots [for a potential hand count],\u201d said Sanda Clark, a Democrat who recently ran to represent the area in the Arizona house. \u201cShe\u2019s an absolute hero of what happened in Cochise county.\u201d One of Marra\u2019s concerns \u2013 that her duties would fall under Stevens \u2013 came true after her resignation. In February, the supervisors voted to put Stevens in charge of the elections director position and make him interim elections director. He will be part of the hiring process and oversee the future election director\u2019s work. The day before the supervisors voted to give Stevens more control over elections, the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office warned them the plan might run afoul of state law. The solicitor general, Joshua Bendor, said the office had \u201cserious questions\u201d about whether it was legal for the board to give some of its duties in election oversight to another elected official. Stevens told the Guardian he did not seek out the job; instead, he feels obligated to help because of an upcoming all-mail election about jail funding, which takes place in May. If he did not step in, the election could be canceled, he said: \u201cBasically, if I don\u2019t do it, the election\u2019s gone.\u201d Stevens\u2019s increased role has caused concerns, especially among local Democrats and independents, who question his friendship and entanglements with Finchem, a prominent election denier, as reported recently by Votebeat. The backlash The lingering election drama has sparked backlash from local residents who worry the supervisors\u2019 actions are undermining democracy and costing the county money. A bipartisan group started a campaign to recall Crosby. The group needs to collect nearly 5,000 valid signatures from Crosby\u2019s constituents to force a vote, an uphill battle in a small community. A bright-red billboard reading \u201cRecall Tom Crosby\u201d stands off Highway 92 in Crosby\u2019s district, paid for by the Cochise county Democratic party. Before the election antics, some already wanted to see him recalled. Early last year, he and Judd voted against taking a $1.9m Covid-19 relief grant from the federal government, just as the Omicron wave filled hospitals. Crosby, at the time, said he wanted to \u201cget the county out of the vaccine business\u201d. Eric Suchodolski, the recall campaign\u2019s chair, said Crosby\u2019s willingness to defy attorneys\u2019 advice on the hand count and certification helped cement the recall idea. \u201cHe\u2019s impervious to any of the reasoning that was put before him,\u201d Suchodolski said. \u201cI mean, if the guy\u2019s gonna ignore his own legal counsel, what pull does any ordinary citizen have to convince him otherwise?\u201d Gretchen Lamberth, a Republican who is gathering signatures for the recall campaign, said she was \u201chorrified about [Crosby\u2019s] fiscal irresponsibility\u201d, citing the legal fees piling up for the attempted hand count and delayed certification. She has watched her own political party become captured by a \u201cfew vocal folks\u201d who won\u2019t stop talking about election problems. Crosby filed for re-election in January, seeking another term in 2024. Even if the recall is not successful, Lamberth said she hopes it sends him a message that \u201cthese few people you keep listening to are not the way the rest of the county feels\u201d. Some still want to see Crosby and possibly Judd charged for their initial refusal to certify the election, hoping it will deter other officials from trying to do the same in the future. When she was secretary of state, the Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, asked the then attorney general, Mark Brnovich, to investigate the delayed certification and potentially bring charges. Mayes, the new Democratic attorney general, told the Guardian she could not comment on whether the supervisors could be charged. As the next presidential election approaches, some worry that the attempts at a hand count and calls not to certify the election will only intensify next November. \u201cI worry about [Crosby] trying to do the exact same thing or worse, because he\u2019s kind of been batted down, he\u2019s going to come back at it again, with maybe a different tack,\u201d Suchodolski said. For Tyndall, the elections debate left a lingering sense of distrust in the community that she wants to see repaired. \u201cWe are your neighbor,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re the same person that you waved to when you\u2019re rolling the trash can down the driveway in the morning. And I think that we need a reminder that we are a community \u2013 we\u2019re not two separate realities.\u201d"

            "title": "The $37m question: why do US states elect judges in expensive, partisan elections?",
            "date": "2023-03-31T10:00:21Z",
            "content": "While the 4 April Wisconsin supreme court race is technically non-partisan, the two candidates have not shied away from taking positions on policies that align with political parties. The Democratic party has spent heavily on the liberal candidate Janet Protasiewicz, while conservative candidate Dan Kelly has the backing of Republicans and top conservative donors. The race is already the most expensive state supreme court election in US history, with over $37m in spending. The unprecedented spending and political debate begs the question of why partisan groups are permitted to get involved in the selection of supposedly nonpartisan judges, and why judges are directly elected at all? It\u2019s not uncommon for state supreme court judges to be selected through partisan elections in the United States. Thirty-eight states elect the people who sit on their highest courts in some way, whether it\u2019s partisan elections, non-partisan competitive races, or retention elections where voters get to decide whether to keep someone on the bench. These judges often have the last word on major policy decisions in their states, from reproductive rights to voting policy and redistricting. Since the US supreme court overturned the right to an abortion with its Dobbs decision last year, attention on state supreme court races has intensified, with groups on both sides of the debate recognizing that state courts will have the last say on whether abortion is legal. Douglas Keith, counsel with the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s democracy program, explained that this political landscape comes at the same time that campaign spending on state supreme court races has already been increasing. Meanwhile, research has shown judges tend to rule in favor of their donors. According to the Brennan Center, the 2019-2020 election cycle set an overall national spending record of $97m. The group is still crunching numbers from 2022, but \u201cI expect to see that we have enter for these races once again,\u201d Keith said. A number of factors have contributed to the record spending, including the fact that the partisan balance of the court is up for grabs. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a perfect storm in that we are immediately post-Dobbs and so the awareness of how important these courts are is maybe at a peak,\u201d Keith said, adding that Wisconsin\u2019s election had added significance because it\u2019s a swing state and the winner will determine the ideological leaning of the court heading into the 2024 presidential election. Have US states always allowed voters to elect state supreme court judges? The concept of having voters directly elect state supreme court judges dates back to the mid-19th century when there was a growing frustration that these top decision makers were being selected in \u201csmoke-filled rooms, behind closed doors\u201d, Keith said. \u201cThere was a sense that there wasn\u2019t enough transparency,\u201d he added. \u201cThat there was political deal-making and horse-trading that people didn\u2019t want in the selection of judges, and there was a movement towards partisan elections.\u201d Each state has a unique history when it comes to deciding who will sit on its top bench. Of the 38 states that currently use some kind of election to select judges for the high court, 16 states empower the governor to appoint judges, who are then reselected in retention elections. Another 14 states have voters select judges in contested, nonpartisan elections and eight states allow voters to select judges in contested, partisan elections. What\u2019s the alternative? A few decades after states moved to partisan elections, some states began taking issue with the political influence involved in these elections and moved towards merit selections. Since 1940, more than half of states have switched at least in part from popular elections or solely appointments to experiment with merit selection. In states that use a merit system, the governor ultimately appoints judges with the help of a nominating commission or board, which is usually composed of a combination of attorneys, other judges, and the general public. The board considers applicants for the position and forwards the best candidates to the governor. Some research has shown that judges selected through a merit process produce higher-quality work than judges selected by partisan elections. The American Bar Association recommends against judicial elections, calling out the \u201ccorrosive effect of money on judicial election campaigns\u201d and \u201cattack advertising\u201d. But for the most part, state policy on how to select judges has not changed in recent history, and judicial elections are used to select the vast majority of state judges. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been significant change in a long time,\u201d Keith said. He explained that some states, like Ohio and North Carolina, made smaller changes more recently \u2013 both added party labels to their ballots, making these races partisan. But the last state to dramatically change how it selects judges was Rhode Island in 1994. Why have these races drawn such a large increase in spending in recent years? Before recent years, there were sporadic elections that drew large spending. In the 1980s and 1990s, big businesses and trial lawyers were frequently at odds over tort reform, which sometimes led to high-cost elections. The type of spending we see now did not become possible until the 2010 supreme court Citizens United decision, which prohibited the government from restricting independent expenditures for political campaigns by corporations, opening the floodgates for outside groups to pour money into political races. The Brennan Center has tracked spending in these races through 2020 and found that the 2019-2020 state supreme court election cycle was the most expensive in history, but this year\u2019s Wisconsin race has already broken records for spending in a single election. Is the spending equal on both sides of the political divide? Republicans were first to dedicate vast amounts of financial resources to state supreme court races. In 2014, the Republican State Leadership Committee \u2013 which is now the leading spender in state judicial elections \u2013 tested whether money could influence the North Carolina supreme court election. The group launched its Judicial Fairness Initiative, a project aimed at backing conservative judges, explaining that it wasn\u2019t enough to elect legislators and governors if they would run into state supreme courts who rejected their policy priorities. It took longer for Democrats to try to match Republicans\u2019 level of spending, but they began to increase spending in state supreme court races as they focused more attention on races that would impact redistricting, especially around the 2020 cycle. According to the Brennan Center, 44% of outside-group spending in 2019-20 state supreme court elections came from groups on the left, marking a higher percentage than in previous cycles. In Wisconsin, Democrats have poured millions of dollars into advertising for Protasiewicz. Of the more than $25m booked in television advertising as of 22 March, Protasiewicz has ordered more than $10m, and outside groups supporting her including A Better Wisconsin Together, Planned Parenthood, and the American Civil Liberties Union have spent an additional $5.4m, giving her a roughly $5m spending advantage in booked advertising over Kelly. Does the increased political spending affect how judges rule once elected to the bench? Though it\u2019s hard to measure the impact of campaign spending and how winning judges will ultimately act on the bench, there has been some research and analysis showing that judges are more likely to rule in favor of major donors and political parties that support them. In their forthcoming book Free to Judge, law professors Michael S Kang and Joanna M Shepherd find that the desire to win re-election results in judges who lean toward the interests and preferences of their campaign donors across all cases. Other research shows that judges tend to be harsher in criminal cases during election years than they are during non-election years, especially when there are more TV ads."

            "title": "Red wall Brexiters will be the \u2018hero voters\u2019 of the next election. The rest of us are just walk-on players | Rafael Behr",
            "date": "2023-03-29T05:00:27Z",
            "content": "Whatever happens in the next general election, Britain will be governed by some kind of coalition. That can be said with confidence because all governments are coalitions of some kind, even when there is only one ruling party. There are Conservatives who see Rishi Sunak as their rightful leader and others who submit to his authority without enthusiasm. The factions must be balanced in cabinet. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is a Sunakian. The home secretary, Suella Braverman, was a rival leadership candidate for the party of perpetual Brexit. The current Tory party chair, Greg Hands, is indigenous to pre-referendum conservatism, an urbane former remainer who served in George Osborne\u2019s Treasury. His deputy, Lee Anderson, is a fire-breathing \u201canti-woke\u201d culture warrior who defected to the Tories from Labour in 2018. That is coalition politics. It also describes Downing Street\u2019s strategy for retaining some of the majority won in 2019. That means defending the \u201cred wall\u201d \u2013 former Labour seats in northern England and the Midlands, where craving for Brexit was the gateway drug to voting for Boris Johnson. But it also means wooing back moderate Tories who recoiled from Johnson\u2019s circus of disrepute and Liz Truss\u2019s pyrotechnic economic mismanagement. The plan is that one side of the Tory party wins back economic trust with a prolonged display of competence, while the other side slams doors in migrant faces to prove it is still the nemesis of European judges and their metropolitan liberal accomplices. The two elements must then be combined in the image of a strong, dependable leader. Sunak is more popular than his party and in a presidential race against Keir Starmer he would certainly be competitive. The opposition leader\u2019s allies concede that he has work to do with the many voters who are window shopping for an alternative government and need to be lured through Labour\u2019s door. But there isn\u2019t much evidence yet that the incumbent prime minister\u2019s personality is sturdy enough to hoist MPs out of danger in all the seats where the Conservative brand is toxic. There are notionally scores of seats in play at the next election, presaging a potentially seismic shift in the political landscape. But both of the main English parties have their sights set on a narrow slice of the population. Deborah Mattinson, Starmer\u2019s director of strategy, calls them \u201chero voters\u201d \u2013 the ones who swing directly from Tory to Labour, effectively having double the impact of anyone who moves from a third party. The profile of these voters is Brexit-supporting, older (but not retired), economically precarious, socially conservative, white, not in big cities and without higher education. The anxieties and prejudices of those people exert a magnetic pull on national debate to the exclusion of other voters. An election fought over the allegiance of red wall Brexiters is an away fixture for Starmer, whose remain-voting liberal lawyer CV is no secret. But the electoral system does give the Labour leader an advantage, too. He would prefer to win a majority, but the door to No 10 creaks open for him as soon as the Tories lose theirs, since no other party will prop up a minority, Sunak-led administration. The Liberal Democrats have signalled that they are in the business of replacing Tories. Their leader, Ed Davey, hasn\u2019t broadcast instructions to his members to vote tactically in places where a Labour candidate is better placed to unseat an incumbent Conservative, but the message is implicit in the choice of constituencies being targeted and the tone of campaign rhetoric. Starmer might not be a president-elect, but Britain has a parliamentary system and he is de facto leader of the GTTO coalition \u2013 Get The Tories Out. That can be a powerful alliance, although also a fragile one. It was fractured for many years by the Lib Dem decision to form an actual coalition with the Conservatives in 2010. It fell apart completely in 2019 because too many swing voters decided the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister was the most repellent one on the ballot paper. Starmer has worked hard to repair the damage done by his predecessor, to the point of forbidding him from running as a Labour candidate. That has disoriented the Corbynite left, which now faces an interesting choice. Loyalty to the exiled independent MP for Islington North means formal rupture from Labour and a future of paddling in the stagnant waters of Marxist protest politics. Rowing in behind Starmer (albeit with much grumbling about principles betrayed) offers a slipstream to future influence over a party in power. It is clear where the left\u2019s interests lie \u2013 and it isn\u2019t martyrdom to the lost Corbyn cause. That also means that even if Starmer wins a majority, he too will find himself governing a coalition. Old divisions are buried, but not deep. They will be disinterred by the hard choices that any government has to make. The disciplined line Labour is currently holding expresses the appetite for victory worked up after a steady diet of defeats, while patience is instilled by opinion poll leads. Those factors will not pertain once a Labour chancellor is rationing funding to cash-starved public services and a Labour home secretary is grappling with Kentish border control. Ask Labour MPs how they feel about that prospect and they say they will gladly take the problems of government over the grind of opposition. Also that they are not complacent because the mountain to climb after the crushing defeat in 2019 is so steep. And they are right. The road to Downing Street is narrow and goes by way of persuading Tory voters to switch sides. But it is a dispiriting prospect for those of us who happen not to live along that route; we, the unheroic, second-class voters, whose ballots will be made by imprecise tactical calculation or cast on to a heap in already safe seats. This is not a new foible of British democracy. For as long as elections have been settled by the first-past-the-post system, millions of voters have had their preferences marginalised. But the imbalance feels especially perverse when politics has been polarised on a range of issues, and the veto-wielding tranche of the electorate is clustered on one side of a partisan divide. If these super voters were swinging on a left-right axis, or a leave-remain one, the battle for their allegiance might at least be a meaningful microcosm of the nationwide competition. But they aren\u2019t. So British politics must be bent out of shape to make some opinions prominent and fold others out of sight: the idea that leaving the EU was a mistake, for example, or that migration is good for the economy, or that mass indefinite detention of asylum seekers is not a practice for civilised democracies. Those views are widely held, but they will not be visible on a campaign trail mapped by Labour and Tory strategists. Anyone who believes such heresies must simply wait and see what kind of coalition we get next. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"

            "content": "We end the week with Ken Wyatt, the former Coalition Indigenous Australians minister, warning the Liberals that opposing the Indigenous voice to parliament could add to a \u201cglobal perception\u201d they are a \u201cracist party\u201d. Ken Wyatt urged the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, to allow the Liberals a conscience vote on the referendum, saying he knew of many who would back it \u201cif given the chance\u201d. Wyatt, a Yamatji man who is a member of the government\u2019s referendum working group, believed it would be a mistake for the Liberals to not offer bipartisan support to a referendum. He said it would add to a perception the party was \u201cracist\u201d, citing incidents he had experienced as a minister under the Morrison government. \u201cOne of the questions I got asked frequently, and the first was the BBC when I was first elected, and I had this from other countries as well: \u2018What\u2019s it like belonging as a member of the Australian parliament in the most racist country?\u2019 And I always defused that. And then the second question they hit me with is: \u2018How do you cope working in a racist party like yours?\u2019,\u201d Wyatt told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s a global perspective. It\u2019s not my perspective; it\u2019s a global perspective.\u201d Top news NSW election race wraps up | The New South Wales Liberal leader, Dominic Perrottet, and Labor leader, Chris Minns, have wrapped up their last day on the campaign trail ahead of voting tomorrow. In Minns\u2019 final press conference, he said the election would come down to the wire, pitching to voters that his party had been focusing \u201clike a laser beam\u201d on cost-of-living issues and would oppose privatising essential assets starting with Sydney water. Meanwhile, Perrottet urged voters to back the Coalition\u2019s economic plan, spruiking the party\u2019s election slogan that it would \u201ckeep NSW moving forward\u201d. New documents in Bruce Lehrmann defamation case | The former Liberal staffer Bruce Lehrmann told the tobacco giant he lobbied for that the public revelation of rape allegations against him had \u201cnot hindered the relations within my political network\u201d and said he was still able to influence federal policy to \u201cfurther the business financially\u201d, documents show. New filings in Lehrmann\u2019s defamation case against News Corp, Network Ten, Lisa Wilkinson and Samantha Maiden reveal Lehrmann\u2019s correspondence with British American Tobacco Australia, his then employer, in the days and months after Brittany Higgins\u2019 allegations were first made public in February 2021. Mass fish kill clean up begins | The first signs of a cleanup of the millions of dead fish that blanketed the Darling-Baaka River in far west New South Wales began on Thursday afternoon when two men in a tinny began netting the carcasses. The mass fish kill, reported last Friday, saw millions of dead fish floating to the top of the river along a 70km stretch, centred on the town of Menindee, where locals \u2013 who are breathing in the smell of rotting fish \u2013 are angry and frustrated at river management and the delayed government response to the crisis. Lidia Thorpe\u2019s treatment \u2018disturbing\u2019 | The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, says an incident in which senator Lidia Thorpe was pulled to the ground, apparently by an Australian federal police officer, while protesting against an anti-trans rights rally was \u201cdisturbing and concerning\u201d. On Thursday, Thorpe was pulled to the ground after she rushed towards a lectern at which anti-trans activist Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull was addressing a small crowd of supporters outside Parliament House in Canberra.

Asteroid flybys are common but Nasa said it was rare for one so big to come so close and that events like this occurred only about once a decade. Scientists estimate its size to be somewhere between 40 and 90 metres in diameter. French protest inflamed | Emmanuel Macron felt the full force of French anger on Thursday as protesters gathered across the country to demonstrate their opposition to the pension age being raised from 62 to 64. In Paris, union leaders claimed that a record 800,000 people took part in a mostly peaceful march through the city \u2013 the police gave the figure as 119,000 \u2013 to demand the government drop the fiercely contested change. Scores arrested on Israeli day of protest | Israel\u2019s two-month-old protest movement took to the streets for a \u201cday of disruption\u201d as the parliament passed the first part of the hardline government\u2019s controversial judicial changes into law. The legislation, designed to protect the position of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was approved early on Thursday after a heated all-night debate by 61 votes to 47 \u2013 the minimum majority required.

            "title": "Pakistan delays Punjab election despite supreme court ruling ",
            "date": "2023-03-23T14:14:21Z",
            "content": "Pakistan has postponed elections in Punjab, the country\u2019s most populated province, in a move that spurns a recent supreme court ruling and is likely to cause more sparks between supporters of former prime minister Imran Khan and the government. In an eight-page order seen by the Guardian, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) claimed that \u201cit is not possible to hold and organise the elections honestly, justly, fairly, in a peaceful manner\u201d, blaming security threats and financial problems. It said it would be unable to provide a \u201clevel playing field\u201d to all political parties as a result. The move appears to violate a supreme court ruling earlier this month that a new election be held within 90 days of the Punjab assembly being dissolved. The former prime minister Imran Khan decried the delay. \u201cBy postponing Punjab elections till October, the ECP has violated the constitution,\u201d Khan said. After being ousted from central government in a vote of confidence last year, Khan went on the offensive, holding rallies and demanding a snap election. At one rally he was shot and wounded. But Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, rejected Khan\u2019s demands for a quick election. Khan responded by dissolving the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies, the provincial governments where his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, remained in power. The supreme court ruled on 1 March that the new elections be held within 90 days. It asked the election commission to propose a poll date and said it could deviate from the 90-day deadline only by the \u201cbarest minimum\u201d in case of any practical difficulty. Salahuddin Ahmed, a lawyer, said the decision to delay the elections by six months represented a violation of the constitution, and the case would go back to the court to be resolved. \u201cTo deal with this constitutional crisis, the court has to come up with a full bench, otherwise selecting a few judges to decide on this crucial issue will raise eyebrows,\u201d he said. Former senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar suggested the election commission had been pressured by the government and a political establishment who were terrified of going to the polls at a time when Khan\u2019s popularity is as high as it has recently been. \u201cThe security situation was worse in 2008, when suicide bombings were taking place across the country and we even lost Benazir Bhutto in one of the terror attacks,\u201d Khokhar said. \u201cThat did not deter the ECP then from holding the elections, or after that in 2013 when the security situation was equally bad. \u201cThis excuse is not only just lame but undemocratic in spirit and unconstitutional in nature.\u201d On Wednesday the government had pleaded with the chief justice of Pakistan to \u201creview\u201d the supreme court\u2019s 1 March ruling, saying that forcing an election now when the polls were split would create chaos. The court has not yet responded to the government\u2019s petition but could take it up as soon as Friday. Michael Kugelman, a director at the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, said that as Khan\u2019s primary demand since he was ousted had been elections, he was unlikely to take the decision to postpone them for so long well. \u201cIf the decision to postpone the Punjab election is upheld, and especially if the government ends up delaying national elections too, this will inflame Imran Khan and his supporters and ratchet up their dangerous confrontation with the government even more,\u201d said Kugelman."

            "title": "Nigeria\u2019s ruling party candidate Tinubu wins presidential election \u2013 electoral commission",
            "date": "2023-03-01T07:05:40Z",
            "content": "Nigeria\u2019s ruling party candidate, Bola Tinubu, was on Wednesday declared winner of the presidential election, after defeating two of his closest rivals in the most competitive election for decades. Tinubu\u2019s victory after the weekend vote signalled the continued dominance of the established political elite in Nigeria. Analysts had described the poll as a potential \u201cinflection point\u201d for Africa\u2019s most populous country, which is struggling with economic turmoil, widespread violence and corruption. The Independent Nigerian Election Commission (Inec) announced final results early on Wednesday, after a chaotic count lasting almost four days. Though Tinubu\u2019s victory appears to reinforce the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party\u2019s grip on power, the count showed that reformist candidate Peter Obi overcame a lack of resources and weak organisation to make big gains. Nigeria\u2019s new president-elect defended the integrity of the election, and called on citizens to unite after a bitter dispute over results opposition parties said were flawed. \u201cI am very happy I have been elected the president of the federal republic of Nigeria,\u201d Tinubu said to cheers in Abuja. \u201cThis is a serious mandate. I hereby accept it.\u201d Tinubu\u2019s victory was conclusive, with 8.79m votes won by the 70-year-old veteran, putting him well ahead of main opposition challenger Atiku Abubakar\u2019s 6.98m. Obi, who won 6.1m votes, surprised many by winning in both Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s biggest city and commercial powerhouse, and the federal capital, Abuja. Tinubu has long been known as a \u201cpolitical godfather\u201d with immense and invisible influence. After emigrating to the US, where he was a taxi driver to fund studies in business administration, Tinubu worked as a management consultant. He returned to Nigeria and became involved in politics in the 1990s during the last years of the military regime. When democracy returned in 1999, Tinubu won elections to become governor of Lagos where he is credited with a crackdown on organised crime and tackling the city\u2019s appalling traffic. Tinubu, who is extremely wealthy, also established extensive patronage networks that have underpinned his political power ever since, experts say. His support for outgoing Muhammadu Buhari was critical. Tinubu\u2019s campaign slogan \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s my turn\u201d \u2013 was seized on by critics as evidence of a sense of entitlement. Opponents also said appearances where Tinubu slurred his words suggested health problems. His exact age is contested. However, within a day of the polls closing, APC officials and ministerial aides were privately expressing confidence in victory. Observers have contrasted Tinubu with Obi, an energetic and frugal 62-year-old businessman, who reached across the country\u2019s faultlines to woo voters from all communities and ran a slick social media campaign to attract the young. The voting on Saturday was mostly peaceful, but was troubled by long delays at many polling stations, while technical hitches disrupted the uploading of results to a central website, fuelling concerns over vote rigging. On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s main opposition parties called for the presidential election to be scrapped, alleging that results showing the ruling party\u2019s candidate in the lead had been manipulated. Election officials said the results had been fully authenticated and government loyalists accused the opposition of fomenting \u201clawlessness and anarchy\u201d. International observers have also criticised Saturday\u2019s vote, which was largely peaceful despite expectations of widespread chaos and violence. A team of observers led by Joyce Banda, the former president of Malawi, said delays on voting day, which led to many polling stations opening hours late, meant the election \u201cfell well short of Nigerian citizens\u2019 reasonable expectations\u201d. An EU mission said the failures \u201creduced trust in the process and challenged the right to vote\u201d. Speaking on Wednesday, Tinubu said, \u201cthe lapses that were reported, they were relatively few in number and were immaterial to affect the final outcome of the election.\u201d The president-elect\u2019s supporters pointed to Tinubu\u2019s power base of Lagos to refute allegations of vote rigging. After eight years of drift and disappointment under outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari, voters hope for firm action to deal with Nigeria\u2019s multiple intersecting crises: economic turmoil, extremism and criminality affecting much of the country. In recent weeks, a botched effort to replace almost all Nigeria\u2019s banknotes has caused massive economic disruption and much anger. Despite often pessimistic forecasts, analysts point out that seven elections have been held in succession in Nigeria and say some Nigerian democratic institutions are growing stronger. That none of the main candidates in 2023 were former military officers \u2013 a first for a Nigerian poll \u2013 is also viewed as an achievement. There have been concerns raised, however, about the limited number of women contesting. Evin Incir, the head of delegation of the European parliament, said: \u201cI wish to express my concern that less than 10% of candidates were women. The next government and parliament should heed to the manifestos of the main political parties of Nigeria, which call for affirmative action, such as quotas.\u201d"

            "title": "Nigeria postpones state elections amid dispute over presidential vote",
            "date": "2023-03-09T10:01:33Z",
            "content": "Nigeria has postponed Saturday\u2019s crucial state elections amid wrangling over a presidential vote that opposition parties claim was rigged. The electoral commission emerged from an hours-long meeting on Wednesday night to announce it was pushing back polls to elect powerful state governors by a week. The commission attributed the delay to problems with reconfiguring a digital voting system that had been the source of rancour and international criticism after it failed to perform as promised in the presidential elections in Africa\u2019s most populous country on 25 February. Earlier on Wednesday the court of appeal rejected a request by the opposition People\u2019s Democratic party (PDP) and the Labour party to inspect the digital tablets used to screen voters and transmit results from polling stations. The electoral commission said that while the ruling made it possible for it to prepare the tablets for state elections, the ruling had come \u201cfar too late\u201d. \u201cWe thank Nigerians and friends of Nigeria for their understanding as we continue to deal with these difficult issues,\u201d it said in a statement. Labour and the PDP have alleged that the failure to transmit results from many polling stations to a much-heralded public website until days after the presidential polling day allowed the ruling All Progressives Congress party to collude with electoral commission officials to manipulate results. They are preparing for a rerun in court of the three-way battle electrified by Peter Obi\u2019s outsider campaign. The APC candidate, Bola Tinubu, won with fewer than 9m votes after the country\u2019s lowest ever electoral turnout. On Monday the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, led hundreds of supporters in a march to the electoral commission\u2019s headquarters in Abuja. Before the electoral commission decision on Wednesday, Obi cancelled planned governorship campaigning, saying he remained committed to the \u201cmission of retrieving our mandate\u201d. The electoral commission has said it plans to use the same public website that has been criticised by international observers for its previous failure. They concluded the presidential election fell short of Nigerians\u2019 expectations, as results were meant to be uploaded to the website directly from polling stations on polling day. However, observers have not alleged fraud as they had after some previous Nigerian elections. The Labour party separately told the Guardian its voters faced being intimidated at polling stations in the state elections. The party\u2019s candidate for Lagos governor said party volunteers would \u201cstand up and defend\u201d supporters and resist any attempts to suppress votes for him. The PDP and Labour have seized on what became a chaotic count after the failures with the digital voting system, as well as evidence of intimidation and voter suppression by ruling party agents at polling stations. One independent observer, the non-profit Yiaga Africa, reported cases of intimidation at as many as one in 20 polling stations. It is unclear how much these may have affected results. The APC denies manipulating results and has suggested its supporters were themselves intimidated in Obi strongholds. Nigeria will elect governors in 28 of its 36 states, as well as state assembly members, with fierce contests expected in cities in which Obi did well in the presidential vote, such as Lagos and the capital, Abuja. In both of these he used a campaign built on social media to upset the odds by winning votes with a promise to tackle corruption. Particular focus will fall on Lagos, home to 20 million people, thriving technology and arts sectors and an economy that would be ninth-largest in Africa were it a country. It is also the home town of Tinubu, who is considered the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the city he used to govern and is said to be desperate to ensure his party maintains power of it. Were he to lose, assuming he is sworn in as president, he would be the first sitting Nigerian president not to control his home state. Labour\u2019s Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, a 40-year-old architect, is taking on the incumbent APC governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who has launched a charm offensive in Lagos in recent weeks including the release of vehicles impounded for minor traffic offences. Rhodes-Vivour said the party would send out a lot more people than on presidential polling day to monitor the process and provide security. Joseph Essien, 47, an Obi-supporting driver in Lagos, criticised the police over the presidential election. \u201cThey didn\u2019t come to [voters\u2019] rescue when needed,\u201d he said. \u201cPolicemen were there and they did nothing so you expect people to go again and not defend themselves?\u201d Joana Andrew, 46, an APC supporter who has been selling snacks outside Tinubu\u2019s high-walled Lagos compound, said Sanwo-Olu had a \u201cbrighter chance\u201d of winning the state than Tinubu had during the presidential voting. \u201cThe people who come out to vote for Obi, they love coming out for the presidency \u2013 when it comes for governorship they withdraw,\u201d she said."

            "title": "Ron DeSantis visits Iowa as presidential bid speculation intensifies",
            "date": "2023-03-11T02:29:40Z",
            "content": "The Republican Ron DeSantis greeted fans in Iowa on Friday, marking the Florida governor\u2019s first visit this election cycle to the early voting state and intensifying speculation over when he might announce his 2024 presidential bid. DeSantis delivered remarks to a full crowd at a casino in Davenport on Friday morning, and later appeared in Des Moines with the governor of Iowa, Republican Kim Reynolds, to promote his new book, The Courage to be Free. Speaking before a crowd of more than a 1,000 on Friday evening, DeSantis drew loud applause by hammering the culture-war issues that have energized Republican primary voters in recent years, particularly on education. \u201cI think we really have done a great job of drawing a line in the sand and saying the purpose of our schools is to educate kids, not indoctrinate them,\u201d DeSantis said in the auditorium on the Iowa state fairgrounds. \u201cParents should be able to send their kids to school without having somebody\u2019s agenda shoved down their throat.\u201d The hardline rightwing governor has emerged as the most likely rival to Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican nomination race and relations between the two have soured, with Trump recently pouring insults on DeSantis. Trump has already announced his own bid to return to the White House, but his grip on the party has weakened a little after a disappointing show by top Trump-backed candidates in last November\u2019s midterm elections. Speaking in Davenport, DeSantis touted his accomplishments in Florida. The crowd gave DeSantis a standing ovation when he mentioned his decision to have migrants flown from Florida to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, a move that sparked a lawsuit and has already cost the state nearly $2m. \u201cWe will never surrender to the woke mob,\u201d DeSantis told the Davenport crowd. \u201cOur state is where the woke mob goes to die.\u201d After the speech, DeSantis mingled with his supporters, working the rope line of the event. The governor took selfies with supporters and offered to autograph their books, looking like a candidate for higher office. DeSantis\u2019s trip comes as he trails Trump in national surveys of likely Republican primary voters, with the former US president leading by 25 points in the latest Morning Consult poll. But a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey suggests DeSantis currently poses the largest threat to Trump in Iowa, which will hold the first caucus of the 2024 Republican nomination contest next February. According to the survey\u2019s results, Trump is viewed favorably by 80% of Iowa Republicans, compared with 75% who view DeSantis favorably. The former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador Nikki Haley, who launched her own presidential campaign last month, is viewed favorably by 53% of Iowa Republicans. \u201cSomeone who has already held the office and who won the state twice would be presumed to be the frontrunner, and I don\u2019t know that we can say that at this point,\u201d said pollster J Ann Selzer, who conducted the Iowa survey. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing locked in about Iowa for Donald Trump.\u201d Haley is wrapping up a three-day swing through Iowa on Friday, and Trump is scheduled to visit the state on Monday to deliver a speech on education issues, which DeSantis has seized upon as a central focus of his gubernatorial tenure. DeSantis has signed a bill banning lessons in Florida\u2019s elementary schools on sexual orientation or gender identity, attacked by critics as the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law, and Republican legislators hope to expand that policy to cover pre-kindergarten through eighth grade during this legislative session. DeSantis is expected to wait to formally launch his presidential campaign until after Florida\u2019s current legislative session, which began on Tuesday, concludes in May. But DeSantis\u2019s latest events and remarks have left little question that he will soon enter the presidential race, with the hope of capturing the Republican nomination and defeating Joe Biden in November 2024. \u201cNow\u2019s not the time to rest on our laurels,\u201d DeSantis said in his state of the state address on Tuesday. \u201cWe will stand strong. We will hold the line. We won\u2019t back down. And I can promise you this: you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d"

            "title": "Fox News braces for more turbulence as second defamation lawsuit advances",
            "date": "2023-03-13T06:00:11Z",
            "content": "As Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox Corporation battles to contain the Dominion lawsuit scandal that has engulfed its top executives and stars, another crisis is building in the wings that has the potential to cause further turbulence for the media empire. Smartmatic\u2019s lawsuit against Fox News has attracted only a fraction of the attention garnered by the legal action of Dominion Voting Systems. Yet both firms are suing Fox for defamation related to its coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s stolen-election lie, and both pose a serious threat to Fox\u2019s finances and reputation. In fact, on paper Smartmatic\u2019s suit appears to be the more dangerous. It\u2019s demanding damages of $2.7bn, compared with Dominion\u2019s $1.6bn. So far, attempts by Fox lawyers to have the Smartmatic case dismissed have fallen on stony ground. Last week the New York state supreme court in Manhattan gave the green light for the case to proceed against Fox News, the Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, the former business anchor Lou Dobbs and Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Smartmatic, a global election technology company headquartered in London, lodged its defamation suit in February 2021. \u201cThe Earth is round,\u201d was the complaint\u2019s striking opening sentence. \u201cTwo plus two equals four. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the 2020 election \u2026 \u201d The complaint goes on to argue that, contrary to these indisputable facts, Fox News broadcast a series of blatant lies in support of Trump\u2019s stolen election conspiracy theory. \u201cDefendants did not want Biden to win the election. They wanted President Trump to win re-election \u2026 They also saw an opportunity to capitalize on President Trump\u2019s popularity by inventing a story.\u201d To prop up that story, the lawsuit claims, Fox needed a villain. That villain was Smartmatic. Smartmatic claims that more than 100 false statements were broadcast by Fox News hosts and guests. Smartmatic was falsely said to have been involved in 2020 election counts in six battleground states \u2013 in fact, it was present only at the count in Los Angeles county. Fox broadcast that Smartmatic shared its technology with Dominion, when in fact the two companies had no communication and regarded each other as rivals. Smartmatic was in cahoots with foreign governments in a conspiracy to rig the vote for Biden, Giuliani said on Bartiromo\u2019s show \u2013 a claim that the company disputes as false and defamatory. Fox also described Smartmatic as having been founded in Venezuela at the behest of corrupt dictators. In fact, it was founded by Antonio Mugica and Roger Pi\u00f1ate in 2000 in Boca Raton, Florida, in the wake of the \u201changing chad\u201d fiasco, with the aim of using technology to restore people\u2019s faith in election results. The business has since grown around the world. The firm claims that it has lost clients as a result of what it calls Fox\u2019s \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d. Fox News has disputed Smartmatic\u2019s multibillion estimate of its losses, calling it vastly inflated. A spokesperson for the broadcaster told the Guardian: \u201cFreedom of the press is foundational to our democracy and must be protected, in addition to the damages claims being outrageous, unsupported and not rooted in sound financial analysis, serving as nothing more than a flagrant attempt to deter our journalists from doing their jobs. There is nothing more newsworthy than covering the president of the US and his lawyers making allegations.\u201d Smartmatic has a very high bar to meet if it is to win the defamation suit at trial. New York state law has a rigorous approach to the first amendment of the US constitution which preserves press freedom. Under it, plaintiffs have to be able to convince a jury that not only did the media outlet put out false information, it did so with \u201cactual malice\u201d. That means that it either knew it was peddling a lie and went ahead anyway, or showed a reckless disregard for the truth. \u201cNew York is pretty protective of media rights,\u201d said Roy Gutterman, a media law professor at Syracuse University who was a consultant early on in the Smartmatic case advising a non-party entity. \u201cEvery year I read a lot of cases from New York, and it\u2019s hard to be successful in this state.\u201d Despite this tough challenge, so far the wind is in Smartmatic\u2019s sails. David Cohen, the New York supreme court justice presiding over the litigation, has indicated that the company has a strong enough case to go to trial. In last week\u2019s ruling, Cohen found that \u201cat a minimum, Fox News turned a blind eye to a litany of outrageous claims\u201d about Smartmatic. \u201cPlaintiffs have pleaded facts sufficient to allow a jury to infer that Fox News acted with actual malice.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-06T18:00:05Z",
            "content": "Turkey\u2019s six-party opposition coalition has selected a bookish bureaucrat to challenge Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s two-decade rule as president at the forthcoming elections, after turmoil surrounding its choice of candidate. A longtime head of the Republican People\u2019s party (CHP), Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu will attempt to challenge Erdo\u011fan in a general election currently expected to take place in mid-May, despite criticism that the 74-year-old economist lacks the political flair and charisma required to challenge Erdo\u011fan\u2019s populism. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu was appointed as presidential candidate by the National Alliance opposition bloc made up of his CHP along with the nationalist Good party (\u0130yi Parti) and several smaller breakaway parties from Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party (AKP), who have pledged to band together to topple Erdo\u011fan and overhaul the changes that have marked his rule, including returning the country to a parliamentary rather than presidential system. The election presents a rare opportunity for the opposition to challenge Erdo\u011fan and his AKP, amid the political fallout from deadly earthquakes last month that killed more than 45,000 people in Turkey and prompted accusations of a lacklustre government response. Polling in the weeks after the earthquake showed a small dip in the AKP\u2019s popularity and an uptick in support for opposition parties, primarily the CHP and the Good party. There is widespread concern that this ballot represents the last opportunity to preserve Turkish democracy and prevent the country from sliding further towards autocratic rule. The democracy nonprofit Freedom House described how Erdo\u011fan\u2019s efforts to dismantle Turkish institutions and a continuing economic crisis threatened the country\u2019s future. \u201cThe AKP government showed growing contempt for political rights and civil liberties and has pursued a wide-ranging crackdown on critics and opponents since 2016,\u201d it said. The declaration that K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu will run against Erdo\u011fan followed days of public squabbles among the opposition alliance, after the political heavyweight Meral Ak\u015fener\u2019s decision to briefly quit the group at the prospect of K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s candidacy. Ak\u015fener, a former interior minister who heads the Good party, declared that appointing K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu as the bloc\u2019s presidential candidate risked losing the election entirely, and last week called on the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu, or Ankara\u2019s mayor, Mansur Yava\u015f, to stand instead. In a dramatic about-face, Ak\u015fener and her party returned to the opposition coalition shortly before a meeting to announce K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s candidacy, after reportedly accepting \u0130mamo\u011flu and Yava\u015f as joint vice-presidential candidates. After the announcement of his candidacy, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu said the heads of each of the other five parties in the opposition coalition would become vice-presidential nominees along with \u0130mamo\u011flu and Yava\u015f. This is despite the coalition seeking to eliminate the role if they succeed in taking power. \u201cOur table is the table of peace and brotherhood. We, the Nation\u2019s Alliance, will rule Turkey through consultation,\u201d he said. Observers fear the very public disunity among the six-party opposition group will only benefit Erdo\u011fan before a contentious election. Selim Sazak, a political consultant who works with the opposition coalition agreed. \u201cUnless the National Alliance can build a coherent narrative around this decision and communicate it effectively, and the questions people are now asking are answered fully and convincingly, then Erdo\u011fan is going to have a field day with this \u2013 a field week, a field two months. Until the election, this will be the talk everywhere.\u201d"

            "content": "New South Wales Labor has secured enough seats to form government in its own right after targeting a series of key seats during the campaign. The Coalition suffered major losses across western Sydney and key regional areas, losing at least nine seats to Labor and is projected to lose at least one other to independents. Votes were still being counted on Saturday night, but these are the key results that have been called. Sydney East Hills Eleventh-hour campaigning with Dominic Perrottet could not save the Liberal party\u2019s Wendy Lindsay from defeat in the south-western Sydney seat of East Hills. The ultra-marginal and traditionally Labor seat was held on a margin of just 0.1% after the 2019 election. Camden Sally Quinnell took back the outer south-west seat of Camden for Labor, winning it from Liberal Peter Sidgreaves after a single term in the parliament. He won it at the last election on a margin of 7.3%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Parramatta There\u2019s been a swing away from the Liberals in the outgoing MP Geoff Lee\u2019s seat of Parramatta, as analysts had expected. He held the seat on a 6.5% margin, but the area\u2019s demographics have shifted since 2019. Labor\u2019s Donna Davis defeated Katie Mullens to pick up the key western Sydney electorate, which both leaders frequented in the weeks before the election. Penrith The former deputy Liberal leader, Stuart Ayres, is projected to have lost the seat of Penrith in favour of Labor\u2019s Karen McKeown, although on Saturday night he said he was awaiting further counting. Ayres was emotional as he campaigned alongside the premier in the seat he had held on a 0.6% margin. Perrottet last year removed Ayres from his cabinet after the trade job saga, but had promised to return him if things worked out at the election. Riverstone The Liberals have also lost the outer north-west suburb of Riverstone to Labor\u2019s Warren Kirby. It was previously held by retiring MP Kevin Conolly on a margin of 6.2%. Ryde Ryde has also fallen to Labor after the resignation of respected retiring member and Liberal minister Victor Dominello. The local mayor, Jordan Lane, had hoped to retain the seat for the Liberals that was previously held on an 8.9% margin. Lyndal Howison has returned the seat to Labor\u2019s hands for the first time since 2007. Regional gains Monaro After losing their candidate early in the campaign, the former Labor cabinet minister Steve Whan has won back his regional seat from the Nationals MP Nichole Overall. She won the seat with an 11.6% margin at a byelection after the resignation of the former Nationals leader John Barilaro. South Coast Liberal hopeful Luke Sikora has failed to secure the once safe South Coast seat after the resignation of Shelley Hancock, who was the local member for 20 years. The seat, which includes Jervis Bay and St Georges Basin, was picked up by Labor\u2019s Liza Butler. Terrigal Labor\u2019s Sam Boughton has turned the usually safe Liberal seat red. Adam Crouch had previously held the Central Coast seat on a 12.3% margin. Independent successes Wakehurst The outgoing minister Brad Hazzard\u2019s seat of Wakehurst is projected to fall into independent hands despite the comfortable 21.9% margin before polling day. The local mayor, Michael Regan, is on track to win the seat against the Liberal hopeful Toby Williams. Wollondilly Judy Hannan is the only Climate 200-backed candidate on track to win a seat. After an unsuccessful bid at the last election, the independent is projected to claimed the large semi-regional seat from the Liberal incumbent, Nathaniel Smith."

            "content": "The rival left and right factions of the New South Wales Liberals look set to face off in a contest over who becomes the state\u2019s next opposition leader, as the incoming Labor government sweats on a handful of undecided seats to see whether it will govern in a majority. As counting resumed on Monday, Labor\u2019s chances of forming majority government in the new parliament were in the balance after the inclusion of pre-poll votes saw it fall behind in the seat of Terrigal on the state\u2019s central coast. While Labor\u2019s incoming treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, announced the party would swear in an interim cabinet on Tuesday, it remained two seats short of a majority. It could mean the incoming premier, Chris Minns, would be forced into bargaining with an eclectic bloc of crossbench MPs, with demands ranging from gambling reform to feral horse culls. At the same time, key Liberals were still coming to terms with the end of 12 years of conservative government in the state after Saturday\u2019s election loss, with a handful of MPs jockeying to replace the outgoing premier, Dominic Perrottet, as the party\u2019s leader. The outgoing attorney general, Mark Speakman, released a statement saying he would hold discussions with colleagues to \u201censure that we have a strong, refreshed and energised team\u201d to hold the new Labor government \u201caccountable in the interests of the people\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll have more to say shortly,\u201d he said in the statement. Speakman, who held senior ministerial positions in both the Perrottet and Berejiklian governments, is the most likely contender from the party\u2019s moderate faction after the outgoing treasurer, Matt Kean, declared he would not run for the position on Monday. Seen as capable but cautious, Speakman would probably to face competition in the form of fellow former ministers Anthony Roberts or Alister Henskens. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Both are from the party\u2019s right faction and could face pushback from the dominant moderates. \u201cIt won\u2019t be Roberts,\u201d was one senior moderate\u2019s blunt assessment on Monday. The party received some good news on Monday, with preference counts saving Tim James in the seat of Willoughby after independent Larissa Penn appeared set to take the seat. Adam Crouch also regained the lead from Labor\u2019s candidate in Terrigal, after a swing of more than 12% away from the Liberals. With a glut of seats still close to call, Labor was sweating on results in Kiama, Ryde, and Terrigal. By Monday afternoon it had won 45 seats, meaning it needed to win at least two of those three to reach the 47 needed to form a majority government. However, a number of other seats remained in doubt. In the electorate of Miranda, in Sydney\u2019s Sutherland shire, the Liberal MP Eleni Petinos was ahead of Labor\u2019s Simon Earle by only 71 votes, after suffering a 14% swing against her. In the seat of Goulburn in the state\u2019s south, outgoing minister Wendy Tuckerman was ahead by about 300 votes. Whether Labor wins majority could have a significant impact on the incoming government\u2019s agenda. Minns repeatedly ruled out formal deals with the crossbench during the election, but may be forced to bargain with a mishmash of independents and minor parties potentially able to wield significant influence in the new parliament. Regardless though, Minns will be sworn in as the state\u2019s 47th premier along with an interim cabinet made up of members of his senior leadership team on Tuesday. Mookhey will be the first Australian minister to be sworn in on the Bhagavad Gita, a holy scripture of Hinduism. The interim cabinet will be made up of Minns, Mookhey, Penny Sharpe in the environment portfolio, Jo Haylen in transport, Ryan Park in health and John Graham as the special minister of state. On Monday, Mookhey said the wider ministry would probably be sworn in next week. \u201cAs a result, tomorrow there will be a Labor government formed in NSW constitutionally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will allow us to have access to the public service and to get the briefings by departments. It will formally bring an end to the caretaker conventions, is the other point here, which will allow decision making to resume in NSW.\u201d"

            "content": "Legalise Cannabis has leapfrogged the Shooters Fishers Farmers and Animal Justice parties to give it its strongest chance yet at entering the New South Wales parliament, despite predictions of minor parties playing kingmaker roles failing to materialise. The so-called teal wave that saw environment- and integrity-focused independent candidates elected at last year\u2019s federal election failed to be replicated in NSW, with only one Climate 200-endorsed candidate predicted to win a seat. But minor parties are projected to increase their share of the votes in the upper house and Legalise Cannabis and the Liberal Democrats could pick up their first seats, with votes still being counted. Legalise Cannabis is on track to have 4.2% of the upper house vote. While the party may fall short of securing a seat, a candidate, Jeremy Buckingham, described the count being at the \u201cupper end\u201d of his expectations. Climate 200\u2019s chief executive, Byron Fay, said despite the results for candidates it backed in Wollondilly and Pittwater being too close to call, the poll was a boon for the independent movement. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He pointed to the independent Michael Regan \u2013 a local mayor who won the seat of Wakehurst \u2013 and the tight contest in Willoughby as positive steps for those communities. \u201cThese seats have been safe forever \u2013 until now. As a result, voters were taken for granted, their voices weren\u2019t being heard,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re marginal, these seats present genuine contests and voters there can\u2019t be ignored, and with thousands of locals deeply engaging with democracy for the first time, this is a very healthy development for society.\u201d On Sunday the Pittwater independent Jacqui Scruby remained hopeful that she could win, despite analysts predicting Rob Stokes\u2019s replacement, Rory Amon, would retain the seat for the Liberals on a slim margin. She said she felt like the independent movement in the northern Sydney seat had \u201calready won\u201d, even if the final result did not go her way. \u201cI feel incredibly happy that our community is falling into a pattern of close election contests between the Liberals and independents,\u201d she said. \u201cThat contest of ideas can only be a good thing. Pittwater will not be considered safe by the Liberal party for years to come.\u201d The independent Willoughby challenger Larissa Penn also remained optimistic about picking up the blue-ribbon seat from the Liberal Tim James, after coming close at the 2022 byelection that followed the resignation of Gladys Berejiklian. When counting paused on Saturday night, James was predicted to hold the seat with a 0.7% margin. \u201cThere are more votes to be counted and then postal votes to come in as well \u2013 if voters have filled in all the boxes and allocated their preferences, then we are in for another close result,\u201d Penn said on Sunday. She said the optional preferential voting system had caused confusion and angst on the booths, echoing calls from other independents for the system to be revised. The Greens enjoyed a slight swing towards them overall but suffered in Balmain, after the resignation of the longtime member Jamie Parker. The Greens candidate, Kobi Shetty, is expected to retain the seat for the Greens on a tight margin. \u201cThe Balmain results are still too close to call at this stage so we are waiting until tomorrow for counting to restart,\u201d Shetty told supporters on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ll be spending some time with my family and waiting to see the numbers roll in. Either way, I look forward to continuing to represent this amazing community for many years to come.\u201d The Greens look set to gain two seats in the upper house, with Cate Faerhmann returned alongside the incoming member Amanda Cohn. The One Nation vote remained steady in the upper house, where it is on track to gain a seat."

            "date": "2023-03-27T07:13:42Z",
            "content": "The cost-of-living crisis in western Sydney and a loss of trust in government drove voters in the region away from the Coalition in a shift that decided the New South Wales election, experts say. Western Sydney has been labelled the region where \u201celections are won and lost\u201d after it played pivotal roles in the NSW election as well as last year\u2019s federal poll. At the 2022 federal election, several key seats in the populous region flipped from Liberal to Labor. A similar situation played out in Saturday\u2019s state election as the seats of Parramatta, Penrith, Riverstone, Holsworthy, Camden and East Hills all switched to Labor, providing the party with a path to victory. The Liberal party had held some of those seats for more than a decade, but their first preference vote collapsed by 15% in Parramatta, 14% in Riverstone and 8% in Camden, amid a statewide swing of more than 7%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Liberals also fell further behind in some western Sydney seats held by Labor, such as Canterbury, Granville and Bankstown. Christopher Brown, chairman of the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue, says this swing was a result of communities hurting from a worsening cost-of-living crisis. He says workers in the region often have to travel further and pay more to commute, amid rising interest rates and the increased costs of bills and groceries. \u201cThe result was deeply rooted in the cost-of-living crisis,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere hurting more than the commuter belt of north-western and south-western Sydney. These are the guys struggling with mortgages that represent the highest percentage of their income.\u201d He said Labor\u2019s focus on essential worker wages was key to the success of the party\u2019s campaign, in contrast to the infrastructure projects the Coalition had become known for. \u201cThe punters chose a different team and it reflects a changing dynamic,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want nurses rather than hospitals; they want teachers rather than schools.\u201d Brown said any future election campaign would ignore western Sydney \u201cat their own peril\u201d, adding the NSW result reflected a region unafraid to \u201cflex its political muscle\u201d. \u201cThis is the third-biggest economy in Australia. We\u2019re bigger than Brisbane,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the place that determines governments in Australia and in NSW. Not through arrogance, but through the numbers. \u201cWestern Sydney is where federal and state elections are won and lost. Simple as that.\u201d But policy decisions weren\u2019t the only factors in securing the large swings for Labor \u2013 the choice of candidates also played a big role, experts say. Prof Andy Marks, director of the Centre for Western Sydney at Western Sydney University, said Labor\u2019s decision to pick candidates from local government in key seats such as Parramatta and Penrith paid off. \u201cThey already had an existing profile. They\u2019re well known in the community and there\u2019s trust there.\u201d Marks said a trust in government was also a factor \u2013 a legacy of the harsh lockdown restrictions implemented across western Sydney during the pandemic. He said the \u201cinfamous sight\u201d of partygoers at Bondi beach while western Sydney was under strict restrictions shaped how people \u201cperceive\u201d the government. \u201cA lot of people felt that the response to the pandemic wasn\u2019t equitable across greater Sydney, particularly when you\u2019re looking at areas on the coast,\u201d Marks said. \u201cThose things do stick with voters. They may not turn the vote in particular, but it adds to a sentiment around the issue of trust and integrity. \u201cWe saw people who felt disenfranchised from some of the narratives of government.\u201d Elfa Moraitakis, chief executive officer at SydWest Multicultural Services, said Covid restrictions, which included travel restrictions and a curfew, had a lasting impact on people\u2019s opinions of the Coalition government. \u201cPeople thought that the great divide and the tale of the two cities has been all forgotten,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately for the outgoing government, the community did not forget and that sentiment translated into votes and to the swing we saw.\u201d Moraitakis said low-income families in western Sydney had been struggling with basics, such as affording food and maintaining a job, and the election was an opportunity to be heard. \u201cThey definitely feel heard but they also want to see a government that will deliver to its promises. \u201cWe\u2019ve never provided more emergency vouchers to people struggling than we have during this cost-of-living crisis. Our homelessness program has exceeded capacity. People are struggling with childcare and to find housing. \u201cAnd that played a huge role in who they decided to vote for. It was definitely a cost-of-living election.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-06T18:26:00Z",
            "content": "Estonia\u2019s popular centre-right prime minister, Kaja Kallas, has begun weighing options for a new governing coalition after a sweeping election victory in which she received more personal votes than any politician in the country\u2019s history. The centre-right leader, one of Europe\u2019s strongest pro-Kyiv voices, said on Monday she felt \u201chumble and grateful\u201d for a result that showed Estonians \u201coverwhelmingly value liberal values, security founded on EU and Nato, and firm support to Ukraine\u201d. Kallas\u2019s Reform party finished first in Sunday\u2019s elections on 31.2% of the vote, giving it 37 MPs in Estonia\u2019s 101-seat assembly, three more than in the previous parliament. Its far-right rival, the Conservative People\u2019s party (EKRE), lost two seats, finishing second with 17. Kristi Raik, a political scientist, said the outcome suggested a desire for continuity reflecting Kallas\u2019s \u201cstrong leadership in the most serious security crisis since Estonia regained independence in 1991\u201d, and popular dislike of EKRE\u2019s policies. Kallas has ruled out going into coalition with the far-right party, which campaigned against additional military aid to Kyiv and called for an end to the arrivals of Ukrainian refugees and radical cuts to overall immigration to protect Estonian workers. Reform has promised to raise military spending to 3% of GDP and lower business taxes in Estonia, an EU and Nato member bordering Russia that has so far spent 1% of its GDP on military aid to Ukraine \u2013 proportionately more than any other country. Kallas said talks with possible coalition partners could begin on Tuesday. She may try to relaunch her present three-party coalition with the Social Democrats and Isamaa (Fatherland), or seek a deal with the Centre party or liberal newcomers Estonia 200. Centre won 14.7%, Estonia 200 13.5%, the Social Democrats 9.4% and Isamaa 8.3%. \u201cWe are weighing the benefits and drawbacks,\u201d Kallas said, adding that discussion would be needed with other party leaders before formal negotiations could start. Rein Toomla, a political analyst from the Johan Skytte Institute, said it appeared that Reform could now safely exclude EKRE from the coalition-building process as the latter\u2019s \u201cposition has now become so weak that it can be easily ignored\u201d. EKRE\u2019s leader, Martin Helme, suggested that Reform had stolen the election, in which more than 50% of voters voted electronically. \u201cWe did everything right, and with honesty, unlike those who stole our well-deserved victory,\u201d he said. The centre-right prime minister, whose multiple prewar warnings about the intentions of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, have boosted her international credibility, has been vocal in her demands for more western military aid to Ukraine. The Centre party, traditionally popular with Estonia\u2019s large Russian-speaking minority, has largely supported her policy towards Ukraine and Russia, prompting a collapse in its electoral support and the loss of 10 parliamentary seats. Reform finished first in the previous 2019 elections but was then kept out of power when three smaller parties formed a government that subsequently collapsed in 2021, allowing Kallas to step in and build a new coalition. After the pre-election concerns that EKRE might outperform expectations, meanwhile, analysts said the far-right party had made a strategic error in challenging the government\u2019s line on Ukraine and Russia. \u201cTheir main communication mistake was the sharp confrontation they sought with the armed forces, and their tactic of calling into question core tenets of national security,\u201d Ott Lumi, a political scientist, told the Estonian news agency ERR. The misstep was all the stranger because EKRE prided itself on its military credentials, he said. \u201cIt seems their campaign stance, flatly ignoring their rivals\u2019 arguments and making themselves into something of a pariah, scared potential voters off,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2023-03-20T09:05:45Z",
            "content": "Thailand\u2019s parliament has been dissolved, paving the way for an election in May that will pit military-linked candidates against the daughter of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has endorsed a decree to dissolve parliament, according to an announcement in the Royal Gazette on Monday. An election must be held between 45 and 60 days after the house\u2019s dissolution. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, 68, who first came to power in a coup in 2014, will run for re-election under a new party, United Thai Nation. However, he is permitted to serve for only another two years before reaching the eight-year term limit, according to a ruling by the constitutional court. Prayuth is also trailing behind the opposition candidate, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, and her party, Pheu Thai, in the polls. Paetongtarn, 36, who is expected to be nominated as Pheu Thai\u2019s candidate, has said she is campaigning to win by a landslide. Parties associated with the billionaire Shinawatra family have won the most seats in every election since 2001. They have also been ousted from power repeatedly; Paetongtarn\u2019s aunt Yingluck was forced from office by a court ruling in 2014, and Paetongtarn\u2019s father Thaksin was ousted by a military coup in 2006. Both Thaksin and Yingluck live in exile. The family is loathed by the royalist military establishment, but remains incredibly popular in rural areas of the north and north-east. Thaksin\u2019s former party, Thai Rak Thai, was the \u201conly party that credibly proposed policies and delivered on these policy promises in a way that concretely improved the wellbeing of people on a large scale,\u201d said Napon Jatusripitak, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \u201cIt has an enduring impact on people\u2019s political preferences.\u201d Even if Pheu Thai performs well, however, the party may not be able to put forward a prime minister. \u201cPheu Thai is the only party that currently stands a credible chance of forming a majority in the house, but it happens to be the least likely to secure the support of the senate,\u201d said Napon. Thailand\u2019s 250 senators, who were appointed by the military, vote alongside the 500-member House of Representatives to select a prime minister. The party would probably need to collaborate with existing political parties, whether these were in the current opposition or the ruling coalition, said Napon. This could involve a deal with the former army chief Prawit Wongsuwan, who was once a close ally of Prayuth but is running as the candidate of the ruling party, Palang Pracharath. Prawit, 77, has sought to pitch himself as a unity candidate who can bridge Thailand\u2019s political divides. Anutin Charnvirakul, 56, leader of the Bhumjaithai party and the current health minister, who championed the decriminalisation of marijuana last year, has also been cited by some analysts as a potential contender. May\u2019s elections will be the first to be held since youth-led mass protests in 2020 shook Thailand\u2019s establishment by calling for the powers of the country\u2019s monarchy to be curbed, and for the military-backed constitution to be rewritten. The protests halted in 2021, as the authorities began to file legal charges including under the strict lese-majesty law, which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. At least 1,890 people, including 284 young people under 18, have been charged under various laws. Move Forward, the only party that has backed calls for reform of the lese-majesty law, has reportedly softened its rhetoric on the issue in the run-up to the election. It was unclear what impact the election could have on young people if they felt their views were not represented, said Napon. \u201cDoes it produce the kind of political apathy as you see elsewhere? Or will it lead to extra-parliamentary-style politics, going out on the streets and more protests?\u201d"

The proportional house gives space for minor parties to win representation and is finely balanced between left and right. The council consists of 42 members: 21 are elected every four years for an eight-year term. The house is elected proportionally with all members representing the whole state. This means the seat results closely mirror the vote results. A party gets one seat for every 4.5% of the vote they poll, with the remaining votes and preference flows deciding the last few seats. The chamber currently has a slim rightwing majority.

His running mate is the outgoing member for Bankstown, Tania Mihailuk, who had been a Labor member until her seat was abolished and she failed to win preselection for the replacement seat. If One Nation can repeat its 2019 result, it will have a total of four seats, with Latham able to pick someone else to fill his former seat for the next four years. The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers had their best result in 2019, and have had some trouble since then, losing all three lower house members. But even half the party\u2019s 2019 vote would still probably be enough to win a seat. Fred Nile\u2019s Christian Democratic party and its predecessors had won a seat at every upper house election from 1981 until 2015, but fell short in 2019, and has since been deregistered. Nile is running second on a ticket led by his wife, Silvana, this year, but their group has not nominated enough candidates to get a box above the line so will probably poll a small share of the vote and not win any seats. The Animal Justice party is defending the seat it won in 2015. The party now holds two seats, but won those seats with the lowest primary votes for a successful candidate under the current voting system, and is in real danger of losing one of those seats this year. There are a number of other contenders but the strongest challenger is probably Legalise Cannabis, headed up by the former Greens MLC Jeremy Buckingham. The party has performed strongly since changing its name, winning seats in the Victorian and Western Australian state elections. If Legalise Cannabis can poll as strongly as it did in Victoria, or as it did in NSW at the last federal election, it will win a seat. Overall these numbers point towards three or four seats for minor parties of the left, and three or four seats for minor parties of the right. But preferences can play a role in deciding the final seats, and at recent elections those preferences have boosted the position of the left. At the last three state elections, a candidate on the left overtook a candidate on the right on the back of stronger preference flows. That could make a difference in the Legislative Council. Voters in the upper house have the option to just mark 1 for a group above the line on the ballot paper and leave it there. That is the most popular option, but more voters are choosing to mark more preferences, and that can make a real difference once your first preference party is no longer in the race. The polls are currently suggesting a small swing to the left, which puts Labor and the other parties of the left on track to win 11 seats between them. This would produce a 21-all tie, but a 12th left seat would produce a progressive majority. That could make a big difference if a Labor government is formed \u2013 a 21-all tie would mean it would probably need the Greens and the Shooters to pass legislation, while a 22-20 split to the left would give it more options."

            "date": "2023-03-20T16:11:54Z",
            "content": "Bringing Boris Johnson back as Conservative leader would be seen as \u201can utter joke\u201d by voters, who would not tolerate yet another change of prime minister, a leading elections expert has said. Robert Hayward, who is a Conservative peer but has analysed May\u2019s local elections across England in his dual role as a polling expert, said the Tories could perform better than expected in the council vote, in part because Rishi Sunak has been able to start detaching himself from Johnson\u2019s political legacy. Sunak\u2019s personal poll ratings were not only outperforming those of his party, but were ahead of those for Johnson, particularly in areas such as trustworthiness, Hayward told a briefing. Bringing back Johnson, as sought by some Conservative MPs, could well transform the party\u2019s fortunes, but \u201cin a negative way, not in a positive way\u201d, Hayward said. \u201cHaving had two different prime ministerial changes last year, there is no credibility whatsoever that we would have another one and not say the Tory party is finished,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be an utter joke \u2026 The electorate would not accept another change.\u201d While the Conservatives remain significantly behind Labour in national polling, Hayward said there were signs Sunak had been able to shake off some of the damage caused by Johnson and the scandal of lockdown-breaking parties, an issue set to return to the headlines this week when Johnson gives evidence to the Commons privileges committee. \u201cThe impact of Boris on Tory party polling appears to be diminishing, and this may be currently to the Conservatives\u2019 advantage,\u201d Hayward said, noting that polling showed the indicator for \u201cConservative leader as the best prime minister\u201d was now some way above the party\u2019s own rating. This \u201chas the potential to drag the Conservatives up, if Rishi can continue to maintain that messaging through all the noise of other things\u201d, Hayward said. \u201cThe population has not parked Partygate. They still view it as a Tory party matter, but they are viewing it as a Boris matter.\u201d These small signs of recovery should, however, be seen in the wider context, Hayward said: \u201cThe reality is that the Conservatives were in a very difficult, if not dire, position, and they now appear to be moving to a difficult one. I\u2019m in no way saying that they\u2019re out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d But the Tory position was \u201cmarkedly better than it was only a few weeks ago\u201d, he added. In the local elections on 4 May more than 8,000 council seats will be contested across 84 metropolitan, unitary and district councils in England, as well as four English mayoralties. The last time the seats were contested, in 2019, Theresa May\u2019s government was struggling terribly and lost more than 1,000 councillors. Labour, then under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, also lost seats, while the Liberal Democrats, Greens and local parties made gains. While refusing to predict whether the Conservatives might gain seats in May, Hayward said the elections were a definite test for Keir Starmer\u2019s party: \u201cThe Labour party need to make major gains because they did so badly in 2019.\u201d The Lib Dems, who held their first in-person conference since 2019 at the weekend, are privately confident about progress in May, despite having made more than 700 net gains in 2019."

            "date": "2023-03-15T14:12:55Z",
            "content": "Niki Struving, a 21-year-old student in Amsterdam, sits under an umbrella next to a circus tent, in bitter winds and driving rain. She is braving icy weather to campaign for more affordable housing \u2013 a key topic in Dutch regional elections this week. For a country known for its fiscal prudence, the Netherlands is suffering a surprising housing crisis. \u201cIn a couple of years I won\u2019t be a student any more, but where will I go?\u201d says Struving. \u201cBack to my parents? I have a student debt of \u20ac30,000, so how would I buy?\u201d Years of government policy have stimulated home ownership and left building to the market, creating a situation where many are priced out and cannot find an affordable house to buy, or to rent. Dozens of people demonstrated last week in The Hague and presented a petition with 102,621 signatures calling for affordable housing to Hugo de Jonge, the housing minister. The average home costs \u20ac424,681, more than 10 times the modal income. From 2015 to 2021, average household disposable income increased by 25%, but house prices rocketed by 63%, fuelled by low interest and a national shortage of 390,000 homes. By the peak of its housing boom last year, houses in hotspots had increased by more than 130% since the end of 2013. But cold winds are blowing in a country judged by the Economist to be one of the developed markets most vulnerable to a housing crash. The most up-to-date indicators suggest house prices have dropped year-on-year by 6%, and the central bank De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), Rabobank and the IMF predict falls to come, but not enough to correct the recent, extreme price rises. The government aims to build 900,000 homes by 2030, but the high price of raw materials, increased borrowing costs and nitrogen pollution from building work are already a challenge. Almost 60% of the 8m Dutch homes are owner occupied, while there are 2.6 million rent-controlled social homes, with a maximum rent of less than \u20ac800 a month. But in the liberalised sector, rents have spiralled in the big cities and \u2013 unlike for social housing or owner occupied homes \u2013 there is no government help. The Dutch economist Mathijs Bouman says that although the housing market has previously seen \u201chysterical\u201d fluctuations, things got out of hand during the pandemic when mortgages dropped to about 1% as central banks lowered interest to stimulate the economy. \u201cThe housing crisis is extremely serious and has worsened in recent years,\u201d says Dr Cody Hochstenbach, an urban geographer at the University of Amsterdam who has written a book on the problems. \u201cThe number of homeless people has doubled, a quarter of renters struggle to pay their bills, class differences have become much more acute and young people are having a tough time, especially those with a low income, without wealthy parents, with difficult backgrounds,\u201d he says. Insufficient housebuilding in the past decade is the obvious cause. Other causes, some believe, are the free-market direction of government, the sale of social housing, the scrapping of a national housing ministry, beneficial schemes for investors, and Europe\u2019s most generous mortgage interest tax relief (leading to one of the world\u2019s highest mortgage debts). \u201cIn the last 30 years, there has been a consistent set of politics based on the ideology of home ownership, encouraging us all to buy as strategic, calculating mini-capitalists,\u201d says Hochstenbach. \u201cPeople are encouraged, hounded even, to borrow as much as they can. The result is to drive up prices and increase the risks, locking people in homes if prices fall because they cannot sell without leaving a debt. \u201cThe Netherlands had a rich tradition of social housing, it was an international example of affordable housing managed by housing corporations. But especially in the last decade, politicians have decimated housing corporations.\u201d Government proposals to regulate rent for more of the Netherlands\u2019 housing stock \u2013 the \u201cmiddle market\u201d \u2013 could even have a counter-productive effect, estate agents believe, encouraging investors to sell up, further inflating non-social rentals and making housebuilding uneconomic. Developers say that regulation \u2013 from energy efficiency targets to nitrogen pollution limits \u2013 is blocking construction. \u201cThe economy will take massive hits due to all these ideological policies which have never been proven to be effective in the creation of better homes for the people who want to live in them,\u201d said Anton Hosman. Housing is key in this week\u2019s provincial elections, says Sjoerd van Heck, an opinion pollster at Ipsos. He notes that rightwing parties are referring to it in the context of immigration, while on the left it is linked with the agricultural sector reducing its nitrogen emissions in order to free up more capacity for building. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting dilemma for the Farmer-Citizen party, which is doing well in the polls,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou never hear them talking about homes, because they would have to do something about the nitrogen.\u201d For the PvdA labour party \u2013 polling as the largest senate party in a pact with the Green Left \u2013 it\u2019s time to change the tone of Dutch housing. \u201cThe real issue is whether you look at housing as a market or as public housing supply, with housing as a constitutional right,\u201d says Henk Nijboer, Labour MP and housing spokesperson. \u201cWhen I started as an MP, a million houses were \u2018under water\u2019, with higher mortgages than their value. That\u2019s a big risk again. Meanwhile, there are hundreds of thousands with a constitutional right to housing, who do not have it because the government has left too much to the market.\u201d But will the interests of wealthier homeowners be so easily outvoted? When 25-year-old house hunter Frederieke told housing minister De Jonge at the protest that, despite a good salary and savings, she could not find something to buy on her own, his reply was telling: \u201cHave you thought about getting a rich boyfriend?\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-05T12:00:53Z",
            "content": "A mile or so from the crashing breakers of the Atlantic, in one of the most affluent parts of Lagos, hushed visitors admire the paintings and prints on the walls of the Nike Art Gallery, one of the biggest such private institutions in Africa. Among the gallery\u2019s visitors last week was Ehi, a businesswoman in her 40s who lives nearby and came with her three children. Hours before, officials had announced the results of Nigeria\u2019s presidential election, held four days earlier. These had left Ehi bitterly disappointed. Her favoured candidate \u2013 Peter Obi, a 61-year-old businessman who had promised reform and a radical change of direction for Nigeria \u2013 had been soundly beaten by Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a veteran \u201cpolitical godfather\u201d who was the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress. \u201c[Obi] articulated what he wanted to do. He had a real programme. Tinubu had no answers. He just left me with more questions,\u201d Ehi said. A few miles across the city, in the gritty, overcrowded streets of Lagos Island, there were different scenes. Voters here had turned out four days earlier to vote en masse for Tinubu, and there was much satisfaction. \u201cNow things will get better. Who knows anything about this Obi man? But we know [Tinubu] \u2026 He will look after us\u201d, said Adeleke Adejoke Bilikis, a jobless 43-year-old. The residents of Lagos are not alone in seeing the election in Africa\u2019s most populous country and biggest economy as a potential inflection point. Nigeria faces economic turmoil, widespread violence and systemic corruption. The eight-year rule of outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari was characterised by drift and disappointment. Before the election, commentators spoke of a chance to \u201cchange the trajectory\u201d. That opportunity seems to have been missed. The poll was very different from the six others held since military rule ended in Nigeria in 1999. One major difference was a new level of competition. Obi campaigned with the tiny Labour party, taking on both Tinubu, 70, and Atiku Abubakar, 76, a second establishment politician who represented the People\u2019s Democracy Party (PDP). For a moment it looked like the decades-old dominance of the APC and the PDP might end. \u201cWhat he has done is pretty mind-boggling. He has challenged the duopoly of two behemoths, two very rich and powerful parties,\u201d said Prof Abiodun Adeniyi, a political analyst at Baze University, Abuja. This was not the only novelty. Where the established parties relied on patronage networks, appeals to ethnic or religious solidarity and a massive party machine to mobilise support, Labour reached out across Nigeria\u2019s faultlines with a slick social media campaign. Tinubu\u2019s campaign slogan was: \u201cIt\u2019s my turn\u201d, which some in Lagos translated less literally but possibly more accurately as \u201cit\u2019s payback time\u201d. Obi, who made a fortune with supermarkets, promised efficient governance and innovation, not pork-barrel politics. His frugal lifestyle and modest approach was another dramatic contrast with Tinubu, who is in no way shy about his massive wealth. Much of Obi\u2019s support came from young people and urban voters. Many are affluent and educated, but not all, as voting returns from polling stations in barracks in Abuja showed. He gained 6m votes [around 25%], and won in the capital and in Lagos, long the fiefdom of Tinubu. \u201cObi is in contrast to our dominant politics. Even if he didn\u2019t win now, he has the potential to be president. His message is resonating with the people,\u201d said Adeniyi. Such analyses will encourage others across the continent. Democracy has been in retreat in many regions, with repressive regimes, parties that have clung to power for 40 years or more, and many \u201cdinosaur\u201d leaders able to see off successive challenges. In many places, opposition candidates have tried to build a popular movement similar to that launched by Obi in Nigeria. They, too, have sought to appeal to Africa\u2019s millions of young voters, whether successful globally networked urbanites or isolated villagers. All, too, have called for an end to politics based on handouts, opaque deals, cronyism, corruption and intimidation. But the efforts of Bobi Wine in Uganda, Nelson Chamisa in Zimbabwe, Adalberto Costa J\u00fanior in Angola and Martin Fayulu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo all met defeat by incumbents backed by security services, police and powerful electoral machines. Last month, Chamisa called on the international community to have \u201ceyes on\u201d the struggling southern African country, despite other crises around the world, and to \u201coffer solidarity\u201d to those fighting for change there. \u201cHere, too, people are being killed for their opinions. Zimbabweans want to see change and want to see a transformation,\u201d Chamisa said. One lesson from the successive defeats of such figures, despite their charisma and integrity, is that eye-catching social media campaigns may raise false hopes. Though Obi dominated \u201cTwitter and other social media spaces driven by his enthusiastic young grassroots supporters \u2026 this online movement did not translate [into] enough votes\u201d, said Kathryn Nwajiaku-Dahou of ODI, a London-based global affairs thinktank. This may partly explain why the Nigerian presidential election recorded the lowest voter turnout since 1999, with only 27% of eligible citizens casting ballots. Fuel and currency shortages were also factors. The exact breakdown of who voted is unclear \u2013 there are suggestions that fewer rural people cast their ballots than those in urban areas \u2013 but analysts predicted a low turnout could lead to a Tinubu win. Another lesson is that deep-rooted identities that have underpinned voting patterns across Africa for decades are enduring. \u201cTinubu, Abubakar and Obi all secured victories in their strongholds as expected,\u201d said Mucahid Durmaz, senior West Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft. \u201cThe political map highlights the fractious nature of Nigerian politics and the continued importance of regional identities, with ethnic and religious undertones. Tinubu will have to unify a country that has retreated into regional and religious blocs, as well as gain the trust of disfranchised urban youths and Christian Igbos in the south-east.\u201d In Abuja, Afolabi Adekaiyaoja, a research analyst at the Centre for Democracy and Development, agreed. \u201cIdentity politics played a big role \u2026 The result showed clearly how divided Nigeria is,\u201d he said. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to reformist politicians and movements across Africa is the brutal efficacy of security services loyal to powerful established elites, and the intimidation and fear they inspire. The Nigerian elections saw selective voter suppression and violence which undoubtedly impacted the result, though by how much is unclear. The anxiety is very real. Ehi refused to give her full name for fear of post-election violence or other threats. \u201cWhy take risks?\u201d she asked. Like many, she blamed rigging for the defeat. Opposition parties have challenged the result in Nigeria, pointing to the chaotic count and long delays in posting results. But if there is no immediate evidence of widespread manipulation during or after the Nigerian vote, there is plenty in other elections across the continent. Few believe the ruling Zanu-PF in Zimbabwe will allow a free and fair poll there later this year, and there is little doubt that Fayulu was the true winner of the DRC\u2019s election in 2018. This may mean that the rapid urbanisation, youth, increasing education and growing connectivity of much of Africa has yet to reach the critical level that would allow reformist opposition movements to overcome resistance to radical change, but this may not always be the case. Despite all the setbacks and challenges, Obi may not be too displeased by the outcome of Nigeria\u2019s 2023 elections. The new political map of the country shows the south-east and centre, as well as Lagos, painted in the bright red of the Labour party. Its leader now has the time to gather the resources and create the organisation or alliances he will need for a new and possibly successful bid for the presidency in 2027. \u201cEven if Obi didn\u2019t win he now has the potential to be president. His message is resonating with the Nigerian people. He is offering real change. He has passion and intellect. He has everything going for him \u2026and the system needs someone with a disruptive agenda,\u201d said Adeniyi. This will please Ehi, and hundreds of millions of others in Nigeria and across Africa. \u201cThat is my greatest joy. Each individual is now interested in the good of their country,\u201d she said. \u201cChange will come \u2026 It may not be how we planned it, or expected it, but change will come.\u201d"

Still, his boss never lets him forget his place, and we see how Surya has internalised prejudice too. All of society turns up at his checkpoint.

            "date": "2023-03-02T17:07:15Z",
            "content": "Although Salman Abedi was born in Manchester, on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1994, his path to becoming one of the UK\u2019s most deadly terrorists began in Libya, the country of his parents\u2019 birth. It was from there that Ramadan Abedi and Samia Tabbal fled in 1993, claiming asylum in the UK on the basis that they faced persecution under the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. The couple went on to establish new lives in Fallowfield, south Manchester, with their children attending local schools. But the conflict back in Libya loomed large in the Abedi household, with the family shuttling between Manchester and Tripoli. Ramadan was a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an Islamist organisation opposed to Gaddafi, the Manchester Arena inquiry heard. Sir John Saunders, the inquiry chair, believes the family holds \u201csignificant responsibility\u201d for the radicalisation of Salman and his younger brother Hashem, now serving a life sentence for his role in planning the attack. Salman and Hashem\u2019s ideology was influenced by the extremist views of their parents and older brother Ismail, Saunders found. In September 2011, a month before Gaddafi was killed by rebel fighters, the Abedi family moved back to Libya. Police evidence suggests Salman and Hashem \u2013 then aged 16 and 14 \u2013 fought as part of the civil war. The inquiry saw photographs of the brothers carrying weapons and wearing military uniforms with the sons of Abu Anas al\u2010Libi, an al-Qaida commander linked to the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. It would have been a \u201ca formative experience\u201d for the teenagers, wrote Saunders. By then, Salman was already on the radar of north-west counter-terrorism police. On 30 December 2010, the day before his 16th birthday, officers told MI5 he was linked to an address that was relevant to a \u201ctrace\u201d request and had been stopped \u2013 and \u2013 searched twice, but nothing suspicious was found. A \u201ctrace\u201d is a check of Security Service databases to establish whether they hold \u201cadverse information\u201d on an individual. By September 2012, the eldest three boys returned from Libya without their parents, with Salman enrolling at Manchester College. Within a month he had assaulted a female pupil by hitting her on the back of the head, and it was Ismail who attended meetings about his brother\u2019s behaviour. The college was sufficiently concerned about the absent parents to ask the police to carry out a welfare check, but not to refer him to Channel or Prevent, the anti-extremist programmes. The act of violence was viewed not as evidence of extreme religious ideology but of a bad temper. Saunders accepted that was a reasonable assumption, but wrote: \u201cFor the future, in my view, misogynistic violence should be recognised as a potential indicator of radicalisation.\u201d In 2013, Salman enrolled at Trafford College in Greater Manchester. A staff member told the inquiry she had seen a photo on his mobile phone that showed him holding a gun. She took no action after the teenager said his family had lots of land in Tripoli and he had gone shooting there. \u201cThis image was another potential indicator of extremism that, if looked at cumulatively with the other indicators I have identified, should have justified a referral to Prevent,\u201d ruled Saunders. Libya had a \u201cdetrimental\u201d effect on Salman, wrote Saunders. A cousin told the inquiry that on his return he was \u201cgoing out partying, drinking, smoking weed\u201d, and had developed what appeared to be an addiction to tramadol, a strong painkiller. In March 2014, when Salman was 19, he was made a \u201csubject of interest\u201d by MI5 \u2013someone suspected of being a threat to national security \u2013 because of his association with someone known by the public inquiry as \u201csubject A\u201d. Three months later, on 29 June 2014, Islamic State declared a caliphate. Within a fortnight, Salman and Hashem were back in Libya, where the civil war had reignited. They had to be evacuated by the Royal Navy because extremist militias were fighting in the area. Back in the UK, Salman\u2019s file was closed as a \u201csubject of interest\u201d on 21 July 2014. It was a reasonable decision because of his lack of engagement with individuals of interest, ruled Saunders. But the judge believes the security services should have paid closer attention to Salman\u2019s friendship with a young Mancunian-Libyan called Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was seriously injured while fighting in Libya. \u201cHe returned to Manchester with a hero status among impressionable young men from a Muslim background who were susceptible to Islamic State propaganda,\u201d wrote Saunders. Abdallah told the inquiry Salman had been his friend since they were both \u201cbabies\u201d. The pair exchanged more than 1,000 messages in November 2014 when Abdallah was under surveillance by MI5. He was arrested soon after and Salman visited him in jail when he was on remand. After he was convicted of terrorism offences and jailed in May 2016, the pair communicated on an illegal phone, and Salman made a further prison visit in January 2017. Another \u201clikely\u201d influence on Salman, believes Saunders, was Raphael Hostey, who travelled to Syria to join IS and was killed in a drone strike. Before his death, Hostey became a prominent propagandist for that group, recruiting people from around the world and particularly from his own south Manchester community. It was in Libya, a few weeks before the attack, where Saunders believes Salman probably received instructions in how to assemble the bomb that ultimately killed 22 innocent people at an Ariana Grande concert. Investigators believe Salman and Hashem watched an IS video posted online in 2016, in which a balaclava-clad instructor explained how to make an explosive called triacetone triperoxide. This cannot be definitively proven: data from just two of the 14 electronic devices the brothers were known to have used was ever recovered. But Saunders thinks the brothers were not clever enough to make such a sophisticated bomb by themselves, without having practised beforehand. Neither held qualifications in \u201cchemistry, maths or any other academic discipline that might be relevant\u201d, wrote the judge in volume three of the Manchester Arena inquiry report. Salman had an \u201cundistinguished educational career\u201d, said Saunders, noting that the bomber displayed \u201cproblematic\u201d behaviour at school and college \u2013 particularly while attending Burnage academy in south Manchester, where he was involved in 15 incidents of \u201cextreme rudeness to staff, fighting, swearing, theft and hooliganism\u201d. \u201cIn my view, it is likely that, while in Libya during the period 15 April 2017 to 18 May 2017, [Salman Abedi] received practical instruction on how to assemble an IED [improvised explosive device],\u201d ruled Saunders. The judge also thought it \u201cmore than likely\u201d that when Salman returned to Manchester on 18 May 2017 to carry out his suicide attack he was carrying with him a special Sistema 45910 switch used to detonate the bomb. Saunders believes someone in Libya told Salman how to make his bomb even more deadly, as the 22-year-old replaced some of the ingredients in the final few days before the attack. Should security services have done more to monitor those travelling to and from Libya? Saunders thought so, finding that the intelligence agencies were more focused on preventing people from going to Syria at the time of the attack. \u201cThe threshold that the Security Service applied when deciding whether to investigate any returnee from Libya was, in my view, too high and amounted to a risky position,\u201d wrote Saunders. This was particularly true in south Manchester, which the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre singled out in 2010 as being a place where young members of the Libyan community were in danger of radicalisation. /Ultimately, we will never definitively know why Salman carried out the attack. He blew himself up leaving no note or propaganda video. But Saunders reaches some sort of conclusion as to what drove his hateful act, blaming the \u201cnoxious\u201d absences of his parents, and the \u201cmalign presences\u2019\u201d of radicalising peers. Presenting the report on Thursday, he apologised to the bereaved families for not being able to answer all of their questions. \u201cI did ask the questions; I did get answers,\u201d he said, but for reasons of national security \u201cI have not been able to report publicly what those answers were.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-06T05:00:17Z",
            "content": "It was Boris Johnson who declared, in November 2021, four months before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, that \u201cthe old concepts of fighting big tank battles on the European landmass \u2026 are over\u201d. Today, dozens of destroyed Russian tanks dot Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas fields near Vuhledar, smashed, rusting emblems of a traditional heavy warfare that has returned to Europe. Events have moved fast since Russia invaded last February, but it is worth restating how far planning for conventional war had gone out of fashion before then. Although it was recognised that Russia was a threat, the dominant military thinking was that the goal of authoritarian regimes was \u201cto win without going to war\u201d, as then chief of general staff Sir Nick Carter said in September 2020. It was not just a UK assumption; the idea was widespread that future conflicts would be economic, or fought in cyberspace; by mercenaries or simply deniably in the way Russia\u2019s first incursions into Ukraine in 2014 were led by separatist rebels infiltrated by Moscow\u2019s forces. War, in short, would be less bloody \u2013 and much cheaper. Such thinking underpinned Johnson\u2019s Global Britain strategy, published in March 2021, centred on the deployment of one of two new aircraft carriers to assert relatively obscure freedom of navigation rights in the South China Sea, part of an Indo-Pacific tilt in support of the US\u2019s long-term rivalry with Beijing. \u201cHi-tech was the flavour at the time, and there was an unstated assumption that Britain would not be fighting a war in Europe again. Now, we need to adjust from the swashbuckling of Global Britain to recognise that it might be necessary to adopt a war tempo to support an ally,\u201d said Lord Ricketts, a former British national security adviser. What has followed is a land war that has been violent, expensive and in Britain\u2019s European back yard. When asked what the key lessons were from the Ukraine war so far, Ben Hodges, a former commanding general of the US Army in Europe, said one of them was simply \u201cammunition stores\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s unexpectedly successful resistance, preventing the Russians from seizing Kyiv in early April, rapidly led it into a dilemma. The defenders quickly realised they were running short of Soviet-standard 152mm artillery shells \u2013 the Russians were able to fire as much as 10 times more a day by the summer \u2013 forcing it to turn, successfully, to the UK in late March and then the US, the latter of which agreed to provide the first of many M777 Nato standard 155m howitzers, and related ammunition. Simple artillery has been the most prevalent \u2013 and necessary \u2013 weapon on the battlefield, used grimly by the Russians in a \u201ctotal war\u201d strategy that sees it slowly raze population centres such as Mariupol, Sievierodonetsk and now Bakhmut, to the ground as it has no other way of capturing them. But to sustain Ukraine, it needs continuous help for its own artillery, bringing the west\u2019s traditionally high-specification and slow moving defence industries into a proxy war against Russia. The demands have proved extraordinary. In December, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s top commander, said he had told his British counterpart Adm Tony Radakin that \u201cthe British army fired a million shells in world war one\u201d (in fact the true figure is far higher) \u2013 prompting, he said, an anxious reply: \u201cWe will lose Europe. We will have nothing to live on if you fire that many shells.\u201d Recent estimates, however, suggest that Ukraine is firing about 5,000 rounds a day, 1.8m rounds a year \u2013 and Russia between 5,000 and 20,000 a day, although this is down from a summer peak of 60,000. The future of the war will depend in part on how long each side can continue firing. Both sides are keenly focused on resupply, with speculative reports that Ukraine is waiting on fresh deliveries for the front \u2013 while Russia still wants to obtain missiles, as well as drones, from Iran and continues to woo China, a relationship monitored with concern by the US. Ukrainian commanders emphasise their two other key weapons are longer range, more accurate Himars and other rocket artillery, plus reconnaissance drones that help correct the gunners\u2019 aim. Hodges said that \u201cprecision can defeat mass if you have enough time\u201d and said he believed it may be possible to force Russia to abandon Crimea, as it was forced to abandon the isolated Kherson last November, by repeatedly striking the two main roads that run south into the occupied peninsula, as well as the airbase at Saky and the naval port at Sevastopol. Fixed wing reconnaissance drones, such as Russia\u2019s Orlan-10 and for Ukraine drones from Danish companies Sky Watch and Nordic Wings, have also reduced the surprise element available to attackers because they are able to detect force concentrations behind enemy lines. Lt Col Pavlo Khazan, who leads a reconnaissance unit in the Ukrainian army, says drones are \u201cthe only way to get real-time battlefield information\u201d and the goal is to automatically integrate their work with artillery units. Similarly favouring defenders has been the minimal presence of combat air power, a stark contrast to the west\u2019s favoured model of war fighting, most recently in the bombing campaign against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Ukraine\u2019s air force is small, hanging on for dear life, but Russia has adopted a risk averse approach to avoid losing significant numbers of aircraft to Ukraine\u2019s surviving \u2013 and improving \u2013 air defences. Russia has only lost 6-8% of its active prewar air force and its combat jets, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) thinktank, because they rarely operate beyond the frontlines, compared to 40% of its main battle tanks, hurled into battle with little apparent tactical forethought. \u201cThere is no substitute for competence,\u201d says Ben Barry, a land warfare specialist at the IISS, reflecting the chaotic initial Russian plan to take Kyiv or the efforts to capture cities such as Bakhmut through repeated waves of attack by newly mobilised soldiers. \u201cThe Russian forces appear to have a very poor standard of training compared to the Ukrainians,\u201d as well notably lower morale, Barry continued, allowing Kyiv\u2019s forces to pick them off in places such as Vuhledar in the Donbas. This too has helped the Ukrainian defenders, raising the question whether either side can break through, in a costly conflict that resembles the first world war, with drones, computers and social media clips attached. So far, international military, financial and aid support for Ukraine has totalled \u20ac157bn according to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute and countries such as Poland rearming, by lifting defence spending to 4% of GDP. Amid this apparent slog, military experts have raised the question that so called \u201cmanoeuvre warfare\u201d is over given the prevailing stalemate \u2013 attempts led by mechanised forces to break through behind enemy lines and force chaos, defeat or retreat by a speedy outflanking \u2013 the style of a second world war blitzkrieg. But Ukraine\u2019s spectacular September offensive in Kharkiv tells a different story. It led to the rapid liberation of Kupyansk, Izium and Lyman, showing that \u201csurprise is still possible\u201d, in the words of Barry \u2013 and hopes that with western tanks Ukraine can drive the Russians back further in a type of war that nobody expected would be fought again."

            "date": "2023-03-29T17:00:17Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak is facing questions over a potential conflict of interest after it emerged a childcare firm part owned by his wife is to benefit from major changes in the budget. The prime minister\u2019s wife, Akshata Murty, is listed as a shareholder in Koru Kids, a childcare agency. Koru Kids is likely to benefit from a pilot scheme offered by Jeremy Hunt to incentivise people to become childminders, with \u00a31,200 offered to those who train to become one through an agency. Sunak did not mention his wife\u2019s interest when speaking about the childcare changes at his appearance before the liaison committee on Tuesday. He was asked by the Labour MP Catherine McKinnell whether he had anything to declare. \u201cNo, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way,\u201d he told McKinnell. It is understood the Cabinet Office was told about Murty\u2019s interest in Koru Kids previously but it was not deemed necessary to appear on the public register of ministerial interests, which was last updated in June 2022. The register states that Sunak\u2019s wife owns a venture capital investment company, Catamaran Ventures UK Ltd, without going into detail of any of its shareholdings. Following the reports, first revealed by the i newspaper, the Liberal Democrats called on Sunak to make sure he had not broken the ministerial code in the way that he has dealt with the interest. Wendy Chamberlain, the Lib Dem chief whip, wrote to Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministerial interests, drawing attention to the ministerial code provision which seeks ministers to ensure \u201cthat no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise\u201d, and that they must \u201cscrupulously avoid any danger of an actual or perceived conflict of interest between their ministerial position and their private financial interests\u201d. \u201cThey should be guided by the general principle that they should either dispose of the interest giving rise to the conflict or take alternative steps to prevent it,\u201d the code says. Chamberlain said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s family does appear to have a relevant financial interest in Koru Kids \u2013 which has benefited from a recent change to government policy. There is a clear question as to whether articles 7.1 and 7.7 of the ministerial code have been breached. \u201cI therefore urge you to investigate whether the code has been broken; and if it has not, what steps the prime minister took to ensure that no conflict arose. In particular please set out whether he made you or other senior officials aware of the financial interest in Koru Kids when the childcare policy was being developed.\u201d Magnus is not able to open his own investigations without the permission of the prime minister. Speaking after prime minister\u2019s questions, Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said he had told the No 10 permanent secretary of any relevant interests when he took the job. The government and independent adviser on ministerial interests will publish an annual statement of all those interests in May. However, there is a question of whether Commons rules mean he should have declared it when speaking about childcare at the liaison committee. \u201cHe has followed the process in terms of declaring his interests as set out in the ministerial code,\u201d the spokesperson said. It is understood the government considers that a Commons declaration is not relevant in relation to Sunak\u2019s family interest because any potential conflict would already have been addressed and mitigated under the ministerial declaration process. But Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cRishi Sunak must explain why he failed to come clean when asked about the shares his family held in a company now set to financially benefit from a childcare policy announced in his budget. \u201cHe must urgently correct the record and set out what steps he took to avoid an actual or perceived conflict of interest. No proper explanation has yet been provided by the prime minister as to why this was not deemed necessary to publish in the register of members\u2019 interests.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-07T11:24:57Z",
            "content": "Good morning. The US and China are heading towards inevitable conflict if Washington does not change its approach, China\u2019s new foreign minister has said in a fiery press conference in which he defended his country\u2019s strengthening relationship with Russia. In his first media appearance as foreign minister, held on Tuesday on the sidelines of the \u201ctwo sessions\u201d political gathering, Qin Gang outlined China\u2019s foreign policy agenda for the coming years, presenting China and its relationship with Russia as a beacon of strength and stability, and the US and its allies as a source of tension and conflict. Qin said the US side claimed that it wanted to outcompete China but did not seek conflict \u201cbut in reality, the US side\u2019s so-called competition is all-out containment and suppression, a zero-sum game where you die and I live. \u201cIf the US does not hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrail can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation.\u201d What did Qin say about Russia? \u201cWith China and Russia working together, the world will have a driving force,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more unstable the world becomes the more imperative it is for China and Russia to steadily advance their relations.\u201d Why does Qin think relations with the US have deteriorated? Qin blamed the US for the worsening relations, specifically citing the balloon incident, as well as tensions over Taiwan and the Ukraine war. He said the conflict in Ukraine seems to have been driven by \u201can invisible hand \u2026 using the Ukraine crisis to serve certain geopolitical agendas\u201d, pushing for the protraction and escalation of the conflict. Fox News hit with fresh federal election complaint over Trump camp collusion A US Federal Election Commission complaint over the collusion of Fox News with the Trump campaign in 2020 could be the first of many, the complainant said, amid continued fallout from dramatic court filings in Dominion Voter Systems\u2019 $1.6bn defamation suit against the network. Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog, filed its FEC complaint last week, over the revelation that Rupert Murdoch personally gave Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, confidential information about a Biden campaign ad. A progressive political action committee, End Citizens United, also filed a complaint. As defined by the Harvard Law Review, FEC \u201ccampaign finance restrictions do not apply to costs associated with producing news\u201d. Media Matters alleges that \u201cpress exemption\u201d does not apply to Murdoch\u2019s decision to give the Biden ad to Kushner. What does the complaint say? Saying the move was \u201cdiametrically opposed to Fox Corporation\u2019s regular press activity. Fox Corporation, through Murdoch, appears to have engaged in the exact type of campaign activity to which the commission has repeatedly affirmed the press exemption does not apply. Therefore, Fox Corporation cannot try to exploit the press exemption to avoid the consequences of making an illegal corporate in-kind contribution.\u201d Anti-trans rhetoric takes center stage at CPAC amid hostile Republican efforts There was a joke about the suspected Chinese spy balloon\u2019s preferred pronouns; claims that Democrats believe there are \u201cmillions\u201d of genders and a menacing call for \u201ctransgenderism\u201d to be \u201ceradicated\u201d. From the main stage of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), far-right activists, members of Congress and the former president of the US waged an aggressive assault on transgender rights last week, raising the issue in speeches and unrelated panel discussions, often under the guise of protecting children. Headlining the conference on Saturday, Donald Trump drew some of the wildest applause of his more than 90-minute address when he pledged to stop the \u201cchemical castration and sexual mutilization [sic]\u201d of children if re-elected in 2024 while endorsing a national ban on transgender medical treatment for young people. A day earlier, congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, one of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies, rallied attenders with a speech devoted to the issue, unveiling her plan to reintroduce a bill that would criminalize doctors for providing gender-affirming care to a minor. What do leading medical organizations say? The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, among others, consider gender-affirming care to be medically necessary and potentially lifesaving for children and adults diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Are laws being changed? In state legislatures across the country, Republican lawmakers are pursuing a barrage of new restrictions related to transgender youth\u2019s medical care, sports participation and bathroom use. So far this year, anti-trans legislation has been proposed in 39 states, including 112 measures that focus on medical care restriction and 82 that pertain to education-related issues, according to the website Track Trans Legislation. In other news \u2026 A public college in Idaho is coming under pressure to explain why it has removed from an upcoming exhibition in its Center for Arts &amp; History several artworks dealing with reproductive health and abortion. Scarlet Kim of the ACLU said that the removal of works of art silenced the voices of women. Ukraine has started online talks with partners on extending the Black Sea grain initiative, a senior Ukrainian government source said on Tuesday. The source said Ukraine had not held discussions with Russia, which blockaded Ukrainian Black Sea ports after its invasion last year. Over the past 11 months, someone created thousands of fake, automated Twitter accounts \u2013 perhaps hundreds of thousands of them \u2013 to offer a stream of praise for Donald Trump. Besides posting adoring words about the former president, the fake accounts ridiculed Trump\u2019s critics. The Biden administration is under pressure to block a visit by Israel\u2019s extremist finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, over his call to \u201cwipe out\u201d a Palestinian town that was the target of an attack by Jewish settlers. More than 100 Jewish American leaders signed a statement opposing the visit. Stat of the day: revealed \u2013 1,000 super-emitting methane leaks risk triggering climate tipping points More than 1,000 \u201csuper-emitter\u201d sites gushed the potent greenhouse gas methane into the global atmosphere in 2022, the Guardian can reveal, mostly from oil and gas facilities. The worst single leak spewed the pollution at a rate equivalent to 67m running cars. Separate data also reveals 55 \u201cmethane bombs\u201d around the world \u2013 fossil fuel extraction sites where gas leaks alone from future production would release levels of methane equivalent to 30 years of all US greenhouse gas emissions. Methane emissions cause 25% of global heating today and there has been a \u201cscary\u201d surge since 2007, according to scientists. This acceleration may be the biggest threat to keeping below 1.5C of global heating and seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points, researchers say. Don\u2019t miss this: French philosopher urges people to rebel \u2013 by making friends Building your life around close friendships rather than family or romance is a joyous and necessary act of rebellion, and governments should put in place \u201cfriendship ministries\u201d to radically rethink the way society is organised, a key French philosopher has argued. Geoffroy De Lagasnerie\u2019s manifesto for friendship, 3 Une Aspiration au Dehors, published this week, questions society\u2019s \u201cauthoritarian\u201d insistence on prioritising romantic relationships. De Lagasnerie told France Inter radio: \u201cThe book stemmed from a form of sadness and melancholy at how life is organised socially \u2026 the idea that life should happen in cycles: youth, studies, form a relationship, move in together, sleep in the same bed, have children \u2026 Those are institutional roles but a lot of people feel at odds with that type of life and have other aspirations.\u201d \u2026 Or this: \u2018She had to hide\u2019 \u2013 the secret history of the first Asian woman nominated for a best actress Oscar Magazine writers did not know what to make of Merle Oberon when she took Hollywood by storm in the 1930s. One writer described her as \u201cbizarre, bewildering, and different\u201d, while others marveled at her \u201cdelicate\u201d oval face, \u201celoquent\u201d emerald eyes, \u201cbright red lips\u201d and \u201calabaster\u201d skin. Though her 1936 best actress Oscar nomination for the coming of age drama The Dark Angel affirmed her place in a league with Katharine Hepburn and the eventual winner, Bette Davis, it was only later that the world discovered Oberon was a south Asian woman passing for white. Oberon carefully hid her true identity to evade certain racial persecution and took that secret to her grave. Climate check: meat, dairy and rice production will bust 1.5C climate target, shows study Emissions from the food system alone will drive the world past 1.5C of global heating, unless high-methane foods are tackled. Climate-heating emissions from food production, dominated by meat, dairy and rice, will by themselves break the key international target of 1.5C if left unchecked, a detailed study has shown. The analysis estimated that if today\u2019s level of food emissions continued, they would result in at least 0.7C of global heating by the end of the century, on top of the 1C rise already seen. This means emissions from food alone, ignoring the huge impact of fossil fuels, would push the world past the 1.5C limit. \u201cMethane has this really dominant role in driving the warming associated with the food systems,\u201d said Catherine Ivanovich, at Columbia University in the US, who led the research. Last Thing: Mississippi: 15-year-old with master\u2019s degree prepares to attend law school A 15-year-old Mississippi boy is reportedly preparing to start law school later this year and has the chance to become one of the youngest people ever to obtain a juris doctorate. James \u201cJimmy\u201d Chilimigras took the law school entrance exam last year when he was just 14 and scored a 174, the highest tally in his home state, Alabama and Louisiana, according to a report from the news station WLOX. Jimmy, who holds bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in accounting from the online, non-profit Western Governors University, told WLOX he is giving himself until May to choose which law school he will attend.

            "content": "The Miami Dolphins have continued their acquisition of talent by trading for All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey, according to multiple sources. The Dolphins sent a third-round pick in this year\u2019s draft and tight end Hunter Long to the Los Angeles Rams to seal the trade. Ramsey appeared to confirm the trade on Sunday afternoon, tweeting: \u201cI prayed for this specifically for about a month &amp; now it\u2019s happening! @MiamiDolphins LETSGO!\u201d Miami have aggressively pursued big-name stars in the last year. Last season, they brought in All-Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill and Pro Bowl linebacker Bradley Chubb. They were also fined and docked a first-round draft pick last year for tampering when they attempted to acquire Tom Brady and Sean Payton. The 28-year-old Ramsey is considered one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL, and is a three-time All Pro and a six-time Pro Bowler. Pro Football Focus ranked him the third-best cornerback in the league last season, and he won Super Bowl LVI with the Rams in February 2022. In Miami he will team up with another All-Pro cornerback, Xavien Howard. The Rams went 5-12 last season and missed the playoffs just one year after winning the Super Bowl, and they\u2019ve have been making changes to their roster this offseason. Los Angeles parted ways with veteran linebacker Bobby Wagner last month after one season. Adding Ramsey is another step for Miami in rebuilding a defense that had a down year in 2022, by their standards. After Miami finished last year ranked 18th in total defense, 24th in scoring defense and 27th against the pass, the Dolphins parted ways with defensive coordinator Josh Boyer and brought in former Denver head coach Vic Fangio to lead the defense. Miami needed to bolster a secondary that was hit by injury last year and were without cornerback Byron Jones, who is expected to be released on Wednesday, when the NFL\u2019s new year begins, in a cost-cutting move. Jones missed the entire 2022 season after undergoing achilles surgery last March. Sunday\u2019s trade means the Dolphins hold only four picks in this year\u2019s draft: in the second, third, sixth and seventh rounds."

            "date": "2023-03-01T11:21:31Z",
            "content": "Even a cursory exploration of race and racism around the world would yield the conclusion that there is nothing simple about it. Racial identity and race-based oppression emerge, morph and erode in different ways in different parts of the world. But leave it to Elon Musk to try to convince you that racism is simple and straightforward. Musk will tell you what is and is not \u201cracist\u201d. And he will explain to you which institutions are racist and to whom. In response to disgraced cartoonist Scott Adams\u2019 proclamation that African Americans constitute \u201ca hate group\u201d, newspapers across the US stopped publishing Adams\u2019 long-running comic strip, Dilbert. \u201cBased on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from Black people,\u201d Adams had said, in a YouTube rant. \u201cJust get the fuck away,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes any sense as a white citizen of America to try to help Black citizens any more [\u2026] I\u2019m going to back off on being helpful to Black America because it doesn\u2019t seem like it pays off.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what Adams has done in the past that was \u201chelpful to Black America\u201d, but he is certain to avoid doing so in the future. Meanwhile, Musk defended Adams and argued that US institutions perpetrate racism against white people. Musk, raised by a parent who owned part of an emerald mine, is a serial CEO who runs a company that treated at least one Black employee poorly enough to generate massive damages. Such a person could have a sophisticated sense of how race and racism work. After all, Musk grew up in apartheid-era South Africa, a country marked by violent segregation of Black and white citizens, with Asians caught in the middle and accepted by neither. He moved to multicultural Canada, with its own history of genocide and exclusion of Indigenous Canadians, and made his name and expanded his inherited fortune in Silicon Valley, a part of the US enriched by an immigrant labor force, a male-dominated-yet-cosmopolitan elite class, and massive race- and ethnicity-based segregation and displacement. Had Musk lived with his eyes and ears open, he might offer us, from his position of great influence, a sense of sensitivity and humanity. It\u2019s not hard, growing up in such milieus, to grasp history and politics in ways that grant dignity and understanding to many different experiences. Instead, Musk expresses his awareness of race, inequality, and injustice like a 12-year-old might. It might be too easy to pick on Musk, who clearly has limited faculties to understand the world in which he is a major, powerful player. And Adams is not the sort of person one should expect to rise to the level of valuable conversation about anything of importance. So perhaps we should instead look to our own fascination with the super-wealthy or famous and the respect we give them. Why does Musk deserve our concern? Why does he send so many of us (myself included) into apoplectic fits of anger and frustration? We might distinguish between the influential and the powerful. When basketball star Kyrie Irving lauds an antisemitic film, he deserves opprobrium, even shame. When JK Rowling rants against trans women, deploying her massive platform against the powerless, we should be stern in our criticism of such \u201cpunching down\u201d. When Adams, who does not have any real power, makes a fool of himself, he only really harms himself and the outlets that publish his little cartoons, which is why so many quickly exercised their first amendment right to refrain from publishing his comic. Irving, Rowling and Adams have influence, but mostly on those who are already like-minded. We should be appalled that such comfortable, famous people take it upon themselves to make others the victims of their paranoid ire. But they are more representative of noxious positions held by millions of others. Those millions live among us. Perhaps indignation against the loudest and richest bigots is not generating a significant intended effect. The rush to defend Irving, Rowling, Adams and others reveals just how deeply they strike sympathy among the like-minded. This does not mean we should refrain from such admonition. But it should give us pause. Is mere admonition \u2013 against those least likely to suffer from meager shaming or the occasional, temporary commercial sanction \u2013 the best way to address serious societal ills? Few celebrities beyond Donald Trump promoted QAnon conspiracy theories, but violence rose from followers anyway. The danger grew acute when Trump, himself a key figure in the QAnon mythology, promoted direct action against the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. QAnon would be dangerous even if Trump had not made a speech that morning. Our challenge is that bigotry such as racism, homophobia, misogyny and transphobia are built into our cultural habits and baked into the data and processes that guide our lives. The views of an individual, even one as famous as JK Rowling, don\u2019t matter as much as we might assume. But what of Musk and his record? His hostility to trans people is well documented. Yet Musk has rarely spoken directly about race or racism in his long, public life. Musk\u2019s peculiar worldview reveals a more troubling ideology than mere vulgar bigotry. There are disturbing aspects to Musk\u2019s weird obsession with population. It echoes the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory, a white-supremacist framework that presumes demographic changes will overrun white populations and thus threaten their power. It sparks deep, historical fears of \u201cmongrel breeding\u201d. Replacement has been the explicit fear of antisemites and anti-immigrant extremists in North America and Europe for decades. It has inspired violence around the world, and is a cousin to the deadly anti-Muslim conspiracy theory of a \u201clove jihad\u201d in India. Musk is, as usual, unable to distinguish between fact and fiction when he discusses demography. Bluntly, Musk is more dangerous, even with his half-articulated and oddball positions, than any mere celebrities. Musk is both a celebrity who can focus the world\u2019s attention on a fringe question with just a tweet and an employer of thousands of people he can actually harm with his company\u2019s policies and practices. The state of California has sued Musk\u2019s car company, Tesla, for allegedly discriminating against Black employees. (Tesla denies the allegations, and is fighting the suit.) His anti-trans eruptions must make trans employees at his various companies wonder if they would be treated fairly by management. Musk has mocked a former top Twitter employee, who was driven from his home after Musk implied that the employee, who is gay, tolerates pedophilia. Musk\u2019s policies at Twitter have invited back many accounts that had been banned in the past for violating various policies. Expressions of hatred and racism on the service have spiked, leaving Twitter users less safe and comfortable expressing themselves. This squelching of speech rarely gets acknowledged by Musk or his fans. So the damage to the public continues and Musk remains oblivious and unconcerned. Bigotry, and the harassment and violence it inspires, robs all of us of the richest possible public life. Deep conspiracies that rest on demographic myths and fears about \u201creplacement\u201d seed trends that could spark genocidal violence. Such violence \u2013 even the threat of violence \u2013 silence those who most yearn to be heard and those who have been heard the least. For anyone to purport to support a rich and diverse public sphere, it\u2019s imperative to understand and resist bigotry and racialized conspiracy theories in all their forms.

            "content": "It should not be, despite what Larry Elliott says, a case of \u201cbuying off\u201d striking workers, but of the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, using the budget to end the crisis in the funding of public services (Jeremy Hunt\u2019s 2023 budget: five things to look out for, 6 March). A sensible government would borrow and increase taxes on the rich and high earners to do this, but instead we will doubtless see nothing of the sort. We will, however, see some token gestures typical of these self-proclaimed One Nation Tories. Unwilling, just like the founder of the theory of One Nation conservatism, to make fundamental changes to reduce poverty, Hunt and Rishi Sunak will make ineffective window-dressing changes of the sort that Benjamin Disraeli introduced to try to trick voters. Almost certainly, especially as the government is failing to \u201cmake good on Britain\u2019s net zero pledges to the world\u201d, green policies will figure strongly in Hunt\u2019s speech (Editorial, 6 March). We can expect something like the previous inflated pledge on installing 600,000 heat pumps annually, attempting to look serious and concerned, but without financial commitment. Let us hope that the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will be ready to expose One Nation Toryism for the sham that it is and to tell the country how Labour\u2019s green policies will be funded.

            "date": "2023-03-15T14:51:12Z",
            "content": "Hunt\u2019s opening remarks Jeremy Hunt kicks off by telling MPs the British economy is \u201cproving the doubters wrong\u201d, and the OBR is now forecasting there will be no recession, after the gloomy projections made in the autumn. \u201cWe are following the plan and the plan is working,\u201d he says. Aubrey Allegretti, political correspondent: Hunt has the weight of his party and the country on his shoulders. The first budget in 18 months \u2013 when the UK has had two chancellors come and go \u2013 carries huge implications for people struggling during the cost of living crisis, businesses concerned about economic stability, and the Conservatives\u2019 polling deficit. He nods to \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d taken in the autumn and seeks to cajole grumpy Tory MPs by telling them \u201cthe plan is working\u201d. To try to boost their spirits, he declares \u201cinflation has peaked\u201d and gets huge cheers for declaring a recession looks likely to be avoided. Cost of living support After a vigorous campaign from the consumer rights champion Martin Lewis and many charities, Hunt confirms that the energy price guarantee will remain at \u00a32,500 until July \u2013 it had been set to rise to \u00a33,000. The chancellor says: \u201cSome people remain in real distress, and we should always remain ready to help when we can.\u201d He says the measure would save the average family \u00a3160. As expected, Hunt extends the 5p cut to fuel duty made by Rishi Sunak last March, for another year. He also announces extra help for those with prepayment meters, saying he will \u201cbring their charges in line with comparable direct debit charges\u201d. He also announces a \u00a363m fund to help leisure centres and pools afford their energy bills, and \u00a3100m extra for charities facing soaring costs. Aubrey Allegretti: Aware that energy prices are a big contributor to people feeling the strain, Hunt knows news that the energy price guarantee being kept at \u00a32,500 from April until July will be welcomed. But he struggles to avoid smiling as opposition MPs laugh at his support for swimming pools \u2013 after this Guardian story. Economic forecasts Hunt says this will be a budget for \u201clong-term, sustainable, healthy growth\u201d, and it will deliver \u201cprosperity with a purpose\u201d. He says the OBR expects inflation, at 10.7% in Q4 of last year, to be 2.9% by the end of 2023 \u2013 meeting Sunak\u2019s target of halving it. Since the autumn statement, the OBR, along with many other forecasters, has become slightly less gloomy about the prospects for 2023. It is now expecting GDP to contract by 0.2%, instead of the 1.4% it predicted in November. Hunt says that will be followed by growth of 1.8% next year, 2.5% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. That compares with November forecasts of 1.3% for 2024, 2.6% for 2025 and 2.7% for the year after \u2013 so the OBR is expecting stronger growth in the next two years, but a slower recovery thereafter. Aubrey Allegretti: While Hunt quietly sets as much distance between this budget and Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s disastrous mini-budget last September, he still needs to demonstrate a commitment to Liz Truss\u2019s watchword \u2013 growth. It is a key target of Labour\u2019s, and restless Tory backbenchers need to be convinced they are not just propping up a government engaged in managed decline. Hunt says growth is one of the PM\u2019s five priorities, but defends his commitment to returning inflation to the 2% target and says it now looks poised to diminish to 2.9% by the end of the year. There are some who think the inflation cut would have happened anyway and that Hunt and Sunak are giving themselves a pat on the back for something more dictated by global headwinds. Hunt will have to prove his plan is partly responsible for the positive news. Public finances Hunt boasts that by the end of the forecast period, the government\u2019s current budget deficit \u2013 day-to-day spending minus tax revenues \u2013 will be in surplus. He says the OBR is expecting that he will meet his fiscal rule of keeping public sector net borrowing below 3% of GDP, with \u00a339.2bn to spare, by the end of the forecast. Public sector net debt was previously expected to peak at 97.6% of GDP in 2025-26, falling to 97.3% two years later. It is now expected to hit a somewhat lower peak of 97.3%, falling to 94.6% by 2027-28. As in the autumn statement, he says day-to-day spending will rise by 1% a year in real terms from next year to the end of the forecast period. Aubrey Allegretti: The wind is in Hunt\u2019s sails here, because of a higher-than-expected tax take providing some extra fiscal headroom. This is well known, and Tory MPs expect the chancellor to make the most of it. In a nod to it, Hunt says this will provide \u201cmore money for public services and more money for future generations\u201d \u2013 something he calls \u201cdeeply held on values that we put into practice today\u201d that earns him some cheers from Tory MPs. It might not be as jazzy as the more retail spending commitments, but reducing debt was a hallmark of the coalition government \u2013 and Hunt is keen to stick at it. The chancellor draws attention to the economy inherited by the Tories in 2010, seeking to rouse the backbenches and as an attack on Labour\u2019s performance in government. Levelling up Hunt says the government plans to create a dozen new investment zones that could become \u201c12 potential Canary Wharfs\u201d. He says areas including the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Liverpool and Teesside had been identified as possible hosts, and they will need to develop proposals centred on universities or research institutes. Successful applicants will be given \u00a380m of support as well and allowed to retain some local taxes. Hunt also announces an extra \u00a3400m for \u201clevelling up partnerships\u201d in areas including Redcar and Cleveland and Rochdale, as well as confirming the next round of city region transport settlements, which will be worth \u00a38.8bn over five years. He confirms that the West Midlands and Greater Manchester will get new multi-year devolution funding deals, and be allowed to retain business rates. Aubrey Allegretti: It was the Boris Johnson government\u2019s raison d\u2019etre \u2013 but levelling up gets far fewer mentions these days. Wary that it was a key part of wooing the 2019 winning coalition of voters that helped the Tories shatter the \u201cred wall\u201d, Hunt knows it remains a vital mission. Truss-era ministers are understood to be frustrated with only 12 investment zones in higher-education hotspots going ahead. They believe the number is too low and that they will no longer fulfil \u201clevelling up\u201d in more deprived parts of the country. Hunt\u2019s nod to key constituencies such as Redcar and regions such as Teesside show there is still ambition to fight to keep the Conservatives\u2019 hold in those areas. Business tax and incentives Hunt says he wants to create \u201cthe most pro-business, pro-enterprise tax regime anywhere\u201d, despite confirming that he will go ahead with the planned increase in corporation tax \u2013 first announced by Sunak \u2013 from 19% to 25% in April. He announces a new \u00a39bn policy of \u201cfull capital expensing\u201d, initially for the next three years, which allows firms to write off all investment against their tax bills. Hunt says the OBR believes this will boost business tax by 3% a year. He also announces a new \u201cenhanced credit\u201d for research-intensive businesses, worth \u00a327 for every \u00a3100 they invest. Hunt also extends \u201cdraught relief\u201d, so that the duty paid in pubs will be up to 11% lower than elsewhere. He calls this a \u201cBrexit pubs guarantee,\u201d saying it would not have been possible inside the EU. He also says he will put in place a new medicine regulator, which will give \u201crapid, often near-automatic approval for medicines and technologies already approved by trusted regulators in other parts of the world such as the US, Europe and Japan. And he says he will offer a \u00a31m a year prize for the next 10 years for the most innovative research in AI. Aubrey Allegretti: The corporation tax rise is perhaps Hunt and Sunak\u2019s weakest flank with Tory MPs. Former cabinet ministers Simon Clarke and Priti Patel have been breathing down the government\u2019s neck on this. The chancellor defends the rise, by saying it will still leave the UK with the lowest headline corporation tax rate in the G7. His \u201ctax cut\u201d for capital expensing will give ministers another key line of defence \u2013 and comes with a hefty price tag of \u00a39bn a year. It is a short-term boost for business investment, as Hunt acknowledges it won\u2019t be made permanent until it is responsible to do so. Energy and climate Hunt announces \u00a320bn of investment in carbon capture and storage, which he says will kick off with projects including Merseyside and Wales. He says nuclear power will be classed as environmentally sustainable, giving it access to investment incentives. Hunt also announces the creation of what he calls Great British Nuclear, which he says will help to bring down costs, and says the government will launch a competition for the design of small modular reactors \u2013 which could be co-funded by the government if they prove viable. Aubrey Allegretti: There are two big reasons for this focus on energy. It has become more politically salient since gas prices shot up after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and as the net zero target looms closer. Boosting nuclear is a way for the Conservatives to bash Labour, and Hunt acknowledges this \u2013 saying it is a \u201cshame\u201d the main opposition party did not champion the energy source when they were in government. We get what might be the first gag by the chancellor this budget \u2013 something that is usually peppered more frequently in such statements. Hunt jokes that energy security is so important because \u201cthe sun doesn\u2019t always shine \u2013 even under a Conservative government\u201d. Employment \u201cConservatives believe work is a virtue,\u201d Hunt says, as he confirms a significant package of measures aimed at tackling economic inactivity, in what he calls a \u201cback to work budget\u201d. These include: Scrapping the much-derided work capability assessment \u2013 though details of its replacement are not yet clear. Introducing a new voluntary employment scheme for disabled people, universal support, worth \u00a34,000 for up to 50,000 people. A \u00a3400m scheme to make more support for mental and physical health available to workers with health problems. For those on universal credit without a health problem, Hunt says benefits sanctions will be \u201capplied more rigorously\u201d to force claimants to search for work. \u201cIndependence is always better than dependence,\u201d he says. Focusing on the over-50s, Hunt says he will increase the number of people who get \u201cmid-life MOTs\u201d from the Department for Work and Pensions, helping them assess their financial situation. There will be a new apprenticeship, called \u201creturnerships\u201d, for over-50s wanting to return to work in a new sector. And Hunt says he will lift the annual limit on tax-free pension contributions from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000 and abolish the lifetime cap, to tempt higher-paid older workers, such as doctors, to remain in the workplace. \u201cNo one should be pushed out of the workplace for tax reasons,\u201d he says. Aubrey Allegretti: Given the number of people who are unable to work because of long-term sickness, retiring early, or unable to go back to work because of spiralling childcare costs, boosting employment is an important focus for the Treasury. Overhauling disability benefits has been a long-trailed plan. Doing so is hoped to incentivise people to return to the workforce. The tougher sanctions for those that fail to meet work search requirements or don\u2019t take up a reasonable job offer are designed to head off any concerns from Tory backbenchers about \u201chandouts\u201d. Increasing the pensions annual tax-free allowance and scrapping the lifetime allowance was a key ask of some Tory MPs, who said they were driving NHS workers to quit. Hunt\u2019s pledge that the long-delayed health service workforce plan is to be published \u201cshortly\u201d will be closely watched. But such promises have been made before. Childcare Hunt says he wants to reform a childcare system he says is \u201cbad for children, and damaging for the economy\u201d, and suggests the overhaul could get 11 million more women into work. As revealed in the Guardian, he says parents of children aged nine months to three years will be offered 30 hours a week of free childcare in term time \u2013 as long as both parents are working at least 16 hours a week. The change will be phased in gradually, by September 2025 \u2013 Hunt says this will allow for new provision to be available. Universal credit claimants will be able to receive childcare funding upfront, instead of in arrears, and the amount available will increase. Local authorities will be given more funding for wraparound care, from 8am-6pm, with an ambition that all schools will offer it by September 2026. Hunt says he will increase the funding for free nursery places, by \u00a3204m from September, and \u00a3280m next year \u2013 an average increase of 30%. Aubrey Allegretti: Sorting out the mess of unwieldy childcare issues is something Tory MPs have been pushing for quietly in the background. A campaign has been led by the \u201cNext Generation Tories\u201d group to push this up the political agenda, because of fears it is driving younger voters away from the party. Changing minimum staff ratios was also part of the supply-side reforms championed by Truss, so this section of Hunt\u2019s speech will go down well with them. However, there are cries of disbelief when Hunt says that he aims to have wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm rolled out for all schools by September 2026. That is a long way off and means it will have to be a pledge in the Conservatives\u2019 next election manifesto."

            "date": "2023-03-20T21:32:39Z",
            "content": "Hello again, it\u2019s been a lively day in US political news and we\u2019ll have more coverage tomorrow in the blog that keeps you abreast of developments as they happen. The blog is closing for now, but thanks for dipping in. There is much other coverage on the rest of the website, of course, on politics, international news and so many other topics and issues. Here\u2019s where things stand: Washington, DC, appears to be making preparations for crowds and any trouble in the unprecedented event that former US president Donald Trump is criminally indicted. He\u2019s the subject of several criminal investigations but could be charged in a case in New York this week. Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg appears set to indict Donald Trump for the hush money payment he allegedly facilitated to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. Trump won\u2019t fight extradition to New York from his residence in Florida, should he be charged, a campaign insider told the Guardian. Fani Willis, the Georgia district attorney investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s attempts to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election result, is said to be considering racketeering and conspiracy charges. Some Republicans think an indictment would be a good thing for Trump. Former New York City mayor and personal lawyer to Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, has been ordered to appear tomorrow in a civil case in Washington, DC, by two Georgia election workers who accuse him of making false claims that put them in physical danger and threatened their livelihoods, according to a new report. The two former election workers filed a defamation lawsuit in late 2021 against Giuliani and also against the rightwing One America News Network and several of its senior executives. During the 2020 election, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, worked as poll workers counting ballots at State Farm Arena in Fulton county, Georgia. They claim they became the center of a series of unfounded conspiracy theories promoted by Giuliani, who was then serving as an advisor to Trump, and OAN news network. \u201cAs a result of their vital service, Ms Freeman and Ms Moss have become the objects of vitriol, threats, and harassment,\u201d they said in the December, 2021 complaint, filed in federal court in Washington. \u201cThey found themselves in this unenviable position not based on anything they did, but instead because of a campaign of malicious lies designed to accuse them of interfering with a fair and impartial election, which is precisely what each of them swore an oath to protect,\u201d the suit said. Last summer, Freeman and Moss appeared before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection by Trump extremists, and the Guardian reported at the time that they gave powerful and emotional testimony about the sinister results of Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election and described how he and his allies upended their lives, fueling harassment and racist threats by claiming they were involved in voter fraud. Testifying to the January 6 committee in Washington, Shaye Moss said she received \u201ca lot of threats. Wishing death upon me. Telling me that I\u2019ll be in jail with my mother and saying things like, \u2018Be glad it\u2019s 2020 and not 1920.\u2019\u201d That was a reference to lynching, the violent extra-judicial fate of thousands of Black men in the American south. Here\u2019s one view from a member of the public: New York City is not the only place preparing for crowds in the event that Donald Trump is criminally charged in that city first amid the numerous criminal cases against him. Washington, DC, is also reportedly making preparations ahead of any indictment of the former US president. There is no confirmation yet that he will be indicted, when or for exactly what crimes, so this is all early stage. But clearly the US Capitol was unprepared when pro-Trump extremists stormed Congress on January 6, 2021 in an effort to prevent the official certification of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory over the Republican president in the November 2020 election. So even if he is indicted and his calls for protest don\u2019t amount to much, law enforcement don\u2019t want to be caught out. Philadelphia officials announced a $9.25 million settlement Monday with hundreds of people over several lawsuits challenging the police response to the protests and civil disorder in 2020 after George Floyd\u2019s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police. Officials said the money will be distributed among 343 plaintiffs in connection with police actions during the protests that erupted in west Philadelphia and along Interstate 676 in the city center that spring. In addition, a grant will provide $500,000 to $600,000 for mental health counseling for west Philadelphia residents, the Associated Press reports. Videos of Philadelphia police firing tear gas on June 1, 2020, at dozens of protesters trapped on I-676 by SWAT team officers on both sides \u2014 many unable to retreat to an on-ramp and clambering to get up a steep embankment and over a concrete wall and fence \u2014 were spread widely on social media. Attorneys suing over events the day before in and around a west Philadelphia business corridor that is the heart of a predominantly Black neighborhood said witnesses reported residential communities turned into a war zone, with tanks traveling on side streets \u201cchasing residents into their homes and indiscriminately firing canisters of tear gas at them.\u201d Mayor Jim Kenney and Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw faced harsh criticism in two audits of the planning and response to the protests, which included multiple clashes, the burning of police cars and instances of opportunistic thefts and vandalism in business districts. One review cited failures in planning that researchers said led to short staffing, emotional responses from officers and sometimes excessive uses of force. Idaho wants to bring back execution by firing squad, the Associated Press reports, with the Republican-dominated legislature passing a bill to employ the method in instances where they can\u2019t get the drugs for lethal injection. If signed into law by GOP governor Brad Little, the northwestern state would join South Carolina, Mississippi, Utah and Oklahoma in allowing the method to be used. However, there is a divide within the Idaho GOP over whether shooting prisoners to death is a good idea, the AP reports: Sen. Doug Ricks, a Republican who co-sponsored the bill, told his fellow senators on Monday that the state\u2019s difficulty in finding lethal injection drugs could continue \u201cindefinitely\u201d and that he believes death by firing squad is \u201chumane.\u201d \u201cThis is a rule of law issue \u2014 our criminal system should work and penalties should be exacted,\u201d Ricks said. But Sen. Dan Foreman, also a Republican, said firing-squad executions would traumatize the people who who carry them out, the people who witness them and the people who clean up afterward. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the aftermath of shootings, and it\u2019s psychologically damaging to anybody who witnesses it,\u201d Foreman said. \u201cThe use of the firing squad is, in my opinion, beneath the dignity of the state of Idaho.\u201d The bill originated with Republican Rep. Bruce Skaug, prompted in part by the state\u2019s inability to execute Gerald Pizzuto Jr. late last year. Pizzuto, who now has terminal cancer and other debilitating illnesses, has spent more than three decades on death row for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors. The Idaho Department of Correction estimates that it will cost around $750,000 to build or retrofit a death chamber for firing squad executions. If Donald Trump is indicted, it will be a first for the United States, but not unheard of for countries worldwide. Axios has a rundown of all the countries where heads of state have faced criminal charges after their terms in office, totaling at least 76 nations. They include a number of gray-area cases, as well as those that occurred in democracies younger than America\u2019s, or in states with other systems of government. But a number happened in wealthy democratic nations similar to the United States \u2013 such as France, where former president Nicolas Sarkozy has been given jail terms for campaign finance violations, as well as corruption and influence peddling charges. He\u2019s appealing the verdicts. Or consider the case of South Korea\u2019s former president Park Geun-hye. She was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2018 for corruption, but pardoned by her successor two years ago. Asked in the daily briefing about Donald Trump\u2019s calls to protest against his impending indictment, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre essentially dodges. That\u2019s per the Guardian\u2019s David Smith, who is at the White House: National security council spokesman John Kirby appeared at the White House press conference and shared the Biden administration\u2019s view of Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s visit to the occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol yesterday: Today, Putin is hosting Chinese president Xi Jinping amid fears Beijing could begin supplying Russia with weapons to help its flagging invasion. For the latest on their high-stakes talks, follow the Guardian\u2019s live blog: While an indictment of Donald Trump for allegedly paying hush money ahead of the 2016 presidential election would make history, it\u2019s far from the only time dirty tricks have been used in a White House campaign, the Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt reports: A former Texas governor met Middle Eastern leaders in 1980 to convince Iran to delay releasing American hostages as part of a Republican effort to sabotage Jimmy Carter\u2019s re-election campaign, according to a news report. The New York Times reported on Sunday that John Connally, who served as Texas\u2019s Democratic governor from 1963 to 1969 and ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980, traveled to a number of countries in the summer leading up to the 1980 election. By that time Ronald Reagan had secured the Republican nomination, and the re-election campaign from his Democratic rival Carter was struggling in the midst of the crisis that resulted from more than 50 Americans being taken hostage from the US embassy in Tehran. Donald Trump\u2019s looming indictment has already had one concrete political effect: convincing a rising Republican lawmaker to back the former president, rather than his most prominent challenger Ron DeSantis. The endorsement came from Anna Paulina Luna, a newly arrived House Republican from Florida who previously said she was partial to Trump in the presidential race, but has now cited Alvin Bragg\u2019s pending charges in giving the former president her full backing. In a statement to the New York Times, Luna said, \u201cI support President Trump,\u201d and calls Bragg\u2019s prosecution \u201cunheard-of, and Americans should see it for what it is: an abuse of power and fascist overreach of the justice system.\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s veto of a Republican bill banning the consideration of corporate governance and climate change risks by retirement funds is not sitting well with Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator who\u2019s been a thorn in the side of his administration\u2019s fight against climate change. While Manchin played a pivotal role in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, Washington\u2019s biggest legislative measure against climate change, that only happened after he swatted down proposals that would have been more effective in curbing America\u2019s emissions. In a statement released following Biden\u2019s veto, the West Virginia lawmaker lambasted Biden for vetoing legislation he supported: This Administration continues to prioritize their radical policy agenda over the economic, energy and national security needs of our country, and it is absolutely infuriating. West Virginians are under increasing stress as we continue to recover from a once in a generation pandemic, pay the bills amid record inflation, and face the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The Administration\u2019s unrelenting campaign to advance a radical social and environmental agenda is only exacerbating these challenges. This ESG rule will weaken our energy, national and economic security while jeopardizing the hard-earned retirement savings of 150 million West Virginians and Americans. Despite a clear and bipartisan rejection of the rule from Congress, President Biden is choosing to put his Administration\u2019s progressive agenda above the well-being of the American people.\u201d Meanwhile, at the White House, Joe Biden just vetoed the first bill of his administration: Republican-backed legislation that overturns a labor department rule allowing retirement fund managers to consider aspects like good corporate governance and climate change risks in their investment strategies. In a brief video released by the White House, Biden said the legislation was the work of the Republican party\u2019s extreme right flank: It passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives with only one Democratic vote, while in the Senate, it was able to pass only after centrist senators Joe Manchin and Jon Tester, who represent red states and are up for re-election next year, voted for it. Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg appears set to indict Donald Trump for the hush money payment he allegedly facilitated to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. The history-making charges could come as soon as today, reports indicate, and been met with a furious reaction from Trump and his allies in the House GOP, who are demanding Bragg sit for an interview and hand over documents. Meanwhile, police in New York are preparing to arrest the former president, and for the possibility that Trump\u2019s supporters heed his call made over the weekend for protests. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Trump won\u2019t fight extradition to New York from his residence in Florida, should he be charged, a campaign insider told the Guardian. Fani Willis, the Georgia district attorney investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s attempts to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election result, is said to be considering racketeering and conspiracy charges. Some Republicans think an indictment would be a good thing for Trump. Now, some news from yet another one of the investigations into Donald Trump, this one involving his possession of classified documents. On Friday, the special federal prosecutor handling that inquiry, Jack Smith, won a court ruling compelling more testimony from Trump\u2019s attorney Evan Corcoran. Corcoran had already appeared before a grand jury convened by Smith to investigate the government secrets found at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, but cited attorney-client privilege to avoid answering some questions. In response to a petition from Smith, a federal judge overruled Corcoran\u2019s privilege claims, finding that some of the advice he gave Trump could have been used to commit a crime. Today, CNN said they\u2019d spotted Corcoran going into the Washington DC federal courthouse where the grand jury is hearing testimony \u2013 indicating that he may be about to tell Smith whatever he tried to avoid saying: Donald Trump could be indicted as soon as today or Wednesday, Politico reports. New York law enforcement officials are meeting today at police department headquarters to plan for the possibility that he will be arrested, the report said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be discussing how we bring Trump in,\u201d a person involved in planning for his arrest said. \u201cNo decisions have been made yet.\u201d Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida who is Donald Trump\u2019s closest rival for the Republican presidential nomination, has broken his silence over Trump\u2019s looming indictment in New York. He did so by mocking the notion that hush money payments to a porn star might be seen as indictable conduct, and repeating an antisemitic dogwhistle. An indictment is expected this week. On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Trump allies were pressing DeSantis to join Trump allies in Congress in condemning Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney. On Monday morning, speaking to reporters at a college in Panama City, the governor did. Asked about the prospect of Trump being extradited to New York (the former president having been a Florida resident since leaving power), DeSantis said: \u201cSo I\u2019ve seen rumors swirl. I\u2019ve not seen any facts yet. And so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. \u201cBut I do know this, that the Manhattan district attorney is a Soros-funded prosecutor. And so he like other Soros-funded prosecutors, they weaponise their office to impose a political agenda on society at the expense of the rule of law and public safety\u201d. George Soros, a Hungarian-American progressive financier and philanthropist, is a boogeyman for Republicans and a regular target for antisemitic invective. DeSantis mentioned \u201cSoros funded prosecutors\u201d five times in a two-minute answer about Trump\u2019s hush money payment to the porn star Stormy Daniels. That included a boast about \u201cremov[ing] one from office\u201d, presumably a reference to the case of Andrew Warren, a Democrat twice elected in Hillsborough county but suspended for saying he would not pursue charges against anyone seeking an abortion or gender transition treatment. DeSantis also tried to hit Bragg over his record on crime, a common Republican tactic. To laughter, DeSantis said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair. I can\u2019t speak to that. \u201cBut what I can speak to is that if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many, many years ago, to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, you know, that\u2019s an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponising the office and I think that\u2019s fundamentally wrong.\u201d In messages viewed by the Guardian, a Trump campaign insider predicts that the former president will not attempt to avoid appearing for arraignment in New York City, if or when an expected indictment over his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels is handed down. \u201cHe will go to NYC for sure,\u201d the insider wrote, adding: \u201cNo video arraignments.\u201d At the weekend, Trump said he would be arrested on Tuesday and called for supporters to protest. Trump staffers then said they did not know when an indictment or arrest might happen. Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who is expected to bring the indictment, told staff preparations were being made to ensure their safety. Trump rose to fame as a property magnate in New York but since leaving power in Washington he has been resident in Florida. An attempt to resist extradition would be a considerable headache for Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida who remains Trump\u2019s closest rival for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. House Republicans are rushing to the defense of Donald Trump by demanding testimony and documents from Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who is said to be on the verge of indicting the former president for a hush money payment he allegedly arranged before the 2016 election. In a letter sent today to Bragg, the GOP chairs of the oversight, administration and judiciary committees accuse Bragg of being \u201cabout to engage in an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority: the indictment of a former President of the United States and current declared candidate for that office. This indictment comes after years of your office searching for a basis \u2014 any basis \u2014on which to bring charges, ultimately settling on a novel legal theory untested anywhere in the country and one that federal authorities declined to pursue. If these reports are accurate, your actions will erode confidence in the evenhanded application of justice and unalterably interfere in the course of the 2024 presidential election. In light of the serious consequences of your actions, we expect that you will testify about what plainly appears to be a politically motivated prosecutorial decision.\u201d They demand that Bragg sit for an interview by Thursday morning, as well as turn over documents related to his office\u2019s communications with the justice department and federal law enforcement about Trump, its use and receipt of federal funds, and the actions of two former prosecutors. \u201cYour decision to pursue such a politically motivated prosecution \u2014 while adopting progressive criminal justice policies that allow career \u201ccriminals [to] run [] the streets\u201d of Manhattan \u2014requires congressional scrutiny about how public safety funds appropriated by Congress are implemented by local law-enforcement agencies,\u201d the letter concludes. But what if Trump is indicted in New York and refuses to travel from his Florida residence to face the charges? That would put the ball in the court of a political player who is undoubtedly watching the case against Trump closely. As the New York Times reports, the Florida governor would have a role to play in the chance that the former president tries to avoid the charges in New York, where he used to live before changing his residence to the southern state: Surrender, some might argue, is not in the confrontational former president\u2019s DNA, and he often seems to relish antagonizing and attacking the prosecutors who have investigated him. In the unlikely event that the former president refuses to surrender, he would put Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, his leading but undeclared rival for the Republican nomination, in an awkward political position. Under law, the role of Mr. DeSantis would be essentially ministerial and he would have few legal options other than approving an extradition request from New York. Still, if New York prosecutors sought Mr. Trump\u2019s extradition, Mr. DeSantis would face an unenviable dilemma. He would be compelled to choose between authorizing an arrest warrant for Mr. Trump and inflaming his base, or attempting in some way to aide his Republican rival, and possibly face legal action as a result. DeSantis is viewed as the strongest Republican challenger to Trump for the party\u2019s nomination next year, though he has yet to formally announce a run. Trump has started attacking DeSantis by name as their rivalry has grown, but as the Times report makes clear, could end up needing the governor\u2019s assistance if he decides to fight the Manhattan district attorney tooth and nail. Despite all the indictment news, the grand jury that would recommend charges hasn\u2019t finished it\u2019s work yet, the Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt and Hugo Lowell report: Donald Trump has cheered the news that a former adviser to Michael Cohen will testify before a Manhattan grand jury investigating the ex-president\u2019s alleged role in hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Robert J Costello, a one-time legal adviser to former Trump attorney Cohen, is scheduled to appear before the grand jury on Monday, where he is expected to give testimony \u201cattacking the credibility of Cohen\u2019s statements\u201d, Associated Press reported. Cohen, a former Trump lawyer, pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges involving $130,000 paid to Daniels in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Daniels claims she had sex with the former president before he took office, though Trump denies the allegation. If Donald Trump were indicted, what would happen next? Would he be handcuffed and taken to jail? Would the fact that he\u2019s a former president matter? The New York Times looked into the finer points of a felony indictment, which might happen to Trump within days as a result of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s investigation into the alleged hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. Here\u2019s what they found: If Mr. Trump is indeed indicted and arraigned, it will be one of the most unusual and closely watched court proceedings in New York history. And accommodation may be made for the former president. While it is standard for defendants arrested on felony charges to be handcuffed, it is unclear whether they will make an exception for Mr. Trump because of his status. Most defendants have their hands cuffed behind their backs, but some white-collar defendants who are deemed to pose less of a danger have their hands secured in front of them. After an arraignment, Mr. Trump would likely be released on his own recognizance because an indictment likely would contain only nonviolent felony charges; under New York law, prosecutors cannot request bail in most such cases. Mr. Trump will almost certainly be accompanied at every step of the process \u2014 from the moment he is taken into custody until his appearance before a judge \u2014 by armed agents of the United States Secret Service, who are required by law to protect him at all times. Security in the courthouse is provided by New York State court officers, an agency with which the Secret Service has worked in the past. The chief spokesman for the Secret Service, Anthony J. Guglielmi, said he could not comment on any security arrangements for the former president. It may take several days for the former president to appear at the courthouse. Once he has been indicted, prosecutors are expected to contact the former president\u2019s defense lawyers to negotiate his surrender, a common practice in white-collar investigations when prosecutors have been in touch with defense attorneys. Some lawyers working for Mr. Trump, who is running for president a third time, have said he will surrender to face the charges and fly from his Florida estate to New York for the arraignment. Courtesy of CBS News, here\u2019s the scene outside the Manhattan criminal courthouse where the grand jury that could indict Donald Trump is convening: Stacked together in the frame are metal barricades that the New York police department uses to control crowds, such as those Trump has called to protest ahead of his possible indictment. An Atlanta-area prosecutor could bring racketeering and conspiracy charges in the investigation into Donald Trump and his allies\u2019 efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, CNN reports today. The charges are being considered by Fulton county district attorney Fanni Willis, who convened a special grand jury to look into the attempt by the then-president and his allies to disrupt Joe Biden\u2019s election victory in the state. The inquiry is one of several stemming from Trump\u2019s election subversion campaign, and CNN said Willis will likely make a charging decision \u201cthis spring\u201d \u2013 meaning soon, because in North America, spring starts today. Here\u2019s more from CNN: Investigators have a large volume of substantial evidence related to a possible conspiracy from inside and outside the state, including recordings of phone calls, emails, text messages, documents, and testimony before a special grand jury. Their work, the source said, underscores the belief that the push to help Trump was not just a grassroots effort that originated inside the state. The special grand jury met for roughly seven months in Atlanta and heard testimony from 75 witnesses, including some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers from his final weeks in the White House. It recommended issuing multiple indictments in their final report, according to the jury foreperson who spoke out in a media blitz. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis could make decisions on charges this spring, the source said. Willis will bring her charging recommendations to the regularly seated grand juries, who each serve two-month terms. Two regular Fulton County grand juries were seated in early March, and the next batch of two are scheduled to be sworn-in early May. Investigators have at least three recordings of Trump pressuring Georgia officials, including a phone call that he made to the Georgia House speaker to push for a special session to overturn Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory in the state. There is also a recording of Trump\u2019s call to a top investigator with the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office in December 2020, while they were looking into quashed allegations of irregularities with signature-matching in Cobb County in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg isn\u2019t the only prosecutor breathing down Donald Trump\u2019s neck. As the Guardian\u2019s Peter Stone reports, other investigations into the former president appear to be heating up: As Donald Trump runs again for the White House, he\u2019s dogged by four criminal investigations that have gained momentum, including two focused on Trump\u2019s zealous drive to overturn his 2020 election loss, raising the odds he will face charges in one or more inquiries in coming weeks or months, say former federal prosecutors. All four inquiries have accelerated in recent months with numerous subpoenas to close Trump associates and testimony by key witnesses before grand juries in Washington DC, Georgia and New York, that pose growing legal threats to Trump, plus several of his ex-lawyers and allies. Two investigations are homing in on Trump\u2019s nonstop efforts to thwart his 2020 election loss with bogus fraud charges, while others are looking into Trump\u2019s retention of hundreds of classified documents post his presidency, and Trump\u2019s role in a $130,000 hush money payment in 2016 to porn star Stormy Daniels with whom he allegedly had an affair. Donald Trump is the Republican party\u2019s once and potentially future president, since he is again running for the party\u2019s nomination in 2024. Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s looming indictment has thus put the party in a pickle \u2013 but could also have its benefits. GOP politicians spent the weekend reacting to the news that an indictment was coming, with several saying it would ultimately be a good thing for Trump\u2019s presidential chances. Here\u2019s Senator Lindsey Graham, a top ally of the former president: Even his former vice-president-turned-naysayer Mike Pence called the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s case a \u201cpolitically charged prosecution\u201d, before bringing up one of the GOP\u2019s usual attack lines. \u201cI\u2019m taken aback at the idea of indicting a former President of the United States, at a time when there\u2019s a crime wave in New York City \u2026 the fact that the Manhattan DA thinks that indicting President Trump is his top priority, I think is, just tells you everything you need to know about the radical left in this country,\u201d he told ABC News. That said, Trump seemed to be going it alone when he called for his supporters to protest the indictment. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy \u2013 another Trump ally \u2013 was quick to swat that idea down: Good morning, US politics blog readers. We\u2019re at the start of what could be a history-making week in the United States. Manhattan\u2019s district attorney Alvin Bragg appears to be getting ready to bring charges against Donald Trump for the alleged hush money payment he made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election, which would make him the first American president ever to be indicted. Over the weekend, Trump said he\u2019d be arrested on Tuesday and called for his supporters to protest \u2013 which is worrying, considering what happened the last time he issued such a plea. The former president may be getting ahead of himself, and his attorneys have since declared that they have no specific knowledge on when an indictment could happen. But if it comes, it would be a huge development in the many investigations that Trump has been embroiled in ever since he left the White House. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: Twenty years ago today the United States and its allies invaded Iraq. Expect to hear plenty about that today. It\u2019s what passes for party time at the White House, where Joe Biden will host a Persian new year celebration then welcome the cast of TV show Ted Lasso. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will brief reporters at 2 pm eastern time."

            "date": "2023-03-21T10:00:12Z",
            "content": "At the time of the US-led invasion of Iraq, American military women were still officially banned from ground combat. Yet the nature of that war with its ill-defined frontlines and insurgent attacks meant that female troops quickly found themselves under enemy fire \u2013 and they began firing back. Twenty years on, what started on that chaotic battlefield in Iraq ended up changing the US armed forces forever. During the war, women played crucial roles under fire alongside their male counterparts, including intelligence-gathering, medical aid, being deployed with the national guard, the military police and combat service support roles. All the while, many also faced issues including ill-fitting uniforms, sexual harassment and difficulty applying for veteran benefits upon leaving the service. Since the Al-Qaida terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, more than 300,000 US women have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. A total of 166 women were killed during combat operations and over 1,000 were wounded, according to the Washington, DC-based Service Women\u2019s Action Network (Swan). Despite the Combat Exclusion Policy prohibiting women from being \u201cassigned\u201d to ground combat battalions in the invasion, commanders shifted to reflect the new reality without officially changing policy, by saying women could be temporarily \u201cattached\u201d to direct combat units. \u201cThat was a war that didn\u2019t really have a normal \u2026 battle space \u2026 If you were on \u2026 transport from the airport to the camp, you could find yourself having to fight,\u201d Lory Manning, a retired captain who served over 25 years in the navy, told the Guardian. On the ever-shifting frontline, she said: \u201cArmy or marine corps majors or captains would have to decide whether to send an infantry patrol out without a medic \u2013 or to send a woman. \u201cAlso, with the cultural differences [in] Iraq and Afghanistan, if you were going to search a [local] woman, it had to be done by another woman. If you were going to get the sort of intelligence you could get by talking to the local people, our men couldn\u2019t talk to the local women. Our women could talk to both the men and women,\u201d Manning, now a director at Swan, added. As a result, female marines on the \u201cTask Force Lioness\u201d ad hoc unit accompanied male infantry soldiers on raids and house searches. In Falluja in June 2005, 13 marines were killed after a suicide bomber targeted an American convoy \u2013 11 of the marines were female, marking the deadliest day for American female soldiers, at the time, since the second world war. Other women in a variety of roles became engaged in huge firefights and killed enemy insurgents, with some being killed and injured themselves. In 2005, Sgt Leigh Ann Hester became the first female army soldier in US military history to be awarded the Silver Star for her actions during a skirmish outside Baghdad that year. While scanning and clearing a route for a supply convoy, Hester\u2019s squad was attacked by enemy insurgents. Hester directed her team andthen began fighting on foot, killing at least three insurgents. In the end, 33 insurgents were killed or wounded and one captured, while everyone on her unit survived. Other women such as Phyllis Wilson, a retired army veteran who served 37 years as a military intelligence voice intercept operator, played crucial roles for special operations missions. Wilson was first deployed to Iraq in 2006. She slept surrounded by sandbags to shield against mortar attacks and delivered intelligence to her special operations teams about enemy insurgents. Wilson also assisted with the Female Engagement Teams dealing directly with the Afghan and Iraqi civilians in the war zone amid great danger that evolved from the ad hoc Lioness taskforces. \u201cWe had to select, both psychologically and physically, the right people \u2026 We couldn\u2019t let these first females fail and we had to make sure \u2026 We give them any kind of training that they needed and push them to believe that what they could do was possible,\u201d Wilson explained. \u201cWe had to also \u2026 screen out those that might not hold up under the kind of incredible scrutiny both by so many other soldiers and by the American public as well. You\u2019ve got to find this amazing combination of skills and mentality all in one little package of one human being,\u201d she added. \u201cThere were only two women on these teams when they ultimately went out with the guys so the two of them had to have each other\u2019s back as well as all of the men that they were supporting. But it made such a huge difference in a society and a culture that we were trying to learn from and get information from.\u201d Yet the women often ended up in combat zones with kit such as body armor tailored for men. \u201cI was protected but I \u2026 can\u2019t get a weapon out \u2026 because the gear was not angled right, the pockets were not right, the equipment either kept you from breathing or it was too loose and you were sure if something comes, it\u2019s going to hit a soft part and kill me,\u201d said Wilson, now president of the Virginia-based Military Women\u2019s Memorial. \u201cYou would choose, if you thought it was going to be a more worrisome situation, to have freedom of movement as opposed to protection.\u201d Meanwhile, Lourdes Tiglao, who heads the Department of Veteran Affairs\u2019 Center for Women Veterans, told the Guardian that she was one of few women with the air force\u2019s critical care air transport team in Afghanistan after 9/11.\u201cI felt that I had to prove myself every time that I belonged there,\u201d said Tiglao, who was tasked with stabilizing wounded troops as part of a three-person team that operated portable intensive care units on transport aircraft. At 4ft11in, her body armor came down to her thighs. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re super short, and so \u2026 you feel like you can\u2019t show any weakness because they will look at you like, \u2018If you\u2019re going to crack under pressure, how can we trust you with someone\u2019s life?\u2019\u201d she said. For others like Toni Hightower, a retired major and combat veteran who served in the army for more than 23 years, the line between displaying the hardness of a leader and the softness of someone grieving lost colleagues was often blurred. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re in a leadership role \u2026 I wanted to go on hard, but not so hard as to not give my soldiers \u2026 the clarity that it is OK to grieve. \u201cI wanted to give them that safe space to say, \u2018I\u2019m hard as woodpecker lips, but. \u2026 I\u2019m hurting too, and I need you to see that\u2019 \u2026 Not only can we be hard, we can also be soft\u2026we show \u2026 it\u2019s OK to be both,\u201d Hightower, who now works at the Center for Women Veterans, added. In 2013, the then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, lifted the official ban on women serving in combat, formalizing what had become business as usual for so many of those deployed. Britain signaled it would follow suit, then later phased in equality of opportunity. Currently, women make up 16% of the US military, with more than 100 having graduated from the army\u2019s rigorous Ranger School. In 2021, a female sailor became the first woman to successfully complete the intense 37-week navy special warfare training course. Three million women have served in or with the US military since the American Revolution, according to a national digital register. Yet it was only last year that the army designed a \u201ctactical bra\u201d for its female soldiers, which veterans say was long overdue. To Kara Vuic, a historian at Texas Christian University who focuses on the role of women in military history, simply lifting a ban is not enough. \u201cIntegration doesn\u2019t mean opening the door and saying, \u2018Everybody\u2019s welcome now\u2019 \u2026 If you want to actually integrate women into these roles, you can\u2019t start from the presumption that women have to integrate into a culture and a practice that has been designed for men,\u201d she said. As improvements continue to be made, albeit slowly as some critics argue, the feminist dilemma of signing up for what can ultimately be the business of killing and being killed in war remains. Wilson concluded: \u201cAs a nation, I think we\u2019ve had to grapple with the idea that women, given the opportunities that we now have, also means that we die, we are gravely wounded, and we may be a prisoner of war. You can\u2019t get equality without the downsides as well.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-23T18:13:52Z",
            "content": "A Russian national accused of smuggling military technology has escaped house arrest a day after an Italian court agreed to hand him over to US authorities. Italian authorities said Artem Uss, who was detained at Milan\u2019s Malpensa airport on an international arrest warrant last October, broke his court-ordered electronic bracelet and left his house in Cascina Vione di Basiglio in the province of Milan. US prosecutors last year charged Uss and four other Russian citizens with shipping military technology bought from US manufacturers to Russian buyers, some of which ended up on the battlefield in Ukraine. Investigators said they used a German company to ship the technology. Uss is also accused of shipping oil from Venezuela to Russia in breach of sanctions, and bank fraud. A Milan appeal court said in a statement on Tuesday it had agreed to the extradition of Uss for smuggling oil, not for smuggling military technologies, citing a lack of evidence. His lawyer, who could not immediately be reached for comment, could have lodged an appeal to Italy\u2019s top court to try to prevent his client from being sent across the Atlantic. Italian investigators fear Uss has already left the country. He is the son of Aleksander Uss, the governor of the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk. When Italian police arrived at his apartment to check that he was home, they found the door closed and the TV on. Investigators do not rule out the involvement of Russian intelligence in Uss\u2019s escape. During the trial, the man\u2019s lawyers suggested that his arrest and extradition would be aimed at a \u201cprisoner exchange\u201d, citing how the US was interested in obtaining from Moscow the release of Paul Whelan, an American businessman who in 2020 was sentenced to 16 years in prison in Russia.

            "date": "2023-03-04T11:58:48Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s military budget is set to increase again, the spokesperson for its rubber-stamping parliament has said, before a week-long political meeting expected to make big changes to China\u2019s system of governance and increase measures to combat international sanctions. The spokesperson for the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s legislative body, addressed the media on the eve of its annual meeting to outline the week\u2019s agenda, including changes to the constitution and the legal sector, and endorsing new appointments to senior roles. Wang Chao said defence budget rises as a proportion of GDP had been moderate and below global averages. Last year\u2019s 1.45tn yuan (\u00a3190bn) budget was a rise of 7.1% and followed a rise of 6.8% in 2021 and 6.6% in 2020. Wang did not say by how much the budget would increase, but said it was \u201cappropriate and reasonable\u201d and was needed for China to meet complex security challenges and to \u201cfulfil its responsibilities as a major country\u201d. \u201cThe modernisation of China\u2019s military will not pose a threat to any country,\u201d Wang said. \u201cOn the contrary, it will only be a positive force for safeguarding regional stability and world peace.\u201d Under Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership, China has continued to significantly expand and overhaul its military. However, information about actual spending compared with budget announcements remains opaque, with the US defence department estimating it could be 1.1 to 2 times higher. China\u2019s military spending is far below that of the US. But it has the world\u2019s largest infantry and biggest navy, and continues to build its stockpile of missiles, warships, submarines and planes including nuclear-capable bombers and stealth fighters. One of the most significant recent shows of force from China occurred in August, when major live fire drills were staged around the main island of Taiwan in retaliation for a visit to Taipei by the then US speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Under the leadership of Xi China\u2019s military has been tasked with readying for potential war, probably over Taiwan, which Xi says is a province of China that must be \u201creunified\u201d, despite overwhelming opposition from its government and people. Pelosi\u2019s visit was cited on Saturday in the opening address by the chair of the political consultative conference (CPPCC), which holds its annual meeting concurrently with the NPC, at an event known as the \u201ctwo sessions\u201d. The chair, Wang Yang, who is also a former Chinese vice-premier, praised China\u2019s \u201cfighting spirit\u201d in response to foreign sanctions against the government, and to Pelosi\u2019s visit. The increasingly aggressive posturing and military activity towards Taiwan, as well as crackdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and support for Russia in its Ukraine invasion, have attracted international criticism and sanctions. At the NPC press conference, Wang Chao decried foreign sanctions against China as \u201cbullying acts\u201d and said China had introduced regulation and laws to counter such efforts, and was working on more."

            "date": "2023-03-29T06:00:28Z",
            "content": "In September 2021, the gun manufacturer Smith &amp; Wesson announced that it was relocating from the Massachusetts town in which it was incorporated in 1852 to a new location \u2013 Maryville in Blount county, Tennessee. \u201cWe have been left with no other alternative,\u201d the company complained, pointing to proposals in the Massachusetts legislature that would extend the state\u2019s ban on AR-15 style rifles to the selling of all semi-automatic firearms. Some 750 jobs would be moved to Tennessee, the gun maker said, for a number of reasons, the first of which was that the state supported the second amendment right to bear arms. Bill Lee, Tennessee\u2019s Republican governor who has overseen the loosening of state gun laws in recent years including signing into law the ability of most adults to carry handguns without a permit, was ecstatic. \u201cWe\u2019re proud this company has chosen to relocate to Blount Co,\u201d he gloated. Eighteen months later, and 180 miles away from Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s sparkling new headquarters, a shooter entered a private Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee, on Monday and gunned down three nine-year-old children and three adult staff. The killer was armed with two semi-automatic firearms \u2013 an AR-15 style rifle and a semi-automatic pistol, both of which would be banned under the Massachusetts bill. The shooter also carried a third weapon, a handgun. Manufacturer: Smith &amp; Wesson. In the wake of the Nashville tragedy, social media platforms have lit up with chatter about the shooter identifying as a transgender man. But another, far more common and far more urgent, factor lies behind the carnage at the Covenant school: the sheer prevalence of assault firearms based on military designs that are marketed to American civilians by the gun industry. The starkest illustration that America has a gun problem are the international comparisons. Figures compiled by the Small Arms Survey show that the country is awash with guns at vastly higher levels \u2013 both numerically and per capita \u2013 than any other country in the world. In 2017 there were 393m legal and illicit firearms in the hands of US civilians. That quantity overshadows the next country in the league table: India, with 71m. Expressed by civilian firearms for every 100 residents, the US still stands head and shoulders above the rest of the globe. It has 121 for each 100, compared with war-torn Yemen in second place with 53. Drill down to the guns used in the Nashville shooting and the extent of the American gun nightmare is illustrated on a more granular level. The first of the shooter\u2019s three guns was an AR-15 style assault rifle \u2013 a Lead Star Arms Grunt built by the Palmetto State Armory in South Carolina. A Washington Post investigation published on Monday (coincidentally about four hours before the Nashville shooter entered the Covenant school) explores how the AR-15 \u2013 a weapon designed for the battlefield and admired by the Pentagon for its \u201cphenomenal lethality\u201d \u2013 has become the best-selling rifle in the US. Polling data from the Washington Post and Ipsos suggests that about one in every 20 US adults \u2013 about 16 million people \u2013 own at least one AR-15. The Post\u2019s investigation also includes the devastating figure that AR-15s have been involved in 10 of the 17 deadliest mass shootings in the US in the past decade. A report from Congress last July helps explain why gun manufacturers have turned so enthusiastically to flooding the US market with AR-15 style rifles. It found that gun makers generated more than $1bn in sales of the guns over the past decade. The second weapon in the Nashville shooter\u2019s possession suggests an even greater problem. That firearm appears to have been a semi-automatic pistol known as a KEL-TEC SUB2000. Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, said that the pistol pointed to an even more daunting threat than AR-15s: the ubiquity of civilian ownership of assault firearms of all sorts of different descriptions. \u201cMany people, from the news media to policymakers, equate assault weapons with the AR-15 or the AK-47. The reality is that there are a wide range of assault guns that are being marketed to civilians \u2013 assault pistols, assault shotguns, 50-caliber anti-armor sniper rifles, and more.\u201d What these weapons have in common, Sugarmann said, was that they are anti-personnel firearms designed to kill the largest number of people in the shortest possible time. Their dominance in US gun sales has been achieved quite consciously, he said, by an industry that has become militarized. \u201cAcross the board, every manufacturer has some type of assault weapon that they offer. What the industry has done is to embrace heightened lethality as the foundation of their marketing efforts, and we are seeing the end result of that in terms of deaths and injuries on a daily basis.\u201d Over the coming days more information will emerge about how the shooter came to buy seven firearms, including the three used in the rampage, entirely legally in recent days. Police have indicated this buying spree occurred even as the assailant was being treated for an emotional disorder. None of that will touch on the even more disconcerting question: how weapons designed by the US military to kill large numbers of enemy combatants have become, in the words of one Republican lawmaker, the much-loved \u201cnational gun of America\u201d."

            "title": "Egyptian army has turned Sinai schools into military bases, says rights group",
            "date": "2023-03-30T05:00:56Z",
            "content": "Egyptian forces have taken over 37 schools and transformed them into military bases while dozens more have been destroyed during a 10-year war with militants in Sinai, a rights group has found in an initial assessment. In a months-long investigation shared with the Guardian before its official release, the UK-based Sinai Foundation for Human Rights (SFHR) accused the Egyptian armed forces of compromising the right to education of children during its campaign against militants in north Sinai. Using satellite images, video, photos and testimony from witnesses who live in the sparsely populated area, the group found the army had carried out the \u201cunnecessary targeting of certain schools\u201d, causing \u201ccommunity-wide shock\u201d. Ahmed Salem, SFHR\u2019s co-founder and executive director, said: \u201cSchools are used as bases because they are often built two or three storeys high, whereas most of the buildings in the area are one story. It gives the military a place to position snipers.\u201d SFHR said it found 59 schools had been destroyed in clashes between the army and insurgents, and added that in three cases, schools were attacked or destroyed by militants. Students have been left with \u201cno education and heightened illiteracy\u201d, SFHR said. Since 2013, Egypt has battled an Islamic State-linked insurgency in Sinai, with militants carrying out scores of attacks on security forces and civilians. The conflict followed the 2011 Egyptian revolution, in which Hosni Mubarak was overthrown, only for the Islamist government that replaced him to be deposed in a military coup. Gen Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who orchestrated the power grab, continues to rule today and has in recent years intensified the large-scale offensive in the vast Sinai peninsula. The toll of the conflict on civilians has been hard to determine as operations have largely been hidden from the public, with journalists and outside observers barred from the area. The violence has mostly avoided tourist resorts at the southern end of the peninsula. Satellite images provided by SFHR showed schools with a military presence, including the construction of radio towers and fortifications, such as brick walls built in the surrounding area. Images of al-Mahdeya joint elementary school in the Rafah region showed that farmland immediately surrounding the school had been razed, SFHR said. Videos taken at ground level showed military personnel and armoured vehicles inside the school. The rights group cited a father whose children attended al-Mahdeya, who said two of his three children had since ended their education as schools in other areas were not equipped to provide extra places. The government had failed to adequately relocate children after taking over their schools, SFHR said. Another school, al-Shatea joint elementary school in the Sheikh Zuweid region, was completely destroyed, according to a video showing the building in ruins. Separate video by pro-government armed groups in Sinai showed broken desks and a blackboard damaged by shrapnel. In other cases, militants had placed explosive devices inside schools to prevent the army from using them, SFHR said. The Egyptian government and militants have been accused by rights groups of committing crimes during the hostilities in north Sinai, home to roughly half-a-million people. Human Rights Watch has previously alleged that warring sides have violated the laws of war as well as committed human rights abuses. It also claimed security forces killed dozens of alleged terrorists in \u201cextrajudicial killings\u201d. A growing body of international law and UN security council resolutions have led to a consensus that schools should be protected from military use during armed conflict. SFHR said it had sent letters to the Egyptian minister of education, chair of the education committee in the Egyptian parliament, governor of north Sinai and undersecretary of the Ministry of Education in north Sinai to comment on its initial findings but had not heard back. The government has previously claimed in local media that it had funded the construction of new schools across north Sinai over the past few years. SFHR disputes this, saying 96 schools in north Sinai cannot be used and many children officially enrolled in school are, in fact, out of education. The Guardian has contacted the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs for comment."

            "date": "2023-03-25T21:15:49Z",
            "content": "Russia has reached an agreement with Belarus to station tactical nuclear weapons on its smaller neighbour\u2019s territory, so bringing some of its arsenal closer to the rest of Europe, Vladimir Putin has said. The Russian president made the announcement on state television, arguing that it would not breach non-proliferation agreements and that it would match similar arrangements that the US has with several of its European allies. Putin said he was acting after negotiations with Belarus\u2019s president, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had \u201clong raised the question\u201d of a nuclear deployment on his country\u2019s territory. \u201cThere is nothing unusual here either: firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThey have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries.\u201d It is estimated by the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation that there are about 100 American nuclear weapons \u2013 airborne gravity bombs \u2013 stored in Europe across six bases in five countries, although they are retained in the control of the US. \u201cWe agreed that we will do the same \u2013 without violating our obligations, I emphasise, without violating our international obligations on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,\u201d the Russian president added. Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats or escalated nuclear rhetoric after the full invasion of Ukraine, but this is the first time he has announced a plan to station nuclear weapons in another country. Moscow has 5,977 nuclear warheads in its inventory, according to the Federation of American Scientists, and has long had the capability to strike a target anywhere in the world. The US has slightly fewer, at 5,428. The US Department of Defense said on Saturday that there were no indications that Russia was preparing to use nuclear weapons after Moscow\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe have seen reports of Russia\u2019s announcement and will continue to monitor this situation,\u201d the department\u2019s press office said. \u201cWe have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture, nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance.\u201d Belarus is one of Russia\u2019s few remaining friends. Lukashenko allowed the Kremlin to invade Ukraine from its territory at the beginning of the war, which saw Moscow make a failed attempt to capture Kyiv. But it has not joined in the war itself, and another attack via the country is still not thought likely. However, Putin\u2019s televised remarks came only a few days after the Kremlin signed up to a joint declaration with China agreeing to restrict future nuclear weapons deployments abroad, after the visit of Beijing\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to the country. Russia will have completed the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus by 1 July, Putin said, but no timetable was given for when the bombs would physically move into the country. Pavel Podvig, director of the Russian Nuclear Forces Project and one of the world\u2019s leading independent experts on Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal, said it was not clear whether the storage site was already under construction. If it was, Podvig tweeted, he hoped it would be located by independent specialists quickly using satellite imagery because \u201cthree months [to complete it by July] seems like a really tight schedule\u201d. Russia has stationed 10 aircraft in Belarus capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons, Putin said, and equipped them appropriately. Aircrews would be trained from 3 April, the president added. Putin also said that Russia had given Belarus Iskander missile systems that can be used to launch nuclear weapons, although it was unclear whether that reflected the type of bombs to be deployed. The Russian leader also bizarrely claimed that Lukashenko had asked about nuclear weapons after a statement earlier this week by the UK that it would be supplying depleted uranium shells with its fleet of Challenger 2 tanks. Depleted uranium is a by-product of the enrichment process to make nuclear weapons or fuel, so as a result is less radioactive. Its military purpose is as a tough and penetrating metal for shells and, while its toxicity makes its use on the battlefield controversial, it is not in any sense a nuclear weapon. US nuclear weapons are believed to be stored in six bases: Kleine Brogel in Belgium; B\u00fcchel airbase in Germany; Aviano and Ghedi airbases in Italy; Volkel airbase in the Netherlands; and \u0130ncirlik in Turkey."

            "date": "2023-03-14T10:22:36Z",
            "content": "The Aukus scheme announced on Monday in San Diego represents the first time a loophole in the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has been used to transfer fissile material and nuclear technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. The loophole is paragraph 14, and it allows fissile material utilised for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium, the core of a nuclear weapon, from international oversight. On Tuesday, the Chinese mission to the UN accused the US and UK of \u201cclearly violating the object and purpose of the NPT\u201d, adding that \u201csuch a textbook case of double standard will damage the authority and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation system\u201d. \u201cThe nuclear submarine cooperation plan released today by Aukus is a blatant act that constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines international non-proliferation system, fuels arms races, and hurts peace and stability in the region,\u201d the mission said. The IAEA said in a statement on Tuesday that Australia, the US and UK had informed it of the deal, but reiterated that the \u201clegal obligations\u201d of the three countries to non-proliferation were \u201cparamount\u201d. \u201cUltimately, the [IAEA] must ensure that no proliferation risks will emanate from this project,\u201d it said. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, supports the steps taken by Aukus, Kyodo News reported. The government said the nuclear-powered submarine procurement plan was explained to Kishida in a phone call with the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Tuesday. The Aukus partners have held intensive discussions with the IAEA about the plans and taken steps to limit the risk. Early on in the talks, the idea was floated that paragraph 14 might not be invoked at all, and the nuclear fuel would be kept under IAEA safeguards. However, the IAEA was not prepared to have its inspection standards watered down to the extent that the agency would not be able to determine the timing of a visit, and the Aukus partners were squeamish about letting an international team of inspectors onboard their state-of-the-art submarines. To mitigate the proliferation risk, the Australians have agreed not to have a training reactor on their territory, but to train their submariners in the US and UK instead. Australia will not enrich or reprocess the spent nuclear fuel, and the fissile material provided by the US and UK will come in welded units that do not have to be refuelled in their lifetime. Australia has undertaken not to acquire the equipment necessary to chemically reprocess spent fuel that would make it usable in a weapon. \u201cSince day one of this effort, or consultation period, we have prioritised non-proliferation,\u201d a senior US official said. The IAEA director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has said he believes the Aukus partners \u201care committed to ensuring the highest non-proliferation and safeguards standards are met\u201d, and noted his \u201csatisfaction with the engagement and transparency shown by the three countries thus far\u201d. \u201cI do think the three countries are quite serious about trying to mitigate the harm to the non-proliferation regime. I think they\u2019ve done a very good job engaging with the IAEA,\u201d James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. \u201cBut I still think there is real and concrete harm done. \u201cThe primary problem with Aukus was always the precedent set, that Australia would be the first country that would remove nuclear fuel from safeguards for use in naval reactors,\u201d Acton added. \u201cMy fear was never that Australia would misuse that fuel, but that other countries would invoke Aukus as a precedent for removing nuclear fuel from safeguards.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-28T14:18:14Z",
            "content": "The terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland has been increased from substantial to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. In a written statement to MPs, the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, said MI5 had increased the threat to the country from Northern Ireland-related terrorism and the public should remain vigilant but not be alarmed. The move by the Security Service comes a month after the senior police officer John Caldwell was shot by masked gunmen in Omagh, County Tyrone. The detective chief inspector is understood to be in a critical but stable condition in hospital after he was shot while he packed footballs into his car alongside his son after a football training session. Thirteen arrests have been made in connection with the attempted murder and dissident republicans have been blamed for the attack. In his statement, Heaton-Harris said: \u201cOver the last 25 years, Northern Ireland has transformed into a peaceful society. The Belfast (Good Friday) agreement demonstrates how peaceful and democratic politics improve society. However, a small number of people remain determined to cause harm to our communities through acts of politically motivated violence. \u201cIn recent months, we have seen an increase in levels of activity relating to Northern Ireland-related terrorism, which has targeted police officers serving their communities and also put at risk the lives of children and other members of the public. These attacks have no support, as demonstrated by the reaction to the abhorrent attempted murder of DCI Caldwell.\u201d Threat levels are designed to give a broad indication of the likelihood of a terrorist attack. MI5 is responsible for setting the threat level from Northern Irish-related terrorism in Northern Ireland, while the threat level for the UK from international terrorism is set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. The threat to the UK from terrorism is substantial, meaning an attack is likely. The raising of the terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland comes just a year after it was lowered for the first time in 12 years. The New IRA has claimed responsibility for the attack on Caldwell, as well as an attempt to kill two police officers with a bomb in Strabane last November. The group has been most active of the dissident republican outfits in Northern Ireland in recent years. It is believed to be the largest of the dissident republican groups and has been linked to a number of murders including those of the journalist and author Lyra McKee in 2019, PC Ronan Kerr in 2011 and the prison officers David Black and Adrian Ismay in 2012 and 2016 respectively. It is believed to have been formed between 2011 and 2012 after the merger of a number of smaller groups, including the Real IRA \u2013 the group behind the 1998 Omagh bomb. The group is strongest in Derry and Strabane, though also has a presence in Belfast, and other pockets in County Tyrone and Lurgan in County Armagh. Earlier this month, Arm na Poblachta (Army of the Republic) said police officers\u2019 families would be considered targets. It is a smaller dissident group that emerged in 2017 but has not been as active. Simon Byrne, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said: \u201cThis is part of an ongoing process of monitoring the threat level in Northern Ireland, which is conducted by MI5. We have spoken publicly about the number of attacks that have taken place in recent months, not least the attempted murder of DCI John Caldwell on 22 February. \u201cWe will relentlessly pursue those who seek to cause harm and terrorise our communities, and attack my officers and staff, and I pay tribute to them as they continue to deliver for our communities. I would also like to thank the community and political leaders of Northern Ireland for their overwhelming support for the police service in recent times.\u201d The Democratic Unionist party leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, called on the UK government to fund more police officers in Northern Ireland. \u201cIt is bad news for Northern Ireland when the risk of further attacks moves to \u2018likely\u2019 or \u2018very likely\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to a day when the threat level is removed but to get there the community must stand with the police and demonstrate there is no space for terrorism in Northern Ireland in 2023. \u201cThe government made a commitment to help fund 7,500 officers in the PSNI but have not yet made good on that promise. With police officers facing such a threat, now is the time for the government to provide that additional funding to ensure the PSNI has the full capacity to meet this threat.\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Stormont leader, Michelle O\u2019Neill, said there was no place or space for paramilitary groups in a modern, democratic society, adding: \u201cThey must go.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s announcement that the level of threat has been increased comes against the backdrop of the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday agreement,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cA quarter century on there is no place or space for paramilitary groups in a modern, democratic society. They must go.\u201d"

            "title": "Did Vietnam peace protests stop Nixon using nuclear weapons?",
            "date": "2023-03-28T06:00:09Z",
            "content": "A new documentary about demonstrations against the Vietnam war in late 1969 argues that the hundreds of thousands who filled the streets in Washington and almost every major US city convinced Richard Nixon to abandon a plan to sharply escalate the war, including the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons. The Movement and The \u201cMadman\u201d will air on PBS on Tuesday. Produced and directed by the veteran documentarian Stephen Talbot, it evokes a peak moment of 1960s activism \u2013 and the \u201cabsolute disconnection\u201d between what Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, were \u201cdeciding to do and the human costs of it, whether it\u2019s to our own soldiers or [Vietnamese] civilians\u201d. Those costs \u201chad absolutely no part of their thinking\u201d said the historian Carolyn Eisenberg. \u201cThey don\u2019t care.\u201d Talbot\u2019s sure eye for searing images is matched by a perfect ear for songs. His soundtrack includes anti-establishment hymns by Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Jimi Hendrix and Judy Collins, plus the essential anti-war anthem, I-Feel-Like-I\u2019m Fixin\u2019-to-Die Rag, which became world famous after Country Joe McDonald performed it at Woodstock in summer 1969. The one thing the documentary does not do is provide any convincing evidence that the demonstrations prevented the use of nuclear weapons. \u201cIt is a serious look at how one major demonstration was organized,\u201d said Thomas Powers, author of The War at Home, a history of the anti-war movement; The Man Who Kept the Secrets, a widely admired biography of the former CIA director Richard Helms; and seven other books. But as far as the idea that \u201ca real danger of the use of atomic weapons was prevented [by the Vietnam Moratorium] \u2013 I think that\u2019s just plain wrong\u201d, Powers told the Guardian. Talbot responded that declassified documents about Operation Duck Hook, which laid out options for Nixon, included the possible use of nuclear weapons as well as the mining of Haiphong harbor and the bombing of dykes that would have caused massive civilian casualties. As to whether Nixon seriously considered the nuclear option, Talbot said: \u201cI literally don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t think anyone could say for sure. But it was on the table.\u201d The \u201cmadman\u201d of Talbot\u2019s film is Nixon. One thing that is not in dispute is that the president worked hard to convince the North Vietnamese and the Russians he was crazy enough to do anything, including pulling the nuclear trigger, if Hanoi refused his demands to withdraw from the south. As Stephen Bull, a former Nixon aide, explains in the film, his boss wanted the Russians to \u201cthink that he was a madman. However, my personal observation was, it was a bluff. He was never going to use nuclear weapons, but he wanted the threat to be out there to force them to the table.\u201d Powers likened Nixon\u2019s threats to use nuclear bombs to Vladimir Putin\u2019s current threats to use such weapons against Ukraine \u2013 which Powers doesn\u2019t think are serious either. Talbot agreed that was a possibility. In his memoirs, Nixon wrote: \u201cAlthough publicly I continued to ignore the raging anti-war controversy, I had to face the fact that it had probably destroyed the credibility of my ultimatum to Hanoi.\u201d The other thing the demonstrations almost certainly accomplished was the passage of a law, signed by Nixon in November 1969, which created a draft lottery. On 1 December 1969, every draft-eligible young man born between 1944 and 1950 was assigned a number based on his birth date, from one to 365. The following year, the Pentagon announced that no one with a number higher than 195 would be drafted. A year later that number dropped to 125, then to 95 the year after that. Since everyone in the streets in 1969 was demonstrating in no small part because of an acute desire to avoid dying in what they considered a pointless conflict, the lottery had an immediate effect in reducing the number who felt a sense of urgency about the war. If you had a high enough number, your life was no longer in danger. After the very first lottery, more than a third of those previously subject to the draft no longer felt any imminent jeopardy. So there was less self-interest to propel the anti-war protests. Talbot agreed that the lottery was a direct result of the anti-war demonstrations, and said he included it in an earlier, longer version of his film \u2013 but it did not make the final cut. In fall 1969, he was a senior in college. He went to DC to make his first film, March on Washington, which became his senior thesis when he attended Wesleyan University. \u201cI used clips from my first student film for this documentary,\u201d he told the Guardian. The truth is, while the Vietnam demonstrations did reduce the dangers of the draft, there is almost no evidence they shortened the war. When Nixon took office, 31,000 Americans had been killed in Vietnam, plus hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese. By the time the last American combat troops left in March 1973, two months after the draft was abolished, 58,220 US soldiers had died \u2013 plus as many as 2 million Vietnamese civilians and 1.3 million Vietnamese soldiers.

            "content": "New Zealand\u2019s government has confirmed it is discussing joining the non-nuclear part of the Aukus alliance founded by Australia, the UK and US. \u201cWe have been offered the opportunity to talk about whether we could or wish to participate in that pillar two [non-nuclear] aspect of it,\u201d said Andrew Little, the New Zealand defence minister. \u201cI\u2019ve indicated we will be willing to explore it.\u201d It comes a week after New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, visited top Chinese diplomats, who raised concerns at the military tie-up between Australia, the UK and the US, which is centred on Australia receiving nuclear-powered navy submarines. A second \u201cpillar\u201d to the three-part deal covers the sharing of advanced military technologies, including quantum computing and artificial intelligence. New Zealand has not been offered the chance to join pillar one, nor would it accept, due to its anti-nuclear position. Little said any Aukus membership \u201ccould not compromise our legal obligations and our moral commitment to nuclear-free\u201d. \u201c[Aukus membership] would be about the kind of technology \u2026 needed to protect defence personnel,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually domain awareness, so surveillance technology, and radio technology that allows us to do that.\u201d Little met this month with Kurt Campbell, the US national security coordinator for the Indo-Pacific region. During her visit to Beijing last week, Mahuta said, Chinese officials made clear their concerns. \u201cThey acknowledged our position on the matter. We\u2019re not a part of those arrangements,\u201d Mahuta said. New Zealand has other concerns about Aukus, including that it may jeopardise the treaty of Rarotonga, which designates large areas of the Pacific free of nuclear weapons. \u201cOur concern is not to see the militarisation of the Pacific, that the treaty of Rarotonga be upheld, and that\u2019s the basis upon which our assurances from Australia have been gained in relation to those arrangements,\u201d Mahuta said. China is strongly against Aukus, with foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin outlining China\u2019s \u201csevere concern and firm opposition\u201d. It is not clear whether China holds the same concerns regarding non-nuclear parts of Aukus. Last week, the New Zealand opposition foreign affairs spokesperson, Gerry Brownlee, raised his own concerns about whether Aukus might make it harder for Anzac forces to operate together. On Tuesday, he walked back his comments, saying he was \u201ccertainly not\u201d trying to criticise the deal. \u201cAustralia will make decisions for Australia,\u201d Brownlee said. Little said foreign or local voices against the deal would not be a factor in potential membership. \u201cWe as a country and the leaders of the day have to make an assessment about our long-term best interests and what is a rapidly changing world and a rapidly changing region.\u201d The former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark has said it is not in New Zealand\u2019s interests to be associated with Aukus.

            "date": "2023-03-22T06:09:16Z",
            "content": "With his first book, The People\u2019s Hospital, author Ricardo Nuila offers a compelling mixture of healthcare policy and gripping stories from the frontlines of medicine. Exploring the question of how Houston\u2019s safety-net hospital, Ben Taub, can have better outcomes by many measures than America\u2019s best private health centers, he deconstructs basic assumptions about healthcare in the US, pulling these ideas from vivid, journalistic accounts of the patients he serves. Nuila took a twisty path to his literary vocation. Born into a family of doctors, he always felt the expectation that one day he\u2019d become a doctor too. \u201cI grew up visiting hospitals with my dad. I loved the feeling of being in a place where there was all this activity, and people were being helped.\u201d Nuila\u2019s father, originally from El Salvador, had worked extremely hard to carve out a profitable private practice in Texas, and his grandfather had also became a doctor, returning to El Salvador to serve his home community. As much as Nuila wanted to heed the expectation that he become an MD, in high school and college he began to feel pulled strongly toward a completely different direction: writing. Books like Blood Meridian and 1984 made strong impressions, and as he made his way through college he was increasingly torn over which direction to choose. Some key advice from Nuila\u2019s father got him thinking that maybe he could do both. \u201cAbout that time I told my dad I wanted to be a writer, and he told me: \u2018you\u2019d be crazy to leave medicine.\u2019 He said: \u2018You can go to graduate school in writing and learn your technique, but where are you going to get your stories? You can get those stories in medicine.\u2019 That was really essential advice.\u201d He reluctantly returned to medical school in search of a steady income, but literature remained seductive, and after medical school, Nuila took a year off and \u201cwrote probably the worst novel that anybody\u2019s written\u201d. As a medical resident, he would get up at 4.30am to write for two hours before then enduring grueling shifts as a trainee doctor. More and more Nuila fell in love with the idea of being a doctor, and he began viewing medicine as a way to service his vocation as a writer. \u201cI saw medicine as my stability on this quest to write.\u201d He landed a day job at Ben Taub while moonlighting for McSweeney\u2019s and taking part in the annual Best American Short Stories anthology. As Nuila deepened his work at the hospital, he started noticing that patients there received extremely good care, despite its reputation for serving clientele who could not afford to go anywhere better. The disconnect between the hospital\u2019s reputation and what he saw as a doctor there lingered in his mind, eventually becoming the seeds of The People\u2019s Hospital. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know that public healthcare can be successful, and these presumptions bother me.\u201d Early on in his book, Nuila touts Ben Taub\u2019s ability to treat heart attacks as the best in the nation \u2013 according to a 2015 study, it removed the blood clots that cause them far faster than any other hospital. Although claims like \u201cbest hospital in America\u201d are undoubtedly complex to validate, it is true that throughout The People\u2019s Hospital Nuila offers a mixture of anecdotal and data-backed claims to back up his big claim: that Ben Taub\u2019s model of lower-cost, patient-centered healthcare can yield better results with far less waste than other medical models in the US. \u201cWe don\u2019t need as much healthcare for it to be good,\u201d said Nuila. \u201cThe cost has gotten excessive, and that makes it so difficult to dole it out to everybody. There\u2019s so much excess and waste in private medicine and in America in general, and we need to think about how that effects everyone, and how it affects specific individuals.\u201d Although data is very much present in the book, the heart and soul of The People\u2019s Hospital are the patients themselves, consistent with Nuila\u2019s literary nonfiction aspirations along the lines of the gonzo journalists of the 60s and 70s, and, more contemporarily, New Yorker writers like Adrian Nicole LeBlanc and Rachel Aviv. \u201cI didn\u2019t come into this book wanting to make a grand statement about healthcare \u2013 I wanted to write patients\u2019 stories. I had to learn to hear the ideas in the patients\u2019 stories.\u201d Although we are introduced to many Ben Taub patients along the way, Nuila principally follows three individuals: Steven, a middle-aged restaurant manager who is shocked by a cancer diagnosis; Roxana, whose severe gangrene leaves her in need of amputations of all four limbs; and Ebonie, whose pregnancy forces her to make an impossible decision. \u201cThe people I encounter on a daily basis are vulnerable,\u201d said Nuila, \u201cand they come from a segment of society with a lot of presumptions about them. When I see that discrepancy, I want to talk about it.\u201d Now that he\u2019s in effect publicizing Ben Taub to the world, Nuila does have some fears over \u201cunintended consequences\u201d. Ironically, if The People\u2019s Hospital does too well, it might threaten the very care that Nuila so lovingly chronicles. \u201cSay that the book is successful and it drives lots more people to Ben Taub \u2013 we\u2019re already overloaded. I\u2019m worried that we\u2019ll get even more overloaded.\u201d Nuila also fears the backlash that might set in by challenging the status quo. He believes that, in part, Ben Taub has been so successful because it has flown under the radar of the American healthcare system. Making too big of a name for the hospital may attract the very kind of people that Nuila wants to keep away from the model of medicine that he so treasures. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the politics of publishing a book like this. Over the years the thought has been: \u2018let\u2019s do our work, but not broadcast it so that we can do our work.\u2019 There\u2019s something to that logic. I am worried that there will be people who will come out against it, and it will affect the ways we do things.\u201d The People\u2019s Hospital is out now"

            "date": "2023-03-20T20:12:52Z",
            "content": "Unconscious bias in the UK healthcare system is contributing to the stark racial disparity in maternal healthcare outcomes, a conference has heard. The Black Maternal Health Conference UK also heard that black women not being listened to by healthcare professionals was also a contributing factor. The conference, organised by The Motherhood Group, was arranged to highlight the racial inequality in maternal healthcare and the disparity in maternal mortality between white, ethnic minority and black women in the UK. Black women in the UK are four times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth than white women, according to a report published by MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK). Asian women are twice as likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth. According to the Office for National Statistics, the death rate of black babies before or during delivery sits at 6.9 stillbirths for every 1,000 births registered in 2021, compared with 3.6 for every 1,000 white babies. Sandra Igwe, who founded the NGO The Motherhood Group in 2016 after the traumatic birth of her daughter, told the PA Media that the event was an opportunity to \u201cbridge the community, stakeholders, professionals, [and] government\u201d, de-stigmatise mental health and bring about change to improve black maternal health. \u201cThere are so many stats \u2013 so why wouldn\u2019t we have a whole day\u2019s conference dedicated to addressing these, just scratching the surface of some of the stats?\u201d Charities and activists have been raising alarm bells about the dangerous consequences of unconscious bias in maternal healthcare for many years. Igwe co-chaired the Birthrights inquiry, a year-long investigation into racial injustice in the UK maternity services, which heard testimony from women, birthing people, healthcare professionals and lawyers and concluded that \u201csystemic racism exists in the UK and in public services\u201d. The report found that the root of many inequities in maternity outcomes and experiences of black and ethnic minority women stem from a lack of physical and psychological safety, being ignored and disbelieved, racism by caregivers, dehumanisation, structural barriers and workforce representation and culture. Speakers at the event in London also discussed the need to tackle the inaccessibility of services, lack of data and negative stereotypes about black women to improve black maternal health. Dr Natalie Darko, associate professor of health inequalities at the University of Leicester said stereotypes that cast black women as \u201cstrong\u201d or myths that black women don\u2019t feel pain affects the care they receive. Darko\u2019s three children were delivered in hospital corridors despite her raising concerns about delivering quickly to staff. \u201cI was trying to tell them the baby\u2019s coming and no one [was] listening. They already see you as difficult before you arrive,\u201d she said at the conference. Other speakers included Stacy Moore, a psychologist, who spoke about the stigmas black women face and how these affect their mental health. \u201cWe know that there are narratives that are said about us and said about us that impacts on how we are treated \u2026 [black women] don\u2019t really want help. They\u2019re really difficult to reach. \u201cActually, these impact on our mental health [and] sense of the world.\u201d All speakers at the event are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. \u201cWhen I have attended conferences that seek to address health inequalities it\u2019s usually that you don\u2019t see mothers, pregnant women from our communities there,\u201d she told PA Media. Access to comprehensive postpartum care was also highlighted as a barrier for black women accessing healthcare. \u201cBlack women are disproportionately negatively affected in their pregnancy and postnatal period. We are the least likely to have pain relief. \u201cWhy are we reporting that we\u2019re the least likely to feel like we\u2019ve been treated with kindness, care and respect? Why are we the most likely to have complications and die as a result of our pregnancy? Why are we the most likely to have postnatal depression but the least likely to have access to care or follow-up treatment?\u201d she said. England\u2019s chief midwifery officer Prof Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent sent a video message, which was played at the conference. In the video posted on The Motherhood Group\u2019s Instagram story, she said: \u201cWe have much to do to ensure equity for all.\u201d"

            "content": "The competition watchdog has warned that a proposed merger between two healthcare technology specialists would lead to higher costs and \u201cworse outcomes for the NHS and ultimately patients and UK taxpayers\u201d. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found the \u00a31.2bn deal for the US firm UnitedHealth to buy British rival EMIS could reduce competition to develop and supply digital and data analytics products to the health service. The NHS has embarked on a drive to digitise more of its systems and improve delivery of healthcare using sophisticated software. EMIS, which is headquartered in Leeds, is a large supplier of data management systems to the NHS, including the electronic patient record system used by the majority of NHS GPs in the UK. UnitedHealth owns Optum, which currently supplies software used by GPs when prescribing medicines as well as providing data analytics and advisory services used by the NHS to improve the provision of healthcare to patients. UnitedHealth announced the deal last June and the CMA began an initial investigation in January. Its investigation examined how the deal could affect competition to develop and supply analytics for the NHS. It found competition could be \u201csubstantially reduced\u201d around analytics as well as software that enables the safe and effective use of medicines. The CMA noted that Optum and its competitors rely on connections to data held by EMIS and links into its electronic patient records. It said the merger could limit these connections and undermine competitors, in turn reducing the options for the NHS, pushing up prices and lowering the quality of products. Sorcha O\u2019Carroll, a senior mergers director at the CMA, said: \u201cThe NHS and the millions of patients under its care depend on critical behind-the-scenes technology to ensure people are looked after and receive the treatment needed to get better. \u201cThis deal could see the NHS lose out on the benefits of competition, including innovation in these products and services and getting better value for money. UnitedHealth has the opportunity to address our concerns, otherwise it will progress to a more in-depth investigation.\u201d The companies have five working days to tackle the watchdog\u2019s concerns with legally binding proposals. The CMA would then have a further five days to consider whether it accepts these remedies or decides to refer the deal to a deeper phase 2 investigation. EMIS said it \u201cnow intends to engage with the CMA with the objective of agreeing suitable undertakings in lieu of a phase 2 reference\u201d. A spokesperson for Optum UK said: \u201cWe note the announcement today by the CMA following the conclusion of their initial review of our proposed acquisition of EMIS plc. With the full support of EMIS, we look forward to working with the CMA to agree upon suitable undertakings in lieu of reference to phase 2 and obtaining the clearance necessary to successfully close our acquisition of EMIS. A further update is expected to be provided on or around 31 March 2023.\u201d The merger comes against the backdrop of significant strains on the NHS and rolling strikes involving thousands of NHS workers including nurses, ambulance staff and physiotherapists. On Thursday, health unions hailed a victory after the government made a significant new pay offer aimed at ending NHS strikes in England."

            "date": "2023-03-07T09:00:32Z",
            "content": "\u201cJamaiCAN,\u201d reads a mural at one of the entrance gates to Bellevue, Jamaica\u2019s only psychiatric hospital. The name of the old powder-pink building near Kingston\u2019s upmarket waterfront is recognisable to any Jamaican and is shrouded in stigma. Built as a colonial lunatic asylum in the 19th century, it had been a tool of political repression, serving as prison for Rastafarian luminaries, forefathers of pan-Africanism, and other Jamaicans who challenged British racial oppression. After independence, media coverage of Bellevue was dominated by stories of poor treatment of patients and threadbare facilities. Staff and directors are today determined to transform the hospital into a modern treatment centre, building on decades of Jamaica\u2019s pioneering mental health policies. But one barrier keeps emerging: resources. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging to get focus on non-communicable diseases, and mental health is a fraction of the focus on non-communicable diseases,\u201d says Ishtar Govia, a member of Bellevue\u2019s board of directors and a researcher at the University of the West Indies. Up to 80% of people with mental disorders live in low and middle-income countries. And while mental health has received increased attention after the Covid pandemic, this has not been reflected in global funding for psychiatric health, says Rebecca Gribble from Georgetown University. According to her research, only 0.3% of global health development funding is dedicated solely to mental health projects. \u201cDonors like to put their money towards things that get quantifiable results,\u201d Gribble says. \u201cWith mental health that is more difficult to measure than with viruses, for example.\u201d However Jamaica, unlike many low and middle-income countries, has been at the forefront of mental health innovation over the past 50 years. After gaining independence in 1962, Jamaica became one of the first countries in the world to take decisive steps to deinstitutionalise its mental health system and integrate it into primary healthcare, despite limited resources. Today, up to 80% of Jamaicans with chronic mental illness are not hospitalised in Bellevue but receive treatment in local health centres or at home, thanks to mobile teams made up of psychiatrists and specially trained nurses. This approach provides a useful task-sharing model for countries looking to restructure their mental health services, says Andr\u00e9 van Rensburg from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, who has been researching deinstitionalisation in low and middle-income countries. The Jamaican model was introduced by the late Professor Frederick Hickling, who was the senior medical officer at Bellevue throughout the 1970s and 1980s \u2013 the highest psychiatric post in the country. Hickling was determined to move the country away from the custodial treatment style inherited from Britain, whereby mentally ill patients were detained in hospitals against their will \u2013 as is still the case in many low and middle-income countries. \u201cPost independence we had limited financial resources and a population traumatised by colonialism and the legacy of slavery,\u201d says Geoffrey Walcott from the Caribbean Institute of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, founded by Hickling. \u201cWe had to find novel ways to restructure our system.\u201d By allowing patients to receive healthcare without being committed to Bellevue, Hickling hoped to avoid the shame associated with mental illness while making treatment more accessible and cost-effective. Nearly half of Jamaicans live in rural areas, a costly journey away from Kingston\u2019s Bellevue, while fewer than 10% own a car. Hickling also sought to minimise involuntary treatment. \u201cWhat we found is that if patients are part of the decision-making process and accept treatment, they are more likely to recover and remain well over a long-term period,\u201d says Walcott, a former student of Hickling. \u201cThe biggest cause of relapse, especially for patients with schizophrenia, is non-compliance with treatment. When a patient is onboard with their medication, the relapse rate can be cut from 50% to 3%.\u201d Walcott recalls attending to a mentally ill man, armed with a knife and a machete, who had been apprehended by the police. \u201cWe opted not to take him involuntarily to a hospital and, while keeping his machete and his knife, he accepted treatment,\u201d Walcott says. After three weeks of treatment the man was lucid enough to cooperate with Bellevue\u2019s social work team. \u201cThe team was able to find his brother and within six months the man was reintegrated into his family while taking long-acting injectables to manage his condition. Today, deinstutionalisation is baked into our healthcare model.\u201d But while Jamaica has found innovative ways to deliver mental healthcare to its citizens, this has not meant the end of challenges for the island as resources remain scarce. \u201cI am grateful that my son is not wasting away in some hospital,\u201d says Yvonne McKenzie, whose son Andrew, 39, has bipolar disorder. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel supported by the system. I feel alone.\u201d For McKenzie, the mental healthcare model which centres on family and community cooperation means that, in the face of limited resources, the responsibility for managing illness can disproportionately fall on women. \u201cI have seen my son\u2019s psychiatrist more times than I can count, but I don\u2019t think Andrew\u2019s dad has spoken to him once,\u201d McKenzie says. \u201cAndrew was diagnosed in his late teens. Since then, I have been journeying with that diagnosis single-handedly. \u201cWhat I fear the most\u201d, she says, \u201cis what will happen to him after I am gone.\u201d Inge Petersen, a professor of public mental health at University of KwaZulu-Natal, says: \u201cTo help patients live in the community families need to be offered support. Often in low and middle-income countries the money does not follow the patient after they are discharged from hospital.\u201d In 2016, 95% of the mental health expenditure of the Jamaican health ministry was dedicated to Bellevue hospital, although the facility offered treatment to only 22% of Jamaica\u2019s mental health patients, according to an internal audit. The policy commitment to deinstitutionalisation is further undermined by 2020 WHO data, which shows that more than 61% of Jamaicans hospitalised for mental illness had been in hospital for more than five years. Finding a way to reintegrate long-term residents into the community, some of whom have lived at the hospital for more than 30 years, is now Bellevue\u2019s priority. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to rehome every single resident,\u201d Govia says. \u201cWe are working to create a transitional adult care facility.\u201d However, the hospital relies on NGO cooperation. \u201cWe may have the best of intentions\u201d, Govia says, \u201cbut we really need to get the buy-in from third-sector organisations to be able to realise them.\u201d \u201cCountries can have wonderful policies,\u201d says Petersen. \u201cBut what is really required is technical support for governments in low and middle-income countries to implement successful deinstitionalisation.\u201d Petersen would like to see a pool of global funding dedicated to implementing efficient mental health policies, similar to the resources available for treatment of HIV. Govia\u2019s long-term hopes for Bellevue include a world-class neurocognitive psychiatric facility. She also hopes that the hospital will become an example of successful transformation. \u201cI would love it if, in the next 50 years, Bellevue would provide insight into how to transform effective long-term care,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Jamaica, the resource constraints have led us to find creative and cross-sectoral solutions. Even if the fruits are not fully visible yet, the insight and experience Jamaican psychiatrists can provide are important.\u201d"

A Karen refugee who lives in Melbourne\u2019s west, Hei wasn\u2019t aware of the Transport Accident Commission or the fact that he might be able to claim assistance with any injuries through them, and he walked away from the site of the accident, in New South Wales, without going to hospital. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Over the following years, Hei experienced significant pain in both legs. He wasn\u2019t able to run and had to stop playing soccer, which he loved. When Utopia Refugee and Asylum Seeker Health opened in 2020, Hei made an appointment to have his hip condition investigated. Hei had in fact fractured both his hips and developed avascular necrosis at the top of his thigh bone \u2013 bone-tissue death that can lead to bone collapse, which occurs when blood supply to the bone is cut off. Hei was referred to the surgical department at Footscray hospital in May 2020 but was not seen by a surgeon until February last year. The orthopaedic surgeon who finally saw him classified his injury as a category three \u2013 the least urgent, for which you are expected to wait up to a year \u2013 and put him on the waiting list for surgery. Nearly 14 months later, Hei still does not have a date for his surgery. His physical condition is far from stable: it has declined to the extent that he can no longer walk and requires either two crutches or a wheelchair to move around. His mental health has plummeted. Since his first referral, he has also had to give up work and apply for jobseeker because he could no longer perform the lifting and moving required for the labouring jobs he had been doing. Hei told Guardian Australia he is now stuck spending most of his days lying down in bed. \u201cI can walk only around the house [and] I have to walk with a stick,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t drive any more.

But Hei\u2019s GP, Dr Lester Mascarenhas at Utopia, had already attempted to advocate for Hei with the hospital. Mascarenhas told Guardian Australia Hei\u2019s wait for surgery was \u201cunacceptably long\u201d and he was concerned Hei\u2019s need for surgery had been misclassified. A spokesperson for Western Health, which runs Footscray hospital, did not answer questions about Hei\u2019s specific situation. \u201cReferrals are received and triaged solely based on clinical need,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cPatients are also clinically assessed to ensure that they are medically ready for surgery which involves addressing any comorbid medical conditions in order to safely perform their surgery.\u201d The spokesperson did not answer questions about the current wait times for category-three hip-related surgeries at hospital, saying instead that they had \u201cperformed more than 8,600 planned surgeries in this financial year \u2013 well above our average \u2013 which has had a positive impact on addressing waiting times for planned surgery for patients following the pandemic.\u201d Mascarenhas said he believed Hei was suffering a great injustice. \u201cThe cost to his mental and physical wellbeing has been substantial,\u201d the GP said. \u201cHere is a young man who wants to work and contribute to society but has been held back for over three years due to our broken public healthcare system. Being told that there is no available date and he just has to keep waiting is simply not good enough.\u201d Pallas was approached for comment. A spokesperson for the Victorian government said: \u201cWe know it can be frustrating for people waiting for planned surgery and we empathise with people in this situation. We urge people to contact their GP or clinician should their condition deteriorate, so they can be reviewed and re-prioritised to a more urgent category if required.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-17T14:23:57Z",
            "content": "Newly released genetic data gathered from a live food market in Wuhan has linked Covid-19 with raccoon dogs, adding weight to the theory that infected animals sold at the site started the coronavirus pandemic, researchers involved in the work say. Swabs collected from stalls at the Huanan seafood market in the two months after it was shut down on 1 January 2020 were previously found to contain both Covid and human DNA. When the findings were published last year, Chinese researchers stated that the samples contained no animal DNA. That conclusion has now been overturned by an international team of scientists. Their analysis of gene sequences posted by the Chinese team to the scientific database Gisaid found that some of the Covid-positive samples were rich in DNA from raccoon dogs. Traces of DNA belonging to other mammals, including civets, were also present in Covid-positive samples. The discovery does not prove that raccoon dogs or other animals infected with Covid triggered the pandemic, but scientists presenting the work to an expert group at the World Health Organization on Tuesday believe it makes that more likely. \u201cThe data does point even further to a market origin,\u201d Prof Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, told Science magazine. Andersen attended a meeting of the WHO\u2019s scientific advisory group for the origins of novel pathogens and is working on the data. The recently uploaded gene sequences were spotted by Florence D\u00e9barre, an evolutionary biologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. She alerted Andersen and Prof Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, who have both written papers providing evidence of a market origin for the pandemic. What started the worst pandemic in a century has become the focus of intense \u2013 and often toxic \u2013 debate. One theory proposes that the virus emerged in wild animals and spread to humans through contamination at the market. Another suspects it escaped from the nearby Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers work on similar pathogens. The lab leak theory has gained headlines in recent weeks after an intelligence assessment from the US energy department and Republican-led hearings into the origins of the pandemic. Concrete evidence is lacking for either theory and may never be found. The latest genetic data does not prove raccoon dogs or other mammals were infected with Covid and spread it at the market. If the animals were infected, they may have contracted the virus from infected humans. But the findings do point to the possibility that the cause was an infected animal and, ultimately, the illegal wildlife trade. While scientists expect the debate to rumble on, there are questions over why the Chinese team did not release the genetic data earlier. One member of the team, George Gao, the former head of China\u2019s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told Science there was \u201cnothing new\u201d in the sequences. Why the data was later pulled from the Gisaid site is also not clear. D\u00e9barre said she was working on a report of the findings, which will be made public, and would answer questions only once that was done. Dr Jonathan Stoye, a virologist and senior group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said: \u201cThe finding of Sars-CoV-2 infected racoon dogs strengthens the plausibility that coronavirus-infected farmed animals were an important link in the series of events leading to the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cHowever, it does not disprove lab-leak theories: that would require the demonstration that such animals were infected prior to their arrival and display at the Huanan seafood market, something that may never be possible.\u201d Also on Friday, the WHO said the Covid-19 pandemic could settle down this year, posing a risk similar to that of flu. \u201cI think we\u2019re coming to that point where we can look at Covid-19 in the same way we look at seasonal influenza: a threat to health, a virus that will continue to kill, but a virus that is not disrupting our society,\u201d Michael Ryan, the WHO emergencies director, said, adding: \u201cI believe that that will come \u2026 this year.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-01T03:21:37Z",
            "content": "Christopher Wray, the FBI director, has weighed in on the debate over the origins of the Covid-19 virus, using an appearance on Fox News to endorse the theory that the virus potentially originated from a leak in a Chinese laboratory. \u201cThe FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan,\u201d Wray told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier, adding that the assessment was based on research the agency\u2019s analysts, including scientists, had conducted and that \u201cour work related to this continues\u201d. Wray\u2019s high-profile public comment highlights the divide within the US intelligence community about the origins of the pandemic, with some federal agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Energy, concluding that the Covid-19 virus probably originated from a lab leak in China, while others have concluded that it first spread from infected animals to humans. Wray\u2019s public endorsement of the lab leak theory runs counter to the conclusions of several prominent scientific studies, as well as the assessments of some other US intelligence agencies. Wray did not explain the evidence that had informed the FBI\u2019s conclusion. \u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of details I can share that aren\u2019t classified,\u201d he said. The Central Intelligence Agency and another prominent US federal agency still remain undecided about the origins of Covid-19, while the National Intelligence Council and four other agencies have concluded that the virus originated in animals, the Wall Street Journal reported this week. The energy department also concluded in a classified intelligence report that Covid-19 most likely resulted from a laboratory leak, but made this assessment with \u201clow confidence\u201d, while the FBI reached the same conclusion in 2021 with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d, the Wall Street Journal reported. \u201cWhile I believe the \u2018lab leak\u2019 theory a real possibility, I should point out that the [energy department\u2019s] assessment has \u2018low confidence\u2019 in that assessment and their assessment did not change the minds of any of the other agencies,\u201d Dr Filippa Lentzos, a reader in science and international security at King\u2019s College London, previously told the Guardian. Some scientists who have studied the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic have pushed back against the endorsement of the lab leak theory by US agencies. Scientists have also noted that, unlike peer-reviewed scientific studies, the US intelligence assessments being debated do not provide public transparency about how they reached their conclusions or the evidence they accumulated. \u201cTwo prior studies \u2013 one of which I co-authored \u2013 demonstrate clearly using multiple lines of evidence that the pandemic emerged into the human population at least twice over an approximately two-week period at or immediately upstream of Huanan market in association with the live animal trade,\u201d Angie Rasmussen, a professor with the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, told the Guardian this week. Wray\u2019s public comments come at a time of heightened tension between the US and China, after the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon sparked an international controversy, and was used by both Republicans and Democrats to criticize the leadership of the opposing party. China\u2019s Communist party government demonstrated its sensitivity about Covid\u2019s origin, with state-run media outlet the Global Times issuing a warning to Elon Musk not to risk his relationship with China, after he sent tweets discussing the Department of Energy report on the lab leak theory. CNBC reported that the Global Times used its social media pages to warn Musk not to \u201cbreak the pot\u201d. \u201c\u2018Breaking the pot after eating\u2019 is Chinese [for] biting the hand that feeds you\u201d,\u201d wrote CNBC correspondent Eunice Yoon. Tesla, Musk\u2019s company, has a huge factory building electric cars in Shanghai, both for the domestic Chinese market \u2013 the second-largest outlet for its vehicles \u2013 and for export to other countries.

            "title": "How did the Covid-19 pandemic begin? We need to investigate all credible hypotheses | Alison Young",
            "date": "2023-03-02T08:17:04Z",
            "content": "This week\u2019s revelation that a top US scientific agency has joined the FBI in leaning toward a lab accident in China as the most likely source of the Covid pandemic has once again surfaced the entrenched politics that have impeded the search for answers since day one. The new assessment is contained in a classified intelligence report, first disclosed by the Wall Street Journal and later confirmed by other media organizations. It is a small, yet important development in what has been the largely stalled search for how the SARS-CoV-2 virus \u2013 which was first detected in Wuhan, China \u2013 made its initial jump to infect humans before spreading around the world and killing millions. In addition on Tuesday, Christopher Wray, the FBI director, publicly discussed the bureau\u2019s longstanding view that the pandemic began with a lab accident. \u201cThe FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan,\u201d Wray told Fox News. \u201cHere you are talking about a potential leak from a Chinese government-controlled lab.\u201d According to the Journal\u2019s reporting, the US Department of Energy \u2013 which runs a national network of labs including some engaged in advanced biological research \u2013 has recently changed its assessment from being undecided on how the pandemic began to viewing a lab leak as the most likely source of the virus. The revised energy department assessment was made with \u201clow confidence\u201d and is reportedly based on some new, yet undisclosed, intelligence. The news has reignited the overheated public debate over the two prevailing hypotheses for the origin of Covid: did the virus emerge in the usual way with a natural jump from an infected animal to a person, perhaps at a market selling wildlife and other live animals in Wuhan? Or did a laboratory accident at a major coronavirus research lab in Wuhan \u2013 perhaps involving a worker who unknowingly became infected during an experiment or field work \u2013 spark the initial outbreak in a city located far away from where these kinds of coronaviruses have historically been found in wild bats? And it comes after a prominent group of US and international researchers have asserted for much of the past year that their studies of early Covid cases tied to a Wuhan seafood market establish that a natural zoonotic origin is the \u201conly plausible scenario\u201d for how the pandemic began and that \u201cthe lab leak theory is dead\u201d. One high-profile scientist this week even equated the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report about the new energy department assessment to \u201cspreading misinformation\u201d, and he criticized the news organization for writing \u201cthat awful title today when the virology community presents overwhelming evidence for natural origins \u2026 \u201d. But the case remains far from closed, as this week\u2019s news shows. While four unnamed US intelligence organizations and the National Intelligence Council lean toward a natural origin for the pandemic \u2013 they also have had \u201clow confidence\u201d in that assessment, according to a previously declassified intelligence report. One other intelligence organization, previously reported to have been the FBI, had assessed since 2021 \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that the initial human infection was the result of a laboratory-associated incident, involving activities ranging from experiments and animal handling to field work sampling for viruses in the wild. Until recently, the energy department was one of three government entities involved in intelligence matters that were undecided on the question, or in some cases had analysts viewing both hypotheses as \u201cequally likely\u201d. While the three entities were not publicly identified in the declassified report, one of the entities that remains undecided is the Central Intelligence Agency, the Wall Street Journal reported. The other has not been identified. Despite the differing views, the previously declassified report noted: \u201cAll agencies assess that two hypotheses are plausible: natural exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated incident.\u201d Since the beginning of the pandemic, the search for the origin of the virus has been distorted by politics on many fronts: from China\u2019s restrictions on the release of scientific information and refusal to cooperate with international investigations, to former president Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cChina virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d slurs, to the unfounded and continued branding of the lab-leak hypothesis as a fringe conspiracy theory by influential news organizations and high-profile scientists \u2013 including some with financial and research ties to the Wuhan labs at the center of the lab-leak hypothesis. Meanwhile in Congress, investigations and hearings that might be able to unearth information related to the origin of the pandemic \u2013 including from US funding agencies and those involved in academic scientific collaborations on potentially risky research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology \u2013 have overwhelmingly been conducted by Republicans, with little engagement from Democrats. It wasn\u2019t always this way. Concerns about laboratory accidents, risky research and the proliferation of high-containment laboratories used to be a fully bipartisan issue with Democrats and Republicans jointly participating in hearings, as they did in 2014 after a serious anthrax incident at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s labs. In those days, numerous members from both political parties came together to jointly request a series of reports by the US Government Accountability Office that have warned of the increased risk of a catastrophic accident from the worldwide proliferation of high-containment biological labs. A 2009 GAO report lists both the Democrat and Republican leaders from multiple congressional committees among the engaged requesters actively seeking answers about the safety of biological research facilities. All these years later, the bipartisan work that led to these earlier warnings has been lost in Washington\u2019s current divisive politics. \u201cWe have a moral obligation to determine to the best of our ability how Sars-2 emerged to cause the worst pandemic in over 100 years,\u201d Gerald Parker, a biosecurity expert at Texas A&amp;M University who also serves as chair of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, said on Twitter this week after the energy department assessment was revealed. \u201cIt is inexplicable why Congress and the administration have not established a bipartisan commission to investigate Covid origin with forensic rigor.\u201d Amid the growing news coverage of the new energy department assessment and the FBI director\u2019s public comments, there were possible signs of a political shift among Democrats in Congress. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday quoted Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer as saying: \u201cThe bottom line is we\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of this \u2026 the Biden administration is committed to it. They have all kinds of people looking at it, and we\u2019ll wait to see their results.\u201d As an investigative reporter, I have spent 15 years revealing shocking details about laboratory accidents for reports in major news organizations and my forthcoming book, Pandora\u2019s Gamble: Lab Leaks, Pandemics, and a World at Risk. What I have learned is that lax biosafety practices are far more common than the public and policymakers realize. And history shows that when accidents happen, labs often go to great efforts to keep their mistakes secret. Chinese authorities and top scientists at the Wuhan lab at the center of the controversy have long said they had never possessed the Covid virus prior to the beginning of the outbreak. But the Chinese government has refused the WHO\u2019s attempts to investigate the country\u2019s labs or do further in-depth studies of data that might shed light on how the pandemic began. Wray said in his interview with Fox News this week that he believes the Chinese government has been working to thwart investigations by US government agencies and their foreign partners into how the pandemic began. The bottom line: nobody yet knows how this pandemic began, and the public and the press should scrutinize those making bold statements claiming the case is solved in favor of either of these two credible theories. Covid swept the world, killing millions and devastating the lives of everyone on this planet \u2013 and it did it without regard for political persuasion. The world needs fewer hot takes and soundbites, and more actions that critically investigate all legitimate hypotheses \u2013 including the virus jumping from nature and the largely uninvestigated possibility of a lab accident origin. All of us need to know how this pandemic began. Getting to the truth might help us avoid calamity in the future. Alison Young is an investigative reporter in Washington, DC, and serves as the Curtis B Hurley Chair in Public Affairs Reporting for the Missouri School of Journalism at University of Missouri. Her book, Pandora\u2019s Gamble: Lab Leaks, Pandemics, and a World at Risk, will be released in April."

            "date": "2023-03-23T15:45:34Z",
            "content": "The Labour party in Leicester has been left reeling after 19 sitting councillors, the majority of them from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds, were deselected by the national committee. About 40% of Labour\u2019s councillors in the city have been told they cannot stand in May\u2019s election, after party figures decided to appoint an NEC board to choose Leicester\u2019s council candidates rather than leave the decision to local members. A number of deselected councillors have stated they will stand as independent candidates, while others are considering defecting to other parties. There is particular anger over the fact the majority of deselected councillors are from BAME backgrounds, in a city where the 2021 census revealed 59% of residents are from minority ethnic backgrounds. Fifteen of the party\u2019s 26 BAME councillors in Leicester have been told they cannot stand, a total of 58%, compared with four of the 22 white Labour councillors. Labour sources insist BAME representation and the number of women candidates will increase as a result of the decisions. Sharmen Rahman, a Labour councillor for the Stoneygate ward, is one of those who has been deselected and said candidates felt \u201cbetrayed and hurt\u201d by the decisions. \u201cI\u2019ve given up my time with my family to fight for Labour. It feels like despite all the time and energy we\u2019ve put into the party, we\u2019re disposable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is absolutely undemocratic. The grassroots of the party, none of them have had any say in this process.\u201d She added that the fact a large proportion of BAME councillors had been deselected would not be lost on voters, especially when they have been working to help communities heal from the violence that rocked east Leicester last year. \u201cThat message will be taken in by the communities, it\u2019s like they\u2019re saying BAME faces are interchangeable; as long as they replace a brown face with a brown face they\u2019ll get the BAME vote,\u201d she said. \u201cBut people look for a proven track record and commitment to the local community. \u201cIt has really sent shock waves through Leicester and especially because this is a majority minority city, to have minority elected representatives treated like this is just going to exacerbate misgivings towards the party.\u201d Labour has held overall control of Leicester city council since 2007, and currently holds 47 of the 54 seats, led by a directly elected mayor, a role held by Sir Peter Soulsby since it was created in 2011. All council seats and the role of mayor are up for election in May. Rita Patel, a councillor for the Rushey Mead ward, has announced she will stand as an independent candidate for mayor, with a view to scrapping the role if elected. Earlier this month she was suspended by the Labour party for six months for backing a motion to abolish the post, and she has since resigned from the party. \u201cI\u2019ve been a member of the party for decades, I\u2019ve always been about communities, social justice, equality, all of the things that I thought the Labour party stood for,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel as if the party is moving away from its own values, and hence I have to step outside as an independent to make my voice heard.\u201d She added: \u201cThey are alienating members of the Labour party. I\u2019ve had people say to me: if your party cannot take care of its own members, how the hell is it going to take care of the city, or the country when it gets in government? And I think that\u2019s a legitimate question to ask.\u201d Last week, Patrick Kitterick, a deselected councillor, announced he would be standing as a Green party candidate in May, telling LeicesterLive that \u201cthe Labour party has changed for the worse\u201d and \u201ccrushes any dissent or opinion\u201d. In an email to local party branches, the Labour party\u2019s regional director, Richard Oliver, said an NEC panel had been convened to select the city\u2019s candidates due to \u201cconcerns about the process\u201d. The Labour party declined to comment."

            "date": "2023-03-02T14:35:03Z",
            "content": "Teaching unions have reacted with fury to leaked texts sent by the former education secretary Gavin Williamson at the height of the Covid pandemic, saying they reveal the UK government\u2019s \u201csecret contempt for teachers\u201d. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the exchange between Williamson and the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, exposed \u201cthe chaos and duplicity at the heart of government\u201d. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it showed \u201can appalling lack of respect for teachers\u201d at a time of national emergency when unions were trying to engage constructively with government. The messages, leaked to the Telegraph, appear to show Williamson accusing teachers of looking for an \u201cexcuse\u201d not to teach during the early stages of the Covid pandemic. In another WhatsApp exchange in October 2020, after Williamson announced a delay to exams for the following year, Hancock praised him for his \u201ccracking announcement\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\u201d Williamson replied: \u201cI know they really really do just hate work.\u201d The former education secretary faced heavy criticism for his handling of the Covid crisis in schools, in particular the 2020 exams fiasco and a number of embarrassing U-turns. \u201cIt was an absolute shambles and the two individuals involved in these snide insults were at the heart of that shambles,\u201d said Barton. \u201cWe constantly had to sense-check and disentangle the reams of confused guidance they issued, and were often wrongfooted by bizarre policy decisions which were then followed by an inevitable U-turn.\u201d The timing of this latest leak will not be helpful to the Department for Education. It came to light as members of the National Education Union (NEU) in London and the south of England prepared to strike in the latest day of industrial action in teachers\u2019 long-running dispute with the government. Commenting on the lockdown messages, Whitehouse said: \u201cHow can any trust develop when the secret contempt for teachers and the teaching profession is laid bare like this? We must not forget Covid was rampant in schools and the whole school community was managing life-threatening risk in the most difficult of circumstances.\u201d Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the NEU, defended the role of teachers and education staff during the pandemic, saying they worked tirelessly, listening to the science and acting to protect the school community when the government was doing neither. \u201cGovernment dragged their feet over providing laptops for children most in need, while it took the footballer Marcus Rashford to shame them into free school meals provision during the school holidays. Evidence that could have curbed the impact of Covid, resulting in wider lockdowns, was ignored, and they gave consistently late information to headteachers on the latest measures being imposed by government on schools and colleges. It was nothing short of a shambles,\u201d she said. \u201cThe education secretary was clearly out of his depth and, we now hear, contemptuous of unions and teachers. Given the current dispute with the Department for Education over teacher pay, we sincerely hope Gillian Keegan does not share this attitude and gets around the table to discuss a resolution to the pay dispute.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the leaked comments were \u201ca kick in the teeth\u201d for teachers who stretched every sinew for children during the pandemic. \u201cThey add insult to injury at a time when fewer people are joining the profession, and when teachers are leaving classrooms in their droves. The Conservatives have shown us today exactly how much they value our teachers.\u201d The Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said: \u201cGavin Williamson was a disgraceful education secretary and these comments solidify his place in history as one of the worst ministers ever to grace government.\u201d The schools minister, Nick Gibb, attempted to defend Williamson. He told LBC: \u201cGavin\u2019s own wife is a primary school teacher \u2013 I\u2019ve worked with Gavin for two years; I know he holds teachers in the highest regard. We all in government hold teachers in the highest regard, both during the pandemic and in normal times as well. People say things in the heat of the moment on WhatsApp that they don\u2019t really believe.\u201d On unions, he said: \u201cI think they work hard for their members. I wish they were with us now negotiating pay and all the other issues that we want to talk about with the teacher unions, so we wouldn\u2019t be having the strike that\u2019s happening in London and the south-east today.\u201d In a statement on Wednesday, Williamson said: \u201cFurther to reports in the Telegraph and other outlets, I wish to clarify that these messages were about some unions and not teachers. As demonstrated in the exchange, I was responding regarding unions. \u201cI have the utmost respect for teachers who work tirelessly to support students. During the pandemic, teachers went above and beyond during very challenging times and very much continue to do so.\u201d Speaking after the publication of the leaked WhatsApp messages, the former children\u2019s commissioner for England Anne Longfield, who held that post during the pandemic, said children were not prioritised as they should have been. \u201cI spent an awful lot of time putting forward the kind of policies that needed to be thought about if children were going to get the support they needed during this very, very uncertain time for them,\u201d she told Sky News. Most children were out of school for six months, and since then anxiety has increased and mental health has \u201cplummeted\u201d, she said. \u201cSo children are living with the impact of what happened during that time right now, today. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me that children were not given the priority they should have been. There was not enough discussion about the impact of decisions on children\u2019s wellbeing and as a consequence it feels they were quite overlooked often, in terms of the big decisions that were made.\u201d"

            "title": "To Battersea Park by Philip Hensher review \u2013 a pandemic masterclass",
            "date": "2023-03-23T07:30:02Z",
            "content": "Three years on, it remains difficult to think coherently about Covid-19 and the many ways it has changed us. A global pandemic, abstract and vast, rendered painfully real in the most intimate of ways; in freedoms curtailed, in relationships lost, in millions of bodies broken or buried. How do we tell the story of something we can\u2019t see? Is there a legible thread that connects a set of experiences that differ so radically along lines of wealth, geography, health, politics, risk appetite and plain old dumb luck? These interpretative challenges are at the heart of To Battersea Park, the surefooted and emotionally generous new novel by Philip Hensher. At first glance, it might seem late in the day to be adding to the already swollen ranks of lockdown novels, but Hensher\u2019s treatment of the topic is both original and affecting. To Battersea Park is primarily concerned with how the mechanisms of storytelling might enable us to bear meaningful witness to the experience of the pandemic. The novel consists of four sections, each named after a different narratological convention: The Iterative Mood, Free Indirect Style, The Hero Undertakes a Journey, and Entrelacement. Collectively, these techniques are used to present a fluid portrait of south London lives lived under varying degrees of pandemic-induced duress; a marriage straining at the seams, ailing parents, rapidly deteriorating mental health. There\u2019s a confidence and playfulness to Hensher\u2019s use of organising principles, with each convention interrogated via a number of periodic and knowing authorial intrusions. It\u2019s a high-wire act, but ultimately a success, showcasing a philosophical humility. Hensher seems to face the task of telling an essentially untellable story by asking the reader: will this tool do the job? No? Well, what about this one? Still no use? \u2026 In that case, I\u2019ll keep trying. Rather than consisting of a unified plot, the four parts of the novel are loosely bound by shared geography and overlapping chronology. We see new habits forming in response to lockdown restrictions, slowly unravelling domestic tragedies, flowering violence, and acts of kindness in the face of vulnerability and failing health. There\u2019s a rare and impressive level of control as Hensher handles this kaleidoscopic approach, moving deftly from the mundane rhythms of family life to the looming horrors of system collapse and back again. The overall effect is that of a high-end camera with a cracked lens; the picture may look fractured, but the zoom is still in good working order. The novel is perhaps at its strongest when it is dealing explicitly with the ways in which the pandemic altered our relationship to attention and the act of noticing. As Hensher\u2019s characters feel the pace of their lives begin to slow, we see their responses to their immediate environment begin to sharpen and brighten. A curiosity develops; a desire to understand the natural and the built world around them. For those of us lucky enough to have felt something of that untethering in the early days of lockdown, it was a heady glimpse of a life lived at a different, less frantic tempo. Hensher captures this feeling brilliantly, lending the process a mythic, prelapsarian quality. To Battersea Park is also excellent on the contingencies of illness and infection. The reader gets the sense of a complex tissue of cause and effect, connecting disparate bodies across space and time. Hensher handles this with some skill, often in the form of asides that are only rendered tragic by the reader\u2019s knowledge of what is to come. A journalist\u2019s professional pride feels like \u201cthe first itches of a fever tingling at his mouth\u201d; later, the seemingly inconsequential contact of skin on surface is transformed into something heavy and ominous. For the most part, the novel exhibits an admirable seriousness about the inner world of its characters, and is also particularly astute at the unfashionable art of observing the small differences in manner, speech and appearance that render people distinct individuals rather than representative types. This makes its occasional lapses into broad brushstrokes all the more jarring. The portrait of a leftwing ideologue unable to see the glory of New Labour and increasingly attracted to reactionary populism, for example, sticks out as a cheap shot in a novel that is otherwise impressively nuanced. It\u2019s hard to overstate how difficult writing a good novel about the pandemic must be. Who wants to hear all over again about how we took to baking bread and buying houseplants, about how strange some of the rules seem in retrospect, how unsatisfying it was to have our professional and personal connections mediated by Zoom? To Battersea Park is a serious achievement precisely because it takes this unpromising raw material \u2013 defined by repetition, limit and stasis \u2013 and makes something powerful and propulsive from it. It does so, ultimately, by being less a book about the pandemic and more a book about the stories we tell ourselves about the pandemic; billions of stories, fragile, partial, and essential, each one a small but vital act of reclamation and remembrance. \u2022 To Battersea Park by Philip Hensher is published by 4th Estate (\u00a316.99).

            "content": "Your report (Minorities in UK no longer at much higher risk of dying from Covid, 22 February) suggesting that the Office for National Statistics\u2019 latest release of Covid-19 mortality figures shows rates of deaths for ethnic minorities are now much lower than earlier in the pandemic will bring cold comfort to many who lost friends and family members. But more disappointing is allowing a repetition that it is socioeconomic factors that drove the disproportionate death rates among black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, when it is increasingly clear that it was failure to prepare that is key. Government policy was to ask people to self-isolate in their homes, even though decades\u2019 worth of evidence shows that these communities are much more likely to live in overcrowded homes. Government policy was to ask people to work from home, even though we knew Black, Asian and minority ethnic people were more likely to work in jobs where this was not possible. The government asked people to wash their hands and avoid contact, even though these communities were more likely to be working in health, care and transport, coming into contact with people. At the same time, the government failed to heed the calls for the provision of PPE. This matters because the Covid-19 inquiry will soon be examining preparedness, but has chosen not to have specific focus on racial inequality. It seems we do not want to learn the lessons from the pandemic. Jabeer Butt CEO, Race Equality Foundation"

            "title": "Cocaine smuggling and production at record high since pandemic retreat",
            "date": "2023-03-16T06:00:21Z",
            "content": "South American drug cartels have capitalised on the retreat of the Covid-19 pandemic to produce and smuggle record amounts of cocaine around the world. Production of coca, the drug\u2019s base ingredient, spiked 35% in 2020-21, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, according to a new report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The increase in coca production is the highest since 2016 and has been accompanied by the continued trend of South American cartels improving the efficiency of their jungle labs where they can extract more of the illicit white powder from the green coca leaves. \u201cThe pandemic was a bit of a blip for the expansion of cocaine production, but now it has rebounded and is even higher than what it was before,\u201d said Antoine Vella, a UNODC researcher working on the report. Cartels were forced to stockpile mass quantities of cocaine early in the pandemic when flights were suddenly grounded and road traffic heavily policed, but they quickly devised new ways of operating. Major drug busts revealed cocaine to be cleverly concealed inside avocados, face masks and even crates full of squid on cargo ships. In the most sophisticated of cases the drug was chemically broken down, mixed into liquids, waxes and fabrics so it could not be seen, and then extracted and transformed back into a powder at its destination. Despite record cocaine seizures of nearly 2,000 tons in 2021, anti-narcotics efforts have only slowed down the growth of cocaine smuggling as it continues to meet the rapacious global demand for the drug. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that there is no limit to the ingenuity of traffickers,\u201d Vella said. Cartels are also devising new routes to avoid the watchful eye of anti-narcotics agents and are looking to expand into nascent but rapidly growing markets such as Asia and Africa, the report says. The amount of cocaine flowing through North Sea ports such as Antwerp, Rotterdam and Hamburg now eclipses those in Spain and Portugal, historically the drug\u2019s gateway into western Europe. Ports in west and central Africa are also increasingly favoured hubs to ferry cocaine to Europe while more cocaine is passing through South Africa on its way to riskier, more remote destinations, such as Australia. Demand for cocaine is currently concentrated in the Americas and Western and Central Europe. The regions are home to one-fifth of the world\u2019s population and three-quarters of its cocaine consumers. Countries such as Brazil \u2013 South America\u2019s largest cocaine consumer \u2013 are seeing a spike in overdoses, however, suggesting they are seeing rapidly growing supply and consumption. \u201cI think we need to shift away from thinking of cocaine as being a European/North American problem because it\u2019s also very much a South American problem,\u201d Vella says. The growing global demand for production has been met by a surge in coca cultivation in Bolivia, Peru and, particularly, Colombia. The amount of land used for Colombian coca cultivation increased by more than 40% in 2021, reaching 204,000 hectares. Cartels have also become more efficient at extracting cocaine from the little green shrubs. The demobilisation of Colombia\u2019s largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), has been followed by the emergence of new criminal groups who operate in a more competitive and efficient cocaine market, the UNODC says. Farc once controlled vast swaths of the country in which it monopolised the drug market but most of the group\u2019s guerrillas laid down their weapons in 2016 as part of a landmark peace deal. Crop substitution efforts have failed and the Farc\u2019s power vacuum was quickly filled by myriad smaller groups \u2013 including a growing number working with Mexican cartels. They operate in a freer market where better prices can be offered than the ones during the Farc monopoly, Vella says. The Farc demobilisation has also made it safer for other crime factions and rebel groups to focus on their business matters, said Jorge Restrepo, director of the Bogot\u00e1-based Resource Center for Conflict Analysis (Cerac). \u201cThe group with the largest capacity to exert violence suddenly disappeared \u2013 and that in itself is an incentive for the production of coca and cocaine,\u201d Restrepo says."

            "date": "2023-03-01T05:01:23Z",
            "content": "A new study has found that the pandemic has severely affected people\u2019s mental health and relationships all over the world, particularly for young adults. The third annual mental state of the world report (MSW) commissioned by Sapien Labs, a non-profit research organization, conducted a global survey to better understand the state of mental health. The research compiled responses from over 400,000 participants across 64 countries, asking respondents about their family relationships, friendships and overall mental wellbeing. The survey found that there has been little recovery in declining mental health during the pandemic, which the group measures by a score called \u201cmental health quotient\u201d. It had found that average score had declined by 33 points \u2013 on a 300-point scale \u2013 over the past two years and still showed no signs of recovery, remaining at the same level as 2021. The survey also found that young adults were more likely to have mental health challenges compared with previous generations. People aged 18 to 24 also had a lower \u201csocial self\u201d, a metric that measures how an individual perceives themselves and the ability to maintain meaningful relationships. They were also three times more likely not to get along with family members, reporting higher rates of family instability and conflict. Young adults were also more likely not to have close friends, compared with those 75 and older, reported the survey. \u201cThis pattern, apparent even prior to the pandemic, represents a sharp reversal of patterns documented prior to 2010, indicating a dramatic decline in mental wellbeing with each younger generation rather than an increase in wellbeing as we age,\u201d noted the study. Family relationships are diminishing worldwide, according to the research, which could hurt a person\u2019s mental health. People with no close friendships and poor familial relationships are 10 times more likely to experience poor mental health, the research found. Tara Thiagarajan, founder and chief scientist at Sapien Labs, said in a statement: \u201cThese data suggest that we have not fully appreciated the profoundly relational nature of the human psyche. As much as we may believe that we are each independent, our wellbeing is profoundly relational in nature.\u201d Tanzania, Panama, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela are countries with the highest rankings of mental health, whereas Britain, Ireland, Australia, South Africa and Brazil all have lower mental health rankings."

            "content": "I wholeheartedly agree with Devi Sridhar\u2019s concern about dwindling childhood protection from infectious diseases (In a sceptical era, understand this: vaccines do work - and our children need them, 27 March). Coming from a small hamlet near Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, I developed measles, mumps, then whooping cough in rapid succession on starting primary school. I spent most of my first four months off school. I was fortunate to join a long queue and receive my first polio vaccine. In 1966, when I was a medical student, my father was appointed to manage the only British Polio Fellowship residential home in the country. I was horrified to find young people there with severe paralysis from the waist down, wholly dependent on carers. There were older residents too, many with grossly swollen ankles. They shared ghastly stories of life in an iron lung during their initial recovery and the anger of their plight now. In 1984, working as a locum GP at a military hospital in Jeddah, I had to admit a young boy with profound paralytic polio. I dealt with him with tears in my eyes, knowing full well what his future held. Visiting the ancient Greek site of Mystras, I learned that the duration of life then was thought to be up to 35 years. Now well into my 70s, I have been so lucky to have lived in the age of vaccination that has done so much to keep me and my fellow baby boomers fit and active for so long, and which continues to do so. Bernard Bedford Brockenhurst, Hampshire \u2022 Devi Sridhar highlights the abuse against doctors who supported vaccination during the Covid-19 pandemic. I received daily death threats in 2022. Many other scientists were threatened, along with their families. The anti-vaccination movement could continue to grow if left unchecked. Three policy changes could help reverse this. First, qualified healthcare professionals who publicly oppose vaccinations that have proven clinical benefits need to be investigated by the General Medical Council. Second, threats against doctors and scientists need to be stopped by stricter rules on social media, with legal action if necessary. Third, school entry requirements on vaccination need to be made more stringent. Vaccinating children and adolescents leads to more benefits than risks. Schools and universities should require proof of a range of approved vaccinations for entry, with medical explanations needed for students who are not fully vaccinated. One in eight children in the UK are not fully vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. And one in 12 are not vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio. Measles outbreaks have been reported in countries with poor vaccine coverage. Vaccination cannot be mandated, but stricter entry requirements for schools and universities, supported by clear information on the benefits, could help reverse the damaging effects of the anti-vaccination movement. Dr Andrew Hill London \u2022 Prof Sridhar has illuminated for me why I can vividly recall the push for polio vaccination \u2013 and the fear of the disease \u2013 when I was a child in the early 60s. The burning issue today is how to combat the tide of misinformation and propaganda masquerading as news and peddled by special interest groups. While respecting the right of freedom of speech, we must have accountability in the media. Andrew Scaife York \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "date": "2023-03-06T14:43:37Z",
            "content": "GB News breached rules on potentially harmful content when the presenter Mark Steyn used official health data to draw misleading conclusions about the Covid-19 booster that \u201cmaterially misled\u201d the audience, the media regulator has found. Ofcom said Steyn used UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data in a broadcast on 21 April last year to wrongly claim the figures provided evidence that a third booster was causing higher infection, hospitalisation and deaths. The investigation was launched in July 2022 after the watchdog received four complaints from viewers who said the presenter had made \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cfatally flawed conclusions\u201d. Steyn was previously one of the TV channel\u2019s leading presenters before resigning last month after it demanded he personally pay the fines issued if found in breach of the broadcasting code. Ofcom said Steyn\u2019s comparison of similar-sized groups who had and had not received the third Covid vaccine was \u201cmisleading\u201d for only drawing one conclusion from the comparison and not taking into account the differences in age or health of the individuals in the two groups. It said the programme failed to reflect the official UKHSA reports that said conclusions surrounding vaccine efficacy should not be drawn from raw data. \u201cOverall, we concluded that this factual programme may have resulted in viewers making important decisions about their health, and it was therefore potentially harmful and materially misleading,\u201d the regulator said of the breach. The independent factchecking website Full Fact previously said Steyn\u2019s claim was based \u201con an inaccurate reading of a vaccine surveillance report, which specifically includes a caveat warning that the data can\u2019t be used to determine vaccine effectiveness\u201d. Responding to the regulator\u2019s findings on Monday, the head of policy at Full Fact, Glen Tarman, said GB News\u2019s viewers deserved information they could trust. \u201cFull Fact has repeatedly contacted GB News about unsubstantiated or false claims made on their programmes without receiving a response. Every broadcaster should be prepared to get their facts right, back up what they say with evidence, and correct the record when they get things wrong,\u201d said Tarman. \u201cWe hope GB News will correct the record in light of Ofcom\u2019s findings today.\u201d UK broadcasting law requires factual programmes or portrayals of factual matters must not mislead the audience. GB News faces a second formal investigation regarding its coverage of the coronavirus vaccine after the author Naomi Wolf claimed women were being harmed by Covid vaccines as part of an effort to \u201cto destroy British civil society\u201d, again on the Mark Steyn show. Steyn, who has been off air since last year after two heart attacks, previously told fans on his personal website that he used to call GB News\u2019s in-house compliance officer \u201cOfcom\u2019s bitch\u201d when they argued about what he was allowed to say on air. The channel has regularly provided a platform to individuals critical of the scientific response to Covid and has attracted a steady stream of Ofcom complaints about its output, although few have progressed to the stage of formal investigations. The right-leaning TV channel, now found in breach of the broadcasting code for the first time, started 2023 with an attempt to make its operation more \u201cdisciplined\u201d. Alan McCormick, the GB News chair, said all staff would be put on mandatory Ofcom training to avoid repeatedly falling foul of the regulator\u2019s broadcasting code. A spokesperson for the channel said: \u201cWe are disappointed by Ofcom\u2019s finding. Our role in media is to ask tough questions, point out inconsistencies in government policy, and hold public bodies to account when the facts justify it. \u201cMark Steyn\u2019s programme did exactly that. We support his right to challenge the status quo by examining the small but evident risks of Covid vaccines.\u201d They added: \u201cHe drew a reasonable conclusion from the facts. However, he drew only one conclusion. \u201cWe accept that the data offered several valid interpretations, and he should have made this clear. Had he done so, the story would have remained within the wide freedoms that Ofcom\u2019s broadcast code allows.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 March 2023 to clarify that Ofcom found that GB News had breached rules on potentially harmful content, not impartiality as an earlier version said."

            "date": "2023-03-30T01:07:13Z",
            "content": "Only high-risk groups should receive ongoing Covid-19 booster doses because strong population-level immunity means ongoing boosting of the general population offers little impact, the latest update from the World Health Organization (WHO) says. The vaccination guide, from WHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation, says each country needs to take into account its own epidemiological situation, stressing that its recommendations are for short-to-medium term planning and subject to change. The guide is largely in line with recommendations already in place in Australia, which prioritises high-risk groups. The \u201chigh-priority\u201d group for boosters identified by WHO includes older adults; younger adults with significant co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease; people, including children six months and older, with immunocompromising conditions such as HIV and transplant recipients; pregnant people; and frontline health workers. This high-priority group should get a booster six to 12 months after their last dose, with the timeframe depending on factors such as age and immunocompromising conditions, the guide says. Healthy adults \u2013 usually considered those under the age of 50-60 \u2013 and children and adolescents with co-morbidities are considered \u201cmedium priority\u201d. The guide recommends one booster dose for this group. While \u201cadditional boosters are safe for this group\u201d, they should not be routinely recommended given the comparatively low public health returns, WHO said. The lowest-priority group is healthy children and adolescents aged six months to 17 years. While primary and booster doses are safe and effective in children and adolescents, the public health impact of vaccinating them is comparatively much lower than the benefits of vaccines to protect them against diseases such as measles. Some countries have seen concerning disruptions to childhood vaccination programs and a reduction in vaccine rates due to the pandemic, though rates have remained high in Australia. Prof Julie Leask, a social scientist specialising in immunisation, is currently at a vaccination science meeting in Seoul where she said \u201cwe are hearing about the deeply concerning drop in childhood vaccination coverage brought about by the Covid pandemic\u201d. \u201cLow- and middle-income countries deployed their stretched workforces to delivering Covid vaccines at a cost to childhood vaccination programs,\u201d said Leask, who is with the University of Sydney. She said globally, those children who had received zero doses of their childhood vaccination schedule in 2021 rose to 18%, or 18.2 million children. \u201cNow with high levels of Covid immunity and a clearer picture of who is most at risk \u2013 the older and those with risk factors \u2013 many countries are choosing to re-focus. They are not dropping Covid vaccination altogether, but their workforces are depleted and budgets are stretched, so they need to prioritise according to greatest need. \u201cWe may eventually land on a more stable vaccine booster recommendation in Australia as evidence on longevity of protection against severe disease evolves.\u201d On Thursday, Australia\u2019s health minister, Mark Butler, announced further measures to protect those most at risk. From 1 April, more than 160,000 people aged 60 to 69 will have free access to the antiviral treatment Paxlovid under expanded eligibility guidelines. The change means people in this age group with only one risk factor for severe illness \u2013 instead of two \u2013 will get access to the drug, which helps prevent progression to severe illness. The WHO guide also states \u201cthough low overall, the burden of severe Covid-19 in infants under six months is still higher than in children aged six months to five years\u201d. \u201cVaccinating pregnant persons \u2013 including with an additional dose if more than six months have passed since the last dose \u2013 protects both them and the foetus, while helping to reduce the likelihood of hospitalisation of infants for Covid-19.\u201d Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) guidelines, last updated on 8 February, already emphasise protecting vulnerable people, with increases in protection against severe illness following a booster dose most beneficial for people at higher risk of severe illness. The only group Atagi recommends receive a booster \u2013 regardless of the number of prior doses received \u2013 are all adults aged 65 years and over, and adults aged 18-64 years who have medical co-morbidities that increase their risk of severe Covid. Boosters should be given six months after the last vaccine dose or confirmed Covid-19 infection. Atagi states adults age 18-to-64 with no risk factors for severe Covid, and children and adolescents aged five-to-17 who have medical co-morbidities or disability with significant health needs may \u201cconsider\u201d getting a booster. This is regardless of the number of prior doses received. The advice does not go so far as to routinely recommend a booster for these groups, and states those in these groups need to undergo a risk-benefit assessment with their immunisation provider. A booster dose is not recommended by Atagi for children and adolescents aged under the age of 18 who do not have any risk factors. The chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, Prof Catherine Bennett, said the WHO advice is \u201cvery much in line with Atagi\u201d. \u201cNot recommending boosters for younger adults now is not recognition that they don\u2019t work or are too risky as some try to argue, it\u2019s showing that they have worked,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have very high rates of the primary course being taken up, allowing younger populations to transition to hybrid immunity without the more severe disease or even deaths seen pre-vaccination in countries overseas with widespread community transmission.\u201d More than 1 million Australians have received a booster so far this year, and around seven in 10 of those are aged 60 and over, Butler said. From 31 March the government will update its reporting of vaccine uptake to report data on how many adults have received a 2023 booster dose; how many have received a dose in the past six months; how many have received one more than six months ago, and how many are completely unvaccinated."

            "content": "Vulnerable people in the UK are to be offered another Covid booster jab this spring, public health bodies have said, as the virus continues to circulate at high levels. According to the latest data from Office for National Statistics, about one in 45 people in England, Scotland and Wales had Covid in the week ending 21 February, with the figure at one in 90 for Northern Ireland. In England, infection levels are rising, including in people aged 70 and over. Now the UK\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has announced plans for a spring booster campaign, with Covid jabs set to be offered to people aged five years and over who are immunosuppressed as well as adults 75 years and over, and older adults living in care homes. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), urged those offered the jab to accept it. \u201cCovid-19 is still circulating widely, and we have recently seen increases in older people being hospitalised,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important those at highest risk of severe illness do not become complacent and I would encourage everyone who is eligible to come forward once the booster programme starts.\u201d The announcement comes a month after the NHS ended the offer of a Covid booster jab to healthy people aged 16 to 49. While initial Covid vaccinations are still available for this group, the JCVI has advised that they too, should be withdrawn in 2023 in favour of a more targeted approach. The UKHSA said that there will be four vaccines available for use in the spring booster campaign including the Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent jab and the Moderna bivalent, both of which are mRNA vaccines that target two different coronavirus variants, as well as the protein-based Sanofi/GSK vaccine that targets the Beta variant, and the Novavax jab \u2013 a protein-based vaccine that targets the original 2020 strain of Covid. The agency said the last is only to be used when alternative jabs are not considered clinically suitable. UKHSA said children under 12 years of age who are eligible for a spring booster will be offered a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Prof Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI\u2019s Covid-19 Committee, said: \u201cThe spring booster programme provides an opportunity for those who are at highest risk of severe illness to keep their immunity topped up. \u201cThis year\u2019s spring programme will bridge the gap to the planned booster programme in the autumn, enabling those who are most vulnerable to be well protected throughout the summer,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2023-03-13T16:00:21Z",
            "content": "Sleeping for less than six hours per night reduces the immune response to vaccination, particularly in younger men, data suggests. The reduction is comparable to the waning of Covid-19 antibodies two months after vaccination. People\u2019s immune response to vaccination is known to vary because of factors such as age, biological sex and general health. Previous studies have also suggested that sleep duration might play a role \u2013 although the results of such investigations have been mixed. To summarise the current state of understanding, Dr Karine Spiegel, of the French National Institute of Health and Medicine, in Lyon, and her colleagues combined and reanalysed the results of seven studies that involved vaccinating people against influenza and hepatitis A and B, which are all caused by viruses. They compared the antibody responses of individuals who slept for seven to nine hours per night (the recommended level for healthy adults) and those who slept for less than six hours per night. The research, published in Current Biology, found strong evidence that sleeping for less than six hours reduces the immune response to vaccination in men \u2013 although the effect was more variable in women, probably due to fluctuating sex hormone levels. \u201cWe know from immunology studies that sex hormones influence the immune system,\u201d said Spiegel. \u201cIn women, immunity is influenced by the state of the menstrual cycle, the use of contraceptives, and [whether they have gone through menopause], but unfortunately, none of the studies that we summarised had any data about sex hormone levels.\u201d When both sexes were taken into account, the effect of short sleep was comparable to the waning of the antibody response to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine after two months. The researchers said: \u201cIf similar to the influenza and hepatitis vaccines \u2026 then insufficient sleep around the time of Covid-19 vaccination may reduce antibody titers in the same range as the waning of the response to the most commonly administered vaccine over two months.\u201d They also found that the immunological impact of insufficient sleep was greater for adults aged 18 to 60, compared with older adults. \u201cGood sleep not only amplifies but may also extend the duration of protection of the vaccine,\u201d said the senior study author Eve Van Cauter, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago. She said she hoped this knowledge might enable people to boost their responses by prioritising sleep before vaccination appointments. \u201cWhen you see the variability in protection provided by the Covid-19 vaccines \u2013 people who have pre-existing conditions are less protected, men are less protected than women, and obese people are less protected than people who don\u2019t have obesity,\u201d Van Cauter said. \u201cThose are all factors that an individual person has no control over, but you can modify your sleep.\u201d Spiegel emphasised, however, that more research was needed to quantify exactly how much sleep was needed \u2013 and to unpick the role of sex hormones in vaccination response \u2013 before firm guidance could be issued."

            "content": "A new study has found that the pandemic has severely affected people\u2019s mental health and relationships all over the world, particularly for young adults. The third annual mental state of the world report (MSW) commissioned by Sapien Labs, a non-profit research organization, conducted a global survey to better understand the state of mental health. The research compiled responses from over 400,000 participants across 64 countries, asking respondents about their family relationships, friendships and overall mental wellbeing. The survey found that there has been little recovery in declining mental health during the pandemic, which the group measures by a score called \u201cmental health quotient\u201d. It had found that average score had declined by 33 points \u2013 on a 300-point scale \u2013 over the past two years and still showed no signs of recovery, remaining at the same level as 2021. The survey also found that young adults were more likely to have mental health challenges compared with previous generations. People aged 18 to 24 also had a lower \u201csocial self\u201d, a metric that measures how an individual perceives themselves and the ability to maintain meaningful relationships. They were also three times more likely not to get along with family members, reporting higher rates of family instability and conflict. Young adults were also more likely not to have close friends, compared with those 75 and older, reported the survey. \u201cThis pattern, apparent even prior to the pandemic, represents a sharp reversal of patterns documented prior to 2010, indicating a dramatic decline in mental wellbeing with each younger generation rather than an increase in wellbeing as we age,\u201d noted the study. Family relationships are diminishing worldwide, according to the research, which could hurt a person\u2019s mental health. People with no close friendships and poor familial relationships are 10 times more likely to experience poor mental health, the research found. Tara Thiagarajan, founder and chief scientist at Sapien Labs, said in a statement: \u201cThese data suggest that we have not fully appreciated the profoundly relational nature of the human psyche. As much as we may believe that we are each independent, our wellbeing is profoundly relational in nature.\u201d Tanzania, Panama, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela are countries with the highest rankings of mental health, whereas Britain, Ireland, Australia, South Africa and Brazil all have lower mental health rankings."

            "content": "A controversial mental health monitoring system, which embedded police officers in clinical teams, must no longer be used in mental health services, NHS England has said. In a letter seen by the Guardian, NHS England\u2019s national clinical director for mental health, Prof Tim Kendall, gave the instruction about the serenity integrated mentoring (SIM) scheme and similar models. The scheme, which began expanding across the UK six years ago, puts police into health teams to help manage patients who repeatedly call emergency services. Critics say the system involves instructing A&amp;E, ambulance, mental health services and police not to respond to calls from these people in case it \u201cpositively reinforce[s]\u201d high-risk behaviour. Medical bodies and campaigners including the Centre for Mental Health and Rethink Mental Illness have said there are concerns that people experiencing acute distress, who are at high risk of self-harm, have not been receiving the medical help they need. Lucy Schonegevel, the associate director for policy and practice at Rethink Mental Illness, said: \u201cSerious concerns have been raised highlighting that this may result in the potential withholding of life-saving treatment to people in crisis and that the model has not been sufficiently evaluated.\u201d NHS England has worked with the StopSIM coalition, a group campaigning to halt the use of SIM in the NHS, to produce a report on the effects of the system. NHS England said it had no plans to publish the report, but StopSIM called for it to be published \u201cin full immediately\u201d. The coalition said: \u201cOver the past 15 months, we have worked with NHS England, as well as a range of other stakeholders, to produce a rigorous and detailed policy that supports many of the concerns highlighted by service users and activists during the StopSIM campaign.\u201d Andy Bell, the interim chief executive for the Centre for Mental Health, said: \u201cI am deeply disappointed that the full report that was co-produced with the StopSIM coalition will not be published; we strongly call on NHS England to publish that document honouring the co-production that went into it.\u201d StopSIM has concerns that it is now down to the individual trusts and integrated care boards to end the use of SIM or other similar practices. Bell said: \u201cThe important thing in many ways is that SIM and everything similar is no longer part of mental health practice \u2013 it\u2019s crucial that in every part of the country that support for all people in acute distress is safe, compassionate and effective.\u201d Kendall said in his letter: \u201cNHS England will continue to review the key principles for ensuring people in crisis get the right support at the right time as we agree a framework for joint working between police and mental health services over coming months.\u201d He added: \u201cOngoing engagement with people with lived experience will be critical as we do this work, alongside government and policing partners.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2023.

            "content": "At the age of 70, Carmen Su\u00e1rez* is finally coming to terms with an event that happened five decades ago. It was a trauma that changed the course of her life and left her with depression. \u201cI used to cry uncontrollably,\u201d she says. \u201cI was told to seek help, but I had neither the time nor the money. I realise now that I was stuck reliving the incident.\u201d Over the course of a year, the Diada project (detection and integrated care for depression and alcohol use), an innovative project aimed at identifying people with or at risk of developing a mental health or alcohol use disorder, helped her recover. Su\u00e1rez has several chronic ailments, including high blood pressure, and was regularly in and out of treatment. \u201cTogether with my church, the programme helped me begin processing the trauma I\u2019d been living with and made me understand how my mental health was affecting my physical health. It was a huge help,\u201d she says. Until 2018, the Javesalud medical centre in El Tober\u00edn, northern Bogot\u00e1, where Su\u00e1rez is a patient, had no system of detection. \u201cPatient diagnostics of mental health were zero,\u201d says Dr Isabel Zapata, the centre manager. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t exist, we just didn\u2019t have any way of identifying them, so they\u2019d fall through the system.\u201d Working with the Pontifical Javierian University, the non-profit medical centre provides outpatient primary care to 10,000 patients monthly, out of a catchment area of 58,000 people. It has no psychiatrists. Between 2018 and 2020, 7,000 patients participated in Diada. One in ten were diagnosed with a mental illness and 1% with an alcohol abuse problem. To date, there have been 16,000 patients screened. Diada works by directing people \u2013 typically visiting the medical centre for a different health matter \u2013 toward an interactive screen with a series of questions. Algorithms help identify at-risk patients. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple but effective way of screening people,\u201d says Zapata. After the two-minute survey, a ticket is issued, which is given to the doctor and those who register \u201cpositive\u201d go to the next phase. Computer software helps guide clinicians towards possible interventions, depending on the patient\u2019s score which reflects the severity or likelihood of illness. Treatment can range from the loan of a smartphone with a therapy app that registers mood or alcohol consumption, to regular evaluations or medicines. Practitioners say symptoms significantly improve within three months of diagnosis. Depression affects 4.7% of Colombians, making it secondonly to cardiovascular disease in prevelance in Colombia, according to the health ministry, and slightly above the global average. Most of those affected (80%) do not have access to specialist care. The rates of women with depression are 5.4% compared with 3.2% of men. There are only 1,200 psychiatrists to serve a population of 51 million \u2013 equivalent to 2.5 psychiatrists for every 100,000 people, a quarter of the WHO recommended 10 for every 100,000. Alcohol is another leading contributor to the disease burden and the two are often linked. Persistent underinvestment, followed by a global pandemic, has worsened the situation, leaving mental health problems to be a drain on the health system and, with many sufferers unable to work, an economic burden. Dr Carlos G\u00f3mez-Restrepo, who oversaw the national mental health survey, was concerned that despite a significant proportion of the population reporting symptoms of depression, too few were being diagnosed, much less treated. \u201cWe realised that primary care doctors in Colombia weren\u2019t equipped to deal with this. Only the most severe cases of alcohol abuse or depression were being detected, by which time most people would find themselves in the emergency department,\u201d he says. Diada results from a collaboration between the Pontifical Javerian University (where G\u00f3mez-Restrepo is the dean of medicine and the project\u2019s lead researcher), and Dartmouth College in the US. With funding from the National Institute of Mental Health, the pilot was launched in six locations across the country. There is a further planned launch in Leticia, the capital of Colombia\u2019s Amazonas , later this year. \u201cDiada has proved its efficacy and cost-effectiveness,\u201d says Dr Jos\u00e9 Miguel Uribe, co-researcher, and director of the department of psychiatry Pontifical Javerian University. For an estimated cost of $2 (\u00a31.65) for each person treated, according to Uribe, Diada offers an economical model of mental health provision. More psychiatrists are not the solution, much less a quick fix, says Uribe. Instead, equipping primary care centres to enable early detection and prevention, such as with the Diada project, is the way forward. Other Latin American countries, including Peru and Chile, have been watching the Diada project in Colombia and expect to adopt similar programmes. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way process, where we all learn from each other,\u201d says Uribe. Scaling up will need long-term funding from the government, which last week presented its health reforms, claiming they will expand healthcare access. As part of these reforms, President Gustavo Petro has promised up to 20,000 new primary care teams. \u201cThe pandemic laid bare the importance of our mental wellbeing,\u201d says Uribe. \u201cThere has never been more interest shown from as many different groups as there is now \u2013 not only governments and health authorities, but also schools, universities, families and communities. It is a golden opportunity. Mental health concerns us all.\u201d *Name has been changed"

            "content": "Imagine that your teenager was a star athlete, on track for a university athletics scholarship. But then they develop long Covid at the height of the pandemic, meaning they no longer had the lung capacity to run, let alone live independently. If that was your experience, you\u2019re likely to think the government didn\u2019t do enough to protect children from Covid-19, or vaccinate them fast enough. On the other hand, what if your child developed an eating disorder due to social isolation and depression? In that case, you might think that lockdown measures were disproportionate. If you lost a loved one to the disease, then you might blame government for doing too little. If your small business of 20 years shut down, you might blame government for doing too much. The point is that all our views on the pandemic, whether we\u2019re a teacher, pub owner, healthcare worker or even a scientist, are coloured by our personal experiences of this huge, global storm. I\u2019ve been thinking about this in light of a new study that attempts to make sense of the effect the pandemic has had on our mental health. The latest British Medical Journal systematic review, from a Canadian team of researchers, looks at more than 100 studies from around the world and concludes that the pandemic didn\u2019t result in any major changes in general mental health and anxiety symptoms, and only minimal changes in depression. This has led to headlines such as \u201cMental-health crisis from Covid pandemic was minimal\u201d. What\u2019s needed here is nuance. Only that can capture what has undoubtedly been a traumatic few years \u2013 in which millions of people have felt loss, anger and frustration. And this is where general studies on \u201ceveryone\u2019s mental health\u201d are misleading. The pandemic didn\u2019t affect everyone equally. Groups that were badly affected include those with existing mental health conditions, children, people living with disabilities, adolescents and those without financial or social security nets. The BMJ study does highlight some of these groups and notes that the study didn\u2019t capture the views of children. Children universally faced a difficult few years during a formative time, whether through losing caregivers to the virus, through school closures, or being more exposed to abusive adults inside their homes. The problem is that studies such as the BMJ\u2019s are used either to argue that lockdowns don\u2019t have any significant impact on population mental health (and, therefore, are not as bad as predicted), or by others to argue that such research itself is flawed completely. This doesn\u2019t help us. Instead, we need to start coming together on how we heal as a society and recognise that each person\u2019s experience from 2020 to 2022 heavily shapes how they interpret what happened and why. It\u2019s simply not helpful to continue to argue about restrictions and closures using these kind of generalising studies. The truth is that they were an extreme public health response, and were only taken up as public policy because of the even worse option facing countries, of imminent (and real) healthcare collapse and mass death. No one is pro-lockdown; this was about being anti-mass death. Covid-19 from 2020 to 2022 was a once-in-a-century pandemic, most closely related to the 1918 flu pandemic, which involved similar measures such as shutdowns and mask mandates. What we should be thinking about is planning ahead for the next pandemic, whether of avian flu or a new pathogen. How do we prepare platforms and solutions (testing, vaccines, treatments) to limit or even completely avoid restrictions and closures? Humans are social: we live longer when we have meaningful relationships and see others, and we have numerous studies showing that social isolation, especially for certain groups, has negative consequences. Understanding that should be our starting point for the future. Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"

There is much to agree with in his analysis, but I\u2019d disagree with his statement that our efforts today \u201cshould focus on reducing inequalities, not on growing the economy\u201d. Lower inequality is an important goal, but GDP growth will also be necessary to ensure that everyone worldwide has a decent standard of living. I\u2019d strongly agree with him that there is much more to life than economic growth and that the World Bank\u2019s international poverty line of $2.15 (\u00a31.80) a day is an utterly inadequate consumption level for a high quality of life. But, whether the poverty line is set at $2.15 or $10 or higher, economic growth is going to be necessary to ensure no one lives below it \u2013 and the higher the poverty line, the more growth will be required. There isn\u2019t a single low-income country that reports $2.15 poverty below 13%, for example. Outside Ukraine, the lowest poverty rate at $6.85 a day in low- and lower-middle-income countries as a group is 16%. Historically, the only places we\u2019ve seen the most extreme poverty reduced to fractions of a percentage point is in richer countries. We are off-track on the growth target specified in the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals (SDGs), and inadequate economic growth is the major reason we will not meet the SDG extreme poverty target. Zack Gehan and I forecast that we might meet the poverty target 20 years after the SDG deadline, in 2050 \u2013 although even that is based on considerably outperforming historical growth rates. So, two cheers for GDP growth in the world\u2019s poorest countries. It is far from a panacea, but it is also absolutely necessary part of the struggle to sustainably improve global quality of life.

The APPG welcomed efforts to tackle \u201cdirty money\u201d but raised doubts over the level of commitment to addressing the problem in the plan, which runs until 2026. \u201cAs far as we can see, no additional funding has been allocated to the fight against dirty money,\u201d said Hodge. \u201cUntil the government puts money where its mouth is, the entire strategy is just smoke and mirrors.\u201d MPs such as Hodge, say the government should be making commitments not through the plan but by introducing measures through the economic crime and corporate transparency bill, now going through the House of Lords.

            "content": "A new report from the Center for Global Development claims extreme poverty may be eradicated by 2050 thanks to economic growth in low-income countries. However, a cause for celebration, this is not. Before we start putting our feet up, it\u2019s worth remembering that extreme poverty is measured according to the World Bank\u2019s international poverty line, which is set at $2.15 (\u00a31.80) a day per person using 2017 prices. This pitiful amount would barely save you from starvation, let alone allow you to pay for essentials such as housing, heating or transport. It leads you to wonder whether the figure was chosen to ensure the international community would be able to boast quick gains in the fight against poverty. Whatever the political reasons for sticking to this measure of extreme poverty, no one can seriously claim that this amount would allow anyone to lead a decent life. Economic growth, defined as the increase of GDP (or total economic output measured in monetary value) per capita, is not the panacea it is made out to be. It is quite conceivable that as monetary wealth increases in low-income countries, the situation of specific groups within them will actually get worse. First, much of the world\u2019s growth has historically been attributed to the commodification of the natural or cultural resources on which poor communities rely, and that in the past they could have accessed for free. For people in poverty, a world in which a large range of things required for a decent life must be paid for, and can be bought by the highest bidder, is much worse than a world in which such things are treated as \u201ccommons\u201d, democratically governed and allocated on the basis of need, or provided by the state as part of its duty to guarantee the welfare of its population. At the same time, the search for growth has led to some pretty disastrous political decisions for people in poverty, such as establishing \u201cinvestment-friendly business environments\u201d to attract or retain investors. This is simply codeword for lowering taxes on corporate income and removing regulatory requirements, depriving the state of public revenue for financing public services and social protection. And it is in the pursuit of growth that labour markets have been made more \u201cflexible\u201d \u2013 with more casual work, fewer long-term employment contracts, and lower wages and reduced protections for workers. This is all justified to ensure that countries remain attractive to investors \u2013 as if the comparative advantage of a country resides in its working population being kept in poverty. These and other misguided policies may create the conditions for economic growth, and a woeful $2.15 a day in the hands of the very poorest, but they won\u2019t eradicate poverty or the social exclusion that comes with it. Over the past 40 years, while general affluence has increased, inequalities have grown in most countries. And this persistence of wealth and income inequalities has largely cancelled out the positive impacts on wellbeing that are expected to derive from an increase in GDP. It\u2019s not hard to see how if the situation of a particular individual improves in absolute terms, but remains stagnant (or, even worse, falls) in relation to other members of society, that individual will experience a loss in wellbeing that their increased purchasing power will not compensate for. Whether an economy grows or not matters less than whether progress is achieved for those at the bottom. Our efforts today, should focus on reducing inequalities, not on growing the economy, as if a large GDP were some sort of magic wand. What is required is to make social protection universal, to strengthen public services, to achieve progressive taxation, and to build an inclusive economy. An increase in GDP is neither a necessary condition to achieve this, nor is it sufficient to fulfil the promise of ending poverty. \u2022 Olivier De Schutter is the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights."

After official figures showing the UK performed slightly more strongly than originally thought towards the end of 2022, the Institute of Directors said there had been an improvement in demand, confidence, hiring and investment intentions in March. The IoD said its survey of more than 900 firms \u2013 which showed a pick up in growth across all sectors \u2013 suggested the economy would confound predictions in the budget two weeks ago that output would fall in the first three months of 2023. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cThe data coming from our members is strongly suggestive of growth across all sectors in recent weeks. In particular, the strengthening of order books since the end of last year points to an economy performing better in the first quarter than was anticipated as recently as the March budget.\u201d Half of all firms (50%) reported in March that their order books were healthier than at the end of 2022, with 22% saying they were weaker.

The IoD said net positive scores are recorded in all parts of the economy, including consumer-facing sectors and manufacturing. Ussher said: \u201cWhile this is undoubtedly good news, strong demand also means that it may take longer than many forecasters currently expect for inflation to come within sight of the Bank of England\u2019s target any time soon.\u201d Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate rose from 10.1% to 10.4% in February, while figures for the 20-country eurozone for March released on Friday showed a fall from 8.5% to 6.9%. The Office for National Statistics confirmed on Friday the economy narrowly avoided being in technical recession \u2013 two successive quarters of negative growth \u2013 in the second half of 2022. The ONS said it now thought the economy shrank by 0.1% rather than 0.2% between July and September and grew by 0.1% in the final quarter rather than remaining flat. Despite fears that a combination of high inflation, strikes and financial turmoil would lead to falling output, builders, manufacturers and the telecoms sector all recorded faster growth than initially estimated. Government help with energy bills underpinned consumer spending in the fourth quarter but business investment \u2013 which had previously been estimated to have grown by almost 5% \u2013 fell slightly. Despite the revisions, ONS data shows the economy has been broadly flat since early 2022, growing by 0.1% in each of the second and fourth quarters and contracting by 0.1% in the third quarter. The economy remains smaller than it was in late 2019 before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, although by 0.6% rather than the 0.8% previously estimated. Darren Morgan, an ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cThe economy performed a little more strongly in the latter half of last year than previously estimated, with later data showing telecommunications, construction and manufacturing all faring better than initially thought in the latest quarter. \u201cHouseholds saved more in the last quarter, with their finances boosted by the government\u2019s energy bill support scheme.\u201d Analysts said the economy would continue to struggle in the months ahead against a backdrop of rising borrowing costs and the end of government support for energy bills. Ruth Gregory, of Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe upward revision to real GDP growth in Q3 and Q4 of last year suggests that high inflation took a slightly smaller toll on the economy than we previously thought. But with around two-thirds of the drag on real activity from higher rates yet to be felt, we still think the economy will slip into a recession this year.\u201d Gabriella Dickens, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said she was pencilling in declines of 0.1% in both of the first two quarters of 2023. \u201cThe economy likely will continue to flatline in the first half of this year,\u201d she said."

            "content": "It is three years this month since the UK went into lockdown and the path of the economy over that period is now strikingly clear. There was an instant collapse in activity that reduced output by more than a quarter followed by a two-stage bounceback interrupted by a second lockdown. By the end of 2021, the economy \u2013 as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 was pretty much back to where it was before the coronavirus pandemic struck. Over the past 12 months it has remained at that level rather than returning to its pre-lockdown growth path. This underlying pattern held true in January despite the marginally better performance of the economy. The 0.3% growth month-on-month was largely down to a number of one-off factors: the return of Premier League football after the World Cup, postal services being back to normal after pre-Christmas strikes, and more pupils in classrooms after parents removed children from school to a greater extent than normal in December. Without those factors, output would have been flat. Jeremy Hunt took comfort from the fact the economy is showing more resilience than expected but rightly noted there was a \u201clong way to go\u201d. The good news for the chancellor is that the recession predicted by the Bank of England last November has yet to materialise, and even if it does come to pass is likely to be shorter and more shallow than expected last autumn. Higher growth means stronger tax receipts, lower borrowing and some extra wriggle room for Hunt in next week\u2019s budget. The bad news is that it is going to be some time before the economy benefits from lower global gas prices and falling inflation. GDP is not going to do much more than edge sideways again this year, if that, and even after beating forecasts in January it is still possible the economy will contract in the first quarter. The boost to private healthcare noted by the ONS is an indication of the effect on the economy of this winter\u2019s widespread industrial action. As Samuel Tombs, the UK economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the full impact of rising interest rates has yet to be felt but will increasingly be felt by consumers and businesses. Hunt says next Wednesday\u2019s budget will outline the \u201cnext stage\u201d of the government\u2019s growth plan. It will need to because the economy is going nowhere."

Well, of course there is, it\u2019s jobby; thanks to the shower in charge of the country, there\u2019s tonnes of the stuff bobbing up and down the Thames. But it\u2019s also an idiom, and just like exactly this time last week, it gives us an excuse to lash Chelsea and Tottenham together for the purposes of our story. Thing is, neither club appears to be a model of corporate competence right now. Only this morning, Chelsea posted a loss of \u00a3121m for the 2021-22 season, a number which doesn\u2019t look all that clever to simple folk like Football Daily. The club blame the Boris Johnson-approved sanctions imposed on former owner Roman Abramovich, which will continue to be felt \u201cin the following years\u201d, as presumably will the \u00a3500m splurge set to hit next year, so good luck to everyone at the Bridge. Perhaps someone can find a way of pinning Kalidou Koulibaly and Marc Cucurella on Liz Truss when it all goes up. Meanwhile up north, Tottenham continue to do Tottenham stuff, taking eight days to sack a manager who had effectively sacked himself eight days ago. With Antonio Conte cluttering up the place all last week, no mean feat seeing as he wasn\u2019t even physically there, Tottenham\u2019s exercise in Olympic-standard foot dragging ensured the club missed out on one of their top targets in Roy Hodg \u2026 no, that\u2019s not right, is it \u2026 Thomas Tuchel. While Spurs were faffing, the former Chelsea boss took over at Bayern Munich after the German champions, one point off the top of the Bundesliga and through to the quarters of Big Cup with eight wins out of eight, defenestrated Julian Nagelsmann with a ruthless cold-blooded efficiency that would make a mob hit feel like a Duggee hug. Oh Daniel! This is how it\u2019s done. The one plus point of Levy\u2019s procrastination is that Nagelsmann, another longtime target for Spurs, is suddenly on the market. The German is hanging around the Job Centre with Luis Enrique and Mauricio Pochettino and, of the three out-of-work big names, he\u2019s the one considered most likely to next hang his 1970s US sportscaster blazer on the infamously shoogly peg in the Spurs manager\u2019s office. Having said that, with Cristian Stellini installed as caretaker until the end of the season, pretty much anything could happen in the interim. There\u2019s plenty of time for someone else to snap up Nagelsmann, Luis Enrique and Poch, and for other rumoured names such as Thomas Frank, Ange Postecoglou and Roberto De Zerbi to go down different career paths as well. Maybe this is one for Mr Roy after all? He\u2019ll be done with Palace by the summer!

            "date": "2023-03-31T14:00:25Z",
            "content": "Farmers near Menindee in western New South Wales have to make the choice between spending hours carting untreated water for their stock or allowing them to drink water containing \u201cpotentially toxic algae\u201d, after a mass fish kill contaminated the Darling-Baaka River. Plans to flush the river to remove the sludge of millions of dead fish have been criticised because they involve releasing water earmarked for environmental flows. Residents within the town of Menindee, population 550, have repeatedly been told that water processed at the town treatment plant is safe to drink. But many properties just outside the town rely on pumping directly from the river. As of Tuesday, the Central Darling shire council had delivered 147,000 litres of water to 21 properties reliant on the river that do not have access to down water, but the council says water was strictly allocated for domestic use. That leaves livestock in the lurch. Horse trainer Wayne Marsden confronted authorities at a town meeting last Friday and was given a water testing kit to send to Sydney to see if the water was safe to use. A few days later he received a call from the council administrator offering a potential solution. \u201cThat\u2019s when he and [local water authority] Essential Water came up with the idea to let me use the raw water from the pipeline from Menindee to Broken Hill,\u201d Marsden tells Guardian Australia. The pipeline used to supply water from the Menindee Lakes to Broken Bill, before it was shut down in 2019 over concerns about dwindling water supplies and Broken Hill instead began receiving water from Wentworth, 270km to the south on the Murray River. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Essential Water says it established the Broken Hill to Menindee pipeline as a back feed of water from Stephen\u2019s Creek in Broken Hill, as a precautionary measure in case the water quality in the Darling-Baaka River deteriorated. Marsden will now need to buy a 1,000 litres water pod, drive it to a take-off point on the old pipeline, fill it up with water from Broken Hill, then drive it home to pump it into his own water tank to supply his horse troughs. \u201cIt will last me maybe a day and a half, so I have a new full-time job carting my own water,\u201d says Marsden. Horses drink about 50 litres a day. \u201cIt\u2019s a solution now that I only have a small number of horses, but a few months ago I had 14 horses and I couldn\u2019t have kept up. But it is a solution at the present time.\u201d \u2018If they die, they die\u2019 Other property owners told Guardian Australia they could not manage the task of carting water, and were left with little option but to hope the river water is potable for their stock. At Bootingee Station, Stewart Oates says he is still dealing with damaged access roads caused by a flood late last year. \u201cWe got washed out, it\u2019s disgraceful, it looks like a bloody hurricane went through the joint out here,\u201d says Oates. He also lost livestock and one of his cars. \u201cI lost half of them with the flood, I lost 40-50 head of sheep, and it took them down the river,\u201d he says. Oates says he is unable to cart water because of the damage to his property. His remaining sheep will have to drink the river water. \u201cMy stock has got to drink it, I have no choice,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they die, they die.\u201d Meanwhile, the NSW Environment Protection Authority has published the results of testing done on the first six samples collected by WaterNSW since the fish death event. \u201cAll six water samples contained potentially toxic algae and blue green algae,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said. All were also negative for 600 pesticides scanned for by the EPA. Emergency response called off Despite ongoing difficulties accessing potable water and a visit from new NSW premier Chris Minns this week, the government response has backed off. The emergency operations centre established in response to the fish kills two weeks ago has been stood down, with NSW police assistant commissioner Brett Greentree, who headed the centre, saying it had delivered on its priorities. Greentree says individual government agencies will now operate as per their usual priorities to monitor the health of the river. \u201cI want to reiterate that while the emergency operation is concluding, there will still be significant work being conducted by the responsible agencies throughout the Murray-Darling Basin and beyond,\u201d he says. Water authorities have released water from the Menindee Lakes to flush the Darling-Baaka, taken from the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder\u2019s (CEWH) allocations for environmental flows. Maryanne Slattery, director of water consultancy Slattery and Johnson, says that while it\u2019s \u201ccommendable\u201d of CEWH to use their water to improve water quality, \u201cit is not an environmental flow\u201d. \u201cEnvironmental water should be on top of water that is already provided for the river not instead of,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not going to fix it by addressing the problem at the proximate cause, we need a systemic solution to it. We need to be rethinking this at a system scale. \u201cIn the immediate event, we need to have embargos on flows in the north to get more flows coming down through the system. It should not just fall on the responsibility of the CEWH.\u201d A CEWH spokesperson says the decision to provide additional releases into the lower Darling-Baaka River was informed by advice from local water managers. \u201cWater for the environment is being provided to improve dissolved oxygen levels for native fish,\u201d they say. \u201cDelivering water to support native fish populations across the Murray-Darling Basin is aligned with the CEWH\u2019s water management plans.\u201d Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"

            "content": "The FTSE 100 will lose one of its biggest companies after the building materials group CRH said it plans to move its primary stock market listing to the US, in a further blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s ambitions for London as a global financial centre. CRH, which has its headquarters in Dublin, said it will aim for \u201cUS equity index inclusion as soon as possible\u201d in a statement to the stock market. Sunak has pushed for new rules to make London a more attractive destination for companies to list their shares. However, several companies have in recent months reportedly either rejected the UK or considered leaving. The prime minister met the leader of Arm and its Japanese owner, SoftBank, in an effort to persuade the chip designer to list in its home country. However, Arm has decided against selling shares in London, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. The oil company Shell considered moving its headquarters and listing from London to the US before opting to ditch a second share listing in the Netherlands in favour of remaining in the UK, the Financial Times reported this week. Russ Mould, investment director at the AJ Bell platform, said: \u201cSo much for making London the go-to place for companies to list their shares. London Stock Exchange is having to work overtime just to keep those already listed, let alone attract new ones. \u201cEfforts to relax the listing rules to attract more companies to London come across as a bit desperate. It should be a badge of honour to list in the UK, but that reputation is dwindling fast. \u201cOverseas investors lost interest in the trading venue as soon as the UK voted in favour of Brexit, and valuations have got even cheaper. That\u2019s hardly a good sales pitch to attract more big companies to the UK market.\u201d It comes amid broader concerns over London\u2019s status as a global financial hub. London\u2019s productivity growth has trailed behind international competitors since the financial crisis in 2007, according to a report published on Thursday by the thinktank, Centre for Cities. The centre said rising costs for office space had eaten up spending that could have gone on innovation, while higher house prices and more restrictive immigration policies had made it harder to attract talented people. CRH said its decision was driven by the fact that 75% of its earnings come from North America. It will follow the plumbing and heating equipment supplier Ferguson, known as Wolseley before it changed its name to the US brand in 2017, and moved its listing from London to New York in May last year. CRH\u2019s market value was \u00a329bn on Wednesday evening before the announcement. Its share price jumped by nearly 11% on Thursday morning to its highest ever level above \u00a344. In its statement, CRH said: \u201cWe have now come to the conclusion that a US primary listing would bring increased commercial, operational and acquisition opportunities for CRH, further accelerating our successful integrated solutions strategy and delivering even higher levels of profitability, returns and cash for our shareholders.\u201d CRH said it will talk to its investors about why the move would be \u201cin the best interests of our business and our shareholders\u201d, with a further update to be provided on 26 April. It plans to keep its corporate headquarters in Ireland."

            "date": "2023-03-23T16:40:52Z",
            "content": "The energy regulator Ofgem is preparing to crack down on UK power firms to prevent them from \u201cmanipulating\u201d the market with a manoeuvre that has bolstered their profits by millions of pounds. The practice, which does not break existing market rules, involves generators warning the electricity system operator that they are turning their power plants off at times of peak demand and subsequently offering to keep them running in exchange for a \u201cbalancing\u201d payment. In some cases, the electricity system operator, which is owned by National Grid, has been left with little option other than to make payments of significantly above the market price to keep power plants from turning off and avoid the risk of winter blackouts. The balancing payments, which are passed on to consumers in the form of higher bills, add up to millions of pounds. An analysis by Bloomberg claims some power plants have received \u00a3525m in extra revenue from using the \u201coff-on manoeuvre\u201d between 2018 and 2022. It reported that almost 90% of that was paid out over the past two years as market energy prices rocketed due to the war in Ukraine and households struggled to keep up with the soaring cost of electricity. Ofgem, which has opened a public consultation on the issue in recent weeks, said it would introduce a new rule into electricity generation licences, potentially this summer, to prohibit generators from \u201cmanipulating the balancing mechanism in this way for excessive financial gain\u201d. A spokesperson added that all attempts by energy companies to \u201cexacerbate tight market conditions, whether intentional or not, are not in consumers\u2019 interests\u201d. Downing Street said the practice was \u201cclearly completely unacceptable\u201d. Rishi Sunak\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cThe regulator, Ofgem, is aware of this concerning behaviour from a handful of participants involved and is urgently looking into it further. It\u2019s critical that at all times consumers pay a fair price for their energy.\u201d Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, whose 60 members include anti-poverty charities, health campaigners, local authorities, unions and consumer organisations, welcomed the fact that light was being shone on \u201cthe shadowy elements of Britain\u2019s broken energy system\u201d. \u201cEvery time people suffering in cold damp homes use energy, they are the victims of a complex and deeply flawed market which puts profits ahead of giving people access to the energy they need,\u201d he said. According to the Bloomberg investigation, power plant owners were most likely to use the off-on manoeuvre on days when market prices were already far higher than usual as high demand and relatively tight supplies put pressure on British electricity supplies. About three-quarters of the alleged \u00a3525m extracted by power plant owners was paid out on days of restricted energy supplies, according to the research, and more than half of this sum was reportedly paid to power plants owned by VPI, a unit of the commodity company Vitol, and the German utility group Uniper. Bloomberg said it could not account for the reasons behind any individual decision to turn a plant on and off and whether there were circumstances involved other than the pursuit of revenue. A spokesperson for VPI said the company was a responsible participant in the UK power market and has abided by all relevant regulations. Uniper did not respond to a request for comment. Currently, power plant owners are free to notify National Grid electricity system operator (NGESO) that they will turn off plants with only a few hours\u2019 notice while bidding the same plant into the \u201cbalancing mechanism\u201d to keep running in exchange for a one-off payment. The decision by Ofgem, the energy regulator for Great Britain, to take action comes after a review by NGESO of the most expensive days to balance the market last year, which it reported to the regulator and the government."

            "date": "2023-03-16T14:00:15Z",
            "content": "Victoria\u2019s pool of social housing has grown by just 74 units in four years despite the government embarking on a multibillion-dollar \u201cBig Housing Build\u201d and a growing waitlist for homes. Data from the latest Department of Families, Fairness and Housing (DFFH) annual report shows there were 86,887 social housing dwellings across Victoria as of 30 June 2022 \u2013 a net increase of 74 since 30 June 2018, when there were 86,813. At the same time the social housing waitlist has grown by about 45% \u2013 from about 44,000 applications in June 2018 to 64,168 in June 2022. More than 40% of applicants were on the priority waitlist last June. The government is meant to report social housing data quarterly, but is yet to publish figures for September or December 2022. \u201cI would hazard a guess the data isn\u2019t available because it isn\u2019t good,\u201d the opposition\u2019s spokesperson for housing, Richard Riordan, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe reality is, we have a crisis on our hands. In the last year alone, the number people on the priority waitlist grew by more than 3,000 families. \u201cThere are thousands of families without a roof over their heads in Victoria right now and the government is sitting there, patting itself on the back about the \u2018biggest build ever\u2019. It\u2019s shameless.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In November 2020, Daniel Andrews and the then-housing minister, Richard Wynne, announced the $5.3bn \u201cbig housing build\u201d to rectify decades of under-investment in social housing. At the time, Wynne said 12,000 homes would be constructed by 2024 as part of the \u201cbiggest commitment by any state government ever\u201d. This included 9,300 new social housing units and 2,900 affordable homes, as well as the replacement of 1,100 old public housing units. In July 2022 his successor, Danny Pearson, held a press conference to mark the halfway point of the big housing build. He said the government had invested $2.8bn so far and was \u201con track\u201d to deliver at least 16,000 social and affordable homes by 2026. Libby Porter, a professor at the centre for urban research at RMIT University, said she was not surprised the investment had barely made a dent on supply. \u201cWe are demolishing many [dwellings] at the same time we are building,\u201d she said. Porter describes the big build as a continuation of other projects, including the public housing renewal program, which involved the government engaging private developers to replace old public housing with new social housing. For developers, profits came from a new private housing component on the same block. Private non-for-profits then manage the social housing. Porter points to six sites at Ascot Vale, Flemington, Hawthorn and Heidelberg, five of which were public housing estates. Combined, they made up 446 public housing units before they were demolished. They were replaced with a mix of 540 private and 500 social housing units as part of the Big Build. \u201cIt\u2019s total net gain of 54 social housing dwellings across six sites, at the cost to the public of $532m, which is $9.85m per dwelling,\u201d she said. Kerrie Byrne, a long\u2010time public housing tenant and a former community sector worker who is part of the Save Public Housing Collective, was more blunt. \u201cThe winners out of these projects are property developers. Meanwhile, public housing is being left in a shambles. All over the state, public housing tenants are living in unsafe, unhealthy conditions, with mould and leaky buildings a frequent problem,\u201d she said. Byrne cited Port Melbourne\u2019s Barak Beacon estate, which is set to be demolished and replaced by a new development. Some 89 dwellings will be replaced with a mix of social, affordable and private homes. \u201cA 10% increase in social housing is only nine properties. For nine properties they are displacing 200 tenants, including elderly people who are seriously traumatised by what\u2019s happening,\u201d Byrne said. Guardian Australia has previously reported a staged renovation of the Barak Beacon estate could increase stock by 200. Porter said the government would be better off maintaining and refurbish public housing properties via significant recurrent funding in the budget. She said modelling conducted by RMIT would see a $5.3bn spend just on public housing would deliver about 20,000 new dwellings, more if they were constructed on public land, and keep the assets in public hands. A Homes Victoria spokesperson said that at the end of January, more than 7,600 homes had been completed or were under way, and more than 1,700 households had either moved or were getting ready to move into brand new homes. \u201cThe data in the 2021/22 annual report represents the first year of the Big Housing Build, with the majority of new homes to be delivered over the next three years, including larger multi-dwelling developments,\u201d they said. \u201cThe Big Housing Build will increase the supply of available social housing by more than 10% over the life of the program.\u201d The spokesperson said total social housing stock numbers were affected at different times by a number of factors, including renewal projects and tenant relocations. This article was amended on 17 March 2023 to correct a reference to the waiting list having nearly doubled in the standfirst. The social housing waitlist has actually increased by nearly half."

The fall was because of the sharp increase in gas prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine not being repeated this year. As a result, annual energy inflation dropped from 13.7% to -0.9%. In contrast to falling gas prices, the cost of food continued to rise for eurozone consumers. Eurostat said food, tobacco and alcoholic drinks were 15.4% more expensive in March than a year earlier, compared with a 15% annual rise in February. Core inflation \u2013 the cost of living excluding items such as fuel and food \u2013 rose slightly from 5.6% to a new record high of 5.7%. Analysts said the European Central Bank was likely to pay more attention to core inflation than the headline measure of the cost of living, and would continue raising interest rates. Bert Colijn, a senior economist for the eurozone at ING bank, said:\u201cThe potential for core inflation to remain stickier than hoped will be the main reason for the ECB to continue to hike in the near term. \u201cWe expect another 0.25-point hike in May and another in June. As the inflation outlook is starting to look more benign, and recent banking turmoil serves as an illustration that aggressive hikes are not without cost, we expect a peak to be reached thereafter.\u201d Inflation data for the UK for March has not yet been published but figures for February showed headline inflation rising from 10.1% to 10.4%, while core inflation rose from 5.8% to 6.2%. Diego Iscaro, the head of European economics at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cWe estimate that core (eurozone) inflation is close to its peak, and the pressure from food prices is also likely to ease during the second quarter. However, we expect core inflation to remain relatively sticky due to a combination of rising nominal wage growth and firms\u2019 profit margins.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-03-12T18:25:06Z",
            "content": "The language of the market performs a social function to obscure economic encounters. In this inflationary era, it\u2019s worth noting that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the economy has not put up prices all at once. It is firms, free from government curbs, deciding that they can do that. In free markets, companies are meant to compete and undercut each other, driving prices and profits down. Yet this has been failing to happen. Instead, a new report from the trade union Unite reveals, company profits last year rose while real wages fell steeply. Workers are warned that they risk sparking a wage-price spiral if they demand pay rises to match living costs. In fact, Britain seems to be facing a profit-price spiral. Unite\u2019s argument is that UK plc has been able to charge more, with much of the higher prices juicing profits. From the trade union\u2019s perspective, corporate greed has been the primary driver of high inflation. Its 165-page report makes a compelling case that firms, and their investors, are \u201cprofiteering\u201d on the back of a crisis hitting workers hard. Even within key industries, there is talk of \u201cprice gouging\u201d. When Sainsbury\u2019s reported a doubling of profits last year to \u00a3730m, the supermarket insisted it wasn\u2019t ramping up prices. But it accused its competitors of doing so. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sent a shock wave through markets already reeling from a bumpy pandemic reopening and extreme droughts in crop-growing regions. Yet rising prices have not come from government spending or wage pressure. Inflation has, instead, been amplified by firms able to raise markups. Windfalls occur when costs don\u2019t change but circumstances do. Bernard Looney, the boss of BP, last year said sky-high oil prices had turned his firm into a \u201ccash machine\u201d. Energy companies are profiting from a war overseas, while at the same time increasing wealth inequality in the UK. Mr Looney earned more than 170 times as much as his average employee last year, when his pay doubled to about \u00a310m. The report by Unite challenges the more mainstream position that prices were driven higher as pent-up savings and pandemic-stimulus cash was spent when the supply of goods and services had been constrained. With consumers lacking protections and workers unable to defend effectively their share of output, gains flowed to profits. Unite has good reason to believe the corporate sector is practising a form of \u201ctacit collusion\u201d, where firms can behave as if there were an agreement between them to maintain high prices. Its research also echoes recent work by US economists Isabella Weber and Evan Wasner on how emergencies are used to entrench \u201csellers\u2019 inflation\u201d. What is clear is that neither market competition, nor government regulation, is doing much to tackle this problem. Rather both seem to be facilitating it. For all the talk of a high-wage economy, there is no sign of changing a model that relies on real wage restraint for competitiveness. High profits and low pay are not a side-effect but an intrinsic part of an economic system that has resulted in a lowering of living standards. With households carrying historically high levels of debt, rising interest rates are causing more people to question whether the division of spoils within the system is fair. Unite should be thanked for producing a report that shatters the notion that the public live under a just system of regulatory protections. They do not."

            "title": "UK inflation rise complicates Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision",
            "date": "2023-03-22T10:37:19Z",
            "content": "For millions of households in Britain, there had been hope that the worst of the cost of living crisis was behind them. But last month\u2019s unexpected increase for inflation \u2013 reversing three months of progress \u2013 is as a painful reminder the squeeze is far from over. February\u2019s surprise increase will complicate matters for the Bank of England, in particular. Financial markets had been betting over recent days that the worst banking crisis since 2008 could tempt Threadneedle Street to hold back from further interest rate rises. Before its next rate decision on Thursday, a further rise in borrowing costs is increasingly likely. Soaring food prices were behind the latest jump for inflation, alongside rising alcohol prices in pubs and restaurants after discounting in January. With an increase for food and non-alcoholic drink inflation to a record high of 18% \u2013 the highest level in 45 years \u2013 Britain\u2019s poorest households, who spend a larger share of their income on basic essentials, will be feeling the worst of the pinch. Supply shortages of salads and cucumbers drove much of the rise as bad weather in Europe, and supply chain disruption led to rationing on the supermarket shelves, raising questions over the impact of Brexit given the supply problem appeared not to be replicated in the EU. For the Bank the focus will be on an unexpected increase in core inflation \u2013 the measure that strips out the effects of food and energy from the headline rate \u2013 after a jump from 5.8% in January to 6.2% last month. This could suggest that domestically generated inflation is proving more persistent than feared. The suggestion is that Britain\u2019s stronger economic performance than forecast at the start of the year could strengthen the power of businesses to keep pushing prices up, while rate setters will also be watching for signs that staff shortages are maintaining upward pressure on wage growth. However, it is important to note that all the big forecasters are still expecting a significant drop in inflation later this year. It is not unusual for the headline rate to bob up and down from month to month, belying a more general trend in one direction or another. This rapid fall \u2013 seen as \u201cguaranteed\u201d by one Bank rate setter, Silvana Tenreyro \u2013 comes about mostly because of the way inflation is calculated. Because the figure is for the annual rate of change in an average basket of goods and services, the surge in the immediate aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine a year ago will drop from the calculation. Inflation should therefore resume a downward trajectory in March, when this strong base effect from the comparison to March 2022 \u2013 when energy prices surged \u2013 is expected to lower the headline rate. In April there should be a further fall, when consumer energy prices will hold steady but the anniversary of April 2022\u2019s huge 54% increase in the Ofgem price cap is reached. This is helped further by the government extending its energy price guarantee at the current level of \u00a32,500 for an average household bill. Given this mixed picture, the Bank\u2019s rate decision on Thursday could still be finely balanced. With inflation sticking at more than five times its 2% target rate, the optics of staying put during the cost of living emergency are tough to justify. On the other hand, should the crash in the banking sector prove more than a blip, lenders reacting with caution to the crisis and making it harder for households and businesses to get a loan, will do some of the same work as higher interest rates. With Britain\u2019s economy still perilously close to recession, increasing rates much further could make the difference between a near miss and a worse outcome."

            "date": "2023-03-14T09:48:57Z",
            "content": "UK wage growth slowed in the three months to January, despite inflation staying stubbornly high, prolonging the cost of living crisis affecting millions of households. Wages growth fell to 5.7% from a revised 6% in December to leave the average pay rise 3.2% below the rate of inflation, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Easing pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates, pay growth in the private sector fell for the first time in a year from 7.3% to 7%. Central bank officials have warned they may need to increase interest rates if wages continue to rise, fearing that high incomes will add to the pressure on shop prices. Public sector wages continued to close the gap with private sector workers but the increase of 4.8% for workers employed by the state still fell short of the average of 7% paid to private sector workers. Pay in finance and business services sector had the largest growth rate at 7.7%, followed by the construction sector at 5.8%. There was a fillip for the chancellor before the budget on Wednesday from figures showing the proportion of working age people with a job edged higher to 75.7% in the three months to January 2023, driven by young people taking part-time jobs and a rise in the number of self-employed. A more recent estimate of PAYE workers by HMRC found the number of payrolled employees jumped 98,000 to 30 million. The ONS said the workers categorised as neither working nor looking for a job fell overall, \u201cdriven by a drop in young people\u201d. However, the ONS reported that employers were nervous about the outlook for the economy and reduced the number of jobs on offer by 51,000, taking the number of vacancies down to 1.124m. The modest rise in the number of part-time workers is also expected to leave large skills gaps in several industries struggling to fill vacancies. Economists said the fall in wages was a further indication that employers were reluctant to increase employment costs going into a difficult period for the economy. A measure of private sector wages growth that looks at the month of January, showed an even sharper decline, with the increase adjusting downwards to just 1.2%, from an average of 6.9% in the previous 12 months. Samuel Tombs, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Bank of England was likely to set aside the rise in the employment rate and stubbornly low unemployment to focus on the drop in wages growth as a significant weakening of the labour market. There were 2.5 million people off work due to long-term sickness in the three months to January \u2013 up 2.6% quarter-on-quarter and 7.9% year-on-year and the highest since tracking of this statistic began in 1993, according to ONS. Tony Wilson, the director at the Institute for Employment Studies, said the figures showed there were still almost half a million fewer people in work than before the Covid-19 pandemic, driven by more people out of work due to long-term health conditions and more older people out of work."

            "date": "2023-03-13T16:55:49Z",
            "content": "Two ubiquitous consumer items of the 1990s \u2013 alcopops and CDs \u2013 will no longer count towards the monthly update of Britain\u2019s cost of living after the latest shake-up of the shopping basket used to measure price changes. In a sign it is no longer fashionable to order a fruit drink laced with booze in a pub and that the age of the compact disc is over, the Office for National Statistics said both products had fallen foul of its annual audit of the UK\u2019s spending habits. Non-chart CDs and alcopops \u2013 along with digital compact cameras \u2013 were the most high-profile casualties of the latest rejigging of the ONS inflation basket, which contains everything from cucumbers and TV licences to compost and tissues, and is used to measure the annual inflation rate. They have made way for new additions that reflect the environmentally aware, health conscious and property-obsessed state of modern Britain: e-bikes, frozen berries for making smoothies, and home security devices. The inflation basket is updated once a year by the ONS to take account of the changing tastes and habits of UK consumers and to ensure the official yardstick of the cost of living is as accurate as possible. How the cost of living is measured has taken on added significance over the past year following the rise in the annual inflation rate to a 40-year high of 11.1% \u2013 more than five times the government\u2019s 2% target \u2013 last autumn. Although inflation has since fallen to 10.1%, price increases have been especially marked for food and fuel, which has had a disproportionate impact on the poor. Less well-off households spend a higher proportion of their budgets on these staple items than better-off households. The inflation basket \u2013 first introduced in 1947 \u2013 now contains almost 750 goods and services and is designed to be representative of current spending patterns. Most items remain in the list from year to year, but the 26 items added and the 16 removed for 2023 are supposed to reflect the nation\u2019s changing tastes. Last year, the traditional men\u2019s suit \u2013 until then ever-present since 1947 \u2013 was a casualty of the working from home trend that emerged as a result of health precautions taken during the pandemic. Five years ago, gym leggings and quiche came in while bottled lager sold in nightclubs and pork pies were removed. In 2013, ebooks and blueberries were in, filled rolls sold in pubs and round lettuces were out. Alcopops, all the rage in the 1990s, were first introduced to the basket in 1997 while CDs were seen as the future of music when they made their debut on the list in 1987, the year spending on the new format overtook vinyl sales for the first time. But the rise of streaming and the second coming of vinyl have meant sales of CDs have been in steady decline in recent years, with the ONS now saying they would only include sales of Top 40 discs in the basket. Other changes made this year are the inclusion of infants\u2019 dresses and green beans, a broadening of the postage charges category to reflect the growth in parcel courier services, and the replacement of tampons by sanitary towels. The ONS said the influence of Covid-19 on the basket, which had been so obvious over the last couple of years, had faded from shopping habits in 2023. This year\u2019s changes pointed to the evolving choices of consumers and the rise of new technology. Mike Hardie, the ONS deputy director of prices transformation, said: \u201cThe impact of mobile phone technology continues to resonate with the removal of CDs and digital cameras from our basket, reflecting how most of us listen to music and take pictures straight from our phones these days. \u201cWith many people looking to reduce their impact on the environment, we have also introduced e-bikes, whose popularity has risen significantly in recent years.\u201d The ONS said it was changing the way it collected data on rail fares in order to better understand the prices being paid by travellers by train."

            "content": "Employers have warned that an \u201cexcessive\u201d 7% minimum wage rise in line with inflation advocated by unions could tip Australia into recession. It comes as the Albanese government has argued the Fair Work Commission should \u201censure the real wages of Australia\u2019s low-paid workers do not go backwards\u201d. The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, and the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, noted the government submission to the commission\u2019s annual minimum wage review \u201cdoes not suggest that across-the-board wages should automatically increase in line with inflation\u201d, implicitly leaving room for those on higher award wages to receive a lower increase. The Australian Industry Group made their claim responding to unions\u2019 call for a $1.50 an hour rise in the national minimum wage to $22.88. Initial submissions to the FWC\u2019s review, which sets the pay of more than 2.6 million employees on the national minimum or award wages, close on Friday. While the AiGroup is yet to put a figure on its preferred rise, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has asked for a 3.5% minimum wage increase, or 75c an hour, to $841.04 a week. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Acci chief executive, Andrew McKellar, said that would be a \u201creasonable and responsible\u201d increase given business would already have to pay a 0.5% increase in the superannuation guarantee from 1 July. On Wednesday the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed inflation had now eased to 6.8% in the year to February, but despite the signs that inflation has peaked both AiG and Acci have warned of the possibility of rise in the minimum wage adding to inflation. The AiGroup chief executive, Innes Willox, called on the Fair Work Commission to \u201cexercise restraint and caution\u201d. \u201c[Our] submission will draw attention to the real risk that an excessive wage rise would tip Australia into recession,\u201d he said. \u201cWith both the Reserve Bank and the federal government pledging to \u2018do what it takes\u2019 to get inflation under control, a wage rise anywhere near the 7% proposed by the ACTU would raise inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations.\u201d Willox said that households are \u201calready under pressure from increases in mortgage repayments\u201d and failure to curb inflation could lead to an \u201can additional round of interest rate rises\u201d. Willox said that a \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d pay rise would lead to a \u201crecession that we didn\u2019t have to have\u201d. McKellar said the wage case \u201cisn\u2019t about the top end of town, it\u2019s about small and family businesses which are the lifeblood of our local communities\u201d. \u201cConditions across the economy remain disparate, and many small businesses continue to struggle. \u201cAward-reliant sectors like accommodation, hospitality, retail, administration, arts and recreation sectors have all experienced falling profits over the past two years. \u201cWhile Australia appears to have turned a corner on inflation, it still remains stubbornly high.\u201d Burke and Chalmers said they \u201cbelieve the best way to ensure workers can deal with cost-of-living pressures is to ensure they earn enough to provide for their loved ones and to get ahead\u201d. The lowest-paid workers were \u201cmore likely to be women, under 30 years of age and employed as casuals\u201d, they said. On Thursday Chalmers rejected suggestions that wages should be suppressed to prevent an inflationary spiral, blaming inflation instead on the Russian war in Ukraine and interruption to supply chains. \u201cI think that if you made a list of all of the things that are giving us this inflation challenge in our economy, low-paid workers getting paid too much wouldn\u2019t be on that list,\u201d he told Channel Seven\u2019s Sunrise. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a wage price spiral \u2013 there\u2019s no indication that we might have one. \u201cAnd we think making sure that particularly the low paid can earn enough to support their loved ones is an important way for people to deal with these cost of living pressures, not a contributing factor to them.\u201d"

The latest PMI survey found there was a \u201crobust increase\u201d in overall business activity across the UK construction sector last month, driven by in commercial work and civil engineering activity, although housebuilding continued to contract. UK firefighters have accepted a pay offer aimed at averting strike action. Mining stocks have dropped in London, after China set a conservative growth target of around 5% this year.

Luxury car maker Aston Martin is on track for first place on the leaderboard of top-performing shares in London this morning, a day after a very credible performance in the first Formula One race of the season. Aston Martin is leading the FTSE 250 leaderboard, up 15%, having been up 25% at one stage this morning.

So what\u2019s going on? Anthony Dick, an auto analyst at Oddo BHF, reckons the F1 result could be a factor, although investors who have bet against Aston Martin could be caught in a short squeeze.

We think shares have run ahead of themselves and we would seek better entry points Just in: UK firefighters have accepted a pay offer aimed at averting strike action. About 96% of Fire Brigades Union (FBU) members who took part in a ballot voted in favour of the new pay offer, the union said. The turnout for the ballot was 84%. The pay offer includes a 7% rise backdated to last July and another 5% increase from July this year. This revised offer was made after a previous offer of 2% last summer was rejected as \u2018utterly inadequate\u2019 The FBU had recommended that members accept the new offer, in a ballot which opened on February 20 and closed today Monday. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s a step forward but it would not be the end of our campaigning on pay. \u201cWe think there is significant under-investment in the fire service and that needs to be addressed.\u201d Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, is concerned that the UK is not moving towards electric cars fast enough. Following this morning\u2019s news that new car registrations jumped 26% year-on-year in February, Gooding says: \u201cLooked at as a barometer for the economy, this rise in overall sales looks like good news. \u201cBut in terms of the cars we are choosing to buy, the battery-electric share of the market is disappointing given the role electric vehicles are set to play in meeting our climate change objectives. \u201cUnless we choose to drive less, by the end of 2030 we estimate that well over a third of all miles driven by cars must be zero emission from the exhaust. \u201cAt the moment it is under 2%, which suggests a far more rapid take-up of pure electric models is needed.\u201d Starbucks has revealed plans to invest \u00a330m in the UK and open 100 new cafes, a year after it was reported to be considering selling the British arm of the coffee chain. The investment plan came as the company reported it paid lower tax on its UK operations in 2022, even as gross profits surged, as royalty payments to other group companies expanded rapidly. The coffee chain paid \u00a34.6m in corporation tax in the year to 2 October 2022, compared with \u00a35.4m the year before, according to its latest accounts. Wall Street\u2019s main indexes have opened higher, as investors await testimonies from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to Congress later this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 large US companies, has gained 57 points or 0.17% to 33,448 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4% at the start of trading. The main event of this week may be Friday\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report, showing how many new jobs were created in America in February. January\u2019s NFP smashed forecasts, with a 517,000 increase in employment, and another strong report could prompt further interest rate increases. Craig Erlam,senior market analyst at OANDA, says: The jobs report on Friday will tell us whether the January data was a blip or something to be more concerned about. No one is expecting a repeat of last month but any indication that the labour market is still red-hot could see a fourth 25 basis point hike be more priced in. Transport Secretary Mark Harper is urging the RMT union to let its members consider the pay offer on the table from train operating companies, insisting it is a \u201cgood\u201d deal. Last month, members of the TSSA union have voted to accept the pay offers on the table, which are worth 9% over two years, ending their part in the long-running national rail dispute. The RMT, though, says the offers are inadequate and are planning strikes on 16 March across Network Rail and train operators, and on 18 and 30 March and 1 April at train operators. Speaking in Northumberland today, where a rail line from Ashington to Newcastle is due to reopen next year, Harper said (via PA Media): \u201cI was very pleased that the members of the TSSA, one of the rail unions, accepted the offers from both the train operating companies and Network Rail. \u201cThat\u2019s good to see, they are fair and reasonable offers that have been delivered. They\u2019re the best and final offers. \u201cI would urge the RMT to put the offers that they\u2019ve had to their members and let their members make the decision, and I think they\u2019re good offers. \u201cAnd I think that their members ought to accept them and I hope the rail union RMT reconsiders their decision not even to put those offers to their members. \u201cAnd if we get those offers delivered, we can all work together to deliver a better railway for passengers.\u201d Russia\u2019s budget deficit has jumped so far this year, as Moscow continues to spend heavily on the Ukraine war and energy revenues fall. Russia\u2019s federal budget deficit widened to 2.58 trillion roubles (\u00a328bn) in the first two months of the year, the finance ministry reports, as expenditure rose sharply as slumping oil and gas takings hit income. Reuters has the details: Russia\u2019s economy proved unexpectedly resilient in the face of Western sanctions last year, but a return to pre-conflict levels of prosperity may be far off as more government spending is directed towards the military and price caps squeeze Russia\u2019s crucial energy export earnings. Oil and gas revenues were 46.4% lower at 947 billion roubles in Jan-Feb than in the same period last year, the finance ministry\u2019s preliminary data showed, with overall budget revenues for the month down 24.8%. Spending was 51.5% higher in the first two months of 2023, at 5.74 trillion roubles. In the same period last year, Russia had recorded a surplus of 415 billion roubles. Tony Danker has said it is \u201cmortifying to hear that I have caused offense or anxiety to any colleague,\u201d following the investigation into complaints about the CBI chief\u2019s conduct.

Costa Coffee has unveiled plans to hike salaries for more than 16,000 UK workers, ahead of increases in the minimum wage next month. The coffee chain, which is owned by the Coca-Cola Company, said it will raise the base rate of pay for workers across its 1,520 company-owned stores in the UK from \u00a310 an hour to \u00a310.70 an hour from April 1. More experienced baristas will see their base pay rise from \u00a310.53 to at least \u00a311.23 an hour, depending on location and role. The rises will see pay increase by between 6.1% and 7.3%, excluding bonuses \u2013 working out at 6.7% on average. It follows an announcement by rival Pret A Manger last week that it would increase the base salaries of its workers from the start of next month by 2.9%, from \u00a310.30 an hour to \u00a310.60 an hour. From 1 April, the UK\u2019s national living wage \u2013 the minimum amount that companies are allowed to pay people over 23 \u2013 rises 9.7% to \u00a310.42 an hour. Mayors in the north of England are meeting to demand the government \u201cget a grip\u201d on appalling rail services, with TransPennine Express (TEP) on track to cancel more than 20,000 trains this year. The operator has already cancelled about a quarter of services in 2023, with 40% scrapped in one week in January due to a lack of staff. Commuters are also facing higher costs after rail fares in England and Wales increased by an average of 5.9% on Sunday. Tracy Brabin, the Labour mayor of West Yorkshire, who will meet counterparts in Newcastle on Monday, said the north could no longer \u201cstagger on\u201d, with TPE alone likely to cancel 23,000 services in 2023 at the current rate. Brabin said: \u201cGovernment have to get involved, they have to understand we need to invest in transport across the north.I don\u2019t think people in the south and across the country really understand the service we\u2019re being forced to endure from TransPennine.\u201d She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIf things don\u2019t improve, by the end of the year 23,000 services will have been cancelled. This is totally unacceptable, and ministers must get a grip.\u201d The chief economist of the European Central Bank has hinted that it will continue to raise interest rates beyond the hike expected this month. In a speech this morning, Philip Lane said the ECB must take \u201crobust\u201d action if underlying inflation dynamics are at odds with its inflation forecasts. Data last week showed a surprise rise in core inflation, up to 5.6%, well above expectations for a rise of 5.3%, and further from the ECB\u2019s headline inflation target of 2%. Headline inflation was also higher than expected, at 8.5% in February. In a lecture at Trinity College Dublin, Lane suggested that further rate increases will be needed: The current information on underlying inflation pressures suggests that it will be appropriate to raise rates further beyond our March meeting, while the exact calibration beyond March should reflect the information contained in the upcoming macroeconomic projections, together with the incoming data on inflation and the operation of the monetary transmission mechanism. Lane added that lifting interest rates to a \u201csufficiently restrictive level\u201d, to dampen demand and growth, will \u201ccounter-act above-target medium-term inflation pressures\u201d and avoid inflation expectations becoming de-anchored. It will also deter \u2018excessive\u2019 pay rises and price hikes, he added: In particular, the dampening of demand through the tightening of monetary policy means that price setters and wage setters are on notice that excessive price and wage increases will not be sustainable. Reuters reported last week that the ECB\u2019s governing council has been shown evidence that European companies have been lifting their profit margins, amid fears over \u2018greedflation\u2019: Strike action at the Drax power station in Yorkshire has ended after workers secured a \u201cdramatically improved\u201d pay offer, the Unite union has announced. Unite says that fresh negotiations have been held after 180 workes held a day\u2019s strike action on Monday 20 February after rejecting an 8% pay increase, below the headline rate of inflation. Drax has now made a improved pay offer, including back pay, which Unite says is worth 16% to the lowest paid workers. Workers have accepted this offer in a ballot. Strikes had been scheduled for later this month, and in April. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \u201cThis was an excellent increase for Unite members at Drax, who by showing unity and standing up to their employer secured a vastly improved pay increase. \u201cThe pay increase at Drax demonstrates how Unite\u2019s absolute commitment to focus on jobs, pay and conditions is delivering for members.\u201d Investment bank Citigroup is pressing on with a post-Brexit hiring spree in Paris. Citigroup is building a new trading floor in Paris, as part of a plan to nearly double its staff in the French city, Bloomberg reports. The new floor in its existing building \u2014 located steps from the Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and the Arc de Triomphe \u2014 will help Citigroup increase staffing for its trading division to 250 in the coming years, up from 130 currently, according to Fabio Lisanti, head of the bank\u2019s trading business across Europe, excluding the UK. The new floor is set to include at least 85 desks. Citigroup is growing its Paris operation into a trading hub, having previously only had a sales presence there. Following Brexit, Wall Street banks such as Citigroup have been adjusting their operations, under pressure to trade European assets within European Union countries. Lisanti says London remains Citi\u2019s main trading hub, but explains: But we have and will move certain risk management and risk books in Europe. We\u2019ve already moved quite a few and there\u2019s more to go.\u201d Worryingly for the City of London, Lisanti says the move to Paris means it can give a better service to clients. He says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to hire talent in Paris that we would never have been able to attract in London. One of the things we should not forget is us moving to Paris or to Europe, there is a strong commercial reason for that. We will cover our clients better, we will create better teams, stronger teams and ultimately be able to generate revenues more effectively and efficiently.\u201d Tony Danker, the boss of the Confederation of British Industry, has stepped aside amid an investigation into complaints about his conduct, my colleague Anna Isaac reports. The decision to hire a law firm to investigate him comes after the Guardian approached the CBI last week about a formal complaint that was made in January, as well a number of alleged informal reports of concerns over his behaviour. The formal complaint involved a female CBI employee who it is understood claimed the director general of the business lobbying organisation made unwanted contact with her and considered this unwanted conduct to be sexual harassment. Danker continued in his role after the formal complaint was made, representing the influential organisation in the media and at public events, most recently a CBI conference last Wednesday where the keynote speaker was the education secretary, Gillian Keegan. The CBI confirmed it had received a formal complaint about Danker\u2019s \u201cworkplace conduct\u201d in January but opted not to escalate it to a disciplinary process. \u201cThe allegation was investigated thoroughly and was dealt with comprehensively, in line with CBI procedure,\u201d said CBI president Brian McBride. \u201cThe CBI investigation determined that the issue did not require escalation to a disciplinary process.\u201d After the Guardian inquired on Thursday about the formal complaint and raised several additional allegations about his behaviour towards other members of staff, including concern that the director general had been viewing employees\u2019 personal Instagram profiles, the CBI said it had started an independent investigation and that Danker had asked to step aside during it. It has hired Joanna Chatterton, head of the employment law at Fox Williams, to lead the investigation. Matthew Fell, the CBI\u2019s chief UK policy director, has replaced Danker on an interim basis. Here\u2019s the full story: Back in the eurozone, retail spending was weaker than expected at the start of this year. Eurostat data shows that retail sales rose by 0.3% month-on-month in January, but were 2.3% lowe than a year before. Economists had expected a 1.0% month-on-month rise, and a 1.8% year-on-year fall, Reuters says. It suggests that high inflation, and the squeeze from higher borrowing costs, continues to weigh on the euro area. The data indicates that Europe hasn\u2019t enjoyed an economic rebound yet \u2013 with ING predicting GDP growth will be flat in the first quarter of 2023. ING economist Bert Colijn says: This is a weak start to the first quarter and makes growth over the quarter a challenge. Retail sales have been on a declining trend since November 2021, but taking the latest data into account, we can see that there has been a more rapid decline since the autumn of last year. Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, fears that the UK economy will drop into recession this year, despite the pick-up in construction growth last month. Pugh says the economy has been more resilient than expected, but suspects February\u2019s PMI surveys may be overstating its strength. He explains: \u201cThe rebound in the construction PMI is more evidence of just how resilient the economy has turned out to be. But beware a false spring. We still expect the economy to fall into a mild recession in the first half of this year and the construction industry will be hit hardest by the 400bps increase in interest rates over the last year. As such, it probably won\u2019t be long before the construction PMI resumes its downward trend. \u2018The bounce back in the construction PMI in February, to its highest level since May, follows the rebound in the services and manufacturing PMIs. Undoubtedly, the economy has been much more resilient than expected given the cost-of-living crisis and the massive increase in interest rates. But the across the board rebound the PMIs last month should probably be taken with a pinch of salt. UK energy companies are failing to treat many business customers fairly, the Institute of Directors says today. The IoD has written to industry regulator Ofgem urging them to take action to secure \u201ca well-functioning energy market\u201d for non-domestic customers. The IoD survey has found that one in five (18%) businesses encountered at least one form of disadvantageous treatment by energy suppliers in the previous six months. The most commonly reported problem was energy suppliers requesting a larger share of the bill to be paid in advance (11%). This was followed by refusal to negotiate payment terms when requested to do so (6%) and refusal to renew a contract (6%). Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, says Ofgem must heed the concerns of business customers: At a time when energy prices are at an all-time high, it is important that the energy regulator ensures that any unnecessary burdens for businesses are removed. The inclusion of take or pay clauses in energy supply contracts to non-domestic customers runs counter to the government\u2019s messaging to business regarding the cost and environmental imperatives to reduce energy consumption. It is therefore important that Ofgem identifies and recommends the actions needed to address the concerns of business energy customers.\u201d This morning\u2019s surprisingly strong construction sector report is the latest sign that the risk of recession is easing, says Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. Beck points out that there have been other \u201cupbeat indicators\u201d recently, such as rising retail sales, consumer confidence and tax receipts. Beck says: February\u2019s construction Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) joined its services and manufacturing counterparts in signalling stronger activity in February. Although the economy continues to face significant headwinds, the risk of a recession is receding. The near-term outlook for the construction sector remains challenging. Higher interest rates will likely weigh on residential and commercial activity, the housing market downturn and changes to planning rules risk discouraging housebuilding, and falling household real incomes are expected to discourage spending on home improvements. However, the recent improvement in the mood-music surrounding the economy\u2019s prospects, including some recovery in consumer and business confidence, should bolster the construction sector, as will falling energy costs and disinflationary pressures in general. As a relatively cyclical sector, construction firms could be among the first to benefit from the economic recovery that the EY ITEM Club expects to become embedded later this year. Confidence across the UK construction sector hit its highest level in a year last month, today\u2019s PMI report shows. Dr John Glen, Chief Economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says easing supply chain problems and a slowdown in cost inflation cheered building firms. However, rising mortgage rates continued to dampen the housebuilding sector. Glen explains: \u201cThe overall figure paints a bright picture of progress in the construction sector with a robust jump in output last month. Supply deliveries were at their most improved since January 2020 and some commentators mentioned sourcing closer to home to avoid logjams in supply chains caused by China\u2019s Covid policy and the war in Ukraine. New order levels were also at their highest since November 2022 but these strong numbers belie the fact that there is uneven growth in building activity in the UK. Commercial and civil engineering projects dominated this performance with activity on projects such as HS2 and commercial builds. Residential building on the other hand was the odd one out with a third month in contraction as mortgages rates put a dampener on the number of house purchases and buyers were unwilling to commit. Builders themselves remained cheerful as optimism rose sharply and almost half of the survey\u2019s respondents believed business would improve in 2023. With the slowest inflationary rises for raw materials since November 2020 this offered some relief, and it was cheaper transportation costs that helped offset salary and energy costs which were still rising The return to growth in the UK construction sector last month will be welcomed by contractors who are hoping the worst of the economy\u2019s storms have passed, says Max Jones, director in Lloyds Bank\u2019s infrastructure and construction team. Jones explains: \u201cDespite an uncertain economic picture, many in the industry feel confident. Payment times are proving resilient across supply chains, pipelines on infrastructure and commercial projects are holding up well and inflation, for materials and labour, looks to have passed its peak. \u201cThe industry will be closely monitoring this month\u2019s Budget. While few expect the Chancellor to pull any rabbits out of his hat, clarity around future projects, particularly in the regions, will give contractors the confidence they need to plan and invest in the future.\u201d Just in: the UK\u2019s construction sector rebounded back into growth last month as fears of a recession fade. The S&amp;P Global/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), which tracks activity in the building sector, jumped to 54.6 in February, up from 48.4 in January. That shows the fastest growth since May 2022, and well above expectations of a reading around 49.1. Anything over 50 shows a rise in activity. There was a \u201crobust increase\u201d in overall business activity across the UK construction sector last month, S&amp;P Global reports, after two months of decline. The rate of growth was the strongest since May 2022, supported by a marked rebound in commercial work and a positive contribution from civil engineering activity. But, activity in the house-building sector decreased for the third month running. Many housebuilders have been cutting back following a drop in demand, as house prices fall. Tim Moore, economics Director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says that housebuilding was the \u2018weak spot\u2019 in the sector: Some firms noted that fading recession fears and an improving global economic outlook had boosted client confidence in the commercial segment. At the same time, work on major infrastructure projects such as HS2 contributed to the expansion of civil engineering activity in February. Cutbacks to new house building projects remained the weak spot for construction sector activity, with total residential work falling for the third month running in February. Survey respondents often commented on subdued demand and a headwind from elevated interest rates. Construction companies appear increasingly confident about the year ahead business outlook, with optimism rebounding strongly from the lows seen in the final quarter of 2022. Softer inflationary pressures and the least widespread supplier delays for just over three years were factors supporting business expectations in February.\u201d A backlog of orders for new cars, which were held up by recent supply chain problems, helped boost registrations last month, says Chris Knight, UK automotive partner for KPMG: \u201cNew car sales headed into March\u2019s plate change month in a relatively healthy state, thanks to a strong order bank built up over previous months of short supply. \u201cBattery electric vehicles represented 16% of the new car market last year, but aside from uncertainty linked to the cost of living crisis - whether electric vehicle transition can continue to maintain momentum also depends on the pace of rollout of charging points and opening up the market to more consumers via the availability of lower cost new EVs.\u201d The jump in new car registrations last month comes as confidence grows across the sector, says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT: After seven months of growth, it is no surprise that the UK automotive sector is facing the future with growing confidence. It is vital, however, that government takes every opportunity to back the market, which plays a significant role in Britain\u2019s economy and net zero ambition. As we move into \u2018new plate month\u2019 in March, with more of the latest high-tech cars available, the upcoming Budget must deliver measures that drive this transition, increasing affordability and ease of charging for all. It\u2019s official: UK new car registrations grew by 26.2% year-on-year in February as 74,441 new cars joined Britain\u2019s roads. That\u2019s according to the latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), just released, which shows last month was the busiest February for car sales since 2020. This is the seventh month of consecutive growth, as the easing of supply chain shortages help the car market to recover. Deliveries to private buyers up 5.8%, while purchases by large fleets jumped 46.2%. Business registrations rose by a mere 0.7%, or just nine cars. The SMMT reports that hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) recorded the most significant growth of all fuel types, up 40.0%. HEVs have a fossil fuel engine, which can charge an electric battery which can drive an electric drivetrain. Petrol sales were 35.8% higher than a year ago, while diesel registrations fell by -7.0%. Battery electric vehicle (BEV) registrations were up 18.2%, and make up one in six new UK car registrations, while sales of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) were 1.0% higher. The SMMT are urging Jeremy Hunt to announce measures to support the electric car market in next week\u2019s budget. They say: This should include a long-term plan for chargepoint investment, aligning VAT on public charging with domestic energy use, and reviewing the Vehicle Excise Duty premium that will unfairly penalise EV buyers switching to this inevitably more expensive technology in the future. In the City, shares in mining giants are sliding after Beijing announced a surprisingly low growth target for this year. Anglo American (-3.2%), Rio Tinto (-2.3%) and Antofagasta (-2.3%) are among the top fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning, following China\u2019s decision to aim for an economic expansion of \u201caround 5 per cent\u201d for 2023. The oil price has dipped a little too, as traders calculate that China\u2019s reopening after Covid-19 restrictions will not provide as much growth as expected. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Caution seemed the order of the day across markets early on Monday as China set itself one of the lowest gross domestic product target in many years, hinting to investors that the big reopening boom may not be as positive for the global economy as hoped. Beijing set a target of around 5% growth this year, creating a relatively low bar for the regime to clear. Oil and other industrial commodities slipped on the news, whilst basic resources stocks in London were hit, dragging the FTSE 100 marginally into the red at the open. Beijing\u2019s target signals that policymakers are not planning any large-scale stimulus measures now, says Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. Haefele explains that China is relying on a sharp rebound in consumption, and on investment, adding: \u201cOur positive outlook on China\u2019s recovery prospects is a key driver for our global equity preference for emerging markets, while in our Asia strategy we rate China equities as most preferred.\u201d The eurozone\u2019s construction sector shrank again in February, for the 10th month running. The S&amp;P Global Eurozone Construction Total Activity Index has risen to 47.6 in February from 46.1 in January \u2013 still below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. The relative improvement in the headline index was supported by softer drops in both residential and civil engineering activity, S&amp;P Global says. The sector has been hit by rising interest rates since last summer, weak consumer confidence, and increased costs. Home building dropped again across the eurozone last month, extending a decline that began last May. But more encouragingly, construction firms took on more staff, led by firms in France and Italy. Annabel Fiddes, economics associate director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: The latest PMI data showed that the eurozone construction sector moved closer to stabilisation in February, with firms signalling the softest reduction in overall activity for nine months. This was underpinned by weaker falls in construction output across Germany and Italy, which offset a more marked decline in France. The downturn in new business also continued to ease, though sales still dropped considerably overall, which contributed to a sustained fall in purchasing activity. Entrepreneur Sir James Dyson is urging the government not to lift taxes on businesses, claiming that a double tax grab will hurt the economy. In a letter to Jeremy Hunt, seen by The Sun, Dyson warned the chancellor of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of hiking corporation tax and bringing in a new global levy on multinationals agreed by the OECD. Dyson, who has criticised Rishi Sunak\u2019s administration before, told Hunt that the Government has \u201cdone nothing but pile tax upon tax on to British companies.\u201d He reminds the chancellor that pharmaceuticals firm AstraZeneca recently chose to build a $360m advanced manufacturing factory in Ireland, not the UK, and cited \u2018discouraging\u2019 UK tax rates. He writes: \u201cIs it any wonder that the economy is teetering on recession, or that companies like AstraZeneca are deciding to take their investment elsewhere?\u201d Dyson wants Hunt to drop plans to lift corporation tax from 19% to 25% in April. He argues that this, and the new Global Minimum Tax on multinationals, \u201cwill do nothing\u201d to generate the recovery and growth we need. More here: Tycoon Sir James Dyson warns Jeremy Hunt against double tax grab on business ahead of Budget In January, Dyson claimed that the \u201cshortsighted\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d economic policies pursued by Sunak\u2019s government have left the country in a state of \u201cCovid inertia\u201d, and that \u201cgrowth has become a dirty word\u201d. The boss of energy giant Shell has warned that America is significantly more attractive than Britain for energy investment Shell\u2019s new chief executive, Wael Sawan, has told The Times that that UK government should \u201ctake a page from some of the things that the US have done recently, through the Inflation Reduction Act\u201d. The IRA is a $369bn (\u00a3300bn) package of subsidies to spur green investment in America, which has spurred the European Union to push on with its own subsidy plans. The UK, though, has claimed that the IRA package is protectionist, and has not yet responded with a similar package of its own. Sawan says that the IRA provides \u201cten-year clarity and tangible, fixed incentives that people know to bank on\u201d. Instead, he warns, the UK\u2019s focus on windfall taxes, planning delays and uncertainty over subsidies make Britain a less attractive market. Asked how Britain ranked in terms of attractiveness for energy investments, Sawan said the US was \u201cahead significantly\u201d and that Europe was also ahead of Britain. More here: US is more attractive than Britain for energy investment, says Shell chief Campaigners are calling for an end to the \u201cpeak fare rip off\u201d, where commuters in some parts of the country face far higher mark-ups to travel at busy times. The call came after regulated rail fares in England and Wales jumped by 5.9% on Sunday \u2013 the biggest hike in a decade \u2013 adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of many annual season tickets despite record levels of poor service. Consumer groups are now urging operators to make peak fares \u2013 which are not necessarily affected by the 5.9% rise \u2013 more equitable across the country and to reduce them on less popular days to combat overcrowding. The news that London listed big data firm WANdisco is eyeing New York to create a dual listing (see 7.25am) is a reminder of the City\u2019s struggles to attract tech companies. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says London is not facing a \u2018mass exodus\u2019, but points out that recent technology floats have struggled: According to Sky News, it has hired bankers from Evercore Partners to help with the preparations. WANdisco\u2019s chairman and CEO David Richards first discussed the possibility of a US listing in 2017. The news comes after Arm Holdings abandoned London as a potential location for its IPO, FTSE 100 building business CRH also said it was planning to list in the US and Flutter was considering a secondary listing in New York. This has raised concerns about a potential flight of listed businesses away from the London Stock Exchange post Brexit to the United States. However we are far from seeing a mass exodus from the London market as of yet. The City has so far managed to preserve its position as Europe\u2019s leading global financial hub. One of the biggest challenges for the UK market has been its struggle to attract tech giants. New York continues to be the go-to destination for tech behemoths with the Nasdaq boasting giants like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. While the FTSE 100 enjoyed relative resilience last year in part thanks to its shortage of tech stocks, this has long been a criticism and meant that the UK large-cap index missed out on the gains enjoyed stateside from the tech boom prior to 2022. There have been some high-profile tech disasters in London including Deliveroo\u2019s calamitous IPO and THG\u2019s share price slide, adding to the sense of caution towards the UK among tech businesses deciding where to list.\u201d WANdisco, a \u2018big data\u2019 business listed in London, has joined the growing ranks of companies considering a listing on the New York stock exchange. WANdisco, which is headquartered in Sheffield, England and San Ramon, California, has told the City this morning that it is in the early stages of exploring a listing in the US, to run alongside its London listing. Yesterday, Sky News reported that WANdisco was preparing to list its shares in the US \u201camid an intensifying debate about the waning attractiveness of the City to public companies\u201d. Last week, UK chip designer Arm chose to only list in the US, rebuffing London, and building materials giant CRH laid out plans to move its shares to the US. WANdisco reminds shareholders that it has been considering a listing in New York for some time, and isn\u2019t planning to quit London. It says this morning that: As a dual UK and US headquartered technology company, WANdisco has long-stated its intention to consider an additional listing of its ordinary shares in the United States. The company can confirm that it is in the early stages of proactively exploring this option. The Company also confirms that it remains committed to London\u2019s Alternative Investment Market (\u201cAIM\u201d) and to maintaining its current UK AIM listing. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK car sales jumped by a quarter last month, while the cost of travelling by train across the country has risen again. British new car registrations rose by a quarter in February, according to preliminary industry data released on Monday. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the new car market grew by 25% last month in a year-on-year basis, despite the economic pressures from the cost of living crisis on households. Plug-in electric vehicles made up about a quarter of the registrations, meaning that almost half a million plug-in cars are expected to join the road by the end of 2023. The final data, from trade body SMMT, is due at 9am this morning. Last weekend, train passengers were hit by the largest increase in fares for more than a decade on Sunday despite record levels of poor reliability. Fares in England and Wales rose by up to 5.9% on average, adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of many annual season tickets. It\u2019s the largest increase in annual fares since a 6.1% hike across Britain in 2012, analysis shows. More here: Also coming up today Investors are digesting the news that China\u2019s government has set a modest target for economic growth this year, as the annual session of its National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) begins. Beijing is aiming foreconomic growth this year of around 5% on Sunday, below last year\u2019s goal of 5.5%, but above the 3% growth actually achieved.

            "title": "UK inflation rise complicates Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision",
            "date": "2023-03-22T10:37:19Z",
            "content": "For millions of households in Britain, there had been hope that the worst of the cost of living crisis was behind them. But last month\u2019s unexpected increase for inflation \u2013 reversing three months of progress \u2013 is as a painful reminder the squeeze is far from over. February\u2019s surprise increase will complicate matters for the Bank of England, in particular. Financial markets had been betting over recent days that the worst banking crisis since 2008 could tempt Threadneedle Street to hold back from further interest rate rises. Before its next rate decision on Thursday, a further rise in borrowing costs is increasingly likely. Soaring food prices were behind the latest jump for inflation, alongside rising alcohol prices in pubs and restaurants after discounting in January. With an increase for food and non-alcoholic drink inflation to a record high of 18% \u2013 the highest level in 45 years \u2013 Britain\u2019s poorest households, who spend a larger share of their income on basic essentials, will be feeling the worst of the pinch. Supply shortages of salads and cucumbers drove much of the rise as bad weather in Europe, and supply chain disruption led to rationing on the supermarket shelves, raising questions over the impact of Brexit given the supply problem appeared not to be replicated in the EU. For the Bank the focus will be on an unexpected increase in core inflation \u2013 the measure that strips out the effects of food and energy from the headline rate \u2013 after a jump from 5.8% in January to 6.2% last month. This could suggest that domestically generated inflation is proving more persistent than feared. The suggestion is that Britain\u2019s stronger economic performance than forecast at the start of the year could strengthen the power of businesses to keep pushing prices up, while rate setters will also be watching for signs that staff shortages are maintaining upward pressure on wage growth. However, it is important to note that all the big forecasters are still expecting a significant drop in inflation later this year. It is not unusual for the headline rate to bob up and down from month to month, belying a more general trend in one direction or another. This rapid fall \u2013 seen as \u201cguaranteed\u201d by one Bank rate setter, Silvana Tenreyro \u2013 comes about mostly because of the way inflation is calculated. Because the figure is for the annual rate of change in an average basket of goods and services, the surge in the immediate aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine a year ago will drop from the calculation. Inflation should therefore resume a downward trajectory in March, when this strong base effect from the comparison to March 2022 \u2013 when energy prices surged \u2013 is expected to lower the headline rate. In April there should be a further fall, when consumer energy prices will hold steady but the anniversary of April 2022\u2019s huge 54% increase in the Ofgem price cap is reached. This is helped further by the government extending its energy price guarantee at the current level of \u00a32,500 for an average household bill. Given this mixed picture, the Bank\u2019s rate decision on Thursday could still be finely balanced. With inflation sticking at more than five times its 2% target rate, the optics of staying put during the cost of living emergency are tough to justify. On the other hand, should the crash in the banking sector prove more than a blip, lenders reacting with caution to the crisis and making it harder for households and businesses to get a loan, will do some of the same work as higher interest rates. With Britain\u2019s economy still perilously close to recession, increasing rates much further could make the difference between a near miss and a worse outcome."

            "date": "2023-03-15T17:42:33Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt has said he is \u201cproving the doubters wrong\u201d as he used a stronger than expected economic performance to help fund new tax breaks for business investment and a drive to get people back into the workforce. Setting out \u00a322bn of higher spending and tax breaks in the next financial year, the chancellor said the British economy would avoid a technical recession in 2023 with inflation falling by half. However, the economy is still expected to shrink this year. In an attempt to keep older workers from retiring early, Hunt announced a surprise decision to scrap the \u00a31m cap on tax-free pension savings, saying: \u201cNo one should be pushed out of the workforce for tax reasons.\u201d Labour said it would benefit only the 1% with the biggest pension pots. The chancellor said he would reboot Britain\u2019s faltering economy with a focus on growing the workforce with targeted support for working parents, over-50s and those unable to work because of health issues and disabilities. Those measures include: In England, 30 hours of free childcare for children of working parents aged nine months and over from 2025. Increasing the tax-free allowance for pensions from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000 a year as well as abolishing the tax-free cap. Abolishing the work capability assessment, allowing those with health problems to seek work without losing benefits. However, sanctions for those seeking work will be tightened, including those working less than 18 hours a week. Hunt\u2019s second big move was to incentivise business investment, with up to \u00a39bn a year in tax reliefs for companies making productivity-boosting investments, in an effort to bolster long-term economic growth. It comes after furious lobbying from company bosses and backbench Conservative MPs, worried over a sharp rise in corporation tax from April from 19% to 25%. Hunt said the regime of \u201cfull expensing\u201d would last for three years, with the intention to keep the tax break permanently. Saying it would foster an \u201centerprise economy\u201d in the UK, he argued the changes would give the UK the \u201cbest investment incentives of any advanced economy\u201d. He said: \u201cWe tackle the two biggest barriers that stop businesses growing, investment incentives, and labour supply. \u201cToday we build for the future, with inflation down, debt falling and growth up. The declinists are wrong and the optimists are right.\u201d Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the chancellor\u2019s measures were the \u201clatest in a long line of changes and temporary tweaks\u201d. Overall, he said the budget included several \u201csensible\u201d measures, but he warned the chop and change approach to business tax showed \u201cthere\u2019s no stability, no certainty, and no sense of a wider plan\u201d. Hunt outlined his plans for the country\u2019s finances against a backdrop of increasing turbulence in global financial markets as banking shares were rocked by concerns about Credit Suisse, one of Europe\u2019s biggest lenders, extending days of turmoil triggered by the collapse of the US lender Silicon Valley Bank. However, updated forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, showed the economy would still shrink by 0.2% in 2023, even though it would avoid two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 the technical definition of a recession. In a well-trailed budget statement, the chancellor said his measures would bring down inflation while \u201chelping people struggling during tough times\u201d. The OBR said inflation was forecast to fall by more than half, from a peak of 10.7% last autumn \u2013 the highest rate since the early 1980s \u2013 to 2.9% by the end of the year, in a widely expected upgrade after estimates made in November. The government will freeze fuel duty for motorists, as well as beer duties, alongside extending energy support. Hunt said the combined impact reduced inflation by almost three-quarters of a percent this year. Hunt said his measures were designed to encourage people back to work after a dramatic fall in employment among over-50s since the Covid pandemic, which had left businesses already affected by Brexit grappling with chronic staff shortages. Answering calls from business groups to help parents with childcare costs to encourage mothers to return to work or increase their hours, Hunt said the government would expand existing support for preschool children to offer 30 hours of funding for one- and two-year-olds, at a cost of \u00a34bn. \u201cToday we deliver the next part of our plan, a budget for growth,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cNot just the growth that comes when you emerge from a downturn, but long-term sustainable healthy growth that pays for our NHS and schools, and provides jobs for younger people.\u201d In a widely expected move, the government earlier on Wednesday confirmed that its energy price guarantee supporting households would continue to cap the typical annual gas and electricity bill to \u00a32,500 a customer until the end of June. Confirming several widely trailed measures, the chancellor pledged to create 12 investment zones in eight areas, including the West Midlands and the north-east, \u201cto drive business investment and level up\u201d the country, each backed with \u00a380m of government funding. Hunt announced a budget designed to stabilise the economy after the fallout from the disastrous Liz Truss/Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget in September. But Hunt\u2019s budget was in danger of being overshadowed as fears for the banking sector gripped the City of London. In London, the FTSE 100, Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index, slumped by 2.5% to its lowest level since last December. Trading in the shares of some of Europe\u2019s biggest banks, including BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and UniCredit, was briefly halted and restarted as the speed at which their stock prices fell triggered automatic circuit breakers. The sell-off was prompted when Credit Suisse\u2019s largest investor, Saudi National Bank, said it could not provide the Swiss bank with more financial assistance because of regulatory rules."

            "date": "2023-03-31T23:02:08Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s businesses are reporting a spring surge in order books, boosting hopes that the economy may finally be recovering after flirting with recession late last year. After official figures showing the UK performed slightly more strongly than originally thought towards the end of 2022, the Institute of Directors said there had been an improvement in demand, confidence, hiring and investment intentions in March. The IoD said its survey of more than 900 firms \u2013 which showed a pick up in growth across all sectors \u2013 suggested the economy would confound predictions in the budget two weeks ago that output would fall in the first three months of 2023. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cThe data coming from our members is strongly suggestive of growth across all sectors in recent weeks. In particular, the strengthening of order books since the end of last year points to an economy performing better in the first quarter than was anticipated as recently as the March budget.\u201d Half of all firms (50%) reported in March that their order books were healthier than at the end of 2022, with 22% saying they were weaker. The balance of +28 was up from +8 in November 2022 and -2 in September 2022. The IoD said net positive scores are recorded in all parts of the economy, including consumer-facing sectors and manufacturing. Ussher said: \u201cWhile this is undoubtedly good news, strong demand also means that it may take longer than many forecasters currently expect for inflation to come within sight of the Bank of England\u2019s target any time soon.\u201d Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate rose from 10.1% to 10.4% in February, while figures for the 20-country eurozone for March released on Friday showed a fall from 8.5% to 6.9%. The Office for National Statistics confirmed on Friday the economy narrowly avoided being in technical recession \u2013 two successive quarters of negative growth \u2013 in the second half of 2022. The ONS said it now thought the economy shrank by 0.1% rather than 0.2% between July and September and grew by 0.1% in the final quarter rather than remaining flat. Despite fears that a combination of high inflation, strikes and financial turmoil would lead to falling output, builders, manufacturers and the telecoms sector all recorded faster growth than initially estimated. Government help with energy bills underpinned consumer spending in the fourth quarter but business investment \u2013 which had previously been estimated to have grown by almost 5% \u2013 fell slightly. Despite the revisions, ONS data shows the economy has been broadly flat since early 2022, growing by 0.1% in each of the second and fourth quarters and contracting by 0.1% in the third quarter. The economy remains smaller than it was in late 2019 before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, although by 0.6% rather than the 0.8% previously estimated. Darren Morgan, an ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cThe economy performed a little more strongly in the latter half of last year than previously estimated, with later data showing telecommunications, construction and manufacturing all faring better than initially thought in the latest quarter. \u201cHouseholds saved more in the last quarter, with their finances boosted by the government\u2019s energy bill support scheme.\u201d Analysts said the economy would continue to struggle in the months ahead against a backdrop of rising borrowing costs and the end of government support for energy bills. Ruth Gregory, of Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe upward revision to real GDP growth in Q3 and Q4 of last year suggests that high inflation took a slightly smaller toll on the economy than we previously thought. But with around two-thirds of the drag on real activity from higher rates yet to be felt, we still think the economy will slip into a recession this year.\u201d Gabriella Dickens, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said she was pencilling in declines of 0.1% in both of the first two quarters of 2023. \u201cThe economy likely will continue to flatline in the first half of this year,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2023-03-29T16:14:11Z",
            "content": "A UN resolution was adopted on Wednesday that should make it easier to hold polluting countries legally accountable for failing to tackle the climate emergency, in a vote which was hailed as a historic victory for climate justice. The UN general assembly adopted by consensus the resolution spearheaded by Vanuatu, a tiny Pacific island nation vulnerable to extreme climate effects, and youth activists to secure a legal opinion from the international court of justice (ICJ) to clarify states\u2019 obligations to tackle the climate crisis \u2013 and specify any consequences countries should face for inaction. \u201cToday we have witnessed a win for climate justice of epic proportions,\u201d said Ishmael Kalsakau, prime minister of Vanuatu. \u201cToday\u2019s historic resolution is the beginning of a new era in multilateral climate cooperation, one that is more fully focused on upholding the rule of international law and an era that places human rights and intergenerational equity at the forefront of climate decision-making.\u201d \u201cWe are just ecstatic that the world has listened to the Pacific youth,\u201d said Cynthia Houniuhi, president of Pacific Island students fighting climate change (PISFCC). \u201cThrough no fault of our own, we are living with devastating tropical cyclones, flooding, biodiversity loss and sea level rise. We have contributed the least to the global emissions that are drowning our land. \u201cAs young people, the world\u2019s failure to stop planet-killing emissions is not a theoretical problem. It is our present and it is our future that is being sold out.\u201d The resolution, which was co-sponsored by more than 120 countries including the UK, but not the US, will help establish a legal litmus test of sorts for the global climate justice movement seeking to hold countries to account for climate failures in the courts. It comes on the day the Biden administration opened an auction to drill 73m acres of the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas \u2013 and just days after the self-acclaimed \u201cclimate president\u201d approved a massive, multi-decade-long oil and gas drilling project in Alaska, which will create one of the largest \u201ccarbon bombs\u201d on US soil. While the opinion from the world\u2019s highest court will not be binding in domestic courts, establishing international legal rules can be influential on judges and governments. It also represents the first attempt to establish climate action obligations under international law, which advocates hope will strengthen climate-related litigation by helping vulnerable states and advocates hold countries accountable for their action and inaction. The resolution emerged out of mounting frustration at the mismatch between the global community\u2019s rhetoric and action on climate change, amid escalating losses for countries such as Vanuatu, which face an existential threat due to sea-level rise. The frustration spurned a social movement led by Vanuatu law students turned youth activists, and work on the resolution was led by Indigenous lawyers in the Pacific. In essence, the ICJ advisory will help establish whether there is legal obligation for countries to do what they have committed to in non-binding treaties such as the 2015 Paris climate accord, and whether failure to do so can be challenged through litigation. It comes a week after the final report by the IPCC, which underscored the urgent need to phase out fossil fuels to curtail global heating and avoid catastrophic climate chaos. Transitioning to renewables and green technology is not enough, warned scientists, fossil fuels projects must be phased out, not expanded. Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, said: \u201cThe UN resolution to take the issue of climate change to the world\u2019s highest court is a historic moment in the fight for climate justice, human rights and intergenerational equity. \u201cThe advisory opinion must serve as an important accountability tool towards states obligations in protecting the environment and future generations from climate impacts.\u201d Vanuatu, an archipelago of islands 500 miles west of Fiji with about 325,000 habitants, was last month hit by two category 4 hurricanes within 72 hours of each other. They caused widespread infrastructure damage, evacuation and left residents without water and electricity for several days. Island nations and developing countries such as Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands Madagascar and Sri Lanka have contributed least to global greenhouse-gas emissions, but are bearing the brunt of erratic and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, drought, and extreme heat and floods that is upending water and food security, and fueling forced migration. The historic resolution was adopted as countries met in Egypt for the first time to discuss the creation of a loss-and-damage funding facility to compensate countries for the irreversible effects of extreme weather events and sea-level rise that are too late to avoid by climate adaptation and mitigation. \u201cThe International Court of Justice can translate the clear scientific evidence that fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis into clear legal imperatives to phase them out now and implement proven, available solutions. An advisory opinion could help spur greater accountability for the mounting suffering caused by states\u2019 failure to act,\u201d said Nikki Reisch from the Center for International Environmental Law."

            "date": "2023-03-30T16:29:57Z",
            "content": "Senior figures across civic Scotland have called on Humza Yousaf to bridge the delivery gap between progressive rhetoric and the reality of policy implementation that they say characterised the Sturgeon era. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian on and off the record, third sector leaders called for the new first minister to move away from headline-grabbing initiatives towards a systemic approach to policymaking on social justice, equality and poverty eradication. Urging colleagues across the sector to seize this moment as Yousaf sets out his agenda, they also questioned whether their own closeness to government in recent years had affected their capacity to be critical. Yousaf needs to wholly review his government\u2019s engagement with the third sector, said Polly Jones, the head of Scotland for the Trussell Trust. \u201cThere are many, many working groups and steering groups. We all need to focus on action and not just words,\u201d she said. Satwat Rehman, the chief executive of One Parent Families Scotland, said: \u201cWith a new FM it\u2019s a chance to reset the relationship between civic Scotland and government. We need to be unapologetic in our challenge to the status quo because people\u2019s lives depend on it.\u201d In particular, she wanted to see the Scottish government using evidence of the impact of particular policies to inform what happens next. \u201cDo we listen to the experiences of families and evidence from the frontline, then use it to change what we do? Perhaps, in some areas, but it needs to become the way business is done across the whole of government.\u201d Previous emphasis on early intervention appeared to have disappeared, she added. \u201cYes we have been dealing with the pandemic and cost of living crisis response, but we need investment in early intervention now to prevent poverty in first place.\u201d Peter Kelly, the director of the Poverty Alliance, said: \u201cToo often the rhetoric on social justice does not translate into how the Scottish government organises the economic policy to support those aims. \u201cThe Scottish government\u2019s child poverty agenda has been positive. For example, we\u2019ve seen statutory targets to reduce child poverty, when similar ones were being scrapped in the rest of the UK. Despite this, recent data shows that child poverty figures in Scotland are not much improved over the decade. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge question here about resources. The budget last year stripped away a significant amount from employability funding, but that was a key plank of the child poverty delivery plan.\u201d As do his third sector colleagues, Kelly recognises limits on the devolved budget, but he said: \u201cThere is significant scope with the powers we have.\u201d Yousaf has already flagged his willingness to discuss wealth taxes at a planned anti-poverty summit. The delivery gap is a \u201chuge focus\u201d for Shelter Scotland, said its director, Alison Watson. \u201cScotland has the most progressive set of housing rights in the world \u2013 on paper \u2013 but this has not been met by an equivalent increase in supply of social housing. The result is breaking records over four consecutive years for numbers of children stuck in temporary accommodation.\u201d The key question for Yousaf\u2019s new cabinet was this, said Watson: \u201cAre they as committed to delivery as they are to political aspiration?\u201d There is a recognition across the sector that the Sturgeon era was a time of unprecedented access to government for the third sector, with meetings easily secured with cabinet ministers and senior civil servants. This stands in contrast to the UK government, which they feel has largely shut down dialogue with civil society. But Kelly noted that \u201copportunities for direct engagement come with a tension, and access does not necessarily mean influence\u201d. \u201cIt is essential that having that seat at the table doesn\u2019t stop us being critical,\u201d he said. Lack of secure or long-term funding also affects an organisation\u2019s capacity to be honest, said Clare MacGilvery, of Making Rights Real. \u201cThe third sector is a hugely creative sector that can do incredible work, but it\u2019s not sustainably funded,\u201d she said. \u201cThis means that for organisations getting their funding from the state, either at central government or local authority level, there is a concern that they can\u2019t speak truth to power in case their funding gets cut. Whether that\u2019s a real or perceived concern, it has to change.\u201d Amid these challenges for the new first minister, there is an equal challenge to each other. \u201cWe need to be bold, brave and loud when we hold government to account,\u201d Rehman said."

Eileen spent her working life in Northern Ireland, where she identified with the people and the issues. She started teaching at the then-new University of Ulster in 1971, guiding generations of students into careers in health and social care, social work, policy development and academia. Her work ranged across the university\u2019s three campuses, located in Derry, Coleraine and Jordanstown (a fourth campus, in Belfast, was added in 2022), from the 1970s until she retired in 2002. Eileen became a leader in her field, publishing extensively, and is well cited on health and social care, poverty, social security, pensions policy, gender and older people. Outside academia, she was a benefits expert on BBC Radio Ulster for more than 20 years, taking questions from listeners. Every inquiry received a personal reply from Eileen, whether it was discussed on air or not. Eileen was active in the voluntary sector, serving on many public bodies: she chaired the NI Housing Benefit Review Board, the NI Social Security Standards Committee, and, in an acting role, the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust Board. She was also a commissioner in the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, a trustee of Age NI, and a council member of the Pensions Policy Institute, London. Born in Birmingham, to Patricia (nee Nyhan), a nurse, and Francis Moran, a bus driver, Eileen won a scholarship to Olton convent school, Solihull. She went on to Hull University, graduating with a degree in social studies in 1968, followed by a master\u2019s in social science from Queen\u2019s University Belfast. When she was appointed CBE in 2013 for services to disadvantaged people in Northern Ireland, she said it was a recognition of all the people working in her field. Eileen engaged with and was respected by politicians across the spectrum, as she always championed the most vulnerable people in society, regardless of their politics. Partly due to this mindset, at the request of the assembly executive she was lead author of an expert report in 2015 on social welfare reform. Away from work, Eileen enjoyed swimming, travel and reading the Guardian. Her happiest times were spent in the study and garden of her home in east Belfast, with her roses and her pets. She became ill with cancer in 2008 and again from 2020 until her death. She is survived by her partner, Drusilla Hawthorne \u2013 whom she met while campaigning in the 80s \u2013 her brothers, Denzil and Tony, and her nephews, Alex and me."

            "date": "2023-03-26T12:00:17Z",
            "content": "Vivien Rose, supreme court justice, stares steadily back at you from Carey Young\u2019s outstanding new film at Modern Art Oxford. Lady Rose is only required to sit for two minutes in this red leather chair but the pressure of time (and the lens) is upon her. The imperturbable gaze flickers ever so slightly, as she waits for the endless moment to pass. Why is she still here, when she could be dispensing justice? Appearance \u2013 the film\u2019s title plays on the way we come before her and she before us \u2013 takes off from Andy Warhol\u2019s celebrated 1960s Screen Tests. But Young is British and born in 1970. Instead of Bob Dylan or Lou Reed, she invites a succession of our female judges into her spotlit studio. You see them arrive, take their seat and try to keep entirely still. Each appearance quickens into psychological drama. A solemn young woman, with matching lips and nails, looks at the camera with something approaching hostility. A middle-aged judge, wig removed, reveals the carefully brushed tips of her blue-dyed hair even as she conceals her hands beneath kid gloves arranged across her lap. There are abruptly crossed legs, restless fingers and even a hint of growing warmth from a diminutive lawyer whose feet barely touch the ground even in towering stilettos. She stops just short of a full-blown smile. Is it the occasion or the profession that controls the pose? What should a female judge look like? I came into the gallery just as a woman of exceptional youth and beauty was arriving on screen and the viewer next to me gasped. The artist \u2013 her camera noticing emerald rings, expensive hair, judicious eyeliner \u2013 mocks our preconceptions. Judge not lest ye be judged. Young\u2019s profound and involving examination of the law has continued through film, photography and installation art for more than 20 years. This retrospective presents some of her most acute works. Counter Offer, from 2008, consists of two framed propositions. \u201cOffer \u2013 I offer you liberty\u201d (though the fine print below warns that this offer will be automatically withdrawn on the making of any counteroffer, which is hereby rejected) and \u201cCounter Offer \u2013 I offer you justice\u201d. The elements are mutually exclusive, freedom and justice incompatible, or so runs this dark double bind. Obsidian Contract (2010) consists of a legal document written backwards that only becomes legible when you peer into its reflection in a black mirror. Whereupon it turns \u2013 according to the written claim \u2013 into a contract whereby you agree that the mirror is now a piece of common land. All sorts of banned activities, from nudism to loitering to public protest, are magically legal in this illusory place. Look away, though, and your freedom has all gone. Two recent prints seem to show an expanse of twinkling stars in a night sky and, by contrast, dark flecks in a stretch of white ice. The first is in fact a photograph of a notice board in a law school, the documents removed to reveal the pinpricks; the second, the wall of a prison yard. One is the complex reverse of the other, or so you might say, in life as here now in art. The laws that govern our rights, our agency and even our movements in this world are, for Young, \u201ca form of choreography\u201d. This is most explicit in a piece from 2013, now updated to reflect our present times. A rectangular line marks out a section of wall and floor. Stand inside it and you agree with the declaration of European citizenship. Step outside and the temporary citizenship ends. But now, of course, the concept is even more remote, intangible, absurd, the dancing in and out of it sheer fantasy post-Brexit. And the line has turned black, like the edge of a funeral notice. A recent self-portrait, if that isn\u2019t an overstatement, shows a faint reflection of the artist in a group photograph of US supreme court judges. You can scarcely see Young, who has a camera to her eye in any case, but nor can you quite make out the only woman in the shot. This is Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, the first American woman to hold that office, surrounded by men and obscured by a flash of light. Young\u2019s acclaimed 2017 film Palais de Justice moves as if by stealth through the soaring architecture of the Brussels law courts, noticing strange symmetries, hidden figures, the weird murmur of voices that are always elsewhere, behind closed doors. Her camera peers through the curious porthole windows set into those doors, watching women judges listening, arguing, shifting with impatience (in one case turning straight towards us, eye to startled eye). What does the law look like? With subtle editing, it is suddenly made to look (like the figure of Justice herself) entirely and unprecedentedly female. Yet the art in this show is always and aptly interrogative. What difference would it make if there were more women judges? (Rose is at present the only female justice out of 12 in the UK supreme court.) Appearance presents numerous British women on screen from various backgrounds and levels \u2013 junior and venerable, black, white and Asian, dressed in starched linen, white ermine and even the gold-encrusted robes of the highest courts in the land that require a flunky to trail behind lifting the hem. Each appearance is a discrete essay in character, from the serenely confident to the impassive, impervious or resistant. But what Young\u2019s camera notices, too, is the luxurious jewellery, the costly makeup, shoes and hair; the extraordinary fact of the soft hands and the unlined faces \u2013 scarcely a frown mark, despite the burdens of office. It is as if the law has imposed its own style upon these women, as much as any men, keeping them all in line. Carey Young: Appearance is at Modern Art Oxford until 2 July"

Victims of crimes will also be given a say over the type of punishment that offenders should face, as will communities, under an \u201cimmediate justice\u201d scheme to be unveiled by Rishi Sunak on Monday. In an attempt to show that \u201cjustice is being done\u201d, offenders will be made to wear jumpsuits or hi-vis jackets and work under supervision. Cleaning up graffiti, litter-picking or washing police cars have all been given as possible punishments. Offenders could also be assigned to help on projects that support their local community, including doing unpaid work. The prime minister\u2019s intervention confirms that antisocial behaviour is emerging as a central battleground for the next election. Keir Starmer has already pledged to prioritise low-level crime. Labour has said it will tackle drug dealing, boost the numbers of neighbourhood police and create new \u201crespect orders\u201d to target persistent antisocial behaviour offenders. The latest government scheme will see new funding for police and crime commissioners in order to force those responsible for offences such as vandalism or graffiti to start cleaning up their crimes within 48 hours of receiving an order. The exact level of funding has not been announced. The system will be tested in 10 areas before it is rolled out across England and Wales next year, the government has said. While there is little detail on exactly how victims and communities will be involved in setting punishments, officials said they would have some input alongside local police and crime commissioners. The scheme forms part of the antisocial action plan, to be unveiled this week. Tackling crime was not among the \u201cfive immediate priorities\u201d Sunak announced after he took office, but Downing St has been keen to fight back against Labour\u2019s promises to tackle it. \u201cFor too long, people have put up with the scourge of antisocial behaviour in their neighbourhoods,\u201d Sunak said. \u201cThese are not minor crimes. They disrupt people\u2019s daily lives, hold businesses back and erode the sense of safety and community that brings people together. That\u2019s why I\u2019m bringing forward a new plan to crack down on this behaviour once and for all \u2013 so that everyone can feel proud of where they live.\u201d A pilot programme will also see teams of offenders deployed to clean up more urgent incidents of antisocial behaviour. It will be overseen by the probation service and selected councils. The new schemes come in addition to the \u201ccommunity payback\u201d programme for more serious offenders, which will be expanded from 5m hours a year to up to 8m hours. According to government figures, last year saw 1,500 offenders spend almost 10,000 hours on 300 community clean-up projects. Ministers want to double that figure."

It was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that this was not already in place, he added, especially after the examples of violence against women from police officers. Starmer said the \u201cbiggest danger\u201d after Louise Casey\u2019s damning review, which found the force institutionally racist, misogynist and homophobic, is that it \u201cbecomes just another report rather than the beginning of real, lasting change\u201d. The review, commissioned following Sarah Everard\u2019s murder, warned there may be more officers like killer Wayne Couzens and serial rapist David Carrick. Labour has also proposed to introduce: New leadership training to overhaul culture within the police. 13,000 more neighbourhood officers and PCSOs. Specialist rape and sexual assault units in every force and domestic violence specialist call handlers in every 999 control room. Specialist mandatory training for every officer, including on bias and violence against women and girls. More routes into policing for people from every background, including direct routes into detective work. Starmer said a Labour government under his leadership would fully accept the findings of Lady Casey\u2019s report. \u201cPage after page, the report provides both a detailed diagnosis of what\u2019s gone wrong and a blueprint for radical reform,\u201d he said at a London press conference. \u201cThe strength of its findings require an immediate and urgent response \u2026 The new Met commissioner Mark Rowley has our support in the work he has now begun to turn it around. But he must go further and faster. And he will have our support in doing that. \u201cI know that there are officers right across the Met who are desperate to see these improvements put into place and action taken to rebuild the confidence of Londoners. But mark my words: I will be relentless in demanding progress and change.\u201d While he acknowledged he did have confidence in Cressida Dick before the mayor of London Sadiq Khan ousted her, he said it\u2019s wrong to have the \u201ccriminal justice instinct that if one head rolls, then that\u2019s the problem solved\u201d. \u201cThe duty of the Met is to go through significant change. Big change that requires strong leadership. Leadership which has the shoulder of the government behind it.\u201d Starmer said deep culture change will involve the Met \u201cchanging the police from a force to a service \u2013 with public service values at its heart\u201d. \u201cIf we can get Catholics to serve in Northern Ireland, I won\u2019t expect any special pleading that the Met can\u2019t represent modern London.\u201d Starmer has previously indicated the Metropolitan police might need to change its name as part of a much-needed \u201croot and branch\u201d review in the wake of the Carrick case. The Labour leader likened the scale of change needed within the force to the policing reforms in Northern Ireland that took place after the Good Friday agreement. The Royal Ulster Constabulary was replaced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Starmer previously worked as a legal adviser to the Northern Ireland Policing Board and the Association of Chief Police Officers, and played a role in driving the process of building public consent for policing."

While of course structural reforms are needed in Malawi to make it more resilient, Malawians are also in dire need of immediate support to rebuild their homes, roads and other infrastructure. It seems that Mr Dembitzer is confusing and conflating the two issues. A country may need both aid and structural reform. Malawi definitely needs both. He is also incorrect that international NGOs \u201chave not understood that trees are the only form of fuel to heat homes and cook food\u201d. Many international and local NGOs I know of here have projects around reforestation, reducing firewood and charcoal use, and improving food security. It seems to me that the organisations on the ground in Malawi \u2013 ironically, Grassroots Malawi seems to be UK-based \u2013 do understand the situation very well.

            "date": "2023-03-27T17:30:49Z",
            "content": "After a bracingly close result that raises fundamental questions about the core priorities of the wider party membership, Humza Yousaf begins his tenure as the Scottish National party\u2019s first ethnic minority leader, and soon to be first Muslim first minister of Scotland, with a distinct set of challenges. Immediately after the leadership announcement, there was evident relief particularly from those younger, progressive activists who had dreaded the success of the socially and fiscally conservative Kate Forbes. Campaign groups such as Back Off Scotland, which presses for protest-free buffer zones outside abortion clinics, tweeted their approval. But others made plain their consternation that such a sizeable chunk of their fellow members were willing to set aside Forbes\u2019 personal opposition to equal marriage and abortion, for example, in order to vote for her \u201creset\u201d platform. Two-fifths of SNP members on first preferences were convinced by a candidate who was highly critical of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s record, challenging the outgoing first minister\u2019s model of progressive taxation and the speed of transition away from oil and gas exploration. More than 50% of first preferences votes were for candidates \u2013 Forbes and third-placed Ash Regan \u2013 who were relaxed about ditching the governing partnership with the Scottish Greens. The question remains: to what extent does the wider membership subscribe to Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s progressive consensus, and what does \u201cprogressive\u201d mean to them? While garnering the majority of parliamentary endorsements from councillors, MSPs and MPs, Yousaf fell short of a whole-hearted endorsement from the wider membership and as such has work to do now to earn their trust. As much as the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, decries Yousaf\u2019s lack of electoral mandate, his mandate within the party itself is also slim. Forbes made it clear in her remarks following the announcement that Yousaf needs to listen to those members who supported her and Regan \u2013 while it remains to be seen whether Forbes, should she remain in cabinet, would support his plans for wealth taxes. But more engaged activists suggest that, while Forbes benefited from name recognition with the wider membership, those who have had the opportunity to work more closely with Yousaf also respect him. One experienced activist explained: \u201cI\u2019ve seen him step in to help with internal party issues over the years when he didn\u2019t have to, because he cared about people being treated fairly. As an equalities activist I\u2019ve never had to explain why something mattered. Working with him you realise he\u2019s very on the ball and far from the buffoonish media caricature.\u201d With both Yousaf and Forbes calling for a switch from process to policy on independence strategy, one in 10 SNP members on first preferences were attracted to Regan\u2019s more immediate plans for a referendum, the cohort who have been repeatedly frustrated by Sturgeon\u2019s repeated promises to hold another vote. An hour after the result, Alex Salmond\u2019s Alba party launched a recruitment drive based around Forbes\u2019 slogan \u201ccontinuity won\u2019t cut it\u201d. Yousaf must convince members that his gradualist approach is not more of the same \u2013 and instantly pledged to ask the UK government for the required section 30 order to hold a fresh referendum, a performative gesture given the certainty Westminster would refuse. Having styled himself as the continuity candidate, what has emerged from the contest is how much needs to change inside the party. The campaign has signalled the end of \u201cwheesht for indy\u201d \u2013 all-pervasive internal discipline that meant frustrations about party management or policy were cut off in order to maintain focus on the main prize. The resignation of the SNP chief executive, Peter Murrell \u2013 Sturgeon\u2019s husband \u2013 in a damaging transparency row over membership figures brought other concerns into the open about imposition of HQ-approved candidates, poor handling of harassment complaints and member consultation. There is now a clamour for reform, which Yousaf must heed alongside an overflowing in-tray in government \u2013 including huge pressure on the first minister\u2019s \u00a360bn annual budget, record NHS waiting lists and looming emissions targets. By mid-April, he must also decide whether to contest the UK government\u2019s block on Holyrood\u2019s gender recognition bill. Just as pressingly, Yousaf needs to imprint himself on the minds of voters beyond his SNP base, many of whom will be more familiar with criticisms of his record as health minister and capacity for gaffes, after the latest Ipsos Scotland polling found that his predecessor remains far more popular than any of the three candidates who were vying to succeed her, and that Forbes is more popular with general voters. Despite the relentless racist and Islamophobic abuse he has encountered since he entered public life, Yousaf told the Guardian recently he believes fundamentally that Scotland is a progressive country. Just as Sturgeon spoke of the significance for girls and young woman across the country when she was elected first minister in 2014, Yousaf\u2019s acceptance speech included an invitation to pause and absorb the significance of this moment as the grandson of Muslim migrants from Pakistan steps up to the highest office."

            "date": "2023-03-13T04:58:38Z",
            "content": "New Zealand\u2019s government is dumping a range of high-profile reforms and emissions reduction measures as part of its promise to refocus on \u201cbread and butter issues\u201d, using the savings to introduce a billion-dollar boost to welfare payments to relieve cost of living pressures. Chris Hipkins, the prime minister, announced on Monday that the government would roll out increases for retirees, students, unemployed people, and parents, ranging from $19 to $46.20 a week. The government estimates that 1.4 million New Zealanders will benefit. The government would fund those increased welfare payments by scrapping, shrinking or delaying a number of legislative reforms, including lowering the voting age to 16 years, reductions to driving speed limits, restrictions on the sale and marketing of alcohol, clean car grants, light rail projects, and road transport reforms designed to reduce New Zealand\u2019s transport emissions. Hipkins said New Zealanders were focused on cost of living pressures and recovering from Cyclone Gabrielle, and government priorities had to reflect that. \u201cStopping some of our plans and putting others on a slower track gives us the bandwidth to focus on those immediate priorities, while also saving some money so that we can provide a little bit of extra support to help families with increasing costs,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these things we\u2019re delaying or stopping mean a lot to us as a government. But we\u2019re taking the hard decisions because we know Kiwis are also making some tough calls.\u201d A number of the reforms scrapped by Hipkins had been focused on reducing emissions in the face of the climate crisis. One of the largest financial reallocations will be $568m from halting the clean car upgrade scheme, where households could scrap old cars in return for a grant for a cleaner, lower emissions vehicle, or to pay for public transport. Also delayed is the project to build a light rail system for Auckland, the country\u2019s largest city, which will now be rolled out in stages. Earlier in the year, Hipkins scrapped rules that required fuel companies to add biofuels to their petrol, and announced extended tax cuts for petrol in light of high fuel prices. Asked whether the government\u2019s reprioritising meant it was abandoning its climate crisis ambitions, Hipkins said: \u201cThe climate policies that we\u2019re talking about today would have made a very small contribution to our overall emissions reductions targets. \u201cWe\u2019re not changing our emissions reductions budgets \u2013 we are making some changes to how we will go about achieving those budgets.\u201d Also on the chopping block is lowering New Zealand\u2019s voting age. Jacinda Ardern had committed in 2022 to introducing legislation to lower the voting age in New Zealand to 16, after the supreme court ruled the current law was discriminatory. Hipkins said while he personally supported lowering the voting age, that legislation would no longer be brought forward \u2013 although the government would bring in legislation to reduce the voting age in local body elections. \u201cI support a lower voting age at the age of 16 [but] there isn\u2019t a parliamentary majority for that \u2013 so I don\u2019t intend to progress a bill that\u2019s doomed to fail, because ultimately, that would be an expensive exercise to make a political statement,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2023-03-21T00:01:14Z",
            "content": "Here we all are again. The venues change, as do the decades, the people who chair the inquiry differ, as does the Metropolitan police commissioner vowing to act. About a quarter of a century ago, in a cake box pink building in south London where he held hearings, the evidence he heard led Sir William Macpherson to conclude the Met was institutionally racist. The former judge concluded this at least in part explained why the killers of Stephen Lawrence had escaped justice. Then, unlike now, the then commissioner Paul Condon accepted the label. This time it is even worse: the Met is again found to be institutionally racist, sexist and homophobic, and Louise Casey says it should also accept the finding of an earlier inquiry in 2021 that it is institutionally corrupt. It may be an understatement to say this is a cataclysmic disaster that has befallen the Metropolitan police, the people it serves, the trust it has squandered and the bullied and overworked staff repeated leaders have let down. Lady Casey\u2019s report details the fall of a British institution, tumbling harder than any organisation at the centre of national life has managed before, and one that is so crucial to society. It is not just a London issue. Not just because the Met has national functions such as counter-terrorism, but because its size makes it about one-quarter of policing in England and Wales. Its repeated scandals, as Casey details, its bungled response or cover-up, is buffeting forces across the country, dragging down trust and confidence even hundreds of miles from the capital. \u201cIt\u2019s always the Met,\u201d is a refrain among other chief constables, and their tolerance of their fellow chiefs in London is thin to nonexistent, where once there was support. And they have made the Home Office aware of the drag effect of the better resourced London force\u2019s inability to clean up its messes, and generate new ones. Crime and policing will be a key issue in next May\u2019s London mayoral election, and general election. Polling for the Home Office, seen by the Guardian, already shows a high fear of crime, and low confidence much will be done about it. The fall of the Met came and accelerated during a time when a series of reforms meant police were supposed to be under more scrutiny and face more accountability than ever. Even if the Met leadership was deficient, we should never have got even close to this dire position. Several organisations have questions to answer about whether acts of omission or commission played a part in Scotland Yard squandering public trust. Now on certain measures trust is at 50%, when in 2017 it was 17% higher. As one senior Met insider said: \u201cIt is a hard swing to happen to an institution so quickly.\u201d Those with questions to answer include the London mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime \u2013 first under Boris Johnson when he was mayor, then under Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan and his deputy for policing, Sophie Linden. The current mayor may have earned some redemption by pressing the Met to change and ousting Cressida Dick as commissioner. But also among those charged with holding the Met to account were a succession of Tory home secretaries. Unique among forces the Met has two political bosses. His Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary was late placing the Met in special measures, instead under its previous leader, Sir Tom Winsor, praising the Met and condemning the force\u2019s critics after it waded into mourners for Sarah Everard on Clapham Common after her murder by a Met officer. Winsor also praised Cressida Dick. The Independent Office for Police Conduct faces constant claims of being too lax about allegations of Met wrongdoing, though its report on the Charing Cross police station hate messages helped end Dick\u2019s commissionership. Anyone watching the London Assembly\u2019s police and crime committee is more likely to hear praise for the Met than a well thought out and well researched question, with the occasional exception of the Green party members. Denis Healey\u2019s line that being attacked by Geoffrey Howe was \u201clike being savaged by a dead sheep\u201d is a pretty accurate description. Casey notes in her report: \u201cThe system as a whole does not hold or deliver real consequences where failures persist.\u201d Casey places the primary blame on the Met\u2019s past leadership, who condemned external critics, intimidated internal ones into silence, and reassured the public that everything was all right. Can Sir Mark Rowley, who came out of retirement to start his commissionership in September turn the Met around and avoid being the last commissioner of the Met as we know it? Both he and his deputy, Dame Lynne Owens, served previously at the top table of the Met, and say they will reflect on why they did not see more of the signs. Among senior policing sources there is an increasing view that Rowley\u2019s stated hope to turn the Met around within the five years of his commissionership is an understandable aim, but if he merely stops the bleeding he will have done amazingly well. \u201cIt is not achievable in five years,\u201d said one senior insider. \u201cThis is a 10-year game.\u201d There is talk that if in a year to two years the Rowley plans are not showing results, the issue of whether the Met continues in its current form and size, starts to move to the foreground. To reverse the fall of the Met, Rowley \u2013 a maths graduate \u2013 will need to reengineer the gravity of history. Because past attempts to get the Met to accept it needs to radically reform, and then to get them to actually do it, have ended with today\u2019s damning and depressing report by Casey."

            "date": "2023-03-29T13:56:32Z",
            "content": "When David Perdue applied to be part of a climate comedy program, he felt a little out of his element: \u201cI couldn\u2019t recall one time I\u2019d ever had a conversation with my friends about climate change,\u201d said the Atlanta-based comic. Perdue, who is Black, added, \u201cBut I knew it was an issue that was going to affect people who look like me, so I wanted to use comedy to address that.\u201d Perdue was one of nine comedians who took part in a nine-month fellowship where they learned about climate science and solutions and collaborated on new, climate-related material. The Climate Comedy Cohort produced shorts, toured together, and pitched ideas to television networks. Their work is part of a broader effort to bring some levity to a topic that is increasingly present in everyday life. For Perdue, that meant bringing race into the conversation about sustainability and clean energy. \u201c[Solar power] is free labor, and the most American thing to do is to use free labor,\u201d he says in one of his sets. \u201cWe just have to tell people the sun is Black.\u201d Climate change has increasingly featured in television dramas and apocalyptic thrillers. But comedians like Perdue, as well as higher-profile acts like Michelle Wolf and Joel Kim Booster, are also taking on the climate crisis. (Wolf, in her HBO special, says that \u201cMother Nature is trying to kill us in the most passive-aggressive way possible. She\u2019s like, \u2018What? I raised the temperature a little.\u2019\u201d) By talking about climate, even irreverently, social scientists say, they may be helping to combat climate doom and boost civic engagement. Comedy \u2013 even if it\u2019s about heavy topics like climate change \u2013 can motivate feelings of hope and optimism, said Caty Borum, a professor at American University and author of The Revolution Will Be Hilarious: Comedy for Social Change and Civic Power. \u201cThose are routes to persuasion because we\u2019re being entertained and because we\u2019re feeling emotions of play \u2013 and this is particularly important for climate change,\u201d she said. The Climate Comedy Cohort, a joint project between American University\u2019s Center for Media &amp; Social Impact, which Borum runs, and Generation180, a clean-energy non-profit, announced a new class of comedians earlier this month. \u201cAs it just turns out, the very unique qualities of comedy that allow us to break through taboo, allow us to use social critique, and translate topics, all of that really contributes\u201d to people feeling like they can take action, Borum said. Actor and former Obama aide Kal Penn hosts a new show on Bloomberg called Getting Warmer that focuses on climate technology and solutions \u201cwith a dose of humor and optimism\u201d, according to its tagline. And in April, a group of comedians is putting on a show in Los Angeles called lol climate change: a show. A majority of Americans says climate change is real and caused by humans, but only about half think there\u2019s anything they can do about it, according to a 2022 AP-NORC poll. Borum said that programs like hers can help combat climate doom and inaction. \u201cThe goal of the program is not to have comedians tell more scary stories about climate change, but to really dig in on the solutions,\u201d she said. Just because climate change is heavy and important, it doesn\u2019t mean comedy about it can\u2019t be really silly, said Esteban Gast, a comedian who helped create the Climate Comedy Cohort. He noted that comedy often draws from tragedy. Marc Maron\u2019s new special, From Bleak to Dark, delves into the death of his partner, Lynne Shelton; in Nanette, Hannah Gadsby opens up about being sexually assaulted. \u201cIt\u2019s the comedian\u2019s job to pull from that,\u201d Gast said. On stage, Katie Hannigan, part of the Climate Comedy Cohort notes that gas stoves are horrible for the planet. She says, \u201cI am doing my part for climate change. I have never even used my gas stove \u2026 since I started that fire.\u201d Kat Evasco, one of the lol climate change comedians, has a joke connecting her mother\u2019s skepticism about climate change to her denial about being gay \u2013 even though she\u2019s shared a bedroom with a woman for 25 years, Evasco quips. \u201cIt\u2019s about moments that might not center on climate change, but can tie back to it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t big on sharing data and statistics,\u201d Evasco said. \u201cWhat we are looking for is: how does this show up in human experience? How do you laugh about death?\u201d Max Boykoff, a professor in environmental studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, said he believes comedy can help drive the conversation forward on polarizing topics like climate change. (The majority of Americans don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about the climate with their neighbors or co-workers.) \u201cThe comedic approach is not just simply a matter of making someone laugh. It\u2019s actually a way to open people up,\u201d he said. In 2018, Boykoff and Beth Osnes, a professor of theatre, developed a creative climate communication course in which students developed their own comedy skits. At the end of the semester, 90% of students reported feeling more hopeful about climate change, and 83% said they believed their commitment to taking action on climate change was more likely to last. Borum said that when comedy is done well, it can change minds on almost any topic \u2013 she has studied how comedy can create social change around poverty, inequality and human rights. \u201cThe best comedy that inserts something important about the world is not boring and lame,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s true from a science perspective, but also a comedy perspective.\u201d This article originally appeared in Nexus Media News"

            "content": "We were warned. From the \u201ccertainty\u201d of rising greenhouse gas emissions in 1992 to \u201cwidespread\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d impacts on humanity by 2014, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been the beacon of climate science for the world. There were earlier warnings. Even oil giants such as ExxonMobil made predictions in the 1970s and 1980s for global heating that proved \u201cbreathtakingly\u201d accurate \u2013 before embarking on decades of damaging denial. But the power of the IPCC is that thousands of the world\u2019s best scientists work together to distil the latest global research into reports that are then signed off by all the governments in the world. These are the gold-standard statements on the reality and dangers of climate change and, arguably, the greatest scientific endeavour in history. 1992: first IPCC report \u201cWe are certain of the following: emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases. These increases will result on average in an additional warming of the Earth\u2019s surface.\u201d From the very first IPCC summary report in 1992, the reality of global heating is made clear. The report predicted a global temperature rise of about 2C by 2025, compared with the period before the industrial revolution sparked the mass burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, the rise is 1.4C. However, the report said: \u201cThe size of the warming over the last century is broadly consistent with the prediction by climate models, but is also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability. The unequivocal detection of the [human-]enhanced greenhouse effect from observations is not likely for a decade or more.\u201d Nonetheless, the first IPCC reports led to the creation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the annual UN summit where nations negotiate climate action. 1995: second IPCC report By 1995, the second IPCC report had started to point the finger firmly at human-caused emissions for rising global temperatures: \u201cGlobal mean surface temperature has increased by between about 0.3 and 0.6C since the late 19th century. The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.\u201d The report also made plain that global heating was a serious danger to the world: \u201cClimate change is likely to have wide-ranging and mostly adverse impacts on human health, with significant loss of life.\u201d \u201cDuring the past few decades \u2026 potentially serious changes have been identified, including an increase in some regions in the incidence of extreme high-temperature events, floods and droughts,\u201d it said. The report made a plea, that was to be ignored: \u201cWhere there is a lack of full scientific certainty, [countries] should: \u2018take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimise the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects\u2019.\u201d The then UK environment minister, John Gummer (now Lord Deben), said at the time: \u201cThere will be far-reaching effects on natural systems and human society for generations to come.\u201d 2001: third IPCC report \u201cThere is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities,\u201d the third IPCC report in 2001 found. \u201cDetection and attribution studies consistently find evidence for an anthropogenic signal in the climate record of the last 35 to 50 years.\u201d In terms of the cause of global heating, humanity was in the dock. The third report also indicated that global heating was already wreaking harm: \u201cThe rising socioeconomic costs related to weather damage and to regional variations in climate suggest increasing vulnerability to climate change.\u201d It sounded the alarm that those least responsible for emissions would suffer the most: \u201cThe impacts of climate change will fall disproportionately upon developing countries and the poor persons within all countries.\u201d The report also warned of triggering climate tipping points. \u201cGreenhouse gas forcing in the 21st century could set in motion large-scale, high-impact, non-linear and potentially abrupt changes in physical and biological systems over the coming decades to millennia.\u201d By 2022, scientists had concluded that five dangerous tipping points may already have been passed. \u201cThe report has starkly confirmed the threat posed by global warming \u2013 the stakes are high for us, and for our planet,\u201d said the then foreign minister for the United Arab Emirates, which has continued to be a major oil producer and will host the latest UN climate summit, Cop28, in December. 2007: fourth IPCC report The fourth IPCC report, in 2007, was the moment when humanity\u2019s responsibility for global heating became all but certain: \u201cWarming of the climate system is unequivocal \u2026 Eleven of the last 12 years rank among the 12 warmest years [on] record.\u201d \u201cMost of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse concentrations,\u201d the report said. Denial was therefore left to those with vested interests, but the report also warned against delay: \u201cDelayed emission reductions significantly constrain the opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels and increase the risk of more severe climate change impacts.\u201d Not acting was the expensive option, the report made clear: \u201cThe evidence leads to a simple conclusion: the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting \u2026 delay would be dangerous and much more costly\u201d. Rajendra Pachauri, the IPCC chair, said: \u201cI hope this report will shock people, governments into taking more serious action.\u201d The IPCC and the US vice-president, Al Gore, were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2007. But the global financial crash that followed diverted the world\u2019s attention. 2014: fifth IPCC report By the time of the IPCC\u2019s fifth report in 2014, the reality, cause and consequences of global heating were glaringly obvious: \u201cHuman influence on the climate system is clear. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems [and] many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia.\u201d Global emissions were still inexorably rising and the report said that meant worse was to come: \u201cContinued emissions will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.\u201d By this time, adapting to all the impacts of climate change was no longer an option, the report said: \u201cAdaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change.\u201d Once again, the IPCC said action was affordable. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost the world to save the planet,\u201d said economist Prof Ottmar Edenhofer. The IPCC\u2019s fifth report laid the scientific ground for the UN\u2019s Paris agreement in 2015, which for the first time spurred most nations to cut emissions. 2018: special IPCC report on 1.5C A special IPCC report in 2018 demonstrated stark differences in the impacts of global heating between a rise of 1.5C and 2C, the two targets contained in the Paris agreement. Compared to 1.5C, it showed many millions more people faced extreme heatwaves, droughts and food insecurity with 2C of heating. Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m said: \u201cClimate change is occurring earlier and more rapidly than expected. Even at the current level of 1C warming, it is painful. This report is really important. It has a scientific robustness that shows 1.5C is not just a political concession. There is a growing recognition that 2C is dangerous.\u201d The report also set out the daunting arithmetic of holding the temperature rise to 1.5C: \u201cCO2 emissions [must] decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030.\u201d In 2022, however, emissions from fossil fuel burning rose yet again to reach a new record high. Humanity may have so far largely ignored the alarm bells sounded by the scientists. But we cannot say we were not warned."

            "date": "2023-03-21T19:10:39Z",
            "content": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published the \u201csynthesis report\u201d of its sixth assessment report (AR6) on Monday. Eight years in preparation, this mammoth report encompasses the entire range of human knowledge of the climate system, compiled by hundreds of scientists from thousands of academic papers, and published in four parts, in August 2021, February and April 2022, and March 2023. The report drew together the most important findings \u2013 but also highlighted some key measures that governments and countries must take immediately if we are to avoid climate catastrophe: Reduce methane Sharp cuts to short-lived climate pollutants, methane chief among them, could cut more than half a degree from global heating. Produced from oil and gas operations and coalmines, and from animal husbandry and natural sources \u2013 such as decaying vegetation \u2013 methane is a greenhouse gas about 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. But it lasts only for about 20 years before degrading into CO2. Durwood Zaelke, a peer review scientist for the IPCC\u2019s AR6 report, and founder of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development in the US, says cutting it is \u201cthe best way to slow near-term warming \u2013 indeed the only way we know of, short of [geoengineering through] solar radiation management, carbon dioxide removal and methane removal, all of which are still speculative\u201d. Cutting it should be easy: the International Energy Agency found that plugging the leaks from fossil fuel operations was not only low-cost but in most cases actively profitable. Butmany of these operations are in countries with little interest in climate action \u2013 Russia is the worst offender, but even in the US, action has been feeble \u2013 and despite the Methane Pledge signed by close to 100 countries since 2021, methane emissions continue to rise strongly. The Guardian recently revealed 1,000 super-emitting methane leaks. Stop deforestation Cutting down rainforests destroys some of the world\u2019s biggest carbon sinks and risks taking the world to a \u201ctipping point\u201d at which vast forests such as the Amazon and the Congo become sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere instead of absorbing it. The world\u2019s remaining forests are also vital hotspots for biodiversity, so preserving them not only keeps the lungs of our planet alive but is essential to any hope of stemming the catastrophic loss of global species, as well as for Indigenous people who live there. There is hope that the recent disastrous rates of deforestation seen in Brazil will abate under the return of President Lula, but the work will be difficult. The Congo is also still under severe threat, and despite progress in Malaysia and Indonesia the destruction of forests there for palm oil continues. Restore other degraded land, and stop it being turned to agriculture Forests grab the headlines, but many other aspects of natural ecosystems are vital absorbers of carbon, yet are being degraded. Restoring them would benefit nature and the climate. Wetlands and peatlands store vast quantities of carbon, but are under threat as they are drained for agriculture. In the oceans, mangrove swamps and seagrass meadows \u2013 which store carbon and can help to reduce the impacts of rising sea levels and storms \u2013 have been destroyed. The oceans themselves are huge carbon sinks, but their capacity to absorb and store carbon is increasingly under threat at higher temperatures. Stopping overfishing, for instance by cutting wasteful subsidies for industrial fishing, and allowing natural marine ecosystems to regenerate would restore some of the natural carbon cycle of the oceans. Change agriculture, and change the way we eat Feeding the world\u2019s future population using current food systems will be impossible, but shifting to a more sustainable diet that is rich in plants and short on meat and dairy products would go a long way. Beyond meat-eating, fertilisers release nitrous oxide, a strong greenhouse gas in its own right. Fortunately, modern agricultural methods, using precision farming techniques can offer a way of keeping yields high while reducing the impact on the climate and nature. Finally, reducing food waste will be vital, as globally one-third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted. In poor countries in the global south, the lack of refrigeration is also a key factor in wasting food before it can be consumed, and is worth investment. Solar and wind power Renewable energy in the form of wind and solar power is now cheaper than fossil fuels across most of the world and the IPCC found that solar power, wind power and reducing the conversion of land to agriculture were the three measures with the strongest potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally. The US and the EU are now engaged in a renewable energy arms race, which is likely to spur competition further. China is the one to watch, however, adding almost as much renewable energy to the grid last year as the rest of the world combined. China also has a near-monopoly on some critical minerals used in clean technology, a position in which the US and the EU are belatedly taking interest. Energy efficiency The International Energy Agency found that using energy more efficiently was the single largest potential contributor to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions. But between 2015 and 2020 improvement in global primary energy intensity slowed, averaging 1.4% a year, down from 2.1% a year over the period 2010-2015. Despite initial signs of a recovery, weak global energy intensity improvements of below 1% a year were observed in 2020 and 2021, as Covid-19 lockdowns bit. This was well below the 4% a year required on average from 2020 to 2030, the IEA warned. Transport is also ripe for change. More efficient public transport systems around the world would benefit people, boost the economy, reduce air pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions, but in too many urban centres this is an area severely neglected by governments. Stop burning coal Switching from coal to gas-fired power would reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally by more than making all buildings energy efficient. But many governments \u2013 including China, which recently approved the biggest expansion of coal-fired power plants since 2015, as well as India and Australia \u2013 are deeply entwined with coal interests, and have seen coal as essential to national energy security. But it can be done. In developing countries, just energy transition partnerships have begun in South Africa, Vietnam and Indonesia to help workers to move out of coal and into highly skilled jobs in renewable energy generation. Put climate at the heart of all decision-making Historically environment ministries have been on the periphery of government, subservient to finance and business ministries. This is no longer tenable. The IPCC issued a plea on Monday for the climate to be at the heart of all government policy, and all decision-making in business. Only by \u201cmainstreaming\u201d climate action, in the unlovely UN jargon, into the decisions of all government departments, and at board level in business, can we hope to make the many changes needed. The good news is that everybody should benefit, from better health and wellbeing, green jobs and a more vibrant economy, and by reducing the threat of climate catastrophe. Dr Hoesung Lee, the chair of the IPCC, said: \u201cMainstreaming effective and equitable climate action will not only reduce losses and damages for nature and people, it will also provide wider benefits. This synthesis report underscores the urgency of taking more ambitious action and shows that, if we act now, we can still secure a livable sustainable future for all.\u201d"

            "content": "Avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown is still possible, and there are \u201cmultiple, feasible and effective options\u201d for doing so, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said. Hoesung Lee, chair of the body, which is made up of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, made clear that \u2013 despite the widespread damage already being caused by extreme weather, and the looming threat of potentially catastrophic changes \u2013 the future was still humanity\u2019s to shape. \u201c[The IPCC reports] clearly show that humanity has the knowhow and the technology to tackle human-induced climate change. But not only that. They show that we have the capacity to build a much more prosperous, inclusive and equitable society in this process. \u201cTackling climate change is a hard, complex and enduring challenge for generations. We, the scientific community, spell out the facts of disheartening reality, but we also point to the prospects of hope through concerted, genuine and global transformational change.\u201d Finance would be key, he said. The shift to a low-carbon economy would take between three and six times the amounts of funding currently devoted to green investment, according to the final section of the IPCC\u2019s comprehensive sixth assessment report (AR6) of human knowledge of the climate. Climate justice would also be vital, the IPCC said, because the people being hit hardest by the impacts of the crisis were the poorest and most vulnerable who have done least to cause the problem. Aditi Mukherji, one of the 93 authors of the \u201csynthesis report\u201d, the final section that draws together the key findings, said: \u201cAlmost half the world\u2019s population lives in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. In the last decade, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions.\u201d This positive framing of a report that makes mostly very grim reading was a deliberate counterblast to the many voices that have said the world has little chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the threshold beyond which many of the impacts of the crisis will rapidly become irreversible. Chris Jones, of the Met Office Hadley Centre, a member of the report\u2019s core writing team, pointed out that emissions fell by 6% in 2020 owing to the Covid-19 lockdowns, and a similar fall would be needed each year for the next decade. \u201cThe scale of the challenge is massive,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we keep emitting at the current rate, the carbon budget for 1.5C will be exhausted by 2030.\u201d Monday\u2019s publication may be the last this decade from the IPCC, which was set up in 1988 to assess global knowledge of the climate and advise on how human actions have been changing it. The IPCC AR6 report, which was delayed slightly owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, was published in three main sections from August 2021 to April 2022. The first three sections covered the underlying science of the climate system, the impacts of climate breakdown and the ways of tackling or reducing the problem, followed by Monday\u2019s synthesis chapter drawing the previous three together. IPCC scientists and climate experts emphasised that this decade would be crucial, as decisions made now would affect the future of the planet for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. Simon Stiell, the UN\u2019s top climate official, said: \u201cWe are in a critical decade for climate action. Global emissions need to be reduced by nearly 43% by 2030 for the world to achieve the Paris agreement\u2019s goal to limit global temperature rise to 2C and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. The synthesis report highlights just how far off-track we are.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not too late. The IPCC clearly demonstrates that it is possible to limit global warming to 1.5C with rapid and deep emissions reductions across all sectors of the global economy. It has given us many feasible, effective and low-cost mitigation and adaptation options to scale up across sectors and countries.\u201d The message of action, rather than despair, was also taken up by the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. He called for countries to adopt an \u201cacceleration agenda\u201d involving all of the G20, the world\u2019s biggest developed and developing countries. Developed countries must bring forward their commitments on reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions, from 2050 to \u201cas close as possible to 2040\u201d, said Guterres. Emerging economies, many of which have set net zero targets for the second half of this century, must also bring them forward, to \u201cas close as possible\u201d to 2050, he urged. This would require a major revision by some of the world\u2019s biggest emitters: China currently has a target of before 2060, and India of 2070. Guterres also called for developed countries to phase out coal by 2030, and all others by 2040. He called for no new licensing or funding of oil and gas projects, based on the findings of the International Energy Agency that all new oil and gas development must cease for the world to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Achieving this will be a stretch, and many governments are likely to ignore these pleas, at least in the short term. Many experts were keen to point out that the price of renewable energy technology has fallen rapidly, making it a more attractive investment. But oil and gas companies have also been enjoying a record bonanza, and many are planning to reinvest the proceeds in more fossil fuels. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change in the UK, said: \u201cAnt\u00f3nio Guterres is right to say that we need to rapidly increase the pace and urgency of the fight against the climate crisis. \u201cIn Britain, we have a Conservative government whose net zero strategy is so bad that it has been declared unlawful. The tragedy is that the Conservatives are holding us back from reaping the benefits of the green transition \u2013 lower energy bills, millions of good jobs, and a livable future for our children and grandchildren. \u201cLabour will make Britain world leader in tackling the climate crisis, with our plan to make Britain a clean energy superpower by 2030, and by leading a clean power alliance across the world to create cleaner, greener energy.\u201d"

            "content": "Independent MPs Allegra Spender and Zali Steggall are pushing the government to include an absolute cap or an explicit objective that emissions must come down under the safeguard mechanism. And Spender is publicly insisting Labor has not ruled out a \u201ccarbon budget\u201d for big emitters. While the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has designed the scheme to be open to new entrants and has ruled out the Greens request for a ban on new coal and gas, the crossbench, including the balance of power senator David Pocock, wants to ensure industries reduce overall emissions. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Despite modelling by the consultants RepuTex suggesting new projects could cause an emissions \u201cblowout\u201d under the safeguard if they produce more coal or gas than forecast, in a speech to the Sydney Institute on Monday Bowen argued the scheme will deliver 205m tonnes of emissions abatement. Bowen said he understood \u201cthe emphasis on possible new facilities in the public debate\u201d, but the safeguard mechanism was \u201cabout reducing emissions from all facilities: old and new, industrial and resources-based\u201d. \u201cThe fact is this: if our reforms are passed, there will be a scheme to ensure emissions come down from big emitters, whether they be old or new,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t pass, there will be no such scheme. It will be business as usual.\u201d In a parliamentary inquiry report last week, Pocock called for the inclusion of \u201can absolute cap\u201d on emissions to ensure that the government\u2019s goal of no more than 1,233m tonnes of CO2 was released from the facilities covered by the scheme between 2021 and 2030, an amendment that has also been moved by Spender. Spender said the goal was \u201cto make sure the safeguard mechanism actually delivers a reduction in emissions\u201d despite the possibility of new entrants. \u201cI\u2019m in constructive conversations with the minister,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cMy goal is \u2026 to truly deliver on decarbonisation. On this one, it\u2019s certainly a conversation we\u2019re having.\u201d Bowen last week told ABC\u2019s 7:30 that \u201ca lot of those proposals [for new entrants] are factored in and we still get 205m tonnes of abatement\u201d. \u201cSecondly, in addition to that, we\u2019ve factored in what we call a reserve, if you like, a buffer of an extra 17m tonnes, in case an existing facility increases production or more new facilities come on,\u201d he said. Steggall said the intent of the bill was good, but the crossbench was concerned about new entrants, the unlimited use of offsets, and improving the measurement of fugitive methane emissions. She has proposed adding an objective for emissions to decline \u2013 not a hard cap \u2013 accepting that there \u201cmay be a reluctance\u201d from the government \u201cto be locked into a scenario that creates difficulties\u201d. \u201cThe reality is we do need our gross emissions to go down \u2026 If not, we\u2019re on a hiding to nothing if we keep increasing emissions but we offset,\u201d Steggall said. Spender has also proposed abandoning a price cap on carbon offsets, planned to start at $75 a tonne of CO2, as a way to create \u201csharp incentives\u201d to invest in their own abatements. She urged the government to abandon its approach of \u201csectoral blindness\u201d, warning that industries in which emissions cuts were difficult, such as cement and aluminium, could become \u201cuncompetitive\u201d if they were forced to shoulder a bigger burden to allow new coal and gas developments. Crossbench parliamentarians have seized on Bowen\u2019s remarks that \u201cnew facilities will be obliged to comply with the world\u2019s best practice on emissions\u201d as an indication that higher standards on emissions intensity or limits on offsets could be applied to them. Bowen told the Sydney Institute the safeguard mechanism \u201cincentivises onsite emissions reduction\u201d by giving companies credits for coming in under their emissions ceiling. Bowen said the government\u2019s goal of cutting emissions intensity for most facilities by 4.9% each year was \u201cambitious\u201d but \u201cachievable\u201d. \u201cBecause of that level of ambition, and the breadth and variety of sectors covered, it\u2019s necessary to provide flexibility to industries to ensure that ambition is achievable,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2023-03-10T22:30:03Z",
            "content": "The chancellor is poised to announce a \u00a320bn investment in technology to reduce Britain\u2019s carbon emissions at next week\u2019s budget, in a riposte to Joe Biden\u2019s flagship Inflation Reduction Act that aims to create thousands of new jobs. Separately, the government plans to add urgency to Britain\u2019s nuclear programme, with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Jeremy Hunt will announce a \u201creset\u201d of government efforts to clean up the UK\u2019s domestic energy supply and safeguard energy security at next Wednesday\u2019s fiscal showpiece, including efforts to create up to 50,000 highly skilled green jobs. Hunt and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have been under pressure to respond to Biden\u2019s $369bn (\u00a3306bn) of climate subsidies, which have attracted a wave of green investment to the US and away from other countries, including the UK. Although the Treasury has sought to play down the scope for tax cuts and spending increases in the budget, better than expected figures for growth and the public finances have provided the chancellor with some additional financial scope on Wednesday. The Treasury said Hunt plans to announce \u201cunprecedented investment\u201d of \u00a320bn spread over the next two decades into carbon capture and low carbon energy projects and \u201ccommit to spades in the ground on these projects from next year\u201d. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity such as steel and cement production, transporting it, and then locking it into underground storage sites. The move will comes as a relief to developers of a string of carbon capture projects, which have been awaiting government approval. These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea. The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs. The government is investing \u00a3210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding. Rolls-Royce\u2019s reactor design is now being assessed by the safety regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. However, the government has faced criticism from the nuclear industry at the pace of its decision around SMRs. Britain\u2019s energy system has been under the spotlight since household bills began to rise sharply in late 2021, with further hefty increases after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government was forced to step in to subsidise bills last year, and Hunt is next week expected to U-turn on a decision to cut support for bills from April. He is thought likely to extend support until July. Hunt said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see high bills like this again, it\u2019s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.\u201d The energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said: \u201cAlready a global leader in offshore wind power, we now want to do the same for the UK\u2019s nuclear and carbon capture industries, which in turn will help cut the wholesale electricity prices to among the lowest in Europe.\u201d"

The group said repurposing the top floors of the car park was the first step of its vision to \u201cturn grey space to green productive space with the needs and wants of the local community at its heart\u201d. \u201cOne of the goals is to be able to show people that we are in the middle of a city and we are growing food 12 months of the year,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe want to be bringing the community in and giving them an opportunity to get their hands dirty, talking about what food they can buy and how they might cook it.\u201d The development, if approved, would be built on the top floors of Vyse Street car park in the Jewellery Quarter area of the city and managed by a community cooperative. \u201cThe Jewellery Quarter has got the smallest amount of green covering of the entire city so there is nowhere people can grow. It was during lockdown that one of our members had the idea of using the space on top of the car park because we know as residents it is underutilised,\u201d said Smith, adding they were inspired by the world\u2019s largest urban farm, which is on a rooftop in Paris. The plans include a biodiversity centre, home to a cafe and education hub that would form partnerships with local schools and colleges to promote interest in food cultivation and cooking. Urban Design Hub, which created the designs for the project, said: \u201cThe hope is that by using circular economy principles, this project can be a catalyst for reconnecting the local community to healthier and locally grown food while shifting their perception of what the built environment looks like.\u201d The car park would also host a hub for delivering locally grown produce by cargo bike to residents, businesses and food justice groups in the Jewellery Quarter and beyond. Slow Food, a global organisation founded in 1989, works to preserve local food cultures and traditions, counteract the rise of fast food and boost people\u2019s interest in what they eat and where it comes from. Slow Food Birmingham said its initiative would help local hospitality businesses reduce their environmental impact and financial costs, as well as reducing the cost of grocery shopping for nearby residents. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had interest from outside Birmingham as to what we\u2019re doing and wondering how soon we can teach people how to replicate what we\u2019ve designed,\u201d said Smith. \u201cUltimately, we want to be able to teach other people how to do this.\u201d"

One of the big problems for many of us is a lack of knowledge of how to change our lifestyles to stop making the situation worse. Even those with quite a good idea of how carbon footprints work do not have an easy way of measuring how they are doing. A fun way to find out is the Climate Hero carbon calculator, a five-minute quiz on your lifestyle choices that gives you a personal carbon emissions figure. The questions are about where you live, how you heat your home, your methods of travel, what you eat and how you shop. It gives you a pat on the back for a good score and lets you know how close you are to \u201cclimate hero\u201d status. However, honesty is required to get to the greatest potential benefit.

            "date": "2023-03-22T13:21:35Z",
            "content": "Pressure is growing on the international shipping industry to accept a carbon levy on ships that would fund climate action in the developing world, with the World Bank among those pushing for the measure at a crucial international meeting this week, the Guardian has learned. A levy on the greenhouse gas emissions produced from shipping would encourage companies to upgrade their fleets, run them more efficiently and seek cleaner fuels and technologies. Shipping accounts for more than 3% of global carbon emissions, but is regarded as one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, as ships run on heavy, dirty, high-carbon fuel oil. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), made up of 175 governments, is hosting meetings in London this week at which the contribution of shipping to the climate crisis will be a key focus. Many nations are concerned that the sector has done too little to address its impact on the climate. A proposal from the World Bank, seen by the Guardian, would require shipping companies to pay into a fund based on the amount of carbon their fleets emit. Those funds could be spent on reducing emissions from shipping, but the World Bank is pushing to see them directed instead towards projects that could help reduce emissions in poor countries. At previous IMO meetings, some countries wanted any revenues from a carbon levy to be recycled for spending only within the maritime transport sector. But the World Bank\u2019s research has found that would be unfair, as many developing countries that are landlocked or have small fleets would not benefit. Using a share of a shipping levy \u201cto finance broader climate aims in these countries could thus help to support a more equitable transition\u201d, according to the bank. The IMO will come under fierce pressure at its meetings this week, which run until 24 March, to show greater urgency in decarbonising shipping. Emissions from shipping, along with those from aviation, have long been omitted from international climate agreements, such as the Paris agreement, because the transnational nature of transport makes it hard to allot their emissions to a particular country. That has allowed the sector to escape scrutiny, in the eyes of campaigners. Tristan Smith, reader in energy and shipping at UCL, said discussions at the IMO last year had shown that many countries accepted the need to regulate carbon from shipping, but the outcome of this week\u2019s meeting was still uncertain. \u201cI think the chances are high that we will have a carbon price and that there will be a fund and revenue disbursement. The exact quantums are uncertain, as are the specifics of use. But there was consensus in the debates last year that we will have an \u2018economic\u2019 element or measure \u2013 some sort of pricing mechanism \u2013 and that this will need to help ensure a just and equitable transition,\u201d he said. A key difficulty would be designing a levy and fund that works for enough of the IMO member states, which all have different priorities for how they would like the fund to be disbursed, he said. John Maggs, shipping policy director of the Seas at Risk campaigning group, praised the World Bank for its proposals. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that they are engaging so thoughtfully. At the last shipping climate negotiating round the World Bank called for a 40% cut in ship emissions by 2030. Only the environment groups were calling for more, and not much more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much what the science says is needed but many in the shipping space are in denial about that, thinking they can [carry on] business as usual to 2030 and then phase in new fuels. The numbers simply don\u2019t add up for that kind of approach, and World Bank recognition of that is important.\u201d The World Bank has come under fire in recent months, as many governments have called for reform of its practices, because of a perceived lack of action on the climate crisis. David Malpass, who was appointed by Donald Trump, resigned after months of controversy, and is to be replaced by the former head of Mastercard Ajay Banga. Maggs said the new proposals should reassure vulnerable countries: \u201cThe negotiations at IMO are not being helped by the sense in the developing world, especially small island developing states and the least developed countries, that they are going to suffer economically as a result of any new shipping measure, so anything that points the way towards a just financial settlement is very important.\u201d A spokesperson for the World Bank told the Guardian: \u201cBy conducting and sharing analytics related to reducing emissions from international shipping in an effective and equitable manner, the World Bank seeks to support its twin goals: eradicating extreme poverty, and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner, in general; and to inform, facilitate, and accelerate evidence-based climate policymaking in line with the Paris agreement temperature goals at the IMO.\u201d"

On Friday Guardian Australia reported that Centrelink\u2019s voice authentication system can be tricked using a free online AI cloning service and just four minutes of audio of the user\u2019s voice. After the Guardian Australia journalist Nick Evershed cloned his own voice, he was able to access his account using his cloned voice and his customer reference number. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The voiceprint service, provided by the Microsoft-owned voice software company Nuance, was being used by 3.8 million Centrelink clients at the end of February, and more than 7.1 million people had verified their voice using the same system with the Australian Taxation Office. Despite being alerted to the vulnerability last week, Services Australia has not indicated it will change its use of voice ID, saying the technology is a \u201chighly secure authentication method\u201d and the agency \u201ccontinually scans for potential threats and make ongoing enhancements to ensure customer security\u201d. The Greens senator David Shoebridge said the finding was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d for people who rely on government services and there needed to be a regulatory framework for the collection and use of biometric data. \u201cThe concerns here go beyond the use of AI to trick voiceprint,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are few, if any, protections on the collection or use of our biometric data to feed and train corporate AI systems. \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on a whack-a-mole approach to digital security where issues are only dealt with once they embarrass the federal government.\u201d Shoebridge said the $10bn in funding in last year\u2019s budget for the Australian Signals Directorate\u2019s Redspice cyber defence program should include an investment to ensure that threats such as the misuse of AI could be identified and protected against on a whole-of-government basis. Guardian Australia has sought comment from the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, who is responsible for the ASD. Shoebridge said the government should also audit agencies using voice recognition to ensure any further security flaws were identified and fixed. \u201cThe government\u2019s main objective with the use of such technologies is to cut operating costs as opposed to what is best for the millions of Australians who rely on government agencies and services,\u201d he said. \u201cThese government savings are almost always paid for by Centrelink\u2019s clients.\u201d In the 2021-22 financial year Services Australia reported that it used voice biometrics to authenticate 56,000 calls each workday, and to authenticate more than 39% of all calls to Centrelink\u2019s main business lines. Between August 2021 and June 2022 it was used in 11.4% of all child support calls, or more than 450 each working day."

            "date": "2023-03-20T07:01:10Z",
            "content": "Good morning. Last year, TikTok was the most downloaded app in the world. It has a reported user base of more than a billion people and remains the fastest-growing social media platform since 2020. But now a succession of countries have banned it from government devices \u2013 with the UK announcing late last week it will join the US, the EU and New Zealand in imposing controls. Whether or not you actually use it, TikTok\u2019s ubiquity has meant that many of us engage with video content that has originated from the app as it migrates across other platforms. Beyond the general criticisms aimed at TikTok \u2013 its addictive nature, its mysterious algorithm, its \u201cshoppertainment\u201d model \u2013 the Chinese-owned social media company has attracted a lot of attention from western governments who cite the app as a security issue. Despite its insistence that user data is safe, TikTok has been unable to assuage suspicions that have been brewing since its popularity exploded five years ago. Government officials in the west have maintained that its ownership by Chinese tech giant ByteDance puts sensitive user data at risk of being accessed by the Chinese government. And as geopolitical tensions between China and the US continue to grow, TikTok has found itself in the firing line. This shift could have huge repercussions for the social media giant \u2013 yesterday, it was reported that the BBC has urged its staff to delete the app from their corporate mobile phones, and no ones knows who else might follow suit. I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s global technology editor, Dan Milmo, about why TikTok has climbed to the top of the security agenda. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Police | The leader of Britain\u2019s police chiefs, Martin Hewitt, has said the Metropolitan Police has no \u201cGod-given right\u201d to exist in its current size if it cannot regain public trust that has rapidly deteriorated after a series of scandals. Hewitt, who is retiring after three decades in policing, has said it would take years for the force to regain the confidence of the public. Strikes | A cross-union group comprised of members from Britain\u2019s biggest health unions are organising a campaign to reject the 5% pay increase being recommended by union leaders because it was well below inflation. Climate crisis | Fiame Naomi Mata\u2019af, the prime minister of Samoa, has issued a desperate plea for action ahead of a landmark IPCC report that is expected to issue a scientific \u201cfinal warning\u201d on the climate emergency. \u201cThere are already examples in the Pacific of communities, whole communities, that have relocated to different countries,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really having to address issues of sovereignty through loss of land.\u201d Russia-China ties | Vladimir Putin has praised Xi Jinping as a \u201cgood old friend\u201d in an article published in China on the eve of a state visit to Moscow by the Chinese president, his first since the invasion of Ukraine. Emergency services | The government has launched a new public warning system where siren-like alerts will be sent to mobile phones about events that may put life in danger, such as severe flooding, wildfires or extreme weather. The Cabinet Office is planning a nationwide trial next month. In depth: \u2018TikTok aggressively harvests your data \u2013 but that\u2019s pretty generic social media behaviour\u2019 The US government has made its stance clear: Beijing-based ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s owners, have to divest their stakes in the company or the video-sharing platform risks being banned from the country altogether. It is a dramatic escalation in the back and forth that has been happening between TikTok and the US government. But how much of this is really about TikTok? And what will happen next? *** What actually is the security risk? So far, there\u2019s no hard evidence to suggest that TikTok has been asked to hand over user data to the Chinese state or that it is manipulating its algorithm to push pro-Chinese propaganda. Dan points out that its practices so far seem to be no different to any other social media platform: \u201cThe overarching debate about TikTok is that it aggressively harvests your data, your location, your likes etc. But that\u2019s pretty generic social media behaviour \u2013 on a basic level it\u2019s no different to anyone else.\u201d This is not to say that the fears are completely unfounded: ByteDance itself admitted that employees used their own app to spy on reporters in an attempt to track down the journalists\u2019 sources, severely damaging TikTok\u2019s credibility. TikTok has also unveiled security plans in Europe and the US that will cost the company \u20ac1.2bn and $1.5bn respectively to convince western governments that it is protecting user data. All data of American users, for instance, would be stored within the US, or in Norway and Ireland for those accessing the app in Europe. Critics however are unconvinced that this is enough, saying that ultimately ByteDance has to comply with demands from the Chinese government. *** How likely is a sale? TikTok\u2019s outsized cultural influence, paired with its highly engaged and growing user base means that it is a tremendous asset. However, Dan points out that selling still wouldn\u2019t necessarily be smooth sailing. \u201cThere is an assumption among some experts in the field that the Chinese state will seek to block a divestment of TikTok from its Chinese owners because it owns precious IP [intellectual property] like its famed recommendation algorithm that makes its For You feed such a compelling experience,\u201d Dan explains. Buying TikTok or a significant chunk of it would come with a lot of baggage and complex, unanswered questions about how exactly it could entirely unravel itself from ByteDance. Also, at a potential price of over $50bn for the US business alone, finding buyers that have pockets deep enough will be difficult. Companies like Snap would struggle to take that on, and there would be big antitrust concerns for any social media buyer. Microsoft and Oracle were potential suitors when Donald Trump\u2019s administration first tried to force through a sale of TikTok US in 2020, but that process was derailed amid successful legal challenges from TikTok. And with the Chinese government in the background too, a sale could be messy. *** Will there be a nationwide ban? Rishi Sunak has set out what the UK intends to do about TikTok: copy everyone else. In this case, the British government seems happy to follow the example of its allies. \u201cQuite clearly what the government announced this week was related to what the United States, Canada, Belgium and the European Commission has done,\u201d Dan says. The logical next step is that if the US is able to follow through with its threats that the UK would follow in its footsteps. But a nationwide ban is a very big leap from banning civil servants and politicians from using the app on government phones. It\u2019s become a staple part of many people\u2019s social media diet and \u201can increasing number of people\u2019s livelihoods depend on TikTok as creators, [so] moving to ban that entirely is quite a big step and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet,\u201d Dan says. It is also important to note that the question of banning TikTok in the US is not legally settled. While there is bipartisan political consensus, TikTok has previously been able to ward off pressure from the White House. \u201cThey successfully sued Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to ban the app in the US, so there already is a precedent of legal defence there, which would make it quite difficult for Biden.\u201d *** TikTok becomes more open TikTok\u2019s transition from cultural phenomenon to geopolitical pariah is a symbol of the hardening relationship between the US, the west more broadly, and China. The spy balloons saga, rising tensions over Taiwan and China\u2019s relationship with Russia has meant that TikTok is merely the latest site of contention about a much larger issue than a video-sharing app. But, TikTok has responded to its changing position, deciding it is time to come out of the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019s suddenly become a much more public facing company. Its executives talk to journalists a lot more and it\u2019s been making a lot more appearances in front of politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to try to state its case,\u201d Dan says. Whether this is enough is yet to be seen. *** What\u2019s next? It\u2019s unlikely that this hostility will stop at TikTok. Other Chinese tech firms and products are likely in the crosshairs of western politicians, says Dan. \u201cSo the obvious question is who\u2019s next? Because either way it seems like this is about China, not TikTok.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading It has been two decades since the UK and the US invaded Iraq, marking the start of a long, bloody war that was \u201cbased on flawed intelligence, months of lying to the world, and a casual disregard for international law\u201d, write Emma Graham-Harrison and Salim Habib.

            "content": "The cybersecurity firm Darktrace has warned that since the release of ChatGPT it has seen an increase in criminals using artificial intelligence to create more sophisticated scams to con employees and hack into businesses. The Cambridge-based company, which reported a 92% drop in operating profits in the half year to the end of December, said AI was further enabling \u201chacktivist\u201d cyber-attacks using ransomware to extort money from businesses. The company said it had seen the emergence of more convincing and complex scams by hackers since the launch of the hugely popular Microsoft-backed AI tool ChatGPT last November. \u201cDarktrace has found that while the number of email attacks across its own customer base remained steady since ChatGPT\u2019s release, those that rely on tricking victims into clicking malicious links have declined while linguistic complexity, including text volume, punctuation and sentence length among others, have increased,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis indicates that cybercriminals may be redirecting their focus to crafting more sophisticated social engineering scams that exploit user trust.\u201d However, Darktrace said that the phenomenon had not yet resulted in a new wave of cybercriminals emerging, merely changing the tactics of the existing cohort. \u201cChatGPT has [not] yet lowered barriers to entry for threat actors significantly, but it does believe that it may have helped increase the sophistication of phishing emails, enabling adversaries to create more targeted, personalised, and ultimately, successful attacks,\u201d the company said. Darktrace also warned in its results that it had seen a \u201cnoticeable\u201d slowdown in businesses signing up for its security products in the final three months of last year. It attributed the drop in its operating profits in the last six months of 2022 to a tax bill relating to the vesting of share awards for its chief executive, Poppy Gustafsson, and finance boss, Cathy Graham, which had forced it to reduce its forecast of free cashflow this year. The company, whose market capitalisation of \u00a31.9bn is far from the heady highs of almost \u00a37bn months after flotation, said it had increased its customer base by a quarter year-on-year from 6,573 to 8,178 in the six months to the end of December. Darktrace, which has been subjected to a barrage of criticism from short-sellers unconvinced that it can deliver on its aim of becoming a potential European superpower in the US-dominated cybersecurity space, said it was not concerned by the recent slump in new business. \u201cAlthough there has been a slowdown in new customer wins, I am pleased that our investments in retaining customers and increasing the value of both new and existing contracts are paying off,\u201d said Gustafsson, who pointed to 36% year-on-year growth in revenues in the six months to the end of December. \u201cOur business continues to deliver against a challenging macro-economic backdrop, with continued strong year-on-year revenue growth.\u201d"

            "content": "The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has apologised for a peak-hour meltdown of the Sydney rail network less than three weeks out from the state election. The shutdown on Wednesday afternoon left tens of thousands of passengers stranded, with Uber fares spiking to hundreds of dollars in surge-price fees. Amid a backlash on Thursday, Uber promised to reimburse customers who were charged the surge prices.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Those concerns were dismissed by transport chiefs on Thursday, who blamed a fault in the network\u2019s communications. Transport for NSW said the network had been shut down for safety reasons after the digital train radio system on the network failed about 2.45pm. The system was back online within about an hour but delays ensued into the peak period. The head of Sydney Trains, Matt Longland, said \u201cbased on the detailed review overnight\u201d the delays had been caused by a failure in a piece of technology and were not \u201crelated to any suspected issue in terms of any cyber activity or any anything of that nature\u201d. The failure came in the network\u2019s emergency system, known as Frequentis, which Longland said was managed by a third-party \u201ctechnology partner\u201d. A backup system supposed to kick in in the event of a fault had not worked, he said, something Sydney Trains was still investigating. Asked on Thursday whether the system should be run in-house, he said the agency made case-by-case decisions. \u201cThe decision that we made at the time in 2016 was really about buying a proven system that operates internationally,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the system that we\u2019ve got. It has been operating very reliably but certainly it\u2019s a case-by-case basis in terms of technology.\u201d The shutdown \u2013 that followed months of chaos on the network last year, stemming from an industrial dispute with the state rail union \u2013 was seized on by the NSW Labor party, with the shadow transport minister, Jo Haylen, saying the government had failed to manage the city\u2019s rail network. \u201cThe lights were out across Sydney trains but they were also out in the retiring transport minister\u2019s office,\u201d she said. The Greens MP Sue Higginson encouraged those stuck in Sydney\u2019s \u201ctrain chaos\u201d to send their rideshare or taxi receipts to the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the NSW Liberals. Elliott said the glitch could have occurred under any government. \u201cThe comments made by the Greens and Labor MPs simply reinforce the point that both are desperately trying to score political points from a highly operational transport issue,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThe fact is that this operational issue (glitch in router/modem) could and would have occurred under any minister or government. Unless of course the Greens and Labor parties know something we all don\u2019t.\u201d Uber said it had not been alerted by Transport for NSW about the outage, and people who were charged above the surge cap would be refunded within 48 hours. \u201cWhile in the past we have been alerted by Transport for NSW when there were Sydney-wide transport issues, in this instance we had no warning that there would be such a complete outage on the NSW trains network,\u201d the spokesperson said. Uber said that as soon as it became aware of the situation, the company had \u201cimmediately\u201d lowered the surge and communicated with driver-partners encouraging them to come online."

            "date": "2023-03-08T00:49:21Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s Deakin University will be the first foreign tertiary education institution in the world to establish a campus in India as the Albanese government ramps up prospects in the rapidly developing sector. The $4m campus deal will be announced during the prime minister\u2019s trip to Ahmedabad in India on Wednesday alongside senior Indian ministers and higher education representatives from Deakin, the University of Melbourne and Universities Australia. Late last year India announced new regulations allowing foreign universities and educational institutions to open offshore Gujarat International Finance Tec City (Gift) campuses and repatriate profits in a range of courses, including financial management, science, technology, engineering and Stem subjects. Deakin\u2019s Gift City campus \u2013 the first of its kind to be approved by the Indian government \u2013 will initially deliver cybersecurity and business analytics courses to Indian students, with a capacity for 100 enrolments annually. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Under India\u2019s sweeping national education plan, the government is aiming for half of its young population to gain vocational or higher education degrees by 2035 \u2013 an increase of 500 million students. Speaking at the announcement on Wednesday evening, the chief executive of Universities Australia, Catriona Jackson, will champion education as \u201cfront and centre\u201d of efforts to strengthen the bilateral relationship, saying Australia is a \u201cvery willing partner\u201d in the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s a great time of opportunity for Australia and India,\u201d she will say, according to a copy of her remarks distributed in advance. \u201cAustralia and India have 450 formal partnerships between them. Since 2005, more than 1.5 million Indians have obtained an Australian university degree. We can build on this \u2013 for the benefit of both nations. \u201cRight now, more Indian students are studying at Australian universities than before the pandemic \u2026 this is a golden era for Australia and India\u2019s relationship.\u201d The Australian government has been quick to express its interest in capitalising on the country\u2019s expanding sector. Anthony Albanese and his counterpart, Narendra Modi, discussed fostering closer educational collaboration during their first bilateral meeting after the Albanese took power in May last year. Last week the education minister, Jason Clare, signed a groundbreaking agreement with his Indian counterpart on a week-long trip to India. The agreement, the most \u201cbroad-ranging\u201d in the nation\u2019s history, locks in rules for mutual recognition to access education in the two nations, including VET and tertiary qualifications provided online and offshore. Clare was accompanied by the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, 11 vice-chancellors, five peak groups and a regulator on the trip, where universities announced memorandums of understanding. Education is Australia\u2019s largest services export to India, with almost 70,000 students studying in Australia at the end of January 2023. Indian students are the fastest growing cohort of international students in Australia and the second biggest demographic behind China. There has been a 160% jump in the number of students arriving from India over the past year, coinciding with a drop in Chinese student enrolments. At the Australian Technology Network of Universities, which represents Deakin, Indian applications and offers are almost double 2019 levels, while Chinese applications are at 75% and grew by just 7% from 2022 to 2033. Speaking at a Sydney dialogue, the minister for external affairs in India, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said India used Covid to bring forward \u201cimportant reforms\u201d and was now \u201cbullish\u201d in its outlook. \u201cThere\u2019s one area in our relationship that we need to attack more strongly, and that is really encouraging more on the investment side,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s today a great mismatch between geographies of demand and geographies of demographics \u2026 Education is bigger than education, it\u2019s about the talent and skills needed to sustain the global economy. \u201cHow do we expand in India the ability to impart skills and education? We would very much welcome Australian universities in India to do that, because having people around physically \u2013 we\u2019re talking about 100,000 people.\u201d Also on Wednesday, the University of Melbourne is expected to announce plans to launch a bachelor of science dual degree with three of India\u2019s leading universities. The University of Wollongong announced its intention to establish a campus at Gift City in July last year and is still working towards achieving approval. The announcement follows a lengthy partnership with Deakin in the south-east Asia region. The university was the first international institution to open an office in India in 1994 and the first to offer complete degrees online."

            "title": "UK economy rebounds as Jeremy Hunt finalises budget",
            "date": "2023-03-10T13:48:53Z",
            "content": "The UK economy rebounded more than expected in January, providing a modest boost to the chancellor as he puts the finishing touches to next week\u2019s budget. Growth of 0.3% month on month was driven by a broad-based return of activity across the education, health and recreation sectors, including the return of football\u2019s Premier League after the winter World Cup, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The rise of private GPs and other private health services also played a part as more people with health problems went private amid lengthy NHS waiting lists. City economists had expected growth of only 0.1% month on month after a combination of industrial action and inflation weighed on the economy. It followed a 0.5% slump in GDP in December. The latest figures are expected to give the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, a slight boost before the budget, when he will set out the government\u2019s tax and spending policies. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said \u201cconfidence is returning\u201d to the UK economy, adding it was doing \u201cbetter than people had feared\u201d. Hunt said that while the UK economy had proved more resilient than many expected, \u201cthere is a long way to go\u201d. He added: \u201cNext week, I will set out the next stage of our plan to halve inflation, reduce debt and grow the economy \u2013 so we can improve living standards for everyone.\u2019\u2019 Most forecasts for GDP growth in 2023 have improved since the Treasury\u2019s autumn statement in November, when analysts were predicting a long recession in the wake of Liz Truss\u2019s destabilising mini-budget. Most analysts expect a milder recession than they did at the beginning of the year, although the recovery is forecast to be equally shallow. However, analysts said the economy lagged behind the UK\u2019s rivals in the G7 and the risk of a recession in the first half of the year was high. The ONS said the economy was still 0.2% smaller than its pre-pandemic peak. Darren Morgan, the ONS director of economic statistics, said a return of children to classrooms after unusually high absences in the run-up to Christmas was one of the main reasons a 0.5% fall in December was partly reversed in January. \u201cThe Premier League clubs returned to a full schedule after the end of the World Cup and private health providers also had a strong month. Postal services also partially recovered from the effects of December\u2019s strikes,\u201d he said. \u201cThese were somewhat offset by a notable drop in construction, with a slowdown in infrastructure projects and housebuilding having another poor month, partly due to heavy rainfall.\u201d Yael Selfin, the chief UK economist at KPMG, said lower wholesale energy prices would give the economy a boost, \u201cbut this may not be sufficient to stave off a recession in the first half of this year, as consumer spending remains weak with households continuing to be squeezed by elevated prices and higher interest rates\u201d. Trade flows were also depressed in January, continuing a downward trend since the UK quit the EU\u2019s single market and customs union. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said analysis of the latest data showed \u201cexports remain impeded by Brexit\u201d, and the UK still lagged behind other industrialised economies. The ONS said the deficit in goods and services trade widened by \u00a33.5bn in January to \u00a327.6bn in the three months to January, \u201cas exports fell by more than imports\u201d. The ONS estimates that the pre-2021 data on exports to the EU would be about 5% higher than currently reported, if they had been based on a previous system of customs declarations. \u201cAccordingly, the damage from Brexit is even larger than the trade data initially suggest,\u201d Tombs said. Business groups said the rise in GDP would do little to ease the pressures on small firms suffering from high inflation and a rise in business taxes. Tina McKenzie, the policy vice-chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \u201cWhile January\u2019s figures are a glimmer of hope, the flat growth over the previous three months means we\u2019re not out of the woods yet, with tough trading conditions persisting for many small firms. \u201cPlenty of challenges remain. Inflation has only barely eased, and the tax burden for small firms is as high as it\u2019s been for seven decades.\u201d The UK economy narrowly avoided sliding into recession at the end of 2022 but the Bank of England has forecast a recession in the first half of this year, while inflation and interest rates remain high, depressing consumer spending and business investment."

Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Is SVB a worry? Tsy Sec Yellen said the US Treasury is watching \u201ca few banks\u201d but there is no sense of a wider panic even as some of the regionals were hit \u2013 deep early losses at the open were pared reasonably quickly and bank stocks came sharply off the lows.

This is a headwind for net interest margins, revenue and EPS\u201d - Morgan Stanley. Some late breaking news: US regulators have shut down Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and taken control of its customer deposits. It\u2019s the largest failure of a US bank since 2008, and came after the bank failed to raise new capital today. Officials said they shut the bank to \u201cprotect insured depositors\u201d. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which typically protects deposits up to $250,000, said it had taken charge of the deposits. As we covered through the day, trading in SVB\u2019s shares was halted after they plunged 60% yesterday, after revealing it had lost $1.8bn on a sale of securities \u2013 forcing it to look to raise funds. The FT says it is the second-largest bank failure in US history after the 2008 collapse of Washington Mutual. They add: The bank had abandoned its efforts to raise $2.25bn in new funding to cover losses on its bond portfolio earlier in the day and had been looking for a buyer to save it, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Time to recap\u2026. The US economy has added more jobs than expected last month, but wage growth has cooled. The US Non-Farm Payroll rose by 311,000 new hires last month, more than expected, but a slowdown on the blowout 504,000 recorded in January. The unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, as more people looked for work. But the dollar weakened, with the data showing a slowdown in wage growth. Average hourly earnings for all private workers rose 0.2% versus 0.3% in January, with annual earnings up 4.6%. Shares of some of the world\u2019s largest banks have fallen as fears over the future of a small California lender ripple through the markets. Investors were spooked by news that California-based Silicon Valley Bank, which primarily lends to tech startups, had launched an emergency share sale to shore up cash after revealing it had lost $1.8bn (\u00a31.5bn) when it sold a portfolio of bonds in response to a decline in customer deposits. SVB\u2019s US-listed shares plunged 60% on Thursday but the rout also spread to other Wall Street stocks. Its shares were halted on Friday after tumbling 66% in premarket trading. UPDATE: US regulators have now taken over Silicon Valley Bank. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index is down 149 points, or 1.9%, in late trading at 7,730. HSBC are down 5%, with Standard Chartered off 4.6% and Barclays losing 4.4%. The UK economy grew faster than expected in January, we learned today. GDP rose by 0.3%, helped by a return of schoolchildren to class after a flurry of illness in December, and Premier League football restarting after the World Cup. The UK\u2019s National Food Crime Unit (NFCU) is investigating a possible case of food fraud after a supermarket stocked beef with false British labels.

A payout for the boss of BP has been labelled a \u201ckick in the teeth\u201d for consumers battling the cost of living crisis, as chief executive Bernard Looney saw his pay package more than double to \u00a310m after the oil and gas giant landed record profits linked to the war in Ukraine.

They will keep the number of points they have already collected, which will still be worth the same amount. The UK economy is \u2018going nowhere\u2019, warns our economics editor Larry Elliott. Following this morning\u2019s GDP report, showing 0.3% growth in January \u2013 but no growth over the last year \u2013 he writes: Jeremy Hunt took comfort from the fact the economy is showing more resilience than expected but rightly noted there was a \u201clong way to go\u201d. The good news for the chancellor is that the recession predicted by the Bank of England last November has yet to materialise, and even if it does come to pass is likely to be shorter and more shallow than expected last autumn. Higher growth means stronger tax receipts, lower borrowing and some extra wriggle room for Hunt in next week\u2019s budget. The bad news is that it is going to be some time before the economy benefits from lower global gas prices and falling inflation. GDP is not going to do much more than edge sideways again this year, if that, and even after beating forecasts in January it is still possible the economy will contract in the first quarter. The boost to private healthcare noted by the ONS is an indication of the effect on the economy of this winter\u2019s widespread industrial action. skip past newsletter promotion Sterling is on track for its best day against the US dollar since the first week of January. The news that the UK economy grew faster than expected in January has boosted the pound, while the mixed US jobs report weakened dollar. Analysts say the 0.3% increase in GDP in January, ahead of forecasts of a 0.1% gain, has eased fears of a recession. Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, explains: \u201cAt this stage, we are far from convinced that a technical recession in 2023 is the foregone conclusion that many in the market have made out. We think that the resilience of the UK economy will provide decent support for the pound in the coming months.\u201d The pound is currrently up 1.4% against the dollar at $1.2090, its biggest jump against the greenback since 6 January. John Cronin, a financial analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, believes the sell-off in UK bank stocks is unwarranted. As covered this morning, shares in UK-listed banks fell amid the jitters created by Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s emergency share sale to raise cash, after it incurred a $1.8bn on the sale of bonds. Cronin points out that given that deposits at most big banks come from the retail market rather than tech startups, and that those same lenders would have to unwind the \u201cenormous\u201d cash balances held by the Bank of England before selling off any of their investment portfolios. Furthermore, UK lenders also hedge risks linked to those portfolios. Here\u2019s the full story: Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s UK arm has issued a statement, pointing out that it is a \u201cstandalone independent banking institution\u201d that is regulated and governed by the Prudential Regularory Authority in the UK. It says: Silicon Valley bank UK has been an independent subsidiary since August 2022 with a separate balance sheet to the SVB Financial Group and an independent UK Board of directors. Silicon Valley Bank UK fully abides by the UK regulatory requirements as covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and by the Financial Ombudsman Service. SVB UK, Ltd. is ring-fenced from the parent and its other subsidiaries. Erin Platts, CEO and head of EMEA, says the bank has received support from its community of investors and start-up founders: SVB has supported investors and innovators for 40 years and we have been so humbled with the consistent drum of support coming from our UK investor and founder community in last few days. We appreciate that this is a concerning time for our clients so we are working tirelessly to support them and give more context\u201d Wall Street has opened slightly lower, with the main indices down around 0.2%. Back in the troubled banking sector: SVB Financial Group\u2019s efforts to raise money have failed and the troubled bank was in talks to sell itself, CNBC reported on Friday, as a crisis at the tech-heavy lender rippled through global markets and hit banking stocks. Shares of SVB Financial Group were halted on Friday after tumbling 66% in premarket trading. SVB, which does business as Silicon Valley Bank, was not immediately available for comment, Reuters reports. US job creation is still running well over the historic average, despite slowing to 311,000 new jobs in February. And while that\u2019s excellent news for workers, it may encourage the US Federal Reserve to keep tightening monetary policy, raising interest rates to cool inflation. Nathaniel Casey, Investment Strategist at wealth manager Evelyn Partners, explains: Despite reporting above consensus estimates, today\u2019s jobs report saw NFPs revert closer to recent trends after January\u2019s gain of 517k. The unemployment rate increased slightly to 3.6%. With January\u2019s payrolls figure seemingly an anomaly and wage growth continuing to slow, the Federal Reserve can feel slightly more optimistic that a tight labour market will not stoke inflation further. However, the Fed still has more work to do with NFP\u2019s running well above the post-Second World War monthly average of 123k. Despite a slowdown in job creation signalling relatively bad news for the economic outlook, it will be seen as good news to markets, Casey adds: During Fed chair Powell\u2019s testimony to Congress earlier in the week, he noted that recent economic data - including employment - had partly reversed the softening seen during the end of 2022. He went on to note that if economic data was to continue to revert those softening trends, the Fed would be prepared to \u2018increase the pace of rate hikes\u2019 to regain price stability. With the Jobs data now softening again and the unemployment rate ticking up, the market can feel slightly relieved that the likelihood of the Fed increasing the pace of hikes has fallen for the time being. The labour force participation rate among \u2018prime-age\u2019 workers (ages 25 to 54) in the US has risen to its levels in early 2020. That suggests that the workers who left the labor market during the pandemic have been returning \u2013 either finding jobs or looking for them. Average hourly earnings growth has slowed to 0.2% month-on-month, from 0.3%, the US jobs report shows. On an annual basis, average hourly pay growth was weaker than expected, at 4.6%. The US unemployment rate has edged up to 3.6% for February, with the number of unemployed persons rising to 5.9 million, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. There were notable job gains across US leisure and hospitality companies, retail trade, government, and health care. But employment declined in the information sector, and in transportation and warehousing. Newsflash: Job creation across the US slowed last month, but more jobs were created than expected. The Non-Farm Payroll, a closely-watched measure of US employment, rose by 311,000 in February, rather stronger than the 205,000 which was expected. That follows a (downwardly revised) 504,000 in January. January\u2019s non-farm payroll increase had initially been estimated at 517,000 jobs last month. It\u2019s nearly time for the US unemployment report for February, which could add more volatility to the markets. Economists predict that around 205,000 new jobs were added last month. A strong jobs report could encourage the US Federal Reserve to keep raising intrerest rates. The UK Serious Fraud Office has dropped the prosecution of three former managers at G4S, two years after the security company took responsibility for fraud related to government contracts for electronically tagging offenders. The SFO on Friday told a London court that there was no longer a public interest in pursuing the case, because of requirements for disclosure of evidence to the people charged that would have dragged out for at least another year, with the prospect of a six-month trial at its end. The scandal emerged in 2013, with G4S agreeing it had tried to \u201cdishonestly mislead\u201d the Ministry of Justice to boost profits on the tagging programme after some offenders recorded as electronically tagged were found to be dead, back in prison or abroad. G4S agreed to compensate the Ministry of Justice in 2014, reaching a settlement worth \u00a3121m. G4S was fined \u00a344m and agreed to overhaul its governance as part of a 2020 deferred prosecution agreement with the SFO. An SFO spokesperson said: \u201cAs a public prosecutor we have to make difficult decisions, including ending a prosecution where it is right to do so. In line with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, we have determined it is no longer in the public interest to continue this prosecution.\u201d The decision means it is likely that no individuals will be prosecuted in relation to the alleged overcharging by G4S. The three men prosecuted have denied wrongdoing throughout the case. Richard Morris, the former CEO of G4S UK &amp; Ireland who was one of the people charged by the SFO, criticised the prosecutors and his former employer for agreeing that fraud was committed, saying the allegation of \u201cwrongdoing\u201d against him was \u201ca wholly untrue allegation\u201d. He said: \u201cThis amounted to G4S signing a false confession, plain and simple.\u201d A spokesperson for the G4S subsidiary involved said: \u201cG4S Care and Justice Services (UK) Limited settled this legacy issue in 2014 through a full commercial settlement with the Ministry of Justice and subsequently agreed a deferred prosecution agreement with the SFO. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment on the cases involving the individuals.\u201d In the commodity markets, wheat futures are on track for their fourth weekly fall in a row, amid growing expectations of a Black Sea deal, to allow Ukraine to continue shipping grains. Prices touched their lowest since July 2021 this morning, and are down more than 15% during the last four weeks, Reuters points out: The U.S. and European wheat markets have been under pressure from Russian export competition and expectations that the wartime grain corridor from Ukraine will be extended beyond this month, increasing available global supplies. \u201cFor the moment, as negotiations are still in progress, operators still favour a renewal of the export corridor from Ukraine,\u201d French consultancy Agritel said in a note. Earlier this week Ukraine\u2019s president and the UN secretary general called for an extension to the deal allowing Russian and Ukrainian wheat and fertilisers to be exported through the Black Sea, amid reports that Moscow does not intend to renew its participation. Britain\u2019s consumer services sector has yet to recover to its pre-Covid levels, January\u2019s GDP report shows. Overall, consumer facing services remain 8.6% below their pre-pandemic levels, whilst all other services were 2.1% above their February 2020 levels. Modupe Adegbembo, G7 Economist at AXA Investment Managers, explains: Consumer facing services have remained subdued as households pull back on discretionary spending and have also been impacted by industrial action particularly on transport rose by 0.3% on the month, following a fall of 1.2% in December. AXA predicts the UK economy will shrink by 0.1% in the January-March quarter. That would be the third quarter without growth in a row, after the economy shrank in Q3 and stagnated in Q4 2022. Adegbembo says: The stronger than expected start to Q1 suggests it may be possible for the UK to avoid a technical recession, but the data reflects a rebound following sharp declines in December impacted by strikes across sectors and points less to stronger underlying growth momentum. We continue to expect Q1 growth of -0.1%, with risks skewed to the upside. Back on the GDP report\u2026Moody\u2019s Analytics economist Barbara Teixeira Araujo is concerned that the UK\u2019s production sector, and the building sector, both contracted in January: \u201cU.K. GDP rose by an above-expectations 0.3% m/m in January, partially reversing December\u2019s 0.5% fall. Despite the positive surprise, we caution against reading too much into January\u2019s rise. The monthly data is volatile and evidence abounds that the economy remains extremely weak on the back of high inflation and awfully tight financing conditions. Indeed, the sectoral details paint a very mixed picture, as much of the rebound in services activities was offset by declines in both industrial production and constructions. Our forecast is that the U.K. economy will remain at best flat in the first half of 2023.\u201d That would mean around 18 months of stagnation, as the economy didn\u2019t grow in the year to January. Passengers have been warned that parts of Britain\u2019s rail network will be closed during strikes next week. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) will walk out at 14 train companies on March 16 and 18, as well as March 30 and April 1. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, said it expects 40-50% of services to run on those days but there will be \u201cwide variations\u201d, with some areas having no trains. Affected operators will only run services from around 7.30am until 6.30pm. There will also be disruption to services during the nights before and mornings after each strike. Earlier this week the RMT suspended stirike action at Network Rail, with staff due to vote on a pay offer, but industrial action continues at the train operators. Despite January\u2019s growth, the UK economy has still not regained its pre-pandemic levels, the CBI point out here: Berenberg bank has upgraded its growth forecasts for the UK for the second time in as many weeks, after the economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 0.3% in January. Berenberg now expect the economy to contract by 0.1% during 2023, up from -0.5% forecast before, and keep their 2024 and 2025 calls broadly unchanged at 1.5% and 1.7% (previously 1.6% and 1.7%) respectively. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg says the UK now faces stagflation, instead of recession, this year. At first glance, the degree of economic resilience the UK is \u201csomewhat of a puzzle\u201d, Pickering writes, adding: Factors including falling real retail sales, the housing market correction and near-record low consumer confidence are strongly pointing to at least a mild downturn. But headline GDP data continue to suggest stagflation rather than outright recession. As balance sheets across the private sector are in good health and the labour market is holding up well even as financial conditions tighten, our earlier calls for a historically mild recession now appear too pessimistic. The tension between clear spots of weakness versus favourable fundamentals and robust aggregate output implies a high degree of uncertainty regarding our medium-term calls. European banking stocks were heading for their largest one-day fall in nine months this morning, fears over the health of banks\u2019 bond portfolios rattled nervous investors. Europe\u2019s STOXX banking index fell by over 4%, set for its biggest one-day slide since early June. Deutsche Bank is leading the fallers, down 7.9%, while France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has lost 5.6%. In London.HSBC are down 4.8%, still leading the FTSE 100 fallers. Back in the UK, the NIESR thinktank is hopeful that the economy will only suffer a shallow contraction at worst in the current quarter (January-March). After the economy grew by a better-than-expected 0.3% in January, Paula Bejarano Carbo, associate economist at NIESR, says: GDP grew by 0.3% in January relative to December, driven by growth in services; in particular, education services grew by 2.5% in January as school attendance levels picked up following a December drop. While this appears to be good news for the UK economy, the broader picture is more ambiguous: GDP was flat in the three months to January relative to the previous three months and also flat compared to January 2022. Despite this, the outlook for the first quarter of 2023 continues to improve as higher-frequency data, including the services and construction February PMIs, indicate that activity will continue to pick-up in February, suggesting that any contraction we might see over Q1 is likely to be shallow.\u201d Demand for US dollars in the currency derivative markets has risen to its highest since mid-December. The selloff in US banking stocks last night, and the ripple effect in Europe today, is reigniting a wave of investor risk aversion. Reuters reports: Three-month euro/dollar cross currency basis swap spreads traded as negatively as -17 basis points, the most since December 14, reflecting a pickup in demand for hard cash. The pound, though, has gained half a cent against the US dollar to $1.1978. Traders are suspecting that the US Federal Reserve will be less keen to raise interest rates, as this would add to the pressure on the prices of bonds held by banks. Shares in SVB Financial Group are set to tumble again when Wall Street opens. They\u2019re down around 38% in pre-market trading, at $67.70. That would be on top of Thursday\u2019s 60% slide to $106, after Silicon Valley Bank announced a share sale to shore up its capital position after losing $1.8bn on its sale of government securities. European stock markets are all in the red, with Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC both down around 1.4%. Jochen Stanzl, head market analyst at CMC in Frankfurt, says the news that Silicon Valley Bank had lost around $1.8bn following the sale of a portfolio of securities valued at $21bn has put pressure on European lenders. Stanzl explains (via Reuters): \u201cGerman banks are now also being targeted by the sellers because the start-up financier SVB Financial has revealed something that could also concern them: unrealized losses in the bond portfolio. \u201cThe background is that many banks hold bonds, some of which have collapsed in price at an unprecedented rate. What the market now fears is an implosion on banks\u2019 balance sheets. \u201cInvestors are now waiting for clarifications from the big banks as to whether and to what extent SVB Financial\u2019s problems also apply to them.\u201d The problems at Silicon Valley Bank are a reminder that many banks are sitting on \u201clarge, unrealised losses\u201d on their bond holdings, explains AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould: \u201cLending to tech start-ups is at the racier end of finance and in that context Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s announcement of a $2.25 billion rescue share issue, after a period when appetite from lenders and investors towards this part of the market has dried up, should not have come as a major surprise. \u201cHowever, in a heavily interconnected banking industry it\u2019s not so easy to compartmentalise these sorts of events which often hint at vulnerabilities in the wider system. The fact SVB\u2019s share placing has been accompanied by a fire sale of its bond portfolio raises concerns. \u201cLots of banks hold large portfolios of bonds and rising interest rates make these less valuable \u2013 the SVB situation is a reminder that many institutions are sitting on large unrealised losses on their fixed-income holdings. The pay package of the BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, has more than doubled to \u00a310m after a year in which the oil and gas giant posted record profits linked to the war in Ukraine. His package included a salary of \u00a31.4m, a bonus of \u00a32.4m \u2013 down fractionally on 2021 \u2013 and a \u00a36m share award, as well as benefits. The total package was 120% more than the \u00a34.5m he received in 2021. BP last month reported annual profits of \u00a323bn after its earnings jumped because of soaring wholesale gas prices, sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and cuts to supplies into Europe. Looney could have received a bonus of up to \u00a311.4m under a three-year share award plan that was devised in 2020, when the Covid pandemic punctured oil demand and forced BP to cut 10,000 jobs. More here: Bloomberg reports that Founders Fund, the venture capital fund co-founded by Peter Thiel, has advised companies to pull money from Silicon Valley Bank amid the concerns about its financial stability, according to people familiar with the situation. SVB, though, is advising clients to remain calm: Bloomberg says: The firm told portfolio companies that there was no downside to removing their money from the bank, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. Shares of SVB Financial Group, the bank\u2019s parent, plunged on Thursday after announcing a stock offering, selling substantially all of the available-for-sale securities in its portfolio and updating its forecast for the year to include a sharper decline in net interest income. SVB Chief Executive Officer Greg Becker held a conference call on Thursday advising Silicon Valley Bank clients to \u201cstay calm\u201d amid concern about the bank\u2019s financial position, according to a person familiar with the matter. SVB is a major lender to fledgling companies, so worries about its financial health is causing concern across the startup world, they add. Here\u2019s Mark Dowding, CIO at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, on the jitters over the value of bank bond portfolios: In the past 24 hours, newsflow from Silicon Valley serves as an example of where we have thought caution is needed with respect to investments in private assets. As and when assets are marked to market, losses may be expected to accumulate in this space with the private equity industry slowly realising how dependent it has been on cheap money and leverage in order to juice returns. In discussions with policymakers, a degree of stress in this space is expected and we don\u2019t see anything to alter the Fed\u2019s path, unless losses act as a trigger for a much more broad-based tightening in financial conditions. Billionaire investor and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman says the US government should consider a \u201chighly dilutive\u201d bailout of Silicon Valley Bank to stem the crisis. Ackman tweeted overnight that if a private capital solution can\u2019t be found, the government should step in. Ackman explained that companies backed by venture capital use SVB both for loans and to hold their operating cash, so a failure of the firm could destroy a crucial long-term driver or economic growth. Otherwise, Ackman warns, there is a risk that \u2018the dominoes continue to fall\u2019 if other banks come under pressure. The selloff is gathering pace in London, where the FTSE 100 index is now down 2% or 158 points, at 7722. That would be its biggest one-day fall since last July. Silvergate Capital Corp.\u2019s abrupt shutdown and Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s hasty fundraising have sparked chatter about whether this could be the start of a \u201cmuch bigger problem\u201d, Bloomberg reports. They say: The issue at both of the once-highflying California lenders was an unusually fickle base of depositors who yanked money quickly. But below that is a crack reaching across finance: Rising interest rates have left banks laden with low-interest bonds that can\u2019t be sold in a hurry without losses. So if too many customers tap their deposits at once, it risks a vicious cycle. Across the investing world, \u201cpeople are asking who is the next one?\u201d said Jens Nordvig, founder of market analytics and data intelligence companies Exante Data and Market Reader. \u201cI am getting lots of questions about this from my clients.\u201d Indeed, amid deposit withdrawals at SVB, its chief executive officer urged customers on Thursday to \u201cstay calm.\u201d The immediate risk for many banks may not be existential, according to analysts, but it could still be painful. Rather than facing a major run on deposits, banks will be forced to compete harder for them by offering higher interest payments to savers. That would erode what banks earn on lending, slashing earnings. Here\u2019s the full piece. Economics writer Frances Coppola has a very good blog post about the situation in the banking sector, which is here. Coppola says that the death of Silvergate Bank (a Californian bank focused on crypto) this week should give other banks pause for thought. Silvergate is far from the only bank that is backing volatile demand deposits with government securities that are falling in value as central banks raise interest rates. The value of those government securities (bonds) held by banks has been falling, as rising interest rates made those bonds less valuable. [The price of a government bond moves inversely to the yield, or effective interest rate. Those yields have risen as central banks lift interest rates. A 10-year US Treasury bill yields 3.8% today, up from 0.6% in 2020]. Coppola explains that \u201cfair value losses can be concealed by means of accounting devices such as classing securities as held-to-maturity and carrying them at amortised cost\u201d. But, if a bank is forced to sell such assets, because its depositors are withdrawing their funds, then they will take a loss on them. That\u2019s what happened to Silicon Valley Bank, whose shares tumbled 60% yesterday after it lost around $1.8bn on the sale of about $21bn of securities, prompting a $2.25bn stock sale to shore up its balance sheet. She writes: \u2026unrealised fair value losses on assets marked as held-to-maturity are not reported in the income statement. In fact they are not reported anywhere except in the notes to the accounts. So they don\u2019t affect the bank\u2019s capitalisation. This is fine as long as the bank doesn\u2019t experience a liquidity crisis. When a bank needs liquidity, it pledges or sells securities on the open market or at other banks (including the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve) for cash. Selling securities crystallises fair value losses, and as we saw with Silvergate, standing ready to sell securities to meet an unknown volume of deposit withdrawal requests forces the bank to mark its held-to-maturity assets as available-for-sale. As a result, the fair value losses on held-to-maturity assets immediately go through the income statement: realised losses are deducted from headline profits, and all losses, realised and unrealised, are deducted from shareholders\u2019 equity. You can read the full piece here. The UK stock market has fallen sharply at the start of trading, as the heavy selloff in US bank shares last night worries investors. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index has tumbled by 1.5% or 120 points to 7760, led by Barclays (-6%), NatWest (-4.4%), Lloyds Banking Group (-4.5%) and Standard Chartered (-4%). European bank shares are also sliding: The selloff follows a rout of some US bank shares last night, as problems at small lender Silicon Valley Bank worried Wall Street. Silicon Valley Bank reported that it made a $1.8bn loss on the sale of a $21bn bond portfolio consisting mostly of U.S. Treasuries (government debt), whose values has dropped as interest rates have risen. That prompted SVB to announce a $2bn share sale to shore up its capital position. The steep losses on the sale of the SVB securities las left investors wondering what risks may be lurking in the huge bond portfolios held by other banks. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: SVB bank launched a stock offering of around $2bn to strengthen its balance sheet, because the bank needed to close a hole due to the sale of around $21bn loss-making assets to ensure that they could pay depositors in the actual environment of rising interest rates. And the SVB\u2019s portfolio had a lot of US Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in it. This is an issue that could hit all the banks, including the big banks, because the banks amassed a lot of assets since the 2007/2008 financial crisis at rising prices, and they had to pay nearly no compensation for bank deposits, as interest rates have been near zero for such a long time. And in theory, the rising interest rates would\u2019ve been a boon for the banking sector as it would top their net interest income, as they would start making money on deposits, yet again. But the problem is that the interest rates rose too fast. The Fed raised the rates by 450bp since last year. And now, with inflation hanging at multi-decade highs, bank depositors ask higher compensation for their deposits, and to pay them, banks could be brought to sell their assets. But the assets must be sold at a severe loss, because the asset valuations sank severely from their all-time-high levels as a result of an aggressive Federal Reserve (Fed) tightening. The return of the Premier League after the pause for the men\u2019s World Cup also lifted the economy in January, today\u2019s GDP reports shows. The sports, amusements and recreation activities grew by 8.9% in a month where Premier League football returned to a full schedule following fixtures being postponed until Boxing Day. Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC, says: \u201cThe UK economy grew by 0.3% month on month in January this year, slightly ahead of expectations after reporting a contraction in the prior month. \u201cEconomic activity was boosted with school attendance returning to normal levels, the return of postal employees to work following strikes and the resumption of the Premier League to a full schedule following the World Cup. \u201cThe big picture story, however, remains that of stagnation with output seemingly unable to break through its pre-pandemic level. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, fears a UK recession is \u201cstill on the cards\u201d despite the brightening economic outlook. Selfin says: \u201cThe marked fall in wholesale gas prices and easing of supply chain disruptions provided a welcome boost to economic prospects at the start of 2023. But this may not be sufficient to stave off a recession in the first half of this year, as consumer spending remains weak with households continuing to be squeezed by elevated prices and higher interest rates. \u201cHowever, we expect the current downturn to be shallower and shorter than previously thought, with stronger business sentiment and a steady fall in inflation expected to support the recovery in the second half of the year. Although our latest forecasts see the UK set for a 0.4% fall in GDP this year and only 0.6% growth in 2024 overall due to the weak start and the lack of fiscal momentum and business investment to bolster medium term recovery. The return to growth in January indicates the UK may avoid falling into a recession, says Victoria Scholar, Head of Investment at interactive investor: \u201cUK GDP came in flat year-on-year in the three months to January, above expectations for a drop of 0.1%. The monthly figure rose by 0.3% following a fall of 0.5% in December and topping forecasts for a rise of 0.1%. Driving January\u2019s gain was an uptick in the service sector output which grew by 0.5% following a drop of 0.8% in December with education and a return to normal levels of school attendance as well as a pick up in postal and courier activities. Real estate activities however was the only services subsector in negative territory amid the rise in mortgage rates and subdued housing market activity. Consumer-facing services grew by 0.3% in January recovering from a drop of 1.2% in December thanks to the resumption of Premier League football which strengthened demand for sports and recreation. However they are stuck 8.6% below their pre-covid levels from February 2020. While services improved, manufacturing shrank falling by 0.4% with over half of its subsectors in decline and construction also fell sharply by 1.7%. Heavy industrial action weighed on education and postal service activity in December, with a reduction in strikes in January prompting a rebound in activity to start the year. The end of the FIFA World Cup and the resumption of the Premier League also helped drive demand for football related spending. For now it looks like the UK is on track to avoid a recession with January\u2019s monthly growth figure landing fractionally above zero. When combined with the government\u2019s unexpected budget surplus in January, the data is well timed for the Treasury and could give Chancellor Jeremy Hunt some wiggle room around his Budget plans next Wednesday. In light of the data, the pound is gaining some strength against the US dollar going against the decline over the past year. An appreciating sterling helps to provide a natural offset to UK inflationary pressures.\u201d It is \u201cencouraging\u201d that the economy expanded a little as we entered the New Year, following the contraction in December, says Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. Ussher points out that the economic picture is better than feared last November, which could give Jeremy Hunt more \u2018room to manoeuvre\u2019 in the Budget next Wednesday. The data has been helped by a resumption of business-as-usual in the education and postal sectors, and a return to the full Premier League schedule following the end of the World Cup. It is also encouraging that the retail sector demonstrated growth, albeit slight, given pressures on household budgets. \u201cWhile a flat economy overall is not usually grounds for celebration, the fact that these results are more positive than was expected at the time of the Chancellor\u2019s Autumn Statement in November gives him more room for manoeuvre in next week\u2019s Budget. The priority now is to use that flexibility to help put Britain on a sustainable growth path for the rest of the year and beyond.\u201d The UK economy has been \u201cmore resilient\u201d than expected, chancellor Jeremy Hunt says, after growing by a better-than-expected 0.3% in January. \u201cIn the face of severe global challenges, the UK economy has proved more resilient than many expected, but there is a long way to go. \u201cNext week, I will set out the next stage of our plan to halve inflation, reduce debt and grow the economy - so we can improve living standards for everyone.\u2019\u2019 The was increased demand for private healthcare in January, the GDP report shows, as NHS waiting lists grew longer. Human health and social work activities grew by 0.7% in January, following a fall of 2.8% in December 2022. January saw growth of 1.1% in human health activities driven by \u201cincreased output in the private sector\u201d, the ONS says. One in eight adults in the UK paid for private medical care in 2022, data last December showed, due to long delays for NHS tests or treatment. Analysts have warned that waiting lists are unlikely to fall in 2023. There was a bounceback in activity in postal activity in January, after Royal Mail staff held a series of strikes in December. Transport and storage services grew by 1.6% in January; the main contributor was an increase of 6.4% in postal and courier activities. \u201cThis growth comes after a fall of 10.5% in December 2022, which was partly because of the impact of postal strikes,\u201d the ONS says. Children returning to school after an illness-ravaged December helped the economy to grow in January. School attendance levels returned to normal levels following a significant drop in December 2022, the ONS says. That lifted activity in the education sector (as more children were being educated). The economy \u201cpartially bounced back from the large fall seen in December\u201d in January, says ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan. But, Morgan also points out that the UK economy has stagnated over the last year. Morgan explains: \u201cAcross the last three months as a whole and, indeed over the last 12 months, the economy has, though, showed zero growth. \u201cThe main drivers of January\u2019s growth were the return of children to classrooms, following unusually high absences in the run-up to Christmas, the Premier League clubs returned to a full schedule after the end of the World Cup and private health providers also had a strong month. \u201cPostal services also partially recovered from the effects of December\u2019s strikes.\u201d Monthly GDP was broadly flat in January 2023 compared with the same month last year, the ONS says. That means the UK economy has not managed to grow over the last 12 months. The UK\u2019s services sector drove growth in January, by expanding by 0.5% during the month. The main contributing sectors were education (2.5%), as school attendance returned to November 2022 levels, and arts entertainment and recreation following the resumption of Premier League football. But the UK\u2019s production sector shrank by 0.3% while construction output decreased by 1.7%. Here are the details: The services sector grew by 0.5% in January 2023, after falling by 0.8% in December 2022, with the largest contributions to growth in January 2023 coming from education, transport and storage, human health activities, and arts, entertainment and recreation activities, all of which have rebounded after falls in December 2022. Output in consumer-facing services grew by 0.3% in January 2023; this follows a fall of 1.2% in December 2022. Production output fell by 0.3% in January 2023, following growth of 0.3% in December 2022. The construction sector fell by 1.7% in January 2023 after being flat in December 2022. Despite growing in January, the UK economy is still 0.2% smaller than in February 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Looking at the broader picture, though, GDP was flat in the three months to January 2023. Newsflash: The UK economy has returned to growth. The Office for National Statistics reports that GDP grew by 0.3% during January, after shrinking by 0.5% in December. That\u2019s a faster recovery than expected after the economy stalled in the final quarter of 2022. Analysts had expected modest growth of just 0.1% (see opening post), as strike action and the cost of living crisis prevented a recovery in consumer and business activity. The latest GDP figure could give the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, a slight boost before next week\u2019s budget, when he will set out the government\u2019s tax and spending policies. Alvin Tan of RBC Capital Markets predicts the UK grew by 0.1% in January \u2013 but that might not stop the economy shrinking during the current quarter\u2026. January\u2019s UK dataflow has been somewhat mixed, but the details of the January PMIs, the services PMI in particular, painted a more positive picture than the headline readings suggested in our view. We look for January GDP (Friday) to grow at 0.1% m/m. Although such an outcome would still mean it is possible for Q1 GDP as a whole to fall, it equally means that any contraction will be small and likely temporary. Good morning We\u2019re about to discover if the UK economy has returned to growth after struggling at the end of last year. January\u2019s GDP report, due at 7am, will show if the economy expanded or not in the first month of 2023. It\u2019s the final healthcheck on the economy before next Wednesday\u2019s budget. Economists predict UK GDP may have crept up by 0.1% in January, after the economy stagnated in the final quarter of 2022. A month ago, we learned that in December alone, the economy shrank by 0.5% as strikes in the public sector, rail and postal services. There have been signs that the economy might be a little stronger than feared. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) forecast on Wednesday that the UK economy is on track to shrink less than expected this year and avoid the two quarters of negative growth which mark a technical recession. And last week, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist said Britain\u2019s economy is showing slightly more momentum than expected. As Huw Pill put it: \u201cSurvey indicators that have become available since the publication of the forecast have surprised to the upside, suggesting that the current momentum in economic activity may be slightly stronger than anticipated.\u201d Also coming up today A heavy selloff in US bank shares last night has sent jitters through the financial markets today. European stocks are expected to fall over 1% when trading begins: Last night\u2019s sell-off in JPMorgan Chase (-5.4%), Bank of America (-6.2%), Citigroup (-4%) and Wells Fargo (-6.2%) came after a small technology-focused lender called Silicon Valley Bank announcd a capital raise, which sent its stock collapsing by 60%. Reuters explains: SVB, which does business as Silicon Valley Bank, launched a $1.75 billion share sale on Wednesday to shore up its balance sheet. It said in an investor prospectus it needed the proceeds to plug a $1.8 billion hole caused by the sale of a $21 billion loss-making bond portfolio consisting mostly of U.S. Treasuries. The portfolio was yielding it an average 1.79% return, far below the current 10-year Treasury yield of around 3.9%. Investors in SVB\u2019s stock fretted over whether the capital raise would be sufficient given the deteriorating fortunes of many technology startups that the bank serves. The company\u2019s stock collapsed to its lowest level since 2016, and after the market closed shares slid another 26% in extended trade. Another California bank, Silvergate Capital Corp, had announced a voluntary liquidation this week, after mass withdrawal of deposits after collapse of FTX exchange. The latest US Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that around 205,000 new jobs were created in America last month, down from the unexpectedly strong 517,000 in January.

            "title": "Cutting its cloth: can a new industrial revolution transform Benin\u2019s economy?",
            "date": "2023-03-21T07:15:07Z",
            "content": "When Muriel Akouewanou finished her studies in natural sciences in Benin, she struggled to find work and was unemployed for two years. Then, she saw an advert on TV. Textile factories were being built in a new industrial zone, 28 miles from Cotonou, the city where Akouewanou, 24, lived with her parents, and they needed workers. \u201cTo be honest, it didn\u2019t appeal to me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was something I\u2019d never done, I\u2019d never worked with machines.\u201d Nevertheless, she applied, and was accepted on to the six-month training scheme. To her surprise she enjoyed the work. Now, her salary covers all her expenses and allows her to give some money to her parents. Her dream is to become a textile engineer in Benin\u2019s emergent industry. In the past few years, Benin has become Africa\u2019s leading cotton producer, with annual production of 728,000 tonnes in 2020-2021, according to government figures. Traditionally it has exported almost all of that raw, with most of it going to Bangladesh. An initiative between the Republic of Benin and Arise Integrated Industrial Platforms, a pan-African venture partly owned by the Africa Finance Corporation, is under way to create jobs and revenue. It aims to process the cotton, as well as other agricultural products, locally, with the goal of exporting finished goods, such as T-shirts and underwear, to Europe, Asia, Africa and the US. \u201cBenin is an agricultural centre, a country that produces a lot of agricultural commodities \u2013 cotton, shea, cashews, soya, pineapple. But most of these crops used to be sold raw without any transformation,\u201d says Letondji Beheton, managing director of the Glo-Djigb\u00e9 industrial zone (GDIZ), which houses the textile factories. \u201cIn 2016 the new president wanted to [transform the Benin economy]. Instead of selling commodities raw, we will process them in Benin.\u201d The initiative aims to create 300,000 jobs by 2030; up to 250,000 jobs are expected in spinning, cotton weaving and garment manufacturing. It expects to increase exports by $5bn to $10bn (\u00a34.15bn to \u00a38.3bn) within 10 years, GDP by $4bn to $7bn (\u00a33.3bn to \u00a35.8bn) by 2030, and Benin\u2019s manufacturing output fivefold. Beheton says 36 investors have already signed a contract with the zone. Regarding the growing textile industry, there is a contract to supply 50,000 T-shirts to US brand The Children\u2019s Place. There have been discussions with other brands including SanMar, H&amp;M and Zara. The impact of this initiative on the country could be huge, say trade experts. Benin is classified by the UN as one of 46 least developed countries in the world \u201cconfronting severe structural impediments to sustainable development\u201d; close to 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. \u201cThe textile industry has been, and is, in many countries the starting point for industrialisation,\u201d says Matthias Knappe, the programme manager for cotton, textiles and clothing at the International Trade Centre. The textile industry has been selected as a priority by the African Union, he says, because it\u2019s a sector where you can create a lot of jobs relatively easily. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good and timely initiative.\u201d Jodie Keane, a senior research fellow at the ODI thinktank, says the textile industry has \u201cbeen the quintessential foothold into the industrialisation process \u2026 this strategy was pursued by east Asian newly industrialised countries (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan) and it has lifted millions out of poverty\u201d. Knappe adds that Benin\u2019s position on the west coast of Africa could be a logistical advantage for buyers in the US, Europe and Africa, as products won\u2019t have to be shipped so far. And, African cotton has an environmental edge. \u201cIt\u2019s all rain fed so there\u2019s no irrigation, tapping into rivers, lakes and underground water like in some other major cotton producing countries. Also, pesticide and chemical use is much lower,\u201d says Knappe. There are challenges ahead, however. Research carried out by Cotton 2040, a cross-industry platform, estimates that, by 2040, about half of the world\u2019s cotton growing regions will face high or very high-risk exposure to at least one climate hazard, while some regions could be exposed to as many as seven. Knappe adds: \u201cThis is business, it\u2019s trial and error, it could go wrong anywhere.\u201d Another pandemic could bring disaster with cancelled orders, for example, or if there were a political crisis the country would risk losing trade preferences from the US. As consumers become more environmentally and socially conscious, brands are putting pressure on suppliers and manufacturers. The European Commission has formulated a textile strategy which has sustainability at its core and will put conditions on products entering the EU. Between 50 and 70% of power needed by the zone will be provided by renewable energy, says Beheton. A solar plant is being built over the next three years, and solar panels will be placed on the warehouse roofs. The remainder will come from a new power plant and gas pipeline later this year. The textile industry has been plagued by human rights abuses, from sexual assault in jeans factories in Lesotho to the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh in 2013, that killed more than 1,000 people. It occurred after workers\u2019 concerns about the safety of the building had been ignored. Natalie Swan, the labour rights programme manager at Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre, says that each time the industry shifts to an emerging market, there\u2019s \u201ca wild west in terms of a lack of unionisation, and a legal framework that gets exploited\u201d. A quick look online will show Benin as the next destination for garment manufacturers because of \u201ca plethora of advantages in terms of low-cost labour\u201d, she says. \u201cThis is how it\u2019s being marketed, this is part of the same exact story that we\u2019ve seen for the last 25 years, but a new frontier is the African continent.\u201d Beheton says workers are paid more than the minimum wage in Benin along with other benefits such as a free lunch and an onsite nursery. \u201cThere is nothing untoward happening here,\u201d he adds. Meanwhile, about 12 miles from Bohicon, a town about two hours\u2019 drive from Cotonou, is Houegnonkpa, a village where houses are made of mud, cooking is done on the ground over an open flame, and there is no running water or electricity. The community is dependent on growing cotton. Rapha\u00ebl Dovonon, 40, grew up helping his father in the cotton fields near his village, and now has his own land. With the money he made from farming the crop he has been able to build his own house. The most recent harvest was bad, he says. He has noticed changes in the weather in recent years. \u201cThings are not the same as in the past. Before, we knew when the rainy season would begin and end. Now it\u2019s different.\u201d He has heard about the factories close to Cotonou which may end up using the cotton he grows to make clothes. \u201cWe are very happy that our cotton will be used in Benin and that young Beninese will get employment,\u201d he says. For the time being, his fortunes won\u2019t change, however. The price of cotton is determined by a body representing farmers and the government. \u201cCotton farmers\u2019 lives will not automatically improve,\u201d says Knappe. For change to happen, \u201cit needs political will\u201d."

            "date": "2023-03-07T14:00:05Z",
            "content": "J\u00fcrgen Maier is bouncing as he opens the door of his home in south Manchester. After retiring as chief executive of Siemens UK three years ago, the industrialist has been hard at work in his office overlooking the garden of his detached Edwardian home. With Britain\u2019s economy close to recession, a cost of living crisis, global heating, a green transition, Brexit and deep regional divisions, there are plenty of problems he wants to fix. Having moved the Siemens UK headquarters to Manchester in one of his final acts before retiring, and become vice-chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, Maier is one of the leading voices pushing to level up the UK\u2019s lopsided regional economy. \u201cWe are in the deepest series of crises any of us in our professional careers have ever experienced,\u201d he says. \u201cYet, at the same time, we find ourselves with the worst possible relationship between business and government. It really is that bad.\u201d Rather than tax cuts or a bonfire of regulation in next week\u2019s budget, he says, Rishi Sunak\u2019s government ought to wake up and recognise that this isn\u2019t the way to run a 21st-century economy. Rather than a \u201c1980s playbook\u201d, it should be working for closer ties between business and government, better relations with unions, and a clear industrial strategy. He admits our conversation is \u201ca bit of a whingeing session\u201d, but there is a purpose to it. Since leaving Siemens after 33 years, Maier has started vocL, an app-based business mentoring and speaking platform. Siemens, John Lewis, Sainsbury\u2019s, Timpsons, Arup and Brompton Bikes are all on board, keen to foster the next generation of bosses willing to speak out on big political issues. \u201cWe think the future will be a different political landscape,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to predict the outcome of a general election, but whoever assembles a government will draw the conclusion that they need a better relationship with business. We want to equip the business leaders of the future with the tools, knowledge and, frankly, moral courage to engage in a positive political and private sector relationship.\u201d For years, he says, company chiefs have largely ducked the public sphere, preferring to stay silent on the big issues. Now Maier wants them to speak up. He uses Liz Truss\u2019s \u201cdreadful\u201d mini-budget to highlight the importance of doing so. \u201cNone of what was in that mini-budget was being called for by business. How did business stand by and allow it to happen? We need to be at the top table, helping create policies that are good for business and society.\u201d Maier is adept at practising what he preaches. He talks 19 to the dozen, is full of stories and, as a regular panellist on BBC Question Time, clearly isn\u2019t afraid of a robust debate \u2013 not least when it comes to Brexit, of which he is an outspoken critic. Business support for Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201cWindsor framework\u201d Northern Ireland deal is strong, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a return to a sensible conversation \u2026 and provides some confidence that we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d Despite this, Maier thinks a wider campaign to rejoin the EU is still years away: \u201cWe\u2019re miles from that, honestly. And I don\u2019t believe that is where business is at all.\u201d European ties are second nature for Maier, a proud Anglo-Austrian. His home is full of signs of his dual heritage: Austrian wine in the fridge, walls adorned with a painting of the W\u00f6rthersee (where he has a second home in the Alps), plus framed prints of Manchester landmarks. Born in 1964 in Germany to Austrian parents, he moved to Leeds aged 10 after his mother remarried an Englishman from County Durham. Starting school as a \u201cforeigner\u201d who couldn\u2019t speak English, and realising he was gay, made for a tough start. \u201cIt was awful, to be honest. I had to learn quickly.\u201d He remembers after-school fights between boys from his comprehensive \u2013 Allerton Grange in the suburb of Moortown \u2013 and a local rival, surreptitiously helped by a PE teacher who taught boxing. \u201cIt\u2019s now sort of the Didsbury of Leeds,\u201d he says of the area where his mother still lives, meaning it\u2019s fairly affluent. \u201cBut when I came to the UK it certainly wasn\u2019t.\u201d His degree in engineering at Trent Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent University) was sponsored by Siemens, and he did an industrial placement there before starting as graduate engineer in 1986 at its factory in Congleton, Cheshire. As Maier was growing up, northern England\u2019s industrial backbone was crumbling. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m so passionate about these things. I want to be part of the generation that improved that,\u201d he says. And there is a lot to be learned from Germany\u2019s approach: \u201cThe scale, the gravitas, the long-termism, the strategic intent. And the business partnership with government.\u201d When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, he and a friend jumped in his battered Ford Granada and drove from Congleton to witness the moment. \u201cI just wanted to see it,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be a part of history. And it was fascinating.\u201d Maier recalls that during die Wende (the turn), as the reunification period is known, Siemens loaned some top employees to the German government to help in piecing the country back together. The UK could learn lessons on close partnership between government and industry, but will it? \u201cThere\u2019s the odd minister, you know, with the right intent,\u201d he says. But the big danger is that without a consistent plan, regional divisions will remain, and Britain will fall behind as other countries steal a march in building the green economy of the future. Although he won\u2019t be drawn on how he votes, he says Labour clearly has a better relationship with business. His big ask is that any government develops and sticks to a proper industrial strategy: \u201cI don\u2019t care what you call it. Let\u2019s just have something sustainable. It\u2019s about confidence, long-termism and partnership.\u201d CV Age 59. Family Lives with his husband, Richard, and their dachshund, Max, in Didsbury, Manchester.

            "title": "If the British economy can\u2019t pay better wages, then it must shrink",
            "date": "2023-03-11T17:00:25Z",
            "content": "Some of Britain\u2019s biggest industries need to shrink and they need to start thinking about how to do it now. Hospitality is one. Manufacturing could be another. These sectors are among many to say they cannot find the workers they need at the price they have traditionally paid. With more than 1m advertised jobs unfilled, it has become a major problem holding back the economy. If the workers are needed, the obvious answer is to ditch the \u201ctradition\u201d and pay them more. And if significant pay rises are out of the question, employers could offer flexible working, more exciting career prospects and better pensions. Yet these demands are deemed unacceptable by the industries\u2019 bosses, who fear they will increase their overheads, push up prices more than they already have, and drive customers away. That raises the prospect of record vacancy rates for several years to come as companies soldier on, delaying projects and demanding overtime from existing staff, rather than sacrificing some of their profits to increase pay \u2013 and if that isn\u2019t possible, pack up the business. This year, thousands of firms will be driven to the wall, whether they want to get creative about filling job vacancies or not, because there is one arm of the state alive to the problem, and it is using the bluntest of instruments to make a difference. Policymakers at the Bank of England want the UK economy to \u201cshrink to fit\u201d and have consistently raised interest rates for more than a year now to achieve that aim. They may do it again when they next meet later this month. A majority of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, which sets UK interest rates, have argued that a labour market that has too few workers chasing too many jobs is a recipe for high inflation, and that won\u2019t do. As with all economic questions, there is more than one answer. In this instance, employers could be urged to increase the supply of labour by training workers, giving them the skills they need. But training has proved to be beyond most employers, and the government for that matter. The skills training budget has increased recently, but only back to where it was a decade ago when adjusted for inflation. The government\u2019s apprenticeship levy was, and is, a farce, and is little used. Employers, left to their own devices, are wary. They don\u2019t want to pay for training until the labour market is in balance again, because they fear whoever they train will just decamp to another employer that doesn\u2019t train workers and can therefore afford to pay higher wages. This is where a government could step in, shoving aside the Bank of England and its jobs destruction agenda. Ministers could impose stricter employment rules and then subsidise those industries they like, while leaving others at the mercy of the market. For instance, going back to the first example, hospitality could be left to fend for itself, while manufacturing businesses are handed extra subsidies. These subsidies would allow factory owners to retrain redundant hotel, bar and restaurant workers \u2013 not to work a lathe necessarily, but to join the admin, IT or marketing teams. Of course there is little to attract a hotel worker to the manufacturing sector when at the moment they probably have a laugh with customers, enjoy flexible working arrangements and have an easy path into management if they want it. The manufacturing sector is weighed down by rigid structures and union rules devised in the early 20th century. Professional institutes connected to manufacturing are much the same, which is why they cannot attract engineers. Jeremy Hunt may try to alleviate the burden on businesses in his budget speech this week with proposals to attract parents and older workers back into the labour market while also relaxing the quotas for foreign workers. It\u2019s a \u201cbit of everything\u201d plan that means the chancellor can avoid taking sides. But it\u2019s also a recipe for allowing zombie businesses \u2013 those that can just about make ends meet \u2013 to soldier on. And a recipe for making the taxpayer fund broad, unfocused subsidies that do little more than counter the extra costs of borrowing imposed by the Bank of England. If coffee shops can only stay in business by hiring foreign workers, who are willing to accept wages below what their UK counterparts need for a decent standard of living, then maybe we need to cope with fewer coffee shops. The same goes for hotels, gyms and other non-essential parts of the economy. The former chair of the Migration Advisory Committee, Alan Manning, has argued strongly that labour shortages \u201care almost always caused by poor pay and conditions\u201d. It\u2019s a message the chancellor should heed."

            "date": "2023-03-10T11:00:50Z",
            "content": "There are few issues besides keeping a clean alley that most Chicagoans agree on. Yet, last week, a majority of the city\u2019s voters ousted the incumbent mayor, Lori Lightfoot, in the city\u2019s mayoral primary. With just under 17% of the vote, Lightfoot became the first mayor to fail to advance to the runoff election since Jane Byrne lost the 1983 primary. But the recent election was not a stunning rebuke of Lightfoot, who commanded third place with a loyal base of mostly Black voters on the city\u2019s South and West Sides, but a demand for a radically different approach toward combating crime amid pandemic recovery, with one candidate focused on law and order and the other hoping to boost the social safety net. In one month, the general election could serve as a bellwether for how Democratic voters across the nation think about crime \u2013 a topic that became deeply politicized during an uptick in violence after the onset of Covid-19 and the widespread call for police reform after George Floyd\u2019s murder. Chicago is the third largest city in the US, and its nearly 3 million residents are deeply segregated and break down into almost equal thirds white, Black and Hispanic. What may appear on the surface to be a reliable Democratic stronghold actually encompasses a wide spectrum of moderate liberals, progressives and even some Trump supporters, the latter concentrated among cops, firefighters and other public workers living on the far Northwest Side. At a time when places like New York City and Washington DC are reassessing their approach to public safety issues and rebuilding their communities, Chicago\u2019s election in April could inform how some of the biggest cities move forward. *** When Lightfoot ascended to power in 2019, the political outsider made history as the first Black, openly gay mayor of Chicago and dominated all 50 of the city\u2019s wards with the optimistic message that she would \u201cbring in the light\u201d. But Lightfoot\u2019s campaign promises of transparency foundered once she took office, particularly when it came to public safety. After Chicago police wrongfully raided the home of a Black woman, Anjanette Young, in 2019 and forced her to stand naked until a female officer arrived, Lightfoot claimed she knew nothing about the incident until local news broke the story. Her own lawyers tried to prevent the local TV station from airing the video of the botched raid and Lightfoot herself later admitted that she was aware of the raid before the news broke. When five alderwomen introduced an ordinance in 2021 banning no-knock raids \u2013 building on the momentum of the Breonna Taylor case \u2013 Lightfoot opposed the bill and argued it could hamper the police\u2019s ability to respond quickly. At the same time, Lightfoot engaged in a legal battle with the city\u2019s cop union, the Fraternal Order of Police, over a vaccine mandate for public workers. Police expressed their frustration over burnout and multiple canceled days off by literally turning their backs on Lightfoot in 2021. In February\u2019s primary, Lightfoot attempted to thread the needle by marketing herself as a moderate candidate. But many voters bolted in one of two other directions: to the most progressive and conservative options. Paul Vallas and Brandon Johnson, the Cook county commissioner, going head-to-head on 4 April represent dueling philosophies of criminal justice. Vallas, the former CEO of Chicago public schools who came in ninth place in his last run for mayor in 2019, ripped a page from the Republican playbook with a law-and-order message. On election night, he placed crime at the forefront of his campaign, declaring public safety a \u201ccivil right\u201d. He also received an endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police, along with its Trump-supporting president, John Catanzara, and has pledged to fill Chicago\u2019s 1,700 police vacancies. Johnson\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a former teacher and Chicago Teachers Union deputy political director puts him at immediate odds with Vallas, whom critics say set the stage for the closure of 50 Chicago public schools predominantly in Black and Brown neighborhoods under former mayor Rahm Emanuel. Johnson\u2019s progressive approach toward criminal justice would include a mental health hotline and eliminating no-knock warrants. He also committed to ending the city\u2019s contract with ShotSpotter, which the city\u2019s own inspector general found \u201crarely leads to evidence of a gun-related crime\u201d. In a televised debate, both Lightfoot and Vallas supported keeping the acoustic gunshot detection tool used by police. Johnson and Vallas agree on some policy issues including changing the Chicago police department\u2019s patrol plan to allocate more police officers during high crime hours. Both have vouched for boosting the number of detectives so that CPD can solve more murders, though Johnson has dodged the question of whether he would reduce CPD\u2019s nearly $2bn budget. But on most issues they represent very different directions for the city. \u201cWhat we have in this runoff is the tale of two cities in Chicago,\u201d said Constance Mixon, a political science professor and director of the urban studies program at Elmhurst University. \u201cIt is a tale of progressives and Brandon Johnson, but it\u2019s also a tale of more conservative voters, particularly in white ethnic neighborhoods on the far north-west and south-west sides of the city \u2026 Paul Vallas\u2019s message of crime resonated with them.\u201d *** Like other cities across the US, violent crime escalated during the pandemic in Chicago. While homicides had been on a steady decline since 2016, they shot up from 500 in 2019 to 776 in 2020. Homicides dropped in 2022, but still rival the rate Chicago saw in the 1990s. \u201cThings like theft and burglary have been trending down for the last two or three decades and the last couple of years is no different. Even overall violence hasn\u2019t increased that much,\u201d said David Olson, a criminal justice professor and co-director of Loyola University\u2019s Center for Criminal Justice Research. \u201cThe challenge politically are the crimes that have increased are the ones that are the most serious and the most visible in terms of coverage by the media and attention by people. And rightfully so, given the fact that homicide is the most serious offense.\u201d For years, crime had disproportionately affected Black and Brown communities on the South and West Sides of the city. But since the pandemic started it has increased in those areas, as well as predominantly white and wealthy neighborhoods \u2013 spurring fresh outrage and new attention to the issue. Carjackings in Lincoln Square, robberies on the Gold Coast, and kidnappings in Wrigleyville have rattled residents and dominated local headlines. \u201cWealthier, whiter parts of the city have been safer for many, many years and the violence has persisted on the South and West sides in plain sight without the kind of attention and response that the issue is getting now,\u201d said Roseanna Ander, founding executive director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab and the University of Chicago Education Lab. Leaders should recognize that public safety strategies should look at persistent problems throughout the entire city, rather than making one part of Chicago safer at the expense of other parts of the city, Ander added. While the post-pandemic rise in crime has frustrated white Chicagoans, Black Chicagoans who have long dealt with the city\u2019s crime problems have left in droves over the past decade. Recent census data showed Chicago\u2019s Black population has dropped by nearly 10% since 2010. Political strategist Delmarie Cobb attributes that exodus to two factors: crime and schools. \u201cThose two issues are front and center for Black people, whereas white people may just be experiencing crime for the first time, but they\u2019re OK with the schools,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cWith the tough-on-crime candidates, they\u2019re often who get all the attention and support because those people who are experiencing crime for the first time at this level, they want somebody who can do it quickly.\u201d How the two mayoral candidates communicate their message on crime to Black voters will prove crucial. In the primary, Johnson garnered support from white progressives on the North Side but in order to beat Vallas, he\u2019ll have to court Hispanics on the West Side who voted for his progressive rival, Congressman Jes\u00fas G \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda, and Black voters who backed Lightfoot on the South Side. Vallas is already trying to shore up support from Black politicians, racking up key endorsements from the former Illinois secretary of state Jesse White and Lightfoot\u2019s ally Alderman Walter Burnett. Toni Preckwinkle, Lightfoot\u2019s rival in the 2019 election, and US congressman Danny Davis, who represents much of the South and West Sides, endorsed Johnson. Johnson may have trouble taking the middle road in the general election. Though his policies on criminal justice reform fired up a progressive base in the primary, Johnson has tried to distance himself from past comments on defunding the police. When it comes to filling police vacancies, Johnson told Block Club Chicago that hiring more officers wouldn\u2019t solve the city\u2019s crime problem, instead saying that funding could be reallocated by shifting officers\u2019 roles and hiring additional emergency service responders. During one primary debate, Lightfoot questioned how Johnson would boost the number of detectives without increasing the police budget. \u201cHe says he wants to promote detectives,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cWhen you promote detectives then you\u2019ve got to backfill the patrol officers and if he\u2019s not willing to commit to not defunding the police, he\u2019s gonna have less officers on the street and our communities are gonna be less safe.\u201d It is possible that Johnson could reallocate funding rather than increasing CPD\u2019s budget, counters Craig Futterman, a clinical professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School and director of the school\u2019s Civil Rights and Police Accountability Project. \u201cWithin a fixed budget, you can put less of your officers in the kind of stop-and-frisk mode, street policing mode and more in investigating mode,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily going to cost you more money.\u201d For Vallas, the endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police will either become his winning advantage or his achilles heel. The group welcomed Florida\u2019s conservative governor Ron DeSantis for a speech in February while its president, Catanzara, has landed in the news for defending January 6 rioters and comparing Lightfoot\u2019s vaccine mandate to the Nazi Germany. More than the endorsements, however, voters may choose based on their visceral feelings about what\u2019s needed to reduce crime, Olson said. \u201cFor a lot of people, their gut feeling is, well, if we just had more police, that would address the problem, and it\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if one candidate presents this blunt: \u2018We just need more police\u2019, that may swing some folks. If another approaches with: \u2018We\u2019ve got to address the root causes, this is a long-term problem that needs a long-term solution\u2019, that might resonate because they see that as perhaps being a more realistic understanding.\u201d"

            "content": "Twenty years ago, Lt Col Karen Kwiatkowski was working as a desk officer in the Pentagon, when she became aware of a secretive new department called the Office of Special Plans. The OSP had been set up to produce the kind of intelligence that the Bush administration wanted to hear, about Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. Kwiatkowski, then age 42, saw first-hand how the disastrous war was confected. \u201cI had this huge faith in my superiors, that they must be there for a reason, they must be wise and strong and all of these fairytale type things, but I came to find out there are very incompetent people in very high positions,\u201d she said. Kwiatkowski, who became a Pentagon whistleblower over the war, is now a farmer, part-time college professor, and occasional political candidate on the libertarian end of the Republican party in Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah Valley. She says she was somewhat cynical about war and politics even before she was seconded to the Pentagon\u2019s Near East and South Asia department in 2002. But seeing America\u2019s governance subverted up close dramatically deepened her disillusion. \u201cThere\u2019s a crisis of faith in this country,\u201d Kwiatkowski said. \u201cAs always, when you have these crises of faith you see populist leaders, and the emergence of Trump certainly was a response to a crisis in faith. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens next, because Americans have a lot less to be proud of than we think.\u201d On the whole, she believes the experience of the Iraq war has imbued Americans with a healthy scepticism about what they are being told by the establishment \u2013 but not nearly enough. \u201cI could go into the Walmart right now and ask everybody about WMD in Iraq and probably three out ten people, maybe more, will swear that it\u2019s all true,\u201d she said. \u201cOur public propaganda in this country is supremely good.\u201d Polling figures over the past two decades suggest that overall attitudes towards foreign policy are fairly stable. When the Chicago Council on Global Affairs asked Americans whether \u201cit will be best for the future of the country if we take an active part in world affairs or if we stay out of world affairs\u201d, 71% supported activism in 2002 and 64% still supported it in 2021. More generally, the Iraq invasion coincided with a collapse in public trust in government which had very briefly recovered from its post-Vietnam slump after the 9/11 attacks. Data from surveys by the Pew Research Centre, show the post-Iraq malaise is deeper and more enduring. \u201cIt said first and foremost to young people that the government can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d John Zogby, another US pollster, said. \u201cIt also said that the American military may be the strongest in the world but it has serious limits, and it can\u2019t impose its will, even on smaller countries.\u201d He added: \u201cAmericans will go to war, but they want their wars to be short, and they want them to make a positive difference.\u201d There are still US soldiers on counter-terrorist missions in Iraq and Syria. The Authorisation to Use Military Force that Congress first granted to the Bush administration in the run-up to the 2003 invasion has yet to be repealed by the Senate, and has been cited by the Obama and Trump administrations in justifying operations in the region. Coleen Rowley, an FBI whistleblower who exposed security lapses leading to the 9/11 attacks, wrote an open letter to the FBI director in March 2003, warning of a \u201cflood of terrorism\u201d resulting from the Iraq invasion. She says now that two decades on, nobody has been held accountable for the fatal mistakes. \u201cI think the real danger is that their propaganda was very successful, and people like Bush and Cheney have now been rehabilitated,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cEven the liberals have embraced Bush and Cheney.\u201d The terrible mistakes made leading to and during the Iraq war forced no resignations and neither George W Bush nor his vice-president, Dick Cheney \u2013 nor any other senior official who made the case the war and then oversaw a disastrous occupation \u2013 have ever been held to account by any form of commission or tribunal. However, the taint of Iraq arguably altered the course of US politics by hobbling those who supported it. \u201cIn some ways you can argue Iraq is what led to Obama being president as opposed to Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Daniel Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher school of law and diplomacy at Tufts University. \u201cI don\u2019t think Obama wins the 2008 Democratic primary if Hillary hadn\u2019t supported the war.\u201d The war also opened a schism in the Republican party, strengthening an anti-intervention faction that eventually triumphed with the 2016 election of Donald Trump. George W Bush and his former vice-president have drawn some positive liberal press for their low-key opposition to some of the excesses of the Trump era, but Kenneth Pollack, a Middle East and military expert at the American Enterprise Institute, they paid a political price by becoming marginalised within their own party. \u201cThe system has punished those people. If you were a Bushie, if you were a neocon, you\u2019re no longer welcome to the party,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cI would say there has been a lot of accountability, but it\u2019s been accountability in a traditionally American way.\u201d Those excluded included traditional conservatives with less extreme domestic social positions than Maga Republicans. The drive to war was fueled by partisanship \u2013 the Bush administration was contemptuous of Democrats and all opposition \u2013 but it also served as an accelerant to the extremism that led to Trump and the 6 January insurrection. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to say how much Iraq was responsible for that, but it does seem to me that it was an important element in making our partisanship worse,\u201d Pollack said. Pollack is a former CIA analyst and a Democrat who backed the invasion, believing the evidence on Saddam Hussein\u2019s WMD and supporting the humanitarian argument for ousting a dictator. Pollack jokes that he is the only person to have since apologised. It is not entirely true as a few other pundits, like the conservative commentator, Max Boot, have also been contrite, but there have been no public expressions of remorse from former senior officials who took the fateful decisions. It is one of the important ways in which the US has still not had a proper reckoning for the war. Pollack, who has stayed in touch with several of the Bush team for a forthcoming book on the US and Iraq, said that some express private regret for specific decisions and choices, but others remain unrepentant. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it said to my face that: \u2018Nope, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. I\u2019d do everything all over again the exact same way\u2019, which I find shocking,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you look at American behaviour during this period and not have regrets.\u201d"

            "title": "I once admired Russell Brand. But his grim trajectory shows us where politics is heading | George Monbiot",
            "date": "2023-03-10T07:00:44Z",
            "content": "In 2014, the Guardian asked me to nominate my hero of the year. To some people\u2019s surprise, I chose Russell Brand. I loved the way he energised young people who had been alienated from politics. I claimed, perhaps hyperbolically, he was \u201cthe best thing that has happened to the left in years\u201d (in my defence, there wasn\u2019t, at the time, much competition). Today, I can scarcely believe it\u2019s the same man. I\u2019ve watched 50 of his recent videos, with growing incredulity. He appears to have switched from challenging injustice to conjuring phantoms. If, as I suspect it might, politics takes a very dark turn in the next few years, it will be partly as a result of people like Brand. It\u2019s hard to decide which is most dispiriting: the stupidity of some of the theories he recites, or the lack of originality. He repeatedly says he\u2019s not a conspiracy theorist, but, to me, he certainly sounds like one. In 2014, he was bursting with new ideas and creative ways of presenting them. Today, he wastes his talent on tired and discredited tales: endless iterations of the alleged evils of the World Economic Forum founder, Klaus Schwab, the Great Reset, Bill Gates, Nancy Pelosi, the former US chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, Covid vaccines, medical data, the World Health Organization, Pfizer, smart cities and \u201cthe globalist masterplan\u201d. His videos appear to promote \u201cnatural immunity\u201d ahead of vaccines, and for a while pushed ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as treatments for Covid (they aren\u2019t). He championed the \u201cFreedom Convoy\u201d that occupied Ottawa, which apparently stood proudly against the \u201ctyranny\u201d of Justin Trudeau\u2019s policies. He hawks Graham Hancock\u2019s widely debunked claims about ancient monuments. A wildly popular clip from one of his videos about the Dutch nitrate crisis offers a classic conspiracy theory mashup: a tangle of claims that may be true in other contexts, random accusations, scapegoating and resonances with some old and very ugly tropes. He claims that \u201cthis whole fertiliser situation is a scam\u201d. The real objective is \u201cto bankrupt the farmers so their land can be grabbed\u201d. This \u201cshows you how the Great Reset operates\u201d, using \u201cglobalist\u201d regulations to throw farmers off their land. He claims it\u2019s \u201cconnected to the land grab of Bill Gates\u201d and the \u201ccorruption of companies like Monsanto\u201d. In reality, the Dutch government was forced to act by a legal ruling, as levels of nitrate pollution, largely from livestock farms, break European law. Its attempts to curb this pollution have nothing to do with the World Economic Forum and its vacuous rhetoric about a \u201cGreat Reset\u201d. Or with Bill Gates. Or with Monsanto, which hasn\u2019t existed since 2018 when it was bought by Bayer. So why mention them? Perhaps because these terms have become potent click triggers. Brand is repeating claims first made by far-right conspiracists, who have piled into this issue, claiming that the nitrate crisis is a pretext to seize land from farmers, in whom, they claim, true Dutch identity is vested, and hand it to asylum seekers and other immigrants. It\u2019s a version of the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory, itself a reworking of the Nazis\u2019 blood and soil tropes about protecting the \u201crooted\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d people \u2013 in whom \u201cracial purity\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d German identity was vested \u2013 from \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d and \u201calien\u201d forces (ie Jews). Brand may not realise this, as the language has changed a little \u2013 \u201ccosmopolitans\u201d have become \u201cglobalists\u201d, \u201caliens\u201d have become \u201cimmigrants\u201d \u2013 but the themes have not. On and drearily on he goes. He manages to confuse the World Health Organization\u2019s call for better pandemic surveillance (by which it means the tracking of infectious diseases) with coercive surveillance of the population, creating \u201ccentralised systems of control where you are ultimately a serf\u201d. Some of his many rants about Bill Gates are illustrated with an image of the man wearing a multicoloured lapel badge, helpfully circled in red. This speaks to another widespread conspiracy theory: those who wear this badge are members of a secret organisation conspiring to control the world (so secret they stick it on their jackets). In reality, it shows support for the UN sustainable development goals. Such claims are not just wrong. They are wearyingly, boringly wrong. But, to judge by the figures (he has more than 6 million subscribers on YouTube), the audience loves them. Some of his theories, such as his recent obsession with UFOs, are innocuous enough. Others have potential to do great harm. There\u2019s the risk to the people scapegoated, such as Fauci, Schwab and Pelosi: subjects of conspiracy theories often become targets of violence. There are the risks misleading claims present to public health. And bizarre stories about shadowy \u201celites\u201d protect real elites from scrutiny and challenge. While I\u2019m not suggesting this is his purpose, it\u2019s a tactic used deliberately by powerful people to disarm those who might otherwise hold them to account. Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, had a term for it: \u201cflood the zone with shit\u201d. As Naomi Klein has shown, the Great Reset conspiracy theory was conceived by a staffer at the Heartland Institute, a US lobby group that has promoted climate denial and other billionaire-friendly positions. It\u2019s a bastardisation of her shock doctrine hypothesis, distracting people from the malfeasance of those with real power. Worse still, conspiracism is fascism\u2019s fuel. Almost all successful conspiracy theories originate with or land with the far right. I\u2019m not suggesting for one minute that Brand is sympathetic to fascism, but his videos are likely to assist its spread. As for his own politics, while he claims to have transcended left and right, I see a clear rightward shift. He concentrates his fire on centrists \u2013 Biden, Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, Trudeau \u2013 while appearing to support Trump. He extols Trump\u2019s \u201cvirility\u201d, which he contrasts with \u201cBiden\u2019s senility\u201d. So what\u2019s going on? Brand has yet to reply to questions I emailed him last week, so I can only guess. I have seen other people drift into absurdity by telling their followers what they want to hear, and I wonder whether it\u2019s happening here. At one point, he tells his audience: \u201cWe are amplifying the voice that you give us. We are feeding back to you the truth that you have long understood.\u201d Of Ron DeSantis, the extreme rightwing Florida governor, he says to his viewers: \u201cI know a lot of you guys like him\u201d, which might explain his weirdly equivocal reporting of DeSantis\u2019s vicious state censorship, which is everything he claims to oppose. Until recently, I thought younger people, demanding a fairer, kinder world, would transform our politics. Now I\u2019m not so sure. I believe Brand and others are helping to confuse and distract them in their millions, shutting down meaningful engagement. He has, in this respect, become the opposite of what he was.

            "date": "2023-03-14T17:45:24Z",
            "content": "I never shared George Monbiot\u2019s admiration for Russell Brand and so I\u2019m not quite so bitterly disappointed that the comedian seems to have disappeared down a conspiracist rabbit hole (I once admired Russell Brand. But his grim trajectory shows us where politics is heading, 10 March). I would also be reluctant to cite him as a reason to despair about the politics of \u201cyounger people\u201d. For a start, Brand is not that young \u2013 at 47, he is five years older than the prime minister. Is he really such an influence on the genuinely young? He gets a lot of views on YouTube, but the values of the young, especially in relation to climate change, are closer to Monbiot\u2019s than Brand\u2019s. What I find interesting is that Brand\u2019s conspirators are just the usual suspects \u2013 Nancy Pelosi, Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum etc. Monbiot finds this lack of originality \u201cdispiriting\u201d. I find it curiously encouraging. If the conspiracists can\u2019t come up with any new material, they will find their audience tiring of the same old tunes and the same old puppetmasters. Jonathan Allum Amersham, Buckinghamshire \u2022 I could not agree more with George Monbiot on Russell Brand\u2019s rants. He has moved, apparently unaware of it, from left to middle (his spiritual phase), to flat-out right. I think a lot of people forget to unsubscribe from his channel, and I suggest all those who stopped watching Brand a while ago (I stopped during that spiritual phase) should unsubscribe. Brand interviewed Jordan Peterson not long ago, and it felt like love. Both expressed that wounded male pride that underpins the exploitation of feelings of sexual inadequacy in (older, white) men by the far right. And it works. See the US philosopher Jason Stanley\u2019s book, How Fascism Works. Dr Helen Hintjens Swansea \u2022 I wonder if the bleak arc followed by Russell Brand and his fellow populist online conspiracy theorists is quite so new? The idea of transcending left and right became popular in the 1990s with Bill Clinton\u2019s and Tony Blair\u2019s \u201cthird way\u201d, a social democratic theory of mild redistribution and liberalisation that would overcome the staid old dichotomy between the state and the market. In 1994, Blair\u2019s academic guru, Prof Anthony Giddens, published Beyond Left and Right: The Future of Radical Politics \u2013 an imaginative guidebook to the new way of doing things. I remember the hype: as an impressionable student at LSE, I attended Giddens\u2019s lectures. The bright morning sunshine of 1 May 1997 was an intoxicating tonic. It was as if these former leftists were implying that there was no longer any need for broad debate. \u201cTrust us,\u201d they were saying. \u201cWe\u2019ve found the answers, and the old divisions are no longer relevant.\u201d But we couldn\u2019t trust them, and they were wrong. Claiming to move beyond established dialectics imperils democracy. Conflict between left and right endures. It seems presumptuous to declare its demise. Dr Daniel Gay St Jorioz, Haute-Savoie, France \u2022 Like George Monbiot, I have been disappointed to follow the career of Russell Brand over the last decade. It\u2019s sad to see what was a rare positive and inspiring voice in the darkness descend into a murky, click-rate-driven negative feedback loop, where \u201cfree thinking\u201d meets Andrew-Tate-style \u201cred pilling\u201d. It\u2019s a far cry from the message of tolerance and unity in search of fairness that we used to hear from his corner.

            "date": "2023-03-30T05:51:15Z",
            "content": "The US, UK, Japan and Australia have condemned the Myanmar military junta\u2019s decision to dissolve the party of imprisoned former leader Aung San Suu Kyi, with Washington warning that the regime\u2019s push for elections will lead to increased instability. State department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters that the US strongly condemned the announcement by the Myanmar military abolishing 40 political parties, including Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD). \u201cAny election without the participation of all stakeholders in Burma would not be and cannot be considered free or fair,\u201d Patel said, using the former name for Myanmar. Military-controlled media announced on Tuesday that the NLD and dozens of other political parties had been dissolved after they refused to comply with a tough new registration law. The military, which seized power in a coup in February 2021, imposed the law and began compiling voter lists in preparation for promised elections. Analysts say any vote held under the regime would be widely considered invalid. The NLD, the country\u2019s most popular party, won elections by a landslide in 2020, though the military refused to accept the results. The junta seized power in February 2021, detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and others, and alleging electoral fraud \u2013 a claim rejected by independent observers. Aung San Suu Kyi has since been sentenced to a total of 33 years in prison. The military has deployed brutal violence to try to suppress determined opposition from the public, and much of the country is engulfed in conflict as an armed resistance seeks to overthrow the generals. Military airstrikes are now an almost daily occurrence and more than 1.38 million people have been displaced by fighting since the coup, according to the UN. Japan\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement that it was \u201cseriously concerned that the exclusion of the NLD from the political process will make it even more difficult to improve the situation\u201d. \u201cJapan strongly urges Myanmar to immediately release NLD officials, including Suu Kyi, and to show a path toward a peaceful resolution of the issue in a manner that includes all parties concerned.\u201d The UK also condemned the dissolution of the NLD and other parties, calling it an \u201cassault on the rights and freedoms\u201d of the Myanmar people. \u201cWe condemn the military regime\u2019s politically motivated actions and their use of increasingly brutal tactics to sow fear and repress opposition,\u201d a UK Foreign Office spokesperson said. The Australian government said it was concerned about the \u201cfurther narrowing of political space in Myanmar\u201d resulting from the imposition of the new political party registration law. \u201cThe people of Myanmar continue to show their courage and commitment to a democratic country in the face of increasing repression and violence by the regime,\u201d it added. The registration law imposed by the junta set various tough requirements for national parties. They included recruiting 100,000 members within 90 days of registration \u2013 far more than the previous requirement of 1,000 members. Parties must also open offices in at least half of all 330 townships within 180 days, contest at least half of all constituencies and hold funds of 100m kyat (\u00a340,000). The NLD said it did not intend to register, calling the election bodies controlled by the military \u201cillegitimate\u201d."

            "content": "Good morning. Donald Trump has become the first former US president to face criminal charges after a grand jury voted to indict him in New York over a hush-money payment made to the adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. The news is likely to shake the race for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, in which Trump leads most polls. \u201cThis evening we contacted Mr Trump\u2019s attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan DA\u2019s office for arraignment on a supreme court indictment, which remains under seal,\u201d the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s spokesperson said. \u201cGuidance will be provided when the arraignment date is selected. Trump was expected to appear in court for his arraignment on Tuesday, said Susan Necheles, a lawyer for Trump. At that point he would enter a plea on the charges. New York police have been told to all report for duty on Friday and be prepared to deal with \u201cunusual disorder\u201d, according to a memo seen by NBC. What has the former president said? Trump, who is running again for president, reacted angrily in a lengthy statement that denounced the grand jury vote as \u201cpolitical persecution and election interference at the highest level in history\u201d. How have Republicans reacted? Republican politicians were swift to condemn the news. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, called the indictment \u201cun-American\u201d and assailed Bragg as a \u201cSoros-backed\u201d Manhattan prosecutor who was \u201cstretching the law to target a political opponent\u201d. News networks that lean towards the Republicans were also vocal in their criticism of the indictment last night. Why did a grand jury vote to indict Trump and what does it mean for him? The sealed felony indictment is likely to be unsealed in the next few days. At this point the specific charges were not immediately made public. \u2018Vulkan files\u2019 leak reveals Putin\u2019s global and domestic cyberwarfare tactics The inconspicuous office is in Moscow\u2019s north-eastern suburbs. A sign reads: \u201cBusiness centre.\u201d Nearby are modern residential blocks and a rambling old cemetery, home to ivy-covered war memorials. The area is where Peter the Great once trained his mighty army. Inside the six-story building, a new generation is helping Russian military operations. Its weapons are more advanced than those of Peter the Great\u2019s era: not pikes and halberds, but hacking and disinformation tools, writes Luke Harding. The software engineers behind these systems are employees of NTC Vulkan. On the surface, it looks like a run-of-the-mill cybersecurity consultancy. However, a leak of secret files from the company has exposed its work bolstering Vladimir Putin\u2019s cyberwarfare capabilities. Thousands of pages of secret documents reveal how Vulkan\u2019s engineers have worked for Russian military and intelligence agencies to support hacking operations, train operatives before attacks on national infrastructure, spread disinformation and control sections of the internet. What do the cyberwarfare leaks show? The documents depict a new world of collaboration between the Russian military and its secret police. And they show how much more aggressive Putin\u2019s siloviki, or security forces, have become since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gwyneth Paltrow found not at fault in Utah ski-crash trial Gwyneth Paltrow, the Hollywood star and lifestyle guru, has prevailed in the dramatic court tussle over contrasting ski-crash claims with the retired optometrist Terry Sanderson, who had sued the actor for liability in a collision on a Utah mountain in 2016. The verdict in the widely watched case, which to many seemed to pit one affluent lifestyle against another, came after a two-week trial that heard from dozens of witnesses attempting to assert truth to an incident that only one witness claimed to see. The jury returned after just two hours and 20 minutes, finding Sanderson at fault for the crash and for Paltrow\u2019s harm. The jury found Sanderson 100% at fault in terms of comparative negligence and awarded the actor damages of $1, as she requested. Her legal costs will be decided at a later date. As Paltrow left the court, she told Sanderson: \u201cI wish you well.\u201d What was the case about? Sanderson, 76, had initially brought a claim for $3m against Paltrow but that was knocked down to $300,000 before the trial began. He alleged her recklessness caused the crash on the slopes and left him with four broken ribs and post-concussion syndrome symptoms including confusion, memory loss and irritability. Paltrow countersued, claiming Sanderson hit her and that she was being exploited for her wealth and celebrity. In other news \u2026 Russia is poised to take charge of the UN security council as the monthly rotation of presidency of the 15-member council has been unaffected by the Ukraine war. \u201cAs of 1 April, they\u2019re taking the level of absurdity to a new level,\u201d said Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukrainian permanent representative. Members of Congress clashed angrily on gun law in Washington yesterday, while hundreds of Nashville protesters urged lawmakers to \u201cSave our children!\u201d The row erupted when the Democrat Jamaal Bowman called Republicans \u201cgutless\u201d, which was overheard by Thomas Massie, a far-right Republican from Kentucky. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has condemned Russia\u2019s arrest of the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, as Moscow was accused of engaging in \u201chostage taking\u201d by arresting a high-profile journalist who could be used as leverage in a potential prisoner swap. The executive director of a US police union has been charged with attempting to illegally import a fentanyl analogue. Joanne Segovia is accused of using the union\u2019s office to communicate with her suppliers and mail the drugs. She was immediately placed on leave, the San Jose police union said. Don\u2019t miss this: should we ban the purchase of cigarettes for life? A US town is trying Two years ago, Brookline in Massachusetts passed an ordinance banning anyone born after 1 January 2000 from buying cigarettes in their town, writes Simar Bajaj. The idea was to curb youth smoking rates without taking anything away from people already addicted, essentially grandfathering out tobacco. Every year, there would be a smaller slice of the population that could buy cigarettes, until one day no one would be left. At least, that was the vision. In tobacco\u2019s heyday in the mid-20th century, 45% of US adults smoked. Fast-forward to 2020, after decades of aggressive anti-smoking campaigns, and the rate was down to 12.5%. Cigarettes still kill roughly half a million people in the US every year. While the tobacco endgame \u2013 smoking rates below 5% \u2013 seems ultimately inevitable, getting the timeline right is the $1.85tn question. Should cigarettes die on their own, or at the hands of the state? \u2026 or this: how brands such as Nike, BlackBerry and Pop-Tarts became film\u2019s hottest stars A slew of movies coming out this year celebrate the boardroom mavericks of the 1980s and 90s. In Air, Ben Affleck directs himself and Matt Damon in the 1984 origin story of the Nike Air Jordan. With Tetris, the scene is four years later; meanwhile Flamin\u2019 Hot is a biopic of Richard Monta\u00f1ez, the janitor at snack giant Frito-Lay, who, in 1990, is said to have invented the title\u2019s totemic flavour of Cheetos. Pending, too, is BlackBerry, portraying the Icarus of Canadian smartphones. What\u2019s behind this corporate nostalgia? From Gen X execs to teenage fans of Stranger Things, the stretch of time from the mid-80s to 90s \u2013 Rubik\u2019s Cube to early internet \u2013 has become the site of a consensus nostalgia: a past we can all agree on. And beyond the big hair and Bon Jovi, the touchstones of the age are the brands, the stuff people bought. Last Thing: Tokitae, the oldest orca in captivity, has path to freedom after 50 years More than five decades after being captured in the waters off the Pacific north-west, Tokitae the orca has a plan to return home, delivering a victory to animal rights advocates and Indigenous leaders who have long fought for her release. The owners of the Miami Seaquarium announced yesterday a formal and binding agreement with a group called the Friends of Lolita to begin the process of returning Tokitae to Puget Sound. Tokitae is the oldest killer whale in captivity. Now in retirement, she lived in the smallest orca enclosure in North America, in a pool of water that made her skin infected and was fed fish that were occasionally rotten and led to intestinal issues. A \u201cgenerous contribution\u201d from Jim Irsay, the owner of the NFL\u2019s Indianapolis Colts, helped alleviate the financial questions around the animal\u2019s future.

Grant became president in 1869, four years after leading the Union armies to victory over the Confederacy in the civil war, the conflict which ended slavery in the US. The policeman who arrested Grant was a Black civil war veteran, William H West. In 1908, West told his tale to the Washington Evening Star. From his days as a cadet at the United States Military Academy, Grant was known as an excellent horseman. Even as president, the Star said, he \u201cloved nothing better than to sit behind a pair of spirited animals. He was a good driver, and sometimes \u2018let them out\u2019 to try their mettle.\u201d When he was stopped by West, the Star said, Grant \u201cwas driving a pair of fast steppers and he had some difficulty in halting them, but this he managed to do\u201d. The president asked: \u201cWell, officer. What do you want with me?\u201d West said: \u201cI want to inform you, Mr President, that you are violating the law by speeding along this street. Your fast driving, sir, has set the example for a lot of other gentlemen.\u201d Grant said sorry and left. The next day, however, he did it again. According to the Star, Grant smiled like \u201ca schoolboy who had been caught in a guilty act by a teacher\u201d and said he had not been aware he was traveling too fast. West said: \u201cI am very sorry, Mr President, to have to do it, for you are the chief of the nation, and I am nothing but a policeman, but duty is duty, sir, and I will have to place you under arrest.\u201d Grant was taken to a police station and ordered to pay $20. A trial was held the next day, with numerous cases against speeding drivers \u201ccontested bitterly\u201d. A judge issued heavy fines and a \u201cscathing rebuke\u201d. Grant, however, did not show up. The Post noted it was not possible to check the story. But it also pointed to comments from 2012 in which Cathy Lanier, then DC police chief, called Grant a joy rider. \u201cHe actually was racing his buggy on M street,\u201d Lanier said. \u201c\u2026 We seized his horse and buggy.\u201d Lanier also said DC police \u201cactually stopped and cited Ulysses S Grant three times for speeding\u201d but \u201cended up letting him pay a fine and walk back to the White House\u201d."

            "title": "China warns of retaliation if Taiwan\u2019s president meets US House speaker during visit",
            "date": "2023-03-29T04:13:02Z",
            "content": "The Chinese government has threatened retaliation if Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, meets the US House speaker this week, and urged the US not to let her transit through the country, saying it would be a \u201cprovocation\u201d. Tsai left Taiwan on Wednesday afternoon for a 10-day trip to visit Central American allies, Belize and Guatemala. The trip includes two stopovers, in New York on the way in, and Los Angeles on the way out. Tsai is expected to meet with the speaker, Kevin McCarthy in California, but there hasn\u2019t been official confirmation. Just hours before Tsai was due to leave Taipei, China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office issued a warning against the trip. \u201cIf she contacts US House speaker McCarthy, it will be another provocation that seriously violates the one-China principle, harms China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and destroys peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Zhu Fenglian, the office\u2019s spokesperson told a news conference. \u201cWe firmly oppose this and will definitely take measures to resolutely fight back.\u201d The one-China principle is a domestic Chinese edict which makes clear the government\u2019s claim over Taiwan. Shortly before her departure on Wednesday, Tsai told media external pressure would not stop Taiwan from engaging with the world. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s determination to go to the world will only become stronger and stronger,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are calm, confident, unyielding, and non-provocative.\u201d Speaking at Taoyuan airport where she was joined by the ambassadors of Guatemala and Belize, Tsai said Taiwan would defend the values of freedom and democracy. \u201cWhen the international community needs Taiwan, Taiwan will contribute. And if Taiwan encounters difficulties, partners will also support Taiwan.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu tweeted a photo from inside the plane before take-off. \u201cI\u2019m excited to accompany [Tsai] again in a trip to visit our allies Guatemala &amp; Belize. Heard that it\u2019s very warm there, weather or otherwise.\u201d Beijing intends to annex Taiwan under what it terms \u201creunification\u201d. Taiwan\u2019s democratically elected government and a large majority of its people reject the prospect of Chinese rule. The US does not recognise Taiwan as a country but is a strong supporter of its efforts to resist Beijing\u2019s increasing efforts at military intimidation and diplomatic coercion. The US government had said Tsai\u2019s stopover \u2013 her sixth through the US since becoming president in 2016 \u2013 was \u201cnormal\u201d and warned Beijing not to use it as a pretext for aggressive behaviour. In August last year, in response to a visit to Taipei by then US speaker Nancy Pelosi, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army surrounded Taiwan\u2019s main island with days of live-fire drills, disrupting sea and air traffic. Pelosi\u2019s successor, Republican Kevin McCarthy, had said he would like to visit Taiwan, but a meeting with Tsai in California has been interpreted by observers as an attempt to avoid a repeat of the Pelosi visit. A US official said that a McCarthy meeting with Tsai would not signal any escalation from the US side. \u201cMembers of Congress have met with the Taiwan president on nearly every transit\u201d by Taiwanese leaders in the past, the official said."

            "title": "Biden\u2019s approval of Willow project shows inconsistency of US\u2019s first \u2018climate president\u2019",
            "date": "2023-03-14T09:00:42Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden continues to confound on the climate crisis. Hailed as America\u2019s first \u201cclimate president\u201d, Biden signed sweeping, landmark legislation to tackle global heating last year and has warned that rising temperatures are an \u201cexistential threat to humanity\u201d. And yet, on Monday, his administration decided to approve one of the largest oil drilling projects staged in the US in decades. The green light given to the Willow development on the remote tundra of Alaska\u2019s northern Arctic coast, swatting aside the protests of millions of online petitioners, progressives in Congress and even Al Gore, will have global reverberations. There are more than 600m barrels of oil available to be dislodged by ConocoPhillips over the next 30 years, effectively adding the emissions of the entire country of Belgium, via just one project, to further heat the atmosphere. The scale of Willow is vast, with more than 200 oilwells, several new pipelines, a central processing plant, an airport and a gravel mine set to enable the extraction of oil long beyond the time scientists say that wealthy countries should have kicked the habit, in order to avoid disastrous global heating. Biden\u2019s approval of this is \u201ca colossal and reprehensible stain on his environmental legacy\u201d, according to Raena Garcia, fossil fuels campaigner at Friends of the Earth. Even a group of Biden\u2019s Democratic allies, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, attacked the decision as ignoring \u201cthe voices of the people of Nuiqsut, our frontline communities, and the irrefutable science that says we must stop building projects like this to slow the ever more devastating impacts of climate change\u201d. But the approval of the project is consistent with an administration that has approved nearly 100 more oil and gas drilling leases than Donald Trump had at the same point in his presidency, federal data shows. Biden may have promised \u201cno more drilling on federal lands, period\u201d during his presidential campaign, but the reality has been very different \u2013 not only have the hydrocarbons continued to flow, they are in a sort of boom, with both oil and gas production forecast to hit record levels year. The White House can point out it is in the middle of a set of confusing, and often contradictory, set of circumstances. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine roiled global energy markets and triggered a push to build new export terminals to ship US oil and gas to European allies, even as Biden toiled to pass $370bn in clean energy spending in the Inflation Reduction Act. Younger, progressive voters have urged the administration to do more on climate \u2013 the youth-led Sunrise movement said the Willow decision \u201cabandons millions of young people\u201d ahead of the 2024 election \u2013 even as Republicans have continued to hammer Biden for waging a supposed \u201cwar\u201d on domestic energy and blamed him for rising gasoline prices. A series of court challenges, and a closely divided Congress, have also forced Biden\u2019s hand. All members of Alaska\u2019s congressional delegation, including newly elected Democrat Mary Peltola, called for Willow to be approved, citing thousands of new jobs. \u201cWe all recognize the need for cleaner energy, but there is a major gap between our capability to generate it and our daily needs,\u201d Peltola wrote in an op-ed on Friday with Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, the Republican senators from Alaska. Biden himself appears to share this view \u2013 in his recent State of the Union speech, the president said \u201cwe\u2019re going to need oil for at least another decade\u201d, before adding \u201cand beyond that\u201d, after boos from some lawmakers. This sort of \u201crhetorical dualism [is] a call for \u2018one last fossil bender before America goes green and sober\u2019\u201d, according to a note by analysts at ClearView Energy Partners on Sunday. Administration officials have stressed that the allowable Willow project is smaller than ConocoPhillips hoped, with three drilling sites allowed instead of the five proposed, and have signaled that the company would have probably prevailed in a court challenge if the project was rejected, given it has held leases in the region for more than 20 years. The Department of the Interior has also unveiled proposed rules it has framed as a \u201cfirewall\u201d against further drilling, with all of the US\u2019s Arctic Ocean off-limits to future oil and gas exploration, as well as the blocking of leases on more than half of the 23m acre National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, a vast area of the North Slope that contains wildlife considered imperative for the subsistence of local native communities. This conservation action, appropriately announced in a whiplash-inducing way the day before the Willow decision was made public, shows that Biden \u201ccontinues to deliver on the most aggressive climate agenda in American history\u201d, the interior department claimed. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear \u2013 this project, which the interior department has substantially reduced in size under considerable legal constraints, won\u2019t stop us from achieving the ambitious clean energy goals president Biden has set,\u201d an administration official said on Monday. But critics point out that the brutal reality of Earth\u2019s climate system doesn\u2019t recognize political expediency or future good intentions. The International Energy Agency, among others, has warned that no new oil and gas fields can be developed if the world is to avoid breaching temperature thresholds that scientists say will tip the planet into increasingly dangerous heatwaves, flooding, wildfires and other impacts. For all of the new wind and solar projects spurred by last year\u2019s climate bill, and Biden\u2019s enthusiastic promotion of electric vehicles, Willow is a sobering reality check \u2013 the project will wipe out the emissions cuts provided by renewable projects on public lands and waters, adding the equivalent of 2m new gas-guzzling cars to the roads. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to prop up the fossil fuel industry with new, multi-year projects that are a recipe for climate chaos,\u201d as Gore told the Guardian on Friday. \u201cInstead, we must end the expansion of oil, gas and coal and embrace the abundant climate solutions at our fingertips.\u201d"

            "title": "Turkish president lifts veto on Finland\u2019s Nato application",
            "date": "2023-03-17T16:18:34Z",
            "content": "Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has lifted his veto on Finland\u2019s application to join Nato, a move that will strengthen the west\u2019s ability to withstand any future Russian threat across the Baltic Sea but leaves Sweden\u2019s parallel bid for Nato membership unresolved. After a choreographed meeting with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, in Ankara, Erdo\u011fan said he would recommend to the Turkish parliament that it vote to back Finland\u2019s application to join. He said he hoped the vote would happen before the Turkish elections in May. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Finland, which shares an 832-mile (1.340km) border with Russia, was forced to reconsider the foundations of its foreign and security policy and apply for Nato membership. It would be the 31st member of the alliance. At a joint press conference, Erdo\u011fan said Turkey\u2019s concerns about Kurdish terrorist activity in Finland had been addressed. \u201cTurkey is one of the strong defenders of Nato\u2019s open-door policy,\u201d he said. Finland had taken \u201cconcrete and authentic steps\u201d to meet Turkey\u2019s security concerns, and \u201cwith Finland\u2019s membership Nato will become stronger\u201d. Niinist\u00f6 said to Erdo\u011fan: \u201cNow we have got an answer, thank you,\u201d but he added: \u201cFinnish Nato membership is not complete without Sweden.\u201d He expressed the hope that both countries would be permitted to join Nato at its summit in Vilnius in July. Erdo\u011fan has been demanding that Finland and Sweden do more to clamp down on Kurdish activists, but his objections about Sweden\u2019s behaviour are more deep seated. On Thursday, Niinist\u00f6 visited Turkey\u2019s Kahramanmara\u015f province, which was at the centre of the 6 February earthquake that killed more than 48,000 people, and he said he was shocked by what he had seen. Hungary is now the only other Nato member still to approve Finland\u2019s membership, and it is expected to relent next week rather than be left isolated within the alliance. Sweden and Finland, for diplomatic and security reasons, had originally treated their application last May as a simultaneous request since joint membership had a compelling reinforcing military logic. But after talks with Sweden, Finland decided reluctantly to press ahead with a membership bid of its own. The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said on Wednesday: \u201cI don\u2019t hide the fact that we would have preferred ratification together and hand in hand. But we respect that each country makes its own ratification decision.\u201d The decision complicates Nato defence planning, but the complexity depends on how long Turkey keeps Sweden in the Nato waiting room. Jans Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said he could not consider the circumstances in which Nato would not come to Sweden\u2019s defence if attacked by Russia. Erdo\u011fan has been seeking assurances from Finland and Sweden to eradicate members of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), an organisation designated as terrorist by the European Union. He said there should be \u201cno place for any terror group no matter what their name or aim\u201d. Last June, Finland and Sweden signed a 10-point memorandum with Turkey to address Ankara\u2019s security concerns, but its contents were open to interpretation as to what it required the Nordic countries to do to clamp down on Kurdish activists. In December, Finland loosened its strict embargo on arms exports to Turkey imposed in 2019 after Turkey\u2019s attack on northern Syria. Erdo\u011fan, politically weakened at home before elections in May, may hope that by accepting Finland\u2019s application he can show he can cooperate with the west and dispel suggestions that his nationalism has damaged the country economically. Finland\u2019s parliament has already approved joining Nato, but the bill would need to be signed into law by the president within three months, setting a deadline on how long it needs to wait. Hungary\u2019s president, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has repeatedly delayed approving Sweden and Finland\u2019s membership, accusing both countries of spreading lies about the state of democracy and the independence of the judiciary in his country. Hungary is looking for EU funds to be unlocked, but Orb\u00e1n may not relish being the last country blocking Nato\u2019s expansion and his officials have indicated that parliament will discuss the issue on Monday. Orban met Erdo\u011fan on Thursday. US officials believe Turkey has been trying to use its Nato veto power as a bargaining chip to extract extraneous concessions, including that the US Senate lift its objections to the sale of F-16 jets. US senators, sensing that Erdo\u011fan may be heading for defeat in the elections and eager to see a new, more cooperative president in his place, are not willing to grant Erdo\u011fan any pre-election favours."
